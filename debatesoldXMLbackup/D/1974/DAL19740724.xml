    <P>Debate resumed on amendment No. 6.</P>
    <P>In page 7, line 55, to delete &ldquo;3rd day of April, 1974&rdquo; and to substitute &ldquo;2nd day of July, 1974&rdquo;.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>I hope the Minister has had a good night's sleep and that in the course of it he has taken another look at this amendment which we have gone into in some detail.  We have established first of all that there are many people affected by the amendment and not merely a possible handful of people taking out large insurance policies.  Secondly, we have established that the date in the Bill is related to the date of the budget but that in the budget speech not only did the Minister not make any reference to what is in this section but that he specifically stated the allowances in respect of insurance would be available in full.  Therefore, <Col N="1816" /> it appears that a mistake was made or that there was an omission from the Minister's budget speech.  No reference was made to this section although it is drafted as if a reference was so made.</P>
      <P>That being so, we think it is selfevident, standing on the principle this House has always stood on and which the Minister affirmed last night, that there should be no legislation enacted, particularly in a Finance Bill, which would have retrospective effect.  Therefore the date in this section should be altered, as is proposed in the amendment, from 3rd April to 2nd July, the date of publication of the Bill.  As I have said, I hope the Minister has reconsidered the position and now finds himself able to accept the amendment.</P>

      <P>No, I am not, for the reasons which I stated last night.  To accept the amendment would facilitate large scale avoidance, large scale abuse of tax exemption which is provided to assist people in the normal income groups.  For instance, if I were to accept the amendment we could have the situation, which is not improbable, that insurance policies could be back-dated to prior to 2nd July in order that people would be able to avail at the expiry date of the policy of very considerable subventions.</P>

      <P>It is not ridiculous. If Deputy Haughey had the same experience as the legal Members of this House he would know what are the time limits in relation to contracts.  It would not be that easy to go back.  I said last night that I was prepared to make a present to Deputy Haughey of the three days between April 3rd and <Col N="1817" /> 6th.  I will go further now and say that I am prepared to take the 6th April as the commencement date.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not.  I am trying to meet the Opposition in a reasonable way.  It is a well established legal principle that when a tax position applies from the commencement of the fiscal year, no element of retrospection arises.  In case the beautiful theorists would be suggesting that there is retrospection in three days, I will give them a present of the retrospection they desire&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>No, I am changing the commencement date to the commencement of this year, the date on which the new tax provisions become operative&mdash;6th April, not 2nd July. That is the date from which the new regime of taxes applies.  To postpone this as the Opposition propose would open an avenue to tax avoidance which would be contrary to everything which the Government intend to do.  We intend to close these gaps, not to widen them.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>We heard last night, unfortunately we have heard it again this morning&mdash;one would have hoped the night's sleep would have cleared the Minister's head&mdash;this nonsense he has been talking about speculators and tax avoiders availing of life assurance. It is arrant nonsense?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. B. Desmond Mr. B. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>Do you hear that?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>Life assurance is a method of saving.  It is a valuable method of saving.  It is of great benefit not just to the families of the individuals but for the whole economy of the country.  Life assurance companies carrying on business here have very heavy investments here.  Most life assurance policies are paid when the proposer or the life assured dies.  Not all of them, but most of them, are paid then.  Most of them which are not paid on death are paid after ten, 15, 25 or <Col N="1818" /> 30 years from the time the policy was taken out.</P>
      <P>For the Minister for Finance seriously to come in here and describe people who take out life assurance as speculators, people trying to make improper or over-large profits, is the height of nonsense and shows the depths to which the Minister for Finance is reduced in trying this morning, in the cold light of day, to justify the nonsensical arguments he made last night.  If the Minister for Finance is prepared to acknowledge that what is in this section is wrong and that he is prepared to change the date by a matter of three days, he accepts the principle of what Deputy Colley, Deputy Haughey and all the rest of us on this side said last night.</P>
      <P>If he changes it by three days the principle is established.  He is trying to pull the wool over the eyes of Members by saying he is prepared to change the date from 3rd April to 6th April because that date is the beginning of the financial year.  That has no validity whatever.  It is the beginning of the financial year and, therefore, the date from which these reliefs or their abolition would operate but the principle that is involved is the date of the taking out of the policies and 6th April has no relevance whatever to that date.</P>
      <P>The abolition of the reliefs on certain policies would date, as everything else must do, from the beginning of this financial year, 6th April, but that date has no relevance to the date of the policies.  The Minister now apparently accepts that it is improper to limit them to 3rd April and the only date he can honourably and justifiably insert is 2nd July, the date of publication of the Bill.  It was only on 2nd July that the public became aware of the limitations that were to be imposed on these policies.  Of course, there is always the possibility of a leakage but we will have to disregard that for the purposes of this argument.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Anyone who took out a policy on or before 2nd July was invited and encouraged to do so by the statement in the budget speech by the Minister <Col N="1819" /> for Finance, and Deputy Haughey pointed this out last night.  The Deputy quoted it at length and it is not necessary to read it out again. The Minister's statement was not merely neutral about life assurance policies in the post-budgetary situation; it was an act of encouragement to people, particularly those paying tax at the higher levels, to take out more life assurance because the Minister specifically told them they would benefit at the higher rate.  Now he realises he made a mistake and that is fair enough.  If he honestly admitted to the House that he made a mistake in the budget speech and that he wished to rectify it, that he was making a change in section 9 and bringing in a new limitation, but was not seeking to impose it on anyone who had acted on his budget speech, we would agree with him and would have no objection to the principle of this section provided the date of 2nd July was inserted.</P>
    <P>The Minister is now trying to confuse the issue by talking about his willingness to change the date to 6th April. I wish to make it very clear to the House that that is only trying to cloud the issue and to confuse it for those who may not be clear in their minds as to the distinction between the date of the assurance policy and the operative date of the relief or the abolition of the relief.  Any change made with regard to income tax in this Bill, not just on this topic but on any topic relating to income tax, operates from 6th April, the beginning of the financial year 1974-75.  The date in question here is not when the financial year begins and the reliefs or their abolition begin to operate; what is in question is the date on which a policy of life assurance was taken out.  Anyone who, subsequent to the budget on 3rd April, was paying tax at above the minimum rate of 26p in the £ was actively encouraged by the Minister for Finance to take out an assurance policy.  The Minister is now welshing in a disgraceful fashion on the active encouragement he gave to citizens to act on his words.</P>
    <P>If he admitted he made a mistake <Col N="1820" /> and told us he would not penalise anyone who acted on his encouragement, we would help him to rectify his mistake. The Minister is doing a very dangerous thing.  Having made a mistake he is now trying to confuse the issue by talking about speculators making improper profits out of life assurance policies and that he will do all he can to screw such profiteers and speculators&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>If someone was encouraged by the budget speech on 3rd April to take out a policy of life assurance, he is now finding that the Minister has gone back on his words. What is even worse, he is trying to mislead this House and the public&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>He is trying to mislead the public into believing he is not doing it but people are being retrospectively taxed in a disgraceful fashion.  It would be bad enough if the statement of the Minister in the budget speech was neutral so far as life assurance and tax relief on it was concerned.  However, it was not neutral; it specifically said that the Minister could not avoid a situation that those who were paying tax at the higher rate would benefit in full while those paying at a lower rate, the new rate of 26 per cent, would lose out. He said he could do nothing about that.  It was an encouragement to those paying at more than 35p in the £ to take out more life assurance. They have been disgracefully treated. There may be only a few hundred people involved but if there is only one the principle is being breached by the Minister.  He encouraged citizens to do something as a result of budgetary policy and three months later he penalised them very severely in the Finance Bill for doing what he encouraged them to do.  All the Minister's ideological talk about speculators <Col N="1821" /> and the &ldquo;get rich quick merchants&rdquo; will not cloak the fact that he has acted in a disgraceful fashion.  Even if there was only one person involved, we have a duty to fight that to the last.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>I can assure Deputies Haughey and O'Malley that I feel positively discriminated against under this Finance Bill.  I wish I could afford to pay immediately the £1,000 premium in order to qualify for income tax relief.  On whose behalf are Fianna Fáil speaking?  Are they speaking on behalf of the overwhelming bulk of ordinary working people who would love to be able to pay the amount of assurance premiums mentioned here?  Deputies O'Malley and Haughey know there are people who have availed of loopholes; some are doctors, some lawyers, others are wealthy auctioneers, some are solicitors and some are wealthy accountants.  They have availed of it religiously and assiduously and have made their fortune by doing this kind of thing.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. B. Desmond Mr. B. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>They were very hopeful that the bold Fianna Fáil Party would come back into office and that this loophole would be allowed to continue.  I commend the Minister for Finance for closing it.  There are many egalitarian principles in the actions of Deputy Ryan since he <Col N="1822" /> became Minister for Finance in making sure that the new industrial rich of this country do not have it all their own way in the matter of tax avoidance. I have no objection to people accumulating wealth.  If they wish to do so, that is their privilege.  But they will not accumulate it at the expense of the vast body of taxpayers.  I commend the Minister for his insistence on closing this loophole.  I have never seen such special pleading as I have seen here from Deputy O'Malley on behalf of what can only be classed as the super sur-tax payers of the nation.</P>

For a party of the people, for a republican party, a broadly-based party, I have never seen such narrow selectivity as I have seen here in relation to taxation.  My heart bleeds for Fianna Fáil this morning.</P>

I am disappointed to find that the Minister himself has not done any thinking on this question and on the principle involved. He has talked again about largescale speculation.  I suppose it is possible that between 3rd April and 2nd July there may have been a number of policies taken out of which nobody on this side of the House has any knowledge&mdash;the Minister may possibly have although how he would have I do not know.

      <P>Over the past couple of years the Minister for Industry and Commerce has had expert personnel working on the Continent, in the US and in Canada trying to encourage industrialists to come over here to establish industry.

      <P>Why give your competitors a lever, a stick with which to beat you?  They will say: &ldquo;Why go over there?  They are liable to change their tax laws any day.  They are doing it all the time.&rdquo;  Will that help the Minister for Industry and Commerce and the Industrial Development Authority to establish industries? Will it help if you create the atmosphere in the US, in Britain and in Germany in which it can be put forward that any Minister for Finance may go back to last year and the previous year, change his mind after he has made his budget speech?  That is the principle involved.  This is not a big enough or a strong enough country to take risks of that kind with our policy of financial integrity.  I would ask the Minister to reconsider the situation.  Leaving aside the moral principle, in which I believe anyway, since we are not the United States, Russia or West Germany we cannot afford to give our competitors sticks with which to beat us by introducing retrospective legislation. I do not believe there is large scale speculation.  Surely there could not have been very much large scale <Col N="1824" /> speculation in April, May and June in the taking out of insurance policies?</P>

That is written in the budget statement. I have repeated it <i>ad nauseam</i>.  If people chose to ignore that and take a risk, they have no cause for complaint if we stop their little game.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Let us look at the legal position, which is well established. I would refer to the judgment in 1943 of Lord Greene in the case of Eastwood <i>versus</i> the Inland Revenue Commissioners.  It says:</P>
      <P>It is notorious and indeed invariably happens that the Finance Act for a particular year does not pass into law until the then current financial year has, to some extent, elapsed.  Nevertheless, the time unit within which the Finance Act invariably deals for the purposes of assessment is the financial year and it deals normally with the taxable income in respect of the then current financial year.  That, of course, does not mean that it is retrospective. It is merely a unit of time in respect of which taxation is imposed.</P>
      <P>That is what we are proposing to do and I have been more than fair in debating this at length, in explaining the position.  If the Opposition wish to continue to obstruct it, that is their right.  I cannot add anything to what I have already said and I do not propose to.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FlorenceCrowley" hpid="Mr. Crowley Mr. Crowley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Crowley</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister is most unfair to the Opposition when he says we are attempting to obstruct the passage of the Finance Bill. Nothing could be further from the truth.  We want to ensure that statements made by the Minister at budget time, or indeed made by any Minister at any time, have some meaning and carry the weight they should carry.  We are not merely talking about a clause in relation to life insurance but about a fundamental principle in relation to statements by Government Ministers or by the Government.

      <P>Nevertheless, that created a tremendous lack of confidence in the Government because they welshed on the contracts entered into by a former Government.  The Minister for Finance comes along in his budget speech and positively encourages people to avail of life insurance and the taxation clauses available to them in full and afterwards he comes to this House and talks about a further statement he made about tax avoidance.  We all agree that those who evade paying tax should be brought to heel and asked to pay their full share but if the Minister comes into this House and, because of an oversight, a mistake or lack of ability, makes a gross error then I do not think the people who availed of the opening in these clauses should now be asked to pay the penalty for their act.</P>
      <P>There is a question here of credibility that has ramifications far greater than just the number of people who may have availed of the Minister's statement in the budget.  Any statements that come from the Minister for Finance and his colleagues in the future will be viewed with the greatest suspicion.  We are afraid on this side of the House that credibility and confidence in the Government will be lost as a result of their activities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not hold any brief for the wealthy people the Minister quotes or for the speculators referred to by Deputy Desmond.  We on this side of the House do not hold any brief whatsoever for them.  This is a deliberate tactic by the Government to distort this very clear issue.  The Minister either means what he says or he does not mean what he says.  If he comes into this House and makes statements in the future are we expected to wait for further statements to clarify his first statements?  The Minister is asking this House to <Col N="1827" /> swallow too much if he expects us to sit down meekly and accept that a statement on budget day does not mean what he said at the time it meant.</P>
    <P>This is fundamentally what we are arguing about.  Despite the attempt by the Government to distract attention from that point we will still pursue it.  I know Deputy Desmond and his Labour Party colleagues will be back using their old clichés about the rich, Fianna Fáil being backed by the rich and that we are only concerned about the rich.  That is exactly what we expect from them.  I would remind the Deputy that when his Government and his party attempt to get rid of the rich and the so-called speculators it is not they who will suffer.  They are already well looked after.  It is the poor people at the end of the scale who will suffer, those who will be denied employment in industries that would have come here if there was a certain credibility in the Government. They are the people we must be concerned about.  I am surprised at Deputy Esmonde, who is a lawyer, and who is smiling very smugly in the back benches.</P>

      <P>It is a pity we are wasting so much time on this matter but nevertheless it is a very important one.  There is a great deal in this Bill that we on this side of the House are anxious to get on with and have discussed. No matter what way the debate develops I am afraid we will not have the necessary time at our disposal to discuss the very important provisions in this Bill in regard to the taxation of farmers, the interest allowance restrictions and the anti-avoidance measures which the Minister is introducing.  These are fundamentally important matters and I cannot see how we can discuss them as they should be discussed.</P>
      <P>I want to reiterate my appeal to the Minister that he leave this Bill over until after the recess when we can discuss it in detail and give it the attention it deserves.  It is particularly unfortunate, for that reason that we are wasting so much time on this one provision.  I feel this side of the House have got to do this because it is a fundamentally important matter.  It is completely misleading to introduce into the discussion on this matter talk about the rich, about avoidance, about evasion and about making quick kills. This is all irrelevant to this discussion. We are discussing the importance and the significance of the Minister's budget speech.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The budget speech of the Minister as I said last night, is the most important single pronouncement on economic and fiscal matters made during the entire year.  It is awaited eagerly <Col N="1829" /> by all sections of the community. Important decisions are taken by different institutions, different organisations and different individuals on the basis of what is announced in the budget speech.  It is fundamental to our whole fiscal structure that the budget speech be a solemn pronouncement beyond contradiction and that is what we are concerned with here.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">

      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>I am just going to deal with what the Minister said about anti-avoidance measures.  I am afraid the Minister has forced himself into a dialectic corner on this matter, and unfortunately because of the way the debate has developed he is forcing himself to use irrelevant arguments to try to defend this indefensible position. The words of the budget speech are categoric.  They are not open to any other interpretation except the one we are putting on them.  The Minister in his budget speech was right.  His approach and his philosophy were right.  When he was making that budget speech he was in favour of life insurance.  He was recognising the value of life insurance.  Life insurance is an important thing in our modern community.  It is something that prudent people take out in the interests of themselves and their families.  Do not let the Deputies on the Government side, for the sake of this one single argument, try to castigate the whole system of life insurance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnGrattanEsmonde" hpid="Mr. Esmonde Mr. Esmonde">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Esmonde</NameTxt>
      <P>Agreed.  We are not saying&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Esmonde interjected and asked &ldquo;What about the single premium?&rdquo;  The single premium was dealt with in the Finance Act of 1973.  The Minister for Finance brought in provisions in 1973, which still apply and which will apply to this situation, dealing with any attempt by people to use the insurance premium provisions for tax avoidance purposes.  It has no bearing on this situation.  The Minister's approach in his budget speech was right.  He was <Col N="1830" /> carrying on the provisions of successive Ministers down through the years in encouraging life insurance by making appropriate income tax provisions in regard to it.  On budget day he said: &ldquo;While I am unifying income tax and sur-tax I shall make a provision whereby life assurance premiums will get a further benefit now by virtue of this unification.  The premiums will be allowed in full no matter what the rate of tax applicable to the taxpayer.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>Subsequently somebody got at the Minister&mdash;I suspect in his Department or in the Revenue&mdash;and said: &ldquo;This will be too costly and we must restrict it.&rdquo;  The Minister then, perhaps rightly, perhaps wrongly, took a decision to bring in this restriction.  We are not quarrelling with his decision to restrict the concession he announced on budget day.  All we are saying to him is: &ldquo;If we are going to restrict the concession which was announced on budget day we can only restrict it from the date on which the Finance Bill was published.  Otherwise you are taking away from the importance and the solemnity of the speech the Minister for Finance makes in this House on budget day.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>The Minister in a desperate search for arguments to bolster up his untenable position&mdash;because it is an untenable position&mdash;is resorting back to his budget speech and saying: &ldquo;I announced in the budget speech I was going to close every loophole and eliminate all attempts by taxpayers at tax avoidance.&rdquo;  Even that does not stand up.  If the Minister looks at his budget speech again he will see that he cannot rely on what it said about tax avoidance to defeat our arguments in this regard.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister dealt at some length in his budget speech with tax avoidance, but he enumerated in his budget speech the exact measures he intended to take to deal with tax avoidance. Not alone did he spell them out one by one and indicate what he was going to do in each area, but he quantified them.  He gave in his budget speech an estimate of the amount that he hoped these itemised anti-avoidance measures would bring in.  In the <Col N="1831" /> precise litany he gave of the measures he intends to take there is no reference to life assurance.  Therefore he cannot rely now on an argument to the effect that in his budget speech he said he was going to introduce a whole lot of anti-avoidance measures and anybody about to take out a life assurance premium should have had regard to that warning and should not have taken out a particular sort of life assurance policy.  I do not think that is a legitimate argument, but particularly when you examine what he said in his budget speech it does not stand up at all.</P>
    <P>It is getting late in the day.  We have a great deal to do in this Finance Bill.  This is almost certainly not an important matter from the point of view of the Exchequer.  I doubt if there is any significant revenue involved in it, so the Minister cannot be taking up this attitude in defence of the Exchequer.  Therefore I urge the Minister, despite the untenable position into which he has unfortunately manoeuvred himself, to think again about this matter.  It is only a matter of changing the date from 3rd April to 2nd July.  However the important principle we are trying to uphold is the validity of the Minister's budget speech.  As there are no Exchequer implications of any significance involved and as there is this important aspect of his words given in the budget speech, let the Minister agree to what we are proposing and let us get on with the other vital matters in the Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnGrattanEsmonde" hpid="Mr. Esmonde Mr. Esmonde">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Esmonde</NameTxt>
      <P>There is something like three months involved in the difference in the date given in the section and the date in the proposed amendment.  The Minister explained quite clearly&mdash;certainly I fully understand what he said&mdash;the reason for picking the particular date in this case.  We all know that when an avoidance technique is being used and if the Government of the day seek to close off the loophole, they do not give a long-distance warning.  You cannot do that if you want to block a loophole, if you want to catch the <Col N="1832" /> rat that is going to escape out through the hole.</P>

      <P>The Deputy may have seen it, but that is the way I read it, and I think that most practising lawyers would read it that way. Generally, what they used do&mdash;I say &ldquo;used do&rdquo; and I think they still do&mdash;when the Minister made his budget speech the lawyers would get around to find out how many loopholes had been obviously blocked.  But if a Minister for Finance says that in principle he is going to move against avoidance schemes, then you do not make firm decisions until you see the Act but you take it on the basis that there will be a closing of loopholes. That will not necessarily be spelt out in detail in the Minister's scheme because possibly that would defeat the whole object.</P>
      <P>This is what is worrying me now when I hear so much heated argument and exercise in this House over a period of three months and the effect of the earlier date is definitely to block a possible move to avoid paying tax.  This is what worries me and what points to the fact that there must be something on or there must have been some scheme on to do this.  Why the exercise?  Why the excitement that has gone on all last night and this morning?</P>

      <P>I was going to add my few words to this discussion.  There is a joke among old-timers in Dublin about the two shawly ladies meeting each other, commenting on the inclemency and uncertainty of the weather and one saying, &ldquo;Isn't it terrible?  You would not know what to pawn.&rdquo;  That is a fair comment to be made by the people in respect of the Minister for Finance.  He is as changeable as the weather.  He cannot be credited with encouraging a citizen who might be disposed to thrift or prudence to have any sense of security or stability.  I realise it is hoped that there would not be any long contributions on this matter.</P>
      <P>I do not want to make a long contribution but I do want to confirm what I am saying and to refer to the Minister's consistency last year on the point, say, of the claw-back, where he accused every speaker on these benches of being interested in giving to the rich, of not being interested in giving to the poor and suggested that his recommendation in respect of the clawback was to take money from the rich and to give it to the poor and that he would continue to do so. That is less than a year ago.  Nevertheless, in his budget of this year the same Minister, who last year expressed such concern and displayed such consistency in the matter of what he would do in regard to children's allowance, this year gave £180 per month to the so-called rich in respect of children's allowance and gave 30p per month to the so-called poor people.</P>

I am trying to show that, as sure as I am standing here, there will be another departure from the stance he is adopting at the moment.  I would hope that in the interest of security and of inspiring confidence in the people in any Minister for Finance the Minister would resist the temptation which here exists for him to change from a statement in his budget speech and would not take refuge under the very flimsy cover that Deputy Esmonde was endeavouring to provide for him.</P>
      <P>Deputy Esmonde knows as well as I do that the Minister indicated in his Financial Statement, unambiguously, that what he is doing now would not happen.  Deputy Esmonde in his professional capacity is occasionally called upon to plead lost causes.  I think he realises that in this particular case he is trying to support a Minister in doing something which is indefensible. I appeal to the Minister now to change his mind, as he has done in the past on matters which had much less merit than that which is being discussed in the amendment.</P>

      <P>
        <i>(Dublin Central):</i> What we are discussing here this morning is not whether there is a revision of tax or not.  We are discussing the integrity of the Minister's budget statement.  The Minister's budget is the most important item that comes before the House.  Is the Minister aware of the number of persons who seek admission to the House on budget day?  The Minister should ask the Superintendent of the House, or any Deputy, the number who seek admission on that day.  I have personal knowledge that members of the NFA, members of the commercial life of the city, industrialists, leading members of financial institutions come here on budget day to listen to the Minister's statement.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On last budget day a leading executive of an insurance company in this city asked me for a pass so that he could hear the Minister's budget statement. I duly obliged.  After the Minister <Col N="1836" /> had made his statement I met this executive in the lobbies and I asked him what he thought of the budget speech.  This executive told me that as far as his business was concerned he was very satisfied.  I asked him what particular part of the budget favoured his company most and he replied that the most favourable part was where they could now qualify for the higher rates.  This executive asked for a copy of the Minister's speech before he left the House.</P>
    <P>I am convinced that that man was justified in telling his insurance agents the following morning that this was how the law stood and that they would be entitled to sell policies on the strength of what the Minister had stated in the House.  This is the type of situation I am concerned about.  Can we trust the Minister's budget speech? The executive I have spoken about, having genuinely asked his agents to sell policies along those lines, now finds two months later the Minister contradicting his budget statement. That is a serious situation and it undermines confidence.  This is what the Minister should concern himself about and not try to cloud the issue with his avoidance of large taxes.</P>
    <P>The Minister should accept this amendment because it is of vital importance to his credibility.  Anybody listening to a budget statement by any Minister for Finance should be left with the clear impression that the Government of the day will stand behind that statement.  The executive I was speaking about was entitled to tell his agents, having listened to the Minister, that they could on the following morning sell policies on foot of the Minister's statement.  This is the danger we have in this type of legislation.  I ask the Minister to consider his own position, to consider his own integrity that the people respect. The Minister is not going to do any harm to the Opposition but he will do a lot of damage to his own integrity and that is what he should try to protect.  There are people who, having read closely the Minister's budget statement, operated on it the following day.  The Minister should consider seriously the implications of what he is doing in this legislation.</P>

      <P>First, I should like to draw the attention of the House to the fact that we had a slow, carefully reasoned exposition of the precise situation that exists given about 20 minutes ago by Deputy Haughey. When the Deputy finished we waited for the Minister to make a reply, if any, to it.  I am the third Member to have spoken since Deputy Haughey and we all waited to see if the Minister would intervene, to see if the Minister would contradict one word of what Deputy Haughey said.  The Minister has neglected to do so, and anybody is justified in accepting that the situation as set out by Deputy Haughey, Deputy Colley and others is correct.</P>
      <P>The Minister is in a position which is indefensible.  His own arguments have made it even more indefensible. The Minister has now, wisely, ceased to try to defend.  We had his words in the budget speech quoted last night and, for the benefit of those who were not here then and so that we can be clear on what we are talking about, I should like to quote the relevant two sentences from Volume 271, column 1447, of the Official Report of 3rd April, 1974:</P>
      <P>Under the existing dual system of income tax and sur-tax, some reliefs, namely, life assurance relief, health expenses, wife's earned income relief and age allowance applied for income tax only.  As it would be anomalous to maintain this distinction under the unified system now proposed, these reliefs are being placed on the same footing as other reliefs and allowances and will be available in full to income tax payers whatever their marginal rate of tax.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>The full relief of the rate, if the Deputy understands English.  There are ceilings on all those allowances.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>&ldquo;...whatever their marginal rate of tax,&rdquo; is what the Minister said.  That means, in simple English, whatever their top rate of tax is.  The top or marginal rate is the relevant one.  I pointed out, as did three or four other Deputies on this <Col N="1838" /> side of the House in the subsequent budget debate, that that provision favoured the rich at the expense of the less well off.  I pointed out that instead of, as in the past, everybody getting relief at the standard rate of 35 per cent the very rich would now get relief at 80 per cent and those who were in the £1,550 taxable income bracket would only get it at 26 per cent.</P>
      <P>The Minister for Finance told us then that we were wrong and he pooh-poohed the case we were making. He said this was not so. However, the Minister came along on 2nd July and published the Finance Bill which accepts the case we were making but flies totally in the face of what he said at column 1447.  The Minister cannot deny what is down in the official record in black and white. Likewise, in case anyone thinks there could have been a misunderstanding about that and that this present Minister for Finance just made one error and decided to try to bluff his way out of it, I invite the attention of the House to column 1454 of the same volume and of the same speech.  The Minister for Finance said that every farmer or land owner who had a nonfarm income, and who was not liable under the provisions of the budget for income tax, would lose half of his allowance.  That was changed very rapidly.  It was changed in the Finance Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Again people were totally misled in regard to that.  I am not complaining that the Minister changed that because it was to the benefit of the taxpayer that it was changed and he did so when he realised he had made a grievous error.  I am complaining, as we all are, legitimately on behalf of the taxpayer who was led up the garden path by being foolish enough to take the word of Deputy Richie Ryan, the Minister for Finance for the time being.  I do not care tuppence for the credibility of a Government, or the lack of credibility of a Government, which consists of Fine Gael and Labour.  In fact, the less credibility they have the better as far as I am concerned.  But, as an Irishman <Col N="1839" /> and an Irish resident, I care greatly that the credibility of an Irish Government, whoever forms it, should be suffering so heavily in the world today as a result of precisely the kind of things that this present Minister for Finance is trying to get away with, trying to bluff his way out, trying to cod the people and bring in irrelevancies.</P>
    <P>The position is perfectly clear.  At column 1447, Volume 271, of the Official Report for 3rd April, 1974 the Minister for Finance in his budget speech gave active encouragement to people to take out more life assurance and told them that reliefs and allowances would be available in full to income tax payers whatever their marginal rate of tax.  He went out of his way specifically to tell those who would be paying at the higher rate in the new unified tax that they would get full relief.  Now he comes along in this Finance Bill and goes back on every word he said.  That is contemptible. I regret very much that we have to delay the House and hold up consideration of this Bill because of the contempt and arrogance of the Minister for Finance.  If he would grow up, admit his error and make the change that has to be made whether he likes it or not, we would get away from this to deal with more important matters.</P>
    <P>As Deputy Haughey said, the revenue involved in this is minimal, perhaps only a few hundred pounds, but, by God, the principle is involved that the Minister for Finance will not be allowed to lie to the people and get away with it.  That is what he is doing at column 1447 seen now in the context of the Finance Bill.  There are many more important things with which we should deal.  This is trivial from the revenue point of view but involves a great principle and we would be in dereliction of our duty if we were to let the Minister get away with it.</P>
    <P>Last year we were put in the position that the final 20 or 25 sections of the Finance Bill had to be allowed through in half an hour as there was no time left to debate them.  We shall <Col N="1840" /> be in the very same position this year as things are going and the Minister is responsible for that through holding up the House by trying to bluff or justify his way out of his own errors.  I have great respect for any man who says he made a mistake and asks the co-operation of the House to rectify it.  We would do that in five seconds but we will not allow him to lie his way out.  We shall find ourselves at 10.30 tonight being told again that the Bill must go through, that the Government are sorry that there is no time to discuss the final 30 sections. This is the most important annual Bill to come before the House and it should get months of discussion if necessary to be properly teased out. Instead it gets two days on Committee Stage and these are used up because of the activities and the mentality of the Minister.</P>
    <P>In view of the fact that tax free certificates are being issued I am not certain that this Bill must go through tonight.  I do not see why we should not continue to insist that the Minister for Finance change his mind about this and not get away with totally misleading people who were foolish enough to believe that a Minister for Finance would mean what he said and would not blatantly break his word.  We have debated this <i>ad nauseam</i>.  The Minister has declined to make any reply to what was said by Deputy Haughey, Deputy Fitzpatrick, Deputy Tunney or myself. It is quite clear that what we have said is right.  If the Minister wants it that way let this country know and let the world know that the office of Minister for Finance in the Irish Government is held by a man who has no regard for honour and has no word.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister, in trying to bluff his way out of this, has concentrated time after time on his allegation that what is involved and what we are trying to do on this side of the House is to benefit people whom he alleges are making &ldquo;a kill&rdquo; in regard to life assurance.  The absurdity of that in regard to life assurance has already been dealt with. We, on this side of the House, know <Col N="1841" /> of no case which could possibly answer to that description.  Last night I asked the Minister if he knew of any such case and we got no answer. But what he has endeavoured to do is conceal the fact that what is really involved is much more than any such mythical figure&mdash;I doubt if there is such a person: whether there is or not the Minister has endeavoured consistently to cloud the issue&mdash;that there are numerous people&mdash;there must be&mdash;who took out insurance policies following the budget statement, which has been dealt with in detail here and who, as a result of this section, if this amendment is not effected, will find that the tax relief they are getting will be different from what the Minister said it would be in his budget statement.</P>
      <P>They entered into these insurance contracts in good faith.  These contracts could be for premiums of £20, £30, or £50 per year.  There must be numerous people in that position and not only are they affected as regards the tax relief which they will get under this section and what they thought they would get on the basis of what the Minister said in his budget statement but, in addition, the differential existing between Irish and non-Irish companies is affected and considerably widened by this section. Therefore, the choice of a person taking out a policy would necessarily be affected by the position as he thought it was when he took out his insurance.  Here, the Minister changes the whole position and wants to change it retrospectively as of the date of the budget.  He said in his Second Reading speech in relation to this very section:</P>
      <P>One section which was not mentioned in my budget speech is section 9 which makes a change in regard to the amount of life assurance premiums which may qualify for tax relief.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>To me the position is perfectly clear: the Minister made no reference to this in his budget speech&mdash;as he confirms himself&mdash;but he has a section here which is framed as though he had referred to it in his budget speech. <Col N="1842" /> Surely it is not beyond the ability of the Minister to acknowledge that because no reference was made to it in his budget speech&mdash;although perhaps he would prefer to have made such a reference; I am not suggesting that he personally was responsible for its omission&mdash;the consequence is that he cannot ram through a section framed as though he had mentioned it in his budget speech.</P>
    <P>The first mention of it, as he confirmed, in his Second Reading speech came when the Bill was published. The amendment is designed to provide that anybody who took out an insurance policy&mdash;not somebody taking out, as the Minister alleges, a huge policy; I am talking of hundreds if not thousands of people who must have taken out ordinary small policies&mdash;based on what the Minister said is not adversely affected.  In that interval, why should the Minister retrospectively change the rules for people who acted on what he said in his budget statement?  Is there any possible justification for this?</P>
    <P>Surely nobody&mdash;and I include Deputy Esomnde in this&mdash;could possibly justify what the Minister is trying to do here.  Deputy Esmonde should not allow himself to be fooled by the Minister's smokescreen about large policy holders.  We do not know if there are any such: and apparently the Minister does not know, because when we asked him he did not tell us. But we do know there must be small policy holders who acted in good faith as a result of what the Minister said on budget day.  Is it too much to ask that these should be protected to the extent that the Minister's change in the law should apply from the date on which he published this Bill, which was the first intimation anyone outside the Minister's office had of it, and not from the date the Minister proposes? Is that an unreasonable request?  I submit it is not; the only reason it has not been granted long ago and the only reason why we have had to spend so much time on this is because the Minister apparently finds himself unable to acknowledge what the position is, to stand up and be man enough to acknowledge it, and let us <Col N="1843" /> get on with the important outstanding business of this House in regard to this Finance Bill.  All this very serious business is being held up because the Minister is being stubborn&mdash;another adjective springs to my mind&mdash;but, at the very least the Minister is being stubborn.  Surely it has been demonstrated beyond all doubt now that the right course, the course that was always followed in this House in the past and should be followed now, is to make the section operate from the date of publication of the Bill.</P>
    <P>As Deputy O'Malley said, there is probably little or no revenue involved, but there is a vitally important principle involved.  Why should the Minister hold up the important business of discussion of the Finance Bill to stick on a point like this when he knows, as well as we do, that he has not a leg to stand on.  It is sad&mdash;I am choosing less emotive words than I might otherwise&mdash;that so much time should be spent in trying to establish a principle the Minister said last night he accepted.  But we have to spend this time in this way because of the stubbornness of the Minister and because of his apparent inability to acknowledge the fact that a mistake was made and this was not referred to in his budget statement.  Why can he not do as any reasonable Minister would and acknowledge that it was not mentioned in his budget speech and, therefore, whatever the consequences, he must accept the fact that it should operate from the date on which notice was first given of this provision, namely, the date of publication of the Bill?  Is that an unreasonable request and, if it is not, would somebody on those benches, for God's sake, talk sense to the Minister and not be wasting our valuable time and the valuable time of the public in regard to the very important matters still to be discussed simply because the Minister will not come down off his high horse and have a bit of common sense?</P>

      <P>It is quite clear that the Minister is now acknowledging, by implication, that what we say is quite correct and this allegation about people taking out huge policies is totally untrue, and the Minister knows that, and it is up to him now to justify his stand.  He refused to do it last night and he has refused again today.  He stands condemned.  He deliberately tried to mislead this House. He is standing on something for which there is absolutely no basis.  He is coming in here and trying to ram through a section which takes away the rights of small policy holders, who acted in good faith as a result of what the Minister said on budget day.  That is what the Minister is trying to do. Let us all understand it.  We certainly, on this side of the House, will not co-operate in any way with the disgraceful performance of the present Minister.  It is in keeping with numbers of other things he has done in the past.</P>

      <P>I should like to say something on the principle involved. <Col N="1845" /> I have been a long time in this House and I can remember when the Minister's party on this side of the House castigated retrospective legislation.  I remember Members on both sides very concerned indeed at times&mdash;I am sorry to say in the past as well as now&mdash;at attempts to legislate retrospectively either because of an administrative mistake or because of ministerial incompetence in dealing with the particular matters in the first instance.  A very important principle is involved here.  I shall not go into the details of the section.</P>
      <P>What I am concerned about is the deterioration in a system in which the citizen will, apparently, have no idea what the law is and will be at constant risk of having the law, which affects him financially, socially and in every other way, changed by either a ministerial or an administrative whim. There will be no security.  In his days in Opposition the Minister was one of the most vocal Members of this House that I can remember on these subjects, a lawyer who made a great parade of legal principles.  He is sitting there now, the victim of his own incompetency and mistakes or else the puppet of administrators who tell him what to do.</P>

      <P>Here is something brought into the Finance Bill about which no prior notice was given in the budget.  Fair enough.  It is often that details are dealt with in a Finance Bill, particularly to stop loopholes. There is nobody on this side of the House who will complain about that. We are complaining about whether in the Finance Bill or in anything else, without some very good, justifiable reason, there should be retrospective action.  Here there is retrospective action.  The first we, the public or the House, know of this proposal is when the Bill is published.  All Deputy Colley wants is that the date will be amended.  There is no dispute whatever as to putting this into action.  If it is a loophole by all means let us close it.</P>
      <P>The principle of going back in time is not justified.  No case has been made.  If it was a terribly serious thing, that could be argued.  If it is to be argued, full information should be given to the House.  The Minister is arrogantly refusing to give full information to the House when asked.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I said I was concerned with the <Col N="1847" /> principle of restrospective legislation here.  The net question that I am putting&mdash;and I would like to take the whole thing in the spirit of which we have been asked to take it&mdash;is this: even granted that the Minister has a point and that there are a few cases which do not affect the Revenue very much&mdash;it may mean possibly that one or two people got away with something&mdash;is that fact alone enough, even though no damage has been done to the State and no financial damage done, to override that very vital principal which has been adumbrated by Deputy Colley and his colleagues here today.</P>
    <P>Is this sufficient to override that principle?  Is this sufficient to add to the already disturbing precedents which exist?  Too many of them already exist.  All of us, on various sides of the House, including respected and competent lawyers on both sides of the House and one of the Minister's own leaders who steered the House on such questions are concerned about this. Is there enough involved to make another inroad?  If the Minister continues as he is going it means that a Minister may get up on budget day to make a budget statement.  Heretofore, that was taken as a lead to the economic community and to the ordinary citizens and a declaration of certainty for a year about the taxation position.  It was often taken as a lead to the whole economic position of the country for a year.  People waited anxiously for the budget.  When it was announced they acted upon it.  It was followed and implemented by the Finance Bill.  It was accepted that many administrative things were dealt with.  One knew up to the budget that the law was such-and-such and after the budget in the main the changes would be such-and-such and that, when it came to the Finance Bill, there might be some more changes in matters of detail.</P>
    <P>I hope we are not entering an era when we have a budget statement and then a budgetary revolution in the Finance Bill.  I hope we are not slipping along that road.  I hope we <Col N="1848" /> will not have one statement in the budget and another in the implementation of the Finance Bill.  This is the start on the slippery path.  Will we have this situation with the result that between budget day and the publication of the Finance Bill which may be delayed as it was in this case, there could be uncertainty?  People will be open to injustice.  Apart from the legal principle and the constitutional principle involved in this, there are practical and economic points.  I would appeal to the Minister to reconsider the position in spite of the heat between us.  If I said something which I should not have said I am sorry.  I said it; but I do not think I was unjustified in taxing the Minister with his attitude.  However, if my language was intemperate, I am sorry.  I still say that it is inconsistent with the Minister's former attitude and protestations. It is dangerous.</P>
    <P>I am afraid I cannot withdraw the suggestion&mdash;if it is not a charge&mdash; that either by mistake or through lack of foresight at the beginning this is being done by a Minister under pressure.  Having said that, I want to say that the principle which Deputy Colley is adumbrating here is all the more important because of what I see will happen in the future. Look at that Bill.  It is getting very complex.  The whole financial structure is very complex.  Everyone can sympathise with the difficulties of the Minister and his advisers in producing a Bill to implement the budget quickly.  Having regard to the necessary secrecy that must exist for the budget, this is an administrative problem with which we can all sympathise.</P>
    <P>The logical result is that we can expect to have substantial delays between the budget and the appearance of the Finance Bill.  If in those circumstances one is to expect surprise packages of this nature&mdash;and there will be surprise packages&mdash;and if they are going to be retrospective and if they are going to affect the period between the budget and the Bill, this is a serious matter and another step in sliding down that slippery road that many of us, including the Minister, have fought against in the past. <Col N="1849" /> It is the slippery road towards retrospective legislation.</P>
    <P>I am moved to say that.  I was not going to intervene in this debate at all, but when the Minister adopted the attitude he did towards Deputy Colley I had to speak.  If this comes to a vote the House should have the courtesy of full information.  There is another point which I will mention in absolute finality.  A practice which used to obtain in this House has been discontinued.  If there was confidential information of a certain detailed type or in regard to individual cases which the Minister hesitated to disclose in public it was not unknown for a Minister to convey confidentially to the Opposition the information he had and the good reasons he had for keeping it confidential.  Such a Minister would make an arrangement in order to help the House to function. If this House is now reduced to being a rubber stamp and to passing legislation of this nature it is time for us all to think of the principles that Deputy Ryan, the Minister for Finance, was so strong about himself in the past and to think also about <Col N="1850" /> the whole question of the operation of parliamentary democracy.</P>

      <P>It would appear that the Minister is persisting in his attitude despite all that has been said. To say the very least, this is regrettable. This section, if passed in its present form, will be a monument to the intransigence and the lack of care of the present Minister for Finance for a very vital and important principle. It will also be a monument to the willingness of the present Minister for Finance to do down small policy holders who acted in good faith on what he said on budget day.  If that is the kind of monument he wants he is welcome to it.</P>

    <P>Question declared carried.</P>
    <P>Amendment declared lost.</P>
    <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That section 9 stand part of the Bill.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister indicated last night that the section, as it stands is unsatisfactory and that he intends changing it in the next Finance Bill. My understanding of his intentions in regard to the change he proposes making is that he will retain the limit of £1,000; that he will retain the differential between Irish and non-Irish life offices up to and including the 35 per cent standard rate of income tax and that, above that rate, the differential would be abolished. However I understand that the non-Irish life offices were under the impression that, in addition to that, he would agree to introduce next year a special income tax allowance, the effect of which would be to provide retrospectively a refund of one-sixth of the excess of the tax rate over 35 per cent in the current year 1974-75.</P>
      <P>I should like to ask the Minister whether or not he intends to include that latter point in the next Finance Bill.  Furthermore, as the House is aware, I withdrew amendments No. 3, 4, 5 and 72 on the Minister's assurance that the course he was proposing to follow was the one most acceptable both to the non-Irish and Irish life offices.  I want to ask the Minister in that connection if he would say when and with whom consultations were held at which it was agreed on behalf of the Irish offices that the course he was recommending was the most acceptable.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I think the Deputy will appreciate that it would be invidious for me to mention particular persons or organisations here in the House.  But we had fairly extensive consultations with the interests involved. There are a number of matters which have yet to be decided as to what would be the best way of dealing with this problem which, as I emphasised, is a temporary one, because of the EEC obligations.  At this stage I would not wish to spell out all the refinements which may be necessary but I am satisfied that by and large our general approach to the matter is one that is acceptable.  There may be requests for further refinements of it but I would be prepared to consider these.  Therefore, because of the need to study any such requests and to consider the matter further it would be inappropriate to try to find an instant solution to this difficult problem.  It is difficult because of the concession which exists in favour of Irish policies. <Col N="1853" /> It is one of these typical anomalies which will arise as we proceed with the system of refining taxation, but this is no reason why we should not try to do better than we have done in the past.</P>
      <P>Our approach is one which will not give any increased material advantage to the Irish offices compared with the non-Irish offices, and that is what matters.  Should there be a temporary advantage of some size for, say, 12 months that would not mean that there would be any real material advantage, so there is no need to be alarmed by any temporary deviation from the absolute advantages which existed previously.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>Normally, I would not have put those queries to the Minister but I have been obliged to do so in this case because, as I have said, I withdrew the other amendments relating to this matter on the Minister's assurance that the course he was recommending was the one which was most acceptable both to the Irish and to the non-Irish offices.  However, since the Minister made that statement it appears to me, from inquiries I have made, that so far as the non-Irish companies are concerned they would go along with what the Minister recommended except in so far as they expected the additional matter I mentioned, that is, a special arrangement in next year's Finance Bill to give a retrospective additional allowance to their policy holders, to be part of the course the Minister was recommending.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>So far as I can understand what the Minister has said now, he has not committed himself to that course. Therefore, it would appear that the consent and agreement of the non-Irish offices is doubtful, to say the least.  I have made inquiries also in regard to the Irish offices, and the result of these inquiries suggests that these offices did not in any way agree to the course recommended by the Minister and in particular to the course recommended by him with the addition that the non-Irish offices expected.  Therefore, I am concerned about this and am obliged to ask the <Col N="1854" /> Minister questions which I would not ask normally, but he will appreciate that in these circumstances I am endeavouring to establish beyond any doubt that the Minister, when he informed us of the agreement of the Irish and non-Irish offices to the course he was recommending, was not, inadvertently or otherwise, misinforming the House.  I wish to establish that the Minister was correct when he said that the Irish offices have agreed to this course.  Perhaps the only way in which the Minister can do what I ask is by making inquiries from his officials, but I want to know precisely when this agreement was reached with the Irish offices and, what precisely was agreed with them.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I cannot give names in the House but I shall certainly be in touch with Deputy Colley for the purpose of letting him know when the consultations took place.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>Since I raised this question has the Minister inquired as to whether such consultations took place, as to when they took place and, if they took place, what was the result?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>There have been consultations.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>With the Irish offices as well as the non-Irish offices?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Certainly, there were consultations with some Irish offices but I am not sure as to how many.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>There are not very many.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>Therefore, the Minister will appreciate that if not all of them were consulted he misled the House last night by suggesting that the Irish offices had agreed to the course he was taking.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am satisfied that what I said last night represents what would be an acceptable compromise, by and large.  Of course, everybody in this world wants everything to be <Col N="1855" /> to his own advantage, but there must be compromise and I would not expect either side to be entirely happy with the compromise.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RaymondMacSharry" hpid="Mr. MacSharry Mr. MacSharry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacSharry</NameTxt>
      <P>So there was not agreement.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>So far as I know there is an acceptance of there having been a fair compromise.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister is correct in saying that no solution will result in every party being entirely happy, but the point is that I withdrew my amendments on the Minister's assurance that the course he was recommending was the one most acceptable both to the Irish and to the non-Irish offices.  That does not mean that both sides were satisfied fully with the recommendation made by the Minister but rather, that of all the courses open, it was the one that was most acceptable.</P>
      <P>From my inquiries it appears that the course recommended by the Minister is not the one most acceptable to all the parties involved.  I have a grievance here because if I had been aware of this last night I would not have withdrawn my amendments but would have argued very strongly for them in the belief that they would be a better solution than the one which the Minister is recommending.  I indicated that at the time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It appears that the Minister's statement was not correct.  There is no point in the Minister communicating with me later if, when he does so, it is to inform me that, for instance, the Irish offices did not agree to the course he recommends or if it emerges that only some of them were consulted. If that should be the case the Minister must appreciate that my amendments were withdrawn under a misapprehension created by him.  It is important that we should establish, in so far as possible, here and now what precisely happened, to what extent was there agreement with the course recommended by the Minister both on the part of the Irish and the non-Irish offices.  I have tried to indicate to the Minister that the result of my inquiries suggests that <Col N="1856" /> the non-Irish offices agreed to the Minister's recommendation but with a very important addition which so far the Minister has not indicated he is prepared to accept.  If he is not prepared to accept that addition it can be taken that the non-Irish offices did not agree to the course recommended by the Minister.</P>
    <P>So far as the Irish offices are concerned the Minister has told us that some of them were consulted.  How many were consulted?  Offhand I can think of three Irish life companies but how many were consulted?</P>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I understand that two were consulted, but I do not wish to give any particulars which might be at variance with the facts.  I am satisfied that the companies concerned, whether Irish or non-Irish, prefer to have the full availability of the different rates right across the board up to whatever ceiling there might be rather than Deputy Colley's suggestion that it be limited to 35 per cent.</P>
      <P>As far as I am aware, there is common ground between both sides of the industry as far as that aspect is concerned and that is why I said, and I have not any reason to believe that I was wrong, that what I will be doing in next year's Finance Bill will be more acceptable than what Deputy Colley was suggesting should be done this year.  There are other areas for further discussion.  We have to try to maintain a very delicate balance of advantage for Irish companies over the non-Irish ones without increasing this advantage in any significant way. I am sure we shall be able to reach a reasonable compromise and that the interests of both sides will be met. That is as far as I can usefully and sensibly go at this stage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not at the moment arguing the merits of one line of approach to this problem as against another.  I might have done that in my amendments last night, but what I am engaged in now is to try to establish whether the course recommended by the Minister and accepted by the House is, as he stated, the one most acceptable to <Col N="1857" /> both the Irish and the non-Irish offices.  I have indicated precisely where a divergence appears to arise between what the Minister recommended and what the non-Irish companies expected.  In regard to the Irish companies, of which only two have been in the business for many years&mdash;one very recently entered into it&mdash;the Minister was somewhat imprecise when I asked how many had been consulted.  I do not blame him personally for that because he was not personally involved in the consultations&mdash;any consultations that took place were between officials and these companies.  I am not sure whether they were with officials of the Department of Finance or of Industry and Commerce.  What I am anxious to learn is what precisely happened, with whom were consultations held&mdash;by that I do not mean the names of the people but between officials of which Department and representatives of how many Irish life companies.  Could the Minister give me that information?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I cannot because I do not honestly know myself and I am not in a position to ascertain immediately on whose behalf the various representatives who were interviewed were speaking, whether it was their own companies exclusively or whether they were representing the views of other companies.  I have said this matter will be dealt with in next year's Bill.  The consultations are not concluded.  The pattern of next year's legislation is not yet finalised but I would visualise that all interests would be contacted.  There simply has not been the time to process this matter in full.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>I appreciate that, but surely the Minister will appreciate that in the circumstances with which we are faced, in which there was not time, then was it not open to argument as to whether the course the Minister recommended or the course I suggested was the better one?  In fact the Minister did not argue that because he assured the House that the course he was recommending was the one most acceptable to both the <Col N="1858" /> Irish and non-Irish companies.  I have reason to doubt that statement and therefore I am questioning the Minister to try to establish what the facts are.  For instance, did the consultation take place with the officials of his Department or of Industry and Commerce?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>There were consultations with both parties.  There is a mixture of proposals.  Deputy Colley's proposal is open for consideration if in the light of further debate it is considered to be more acceptable.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not arguing the merits of one course as against another. The point I am getting at is that I withdrew my amendments on the Minister's assurance but it would now appear that the assurance was not correct.  In the circumstances I am entitled to explore this possibility in view of the indications given to me.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I have given the House my understanding of the position. I cannot take it any further than that, but I will make inquiries and contact the Deputy.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister concerned with the possibility that he might have been given information on which he based his assurance last night which was not correct?</P>

    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Of course one must always be concerned whether the information one gets is correct.  I have no reason to believe the information is not correct.  With respect to the Deputy, I think he is pushing this further than is warranted.  Next year's Finance Bill can rectify any anomalies which appear to require rectification. If it requires retrospection, I trust the Opposition will not attack me.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>Before we pass on to discuss the merits or, more appropriately, the demerits of this infamous section we should clear up this matter. We had a situation last night that Deputy Colley had four amendments, Nos. 3, 4, 5 and 72 which would have added considerable substance to the section.  At a very early stage in their discussion he withdrew them because he was told by the Minister for Finance that the arrangements made in the section had the agreement of the Irish and the non-Irish life offices.  On his own admission this morning, to say the least, the Minister was very vague as to whether any agreement was reached with anyone.</P>
      <P>As an outsider who was not involved in any discussions with any life offices, it seems to me the Minister may well have misled the House last night; in particular it seems highly likely what he told Deputy Colley was not correct, and even if it were partially correct he had no grounds for making the statement. Therefore, he had no grounds for making the statement which caused Deputy Colley to withdraw the four amendments before the House.</P>
      <P>I know this appears to be a matter of little concern to the Minister but is a matter of concern to this House and will have to be shown to be such. We have had the experience of hearing the Minister for Finance not only on the budget and the Finance Bill for this year but for last year also and we know he will glibly make any statement in this House, whether or not he has grounds for it, if he thinks it will ease the passage of legislation for him.  We should come back to what was said last night which caused Deputy Colley to withdraw four amendments.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have now clearly established two points.  First, that the non-Irish offices were agreeable to this course <Col N="1860" /> of action only provided they had a guarantee from the Minister for Finance, for what that is worth with the present Minister, that they should get retrospective benefit in next year's Finance Bill.  Secondly, we have established that the Minister for Finance is not aware what, if any, consultations took place with the three Irish life offices.  He was asked by Deputy Colley when these consultations took place; he does not know.  He was asked who took part in them on his side; he does not know.  He was asked with what company or companies they took place; he does not know.</P>
    <P>Having established all of this by the Minister's admission this morning, let us consider what he told Deputy Colley last night.  He gave an unequivocal assurance to the Deputy last night that all the offices, Irish and non-Irish, were agreeable to this and it was because of that the four amendments were not moved.  We may not have established all the precise truth of what exactly happened but we have established, even on the Minister's own admission, that all the offices concerned have not agreed to what the Minister suggests in the Bill.</P>
    <P>No matter how flippantly the Minister for Finance may take questions of truth or falsity, it is a very serious matter.  Even though it cannot now be proved exactly what took place, it can be proved out of the Minister's mouth that agreement was not reached on the lines he indicated last night and that, therefore, Deputy Colley was caused to withdraw his amendments under a misapprehension that was given to him by the Minister for Finance.  The Minister may pooh-pooh this as he did similar things last year but I want it clearly recorded that the regard for truth of the present occupant of the office of Minister for Finance is a slight one.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>I can only find myself in full agreement with what Deputy O'Malley has said.  To say the least, it is very unfortunate that the Minister gave an assurance, as he did last night, that induced me to withdraw the amendments when, on his own admission this morning, he was not in a position to give any such firm assurance. Even if the position were to turn out eventually to be as he stated last night, it is clear that the Minister did not then have available to him the information which would have enabled him to give this assurance. I might add he does not have it now either.</P>
      <P>It is unfortunate that the Minister, lightly and without regard for the facts of the situation and the care with which any Minister must weigh his words when he gives an assurance of this kind, gave this assurance without having the necessary information. It is unfortunate in that it caused me to withdraw amendments when, in the circumstances now arising where it appears there was not agreement by the offices, I would strongly have argued in favour of my amendments as against the course the Minister recommended in the special circumstances obtaining even for this year. The opportunity to argue the case has been lost because I accepted the Minister's assurance, an assurance that was given without any real basis or firm grounds on which it could be given without equivocation.  That is one unfortunate consequence.</P>
      <P>Another unfortunate consequence is one that has been adverted to by Deputy O'Malley and it is a serious one.  It seems to me that if you reach a stage where, when you get an assurance or an undertaking from a Minister for Finance you are in the position where you cannot accept it automatically, that you have to look behind it and check on it, that is a position that becomes intolerable.  If that situation is now arising, the Minister has only himself to blame.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Despite certain past experiences with the Minister, as I indicated last night, I was quite prepared to accept the assurance he gave at its face value. In view of what has happened, and <Col N="1862" /> what he has told us this morning, I must confess reluctantly that if I receive any further assurances from the Minister for Finance I will not be able to accept them at face value.  I will have to go behind them and inquire the basis for the assurances. That is an unfortunate situation, one that should never occur.  It is unfortunate in relation to the Minister for Finance personally and it is most unfortunate in relation to the office he holds.  I regret this situation has developed but there is nothing much I can do about it except to record my protest at the manner in which the Minister gave an assurance last night which he was not in a position to give and thereby induced me to withdraw my amendments.  I must record my regret at the consequence of that approach by the Minister.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>The arguments on the section as such rested on the amendment the Minister has succeeded in defeating in the last division. There are no new arguments on it but it is perhaps worth noting that here in one section of this Bill alone, section 9, one eighty-fifth of the Bill, less than that if one takes into account the Schedules, the Minister for Finance has succeeded in breaking his word twice. He has broken his word to this House last night which, if not given dishonestly was at the very least given negligently and not caring whether it was true or not, and secondly in the section itself he has broken his word which he solemnly and specifically gave in the budget speech of 3rd April last.  Twice in one section of one Bill the present occupant of the office of Minister for Finance has flagrantly flown in the face of the truth.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We in this House are now expected to legislate in a situation where the man facing us is prepared to wallow in untruth and deception.  We as an Opposition do not know where we stand.  The people of this country, who would expect that they could accept the word of a man who holds the office of Minister for Finance, do not know where they stand.  The problems are not just confined to the <Col N="1863" /> Members of this House or the people of this country, because perhaps in the long run the most serious damage of all to this nation will be done by the fact that there are industrialists and other investors abroad who would be prepared to put money into this country but who are increasingly beginning to fight shy of a country, the Government of which contains a Minister for Finance who will make statements negligently and carelessly, neither knowing nor caring whether they are true.  What can any foreigner think of a country which has as its Minister for Finance a man who makes a precise and solemn declaration in his budget statement on 3rd April, 1974, with regard to life assurance, who, without saying anything whatever in the meantime, comes along and publishes a Finance Bill on 2nd July, 1974, in which he goes back on everything that was said in relation to life assurance on 3rd April, and this without any attempt to excuse or to justify it?</P>
    <P>The House heard this morning the experience of a friend of Deputy Fitzpatrick who came into the Public Gallery at Deputy Fitzpatrick's invitation on budget day, heard the Minister for Finance say what he did say in relation to life assurance and in order to make assurance doubly sure that gentleman, who was involved in life assurance, asked Deputy Fitzpatrick if he would procure for him a copy of the Minister's speech so that he would have it in black and white and would be under no misapprehension.  Deputy Fitzpatrick got it for him.  The man read precisely what the Minister had said and on the strength of that went away and advised his own employees and agents as to what they could do in selling life assurance during this current year. I do not know how many policies were sold as a result of that, but presumably there must have been some at least.  The agents of that company, through no fault of their own, have gravely and grossly misled the people who purchased those policies from them and they have done that because those agents and that man himself were grossly and gravely <Col N="1864" /> misled by the Minister for Finance, who makes not the slightest apology for the contemptible effort at breaking his own word that is contained in this section.</P>
    <P>If the statements of the Minister for Finance in relation to life assurance reliefs in the budget had even been neutral, one could still legitimately complain but perhaps complain less vehemently than we do now about what the Minister proposes to do.  But the statements of the Minister for Finance in the budget speech were not neutral.  They were an active encouragement to people, particularly those paying tax at higher than the standard rate, to avail of as much life assurance as they could possibly get.  They were told at column 1447 of the Official Report that reliefs and allowances will be available in full to income tax payers whatever their marginal rate of tax.</P>
    <P>All this has been clearly spelt out this morning by six of us from this side of the House but the Minister for Finance has not made any effort to deny that what we are saying in relation to this is true.  Perhaps the only more serious reflection on somebody and somebody's honour than to have no honour is to be continuously told it here in Parliament and not even to bother to try to deny it.  At least in his favour it can be said that he does not try to compound his untruth by trying to deny the dishonour which he has brought upon himself and upon his Government but much more seriously upon this country as a whole.</P>
    <P>We are now being asked to enact into law a section which in itself is the living embodiment of a lie of the Minister for Finance.  We cannot stop that enactment because we have not, as matters stand, enough Deputies to stop it.  But perhaps there are at least a few people sitting on the benches opposite, who would have the honesty to walk the other way, and they have plenty of precedent for that now, when the division on this section is called.  If they do not they will enshrine into the permanent financial legislation not just one but two deliberate efforts by Deputy Richie Ryan, <Col N="1865" /> Minister for Finance, to mislead the public and to mislead this House.  The passage of this section and its enactment into law will give the approval of this House to those two deliberate <Col N="1866" /> attempts at misleading, neither of which has been denied.</P>

    <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That section 10 stand part of the Bill.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>This is the section that provides for the abolition of sur-tax with effect from 1974-75.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to ask the Minister is it the position that following the abolition of sur-tax, interest on an investment in a building society will now be free of tax in the investor's hands.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>It will be same position as before except that, of course, it will be the higher rate of tax and not sur-tax that will apply.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to be a little clearer on this.  As I understand the position, at present because of the special arrangement with building societies, societies pay tax in lump sum form to the Revenue Commissioners on a specially worked out basis and are thereby enabled to pay interest to their depositors free of tax, that is, free of income tax.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>Without deduction.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, without deduction, and in fact free as far as income tax is concerned because it has already been paid by the societies.  People who are subject to sur-tax were in due course assessed for sur-tax on that interest, but since sur-tax is being abolished under this section, I would like to know whether an investor in a building society will receive his interest from the building society and will thereafter have to pay no more tax on that interest.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>The interest of the building societies is deemed to be at the standard rate, and you would have to take into account the interest earned by a person in a building society in order to calculate what his appropriate rate would be.  If the appropriate rate would be in excess of the standard rate, then he would be liable for that rate.  We are not providing that this would be a new benefit so that people would get a higher concession in regard to income <Col N="1868" /> tax from the building societies.  You have to take their total income into account in order to assess what their appropriate rate of income tax would be.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>Then the consequence of this is that it will no longer be possible for the building societies to pay and to advertise that they are paying interest free of tax, meaning free of income tax?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>It will be free of the standard rate.  In other words, any person who has an income from a building society will continue to get the concession they got in the past. It was never free of sur-tax.  It was free of the income tax rate.  It will continue to be exempt from the payment of the standard rate of income tax, which is 35 per cent.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 7:</P>
      <P>In page 8, between lines 2 and 3, to insert a new section as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Where, in any of the provisions of this Chapter and of Part I of the First Schedule, a specific sum is mentioned as a deduction falling to be made from the total income of an individual for the year of assessment 1974-75 such sum shall, for each subsequent year of assessment, be deemed to be increased by such percentage sum as is equal to the percentage sum by which the Consumer Price Index has increased during the 12 months period ending on the date to which the Consumer Price Index is calculated next preceding the commencement of the year of assessment&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Whatever one might have to say <Col N="1869" /> about the technical wording of this amendment&mdash;indeed one could say quite a bit about it, I would imagine, and perhaps find flaws in it&mdash;the principle involved is quite clear.  If the Minister accepts the principle of it, I do not think we shall have any difficulty in establishing the correct technical wording of it.  The principle involved is that in relation to the various allowances set out in this chapter of the Bill and Part I of the First Schedule for various income tax allowances, they would be automatically altered and increased by the same percentage each year as the consumer price index had increased in the previous year.  I move to report progress.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnMKelly" hpid="Parliamentary Secretary to the Taoiseach (Mr. Kelly) John Kelly">
      <NameTxt>Parliamentary Secretary to the Taoiseach (Mr. Kelly)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move:</P>
      <P>That the amendments and additions to the Standing Orders of the Dáil relative to Public Business recommended in the Report of the Committee on Procedure and Privileges on Reform of Dáil Procedure (T.235) dated 31st January, 1974 be adopted with effect from the first day on which the Dáil sits subsequent to the adjournment for the Summer recess.</P>
      <P>I want to say a few words about the report which I am putting to the House and which I think has got the agreement of all sides.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The history is that an informal committee was set up in 1971, that its recommendations were shown approval by the Taoiseach in November, 1973, who said they would be processed by the Committee on Procedure and Privileges.  This committee subsequently met several times and went through these recommendations and the recommendations together with the necessary amendments of the Standing Orders are now before the House.  I should like briefly to say that the Government's thanks are due to the members of both of these committees, to the private individuals who <Col N="1870" /> made suggestions from outside and to the staff of the Ceann Comhairle who were extremely helpful with technical advice.  Some of the informal recommendations made by the first committee were adopted very shortly after the change of Government.  Two of them in particular I should mention&mdash; perhaps there are only two&mdash;namely, the system of rotating questions to all Ministers except the Taoiseach, and the resumption of the pre-1932 practice of the House sitting on Catholic holidays of obligation, though an hour later than the normal time.</P>
    <P>The report contains a very large number of matters of detail.  I shall not mention all of these to the House. They are all incorporated in the printed report.  I may just briefly call the attention of the House to a few of the amendments which were proposed which seem of particular interest and importance.</P>
    <P>First, I might mention the proposed new rule which will enlarge the discretion of the Ceann Comhairle to permit Adjournment Debates under Standing Order 29.  These are debates on matters hitherto described as of urgent public importance and you will remember, Sir, that the Ceann Comhairle's office over the years had developed a set of precedents in regard to the interpretation of this order which had the effect that it was very hard to get a subject urgently debated. The committee on all sides agreed that it did not seem to be in conformity with what the public expected of the Dáil and the intention in this new rule is that the Ceann Comhairle will have a wider discretion for admitting debates of this kind.</P>
    <P>Another point which deserves the House's special attention is the recommendation that Bills may henceforth be circulated even in advance of their introduction in the Dáil.  The introduction of a First Stage of a Bill is almost never opposed.  This would mean that Bills which emerged from Departments in the course of a recess can be printed and circulated and can therefore, permit public comment and study by Members of this House even in advance of their introduction here.</P>
    <P>Thirdly, I might call attention to an <Col N="1871" /> agreement incorporated in one of the recommendations and proposed new orders whereby speeches made in Estimate debates will be subject to some time limit.  The speech of the Minister or Parliamentary Secretary proposing the Estimate is not subject to this limitation but the other speeches, all but the closing ones, are and it is proposed that in Estimate debates no Member of the House on either side should be permitted to speak for more than one hour.</P>
    <P>A fourth point worthy of attention is it is now hoped that the rules hitherto affecting Private Members Business will be relaxed.  The rule up to this has meant in practice that Private Members' Business could only be taken during a very short time of the year, after the conclusion of all the financial business and before the next budget came around, which in practice meant a space of two or three months.  This would have required revision anyway in the light of the new financial year arrangements but it is proposed that this limit should now be removed from the arrangements for the taking of Private Members' Business and, while the Government may decline to give Private Members' Time in given weeks, may claim all the time for themselves, the intention is that there should be agreement between the Whips in regard to this happening.</P>
    <P>Fifthly, you will have noticed Sir, that there has been a certain amount of discomfort in the House occasionally in connection with the question of ministerial statements.  A practice has grown up whereby, with the House's consent, a Minister, most usually it has been the Taoiseach but it could be any Minister, makes a statement and a reply is made by his opposite number.  The disagreement of one Deputy would, of course, theoretically, on the basis of a system of agreement, prevent this being done at least without a vote. The committee thought it wrong that one Member should be allowed to prevent ministerial statements from being made and the appropriate replies being given to them from the <Col N="1872" /> other side and a new rule is designed to enable the Ceann Comhairle to exercise greater discretion in regard to ministerial statements and in regard to further statements from other parts of the House.</P>
    <P>Finally, the last of the points I wanted to mention briefly is the recommendation by the committee that more work should be confided to special committees of the House, in particular, technical Bills.  That is a suggestion with which I am myself in very strong agreement and I hope that Deputies opposite will not take it from me as being meant contentiously when I give the House an example of the kind of Bill which I thought and still think might be, and might even yet be, left to a special committee but where I was unable to get agreement from the other side for a reason which I must admit seems a sensible enough reason on the surface.  I should tell the House in case anyone thinks there is a breach of private conversation involved in my saying this, that I asked Deputy Lalor if he had any objection to my mentioning this and he said he had none in the world.  It seemed to me, watching the length of time it took to process in Second Stage the Planning Bill and in all Stages the Constituencies Bill, that the Committee Stage of the Planning Bill which is in part very highly technical might have been left to a Committee of the House.  I put this to the Chief Whip for Fianna Fáil and he consulted his colleagues and I got the answer that the Opposition were unwilling that this should be done and the reason was that, as is perfectly true, a large number of Deputies on all sides are interested in the Bill and would not wish to see it taken off the floor of the House.</P>
    <P>It is true, of course, that quite a large number of Deputies might be expected to contribute and did contribute in the Second Stage debate but I cannot see why a committee might not be made as large as is necessary to accommodate something of this kind.  I hope, Sir, you will allow me to put in this comment of my own, it is not strictly relevant; it is only suggested by one of the recommendations <Col N="1873" /> of the Committee on Procedure and Privileges and in a non-contentious spirit I would urge the Opposition to think again about this.  There really is no reason why the committee might not be able to be made as large as is necessary in the sense of every Member interested in the subject being made a member of it.  There is no reason why, as the report suggests, the Press and the public, to whatever extent the physical possibilities of the House permit, might not be admitted to the deliberations of such a committee. It would certainly save a lot of the time of this House.</P>
    <P>I understand there are 111 amendments down to the Planning Bill. Some parts of the Bill are very contentious and the amendments are, naturally, going to be contentious.  It is perfectly right that a Bill of that kind should get very close attention from the Opposition, and from the Government side as well, but if we have 111 amendments, plus all the sections of the Planning Bill debated in the Dáil very little other work will be done between October and Christmas. I am sorry I have to be alarmist about this but it seems to me that the committee system which has been talked about so much should be given a chance to work.  I appeal to the Opposition in a non-contentious way to think again about their decision not to agree to send the Planning Bill to a special committee so that the main body of the Dáil can get on with other work.</P>
    <P>In case anyone might be afraid that Members who would be interested in the Planning Bill would find their time clashing with what is going on in the Dáil I suggest that this work be done on Thursdays.  It is conventional here, or seems to be, that Thursdays are fairly quite days.  The afternoon is taken up with questions and more often than not the morning is devoted to debating Estimates or with something not likely to result in a vote.  It seems to me that during the hours when the House on Thursday mornings might be debating the Estimate for the Office of Public Works or for the Department of Lands or for any other Department a committee, <Col N="1874" /> consisting of all members interested in it, could be sitting somewhere else in the House getting through the small print of the Planning Bill and bringing it back to the House with the amendments suggested.</P>
    <P>That is one apprehension I have about the Planning Bill, but I should like now to deal with something which is being talked about a lot, and it is the possibility of a new Constitution. The mind boggles at the problems in the Dáil of 1974 of approving the draft&mdash;assuming it was done this way&mdash;of a new Constitution.  In my view it would take years and years to do it.  There may be one or two changes of Government before this thing would be finalised.  I cannot see the Dáil ever finding time to do such a job.  In 1937 things were quite different and the whole Constitution debate, together with a lot of other business, is contained in one single bound volume of the Official Report: in other words, about 15 or 16 days work.  No one can imagine that is possible in 1974.</P>
    <P>It is a very good thing that there should be more and indeed deeper interest now than there was then, but the possibility of the Dáil taking on a job of that kind, while having to run the ordinary legislative burden at the same time, is absolutely nil.  I urge all sides to give a chance to this committee procedure and that the Planning Bill which is hanging over us and is definitely going to absorb colossal quantities of the time of this House might be the subject of the first effort.  Of course, it would not be the first effort because other Bills have been sent to special committees before.  Not very many were sent to such committees, and my office counted half a dozen between 1957 and now.  That is nothing like enough.</P>
    <P>I should like to give my views about our way of running things from the Dáil and detail changes I would like to see brought about.  I have mentioned both of them inside and outside of the Committee on Procedure and Privileges.  I must confess that I did not get much support for them <Col N="1875" /> from any side.  This House sits on Tuesdays and Wednesdays for hours which, for the ordinary person, are very late.  In my view that is a bad system.  I realise that I could be accused of being Dublin-minded when I say this, because Dublin Deputies do not have the same problem that Deputies from the country have in regard to travel and overnight stay. However, I do not see why we could not arrange business in such a way as to give country Deputies a chance to arrive at the same time as they do at present on Tuesday afternoons by sitting during ordinary 9 to 5 hours on Tuesday, Wednesday and Thursday.</P>
    <P>We could develop a convention whereby non-controversial or nondivision material would be done on a Tuesday morning to give the country Deputies a chance to arrive.  Any of them interested in the non-controversial material could make it their business to be here for starting time no matter how far away they lived.  There is the objection that the Dáil sitting until 10.30 at night does not mean that all the Deputies are here listening to the debate.  Everybody knows that the opposite is the case and that most Deputies are upstairs writing letters to their constituents or on behalf of their constituents.  It might be suggested that country Deputies would be kicking their heels during the evenings.  That, I confess, is so, but there is nothing to prevent them staying behind on the premises and writing their letters.  I see that there would be a certain complaint based on that line of thinking.</P>
    <P>The House, basically, consists of people who, on average, are middle-aged, and some have better health than others.  Others are, by any standards, quite elderly.  I am thinking about the ordinary Members.  In my view it is inhuman that ordinary Members should be kept around in the atmosphere of this House, which Deputy O'Malley has said would kill a horse, until 10.30 or 11 at night. In most cases, apart from writing letters, there is little reason for the Deputies to remain around but they <Col N="1876" /> must do so in case a vote takes place. That goes with even more emphasis for office holders.  Ministers and Parliamentary Secretaries no matter what party they belong to or what Government is in office, have been selected by a very tough political process. They have put an enormous amount of effort into their lives in order to get where they are, and when they arrive there they are very heavily burdened with very important and responsible work.</P>
    <P>In my view an office holder, more than anybody else in any other department of life, needs his evenings off.  An office holder needs the hours in the evening when he can lead an ordinary evening existence like other men and women, when he can see his family or his friends, and when he can go to bed early, which is what he should be doing instead of chasing around to receptions which office holders are forced to do.  I have heard it said that were it not for the evening sittings Deputies would get no rest at all because their constituents would expect them to be out at branch meetings <i>et cetera</i>.  However, there comes the stage when a Deputy, and an office holder, has to say that he or she will not do it and that enough is enough.  There comes the stage when he will have to say that he has a duty to himself, his family, and his job, and he will not kill himself.</P>
    <P>In my view all that would be facilitated, and the public interest would benefit, if the House had something like 9 to 5 sittings on Tuesdays, Wednesdays and Thursdays instead of the present arrangements which I believe, like so many other things in the country, were inherited from the English.  Things are quite different and done under different conditions.</P>
    <P>The last point, and a very serious one, in relation to the late sittings on Tuesdays and Wednesdays is one which concerns the media.  Everybody knows, and I intend no criticism of the media because they have to meet a deadline, that there is a certain hour beyond which, barring an emergency or a matter of extreme national importance, we cannot expect reporters <Col N="1877" /> to process what is said here and have it sub-edited, set in type and distributed to Castletownbere the following morning.  That cannot be done, and every Deputy knows that if he has something important to say he would be better off not saying it late at night and leaving it to the following morning.  On one occasion I was guilty myself because I was absolutely determined&mdash;I am sorry to sound so pompous&mdash;that what I had to say on a particular topic would get some representation in the Press in the morning and I must confess I deliberately spoke longer than I needed to on Wednesday night in order to be in possession when Thursday morning came.  In making that confession I am, I am sure, confessing to something of which every Deputy has been guilty.  All this would be unnecessary if the Dáil concluded its sittings at such a time that the organs of public opinion&mdash;the Press, the radio and television&mdash;could have heard everything by the time six o'clock or seven o'clock in the evening came.  The necessity for wasting Dáil time would not exist.  The present situation very often deprives the House of contributions by speakers who cannot be here for one reason or another or are constrained to speak at a time when what they have to say will get absolutely minimum attention.</P>
    <P>There is another matter on which I got no sympathy from either side but which I continue to regard as important: I continue to regard the system of Lobby votes as a foolish and childish system.  My own side do not agree with me on this.  I do not want to detain the House with my feeling about it, but it is out of no exaggerated regard for my own dignity, or anything of that kind, that I say that. If I had any other job, or no job, I would still feel the same way about it. That an issue should be decided by herding so many ladies and gentlemen like so many sheep into a dipping pond, on one side or the other of that stairs, is childish.  I can quite see that on an issue of confidence or on a free vote, such as we had the other evening, it might be necessary to do that.  On a confidence issue or if a <Col N="1878" /> Government show signs of breaking up, then a lobby vote might be necessary so that each Deputy would show exactly where he stood but, in the ordinary course, Lobby votes should not be necessary and all that the two votes we have had so far today mean is that Deputy Lalor and Deputy Browne were doing their job to the best of their ability.  That is all they meant and no more than that.  If there are further votes this evening and the Government are defeated that will not be because the Government are particularly committed to financial proposals but because I have fallen down on the job, or some Deputy has made a mistake or got struck in a lift.  If we lose a vote here this evening or tomorrow that will be the reason for it. I can see that on the Committee Stage of a Bill, which is unpredictable, it may be difficult to replace the Lobby vote but we might consider, by amending the Constitution, some system of proxy voting through the medium of which a Deputy could record his vote and then go away.</P>
    <P>I would like votes, if they are to be taken at all, to be carried out so far as possible on the same system as the system the Dáil has evolved in regard to Estimates, namely, have the votes taken at a fixed time.  That would be possible on the Second Stage, the Fourth Stage and Final Stages of Bills and possibly on a range of other business but, in the absence of a proxy vote, it would not be easy to improve matters on a Committee Stage.  Nevertheless I think the system is difficult to defend.  It was all very fine in the days of loosely drawn party lines when no one was quite sure whether he was a Whig or a Tory, when he went with one one year and another the next.  In the reality of the present day everyone knows that, if I get my Deputies in here, they will all vote for the Government; if Deputy Lalor gets his Deputies in they will vote for the Opposition. That is absolutely predictable and the vote is devoid of any interest or political significance whatever.</P>
    <P>There is another side and that is the waste of human effort.  Again, in case anyone should think I have a tender <Col N="1879" /> regard for my own dignity, let me say a few words about Deputy Lalor. He is an experienced Member of this House.  He has been here for 13 years. He occupied the important office of Minister for Industry and Commerce and, before that, he was Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries.  He is a most experienced Member.  It is entirely a matter for Fianna Fáil how they allot their responsibilities among their own members, but it seems to me that a gentleman of Deputy Lalor's experience is wasted if all he is asked to do is nothing better than just telephoning around to Deputies trying to get them up here and then, when they are here, keeping them here.  It is a waste of time.  The same goes for Deputy Browne, who is experienced in business and in a wide range of walks of life.  To have him doing the same job as Deputy Lalor is a waste of effort because the predictable result is devoid of political significance.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>I would say precisely the same thing about Deputy O'Malley.  He has held ministerial office and, if he were made do that particular job, it would be a waste. He is making a far more effective contribution than if he were put back into that job.  I would regard that as a complete waste.  I hope Deputy O'Malley does not think I am being condescending, or anything like that, about Deputy Lalor.  I could say equivalent things about myself, which would be unacceptably egocentric, but the whole job of Whip so far as it lies in just ensuring the physical presence here of 60 or 70 men and women ought not to exist.  There is plenty of room for the other work a Whip has to do, fixing up business and filling up gaps left between the <Col N="1880" /> party and the Government or between the Government, the party and the Opposition.  All kinds of miscellaneous jobs arrive on the Whip's table but, so far as the most exacting part of the job is concerned, ensuring the physical presence of people here, there is no justification, I believe, for there being such a job at all in a community which should do its work in a rational way, without always looking over its shoulder to see what is done in Britain.</P>
      <P>I recommend the report for adoption.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>To come back to the report, I am very glad to agree, on behalf of this side of the House, that it should now be adopted, principally because virtually all of it arises from a report of a committee of which I was chairman.  That committee reported on 1st December, 1972.  There were 35 main recommendations by that committee and it is correct to say that at a meeting of the Committee on Procedure and Privileges it was decided to implement 31 of the recommendations in full, two more with limitations or reservations and to refuse two.  As well as these 35 main recommendations there was a large number of technical amendments to Standing Orders suggested by the office of the Ceann Comhairle in order to bring Standing Orders into accord with modern practice.  Even though Standing Orders had not been changed for quite a number of years the practice in relation to many matters had changed.  One such is the practice which has grown up here in recent years of holding divisions on Estimates at 10.15 p.m. on Wednesday night irrespective of when the division was called.  There was no power for that in Standing Orders and the position had to be covered by a Resolution of the House at the beginning of each new Dáil.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A number of conventions have grown up with regard to Question Time which had no recognition in Standing Orders but which are now recognised.  So far as the main changes are concerned, the time limit <Col N="1881" /> of speeches for Estimates will be of some value to the House when trying to get through business more expeditiously. The last 18 months have not been marked by abnormally long speeches but the previous Dáil was. One can recall speeches lasting more than six hours from individuals of the then Opposition.  I am glad those days are at an end so far as the Estimates are concerned.  There is no time limit so far as Bills are concerned.</P>
    <P>There is an important change being made here in relation to Standing Order 29 which allows debates on matters of urgent public importance to be debated in the same way as in other Parliaments.  The precedents which had grown up from the rulings of successive holders of the office of Ceann Comhairle were such that it was very difficult to get a debate on a matter of the most urgent public importance, so much so that over a period of 16 years&mdash;1957 to 1973&mdash; there had never been a single debate under Standing Order 29.  The committee of which I was chairman did not see the point of continuing that Standing Order unless it was brought into contact with reality and would be of some value to the House.</P>
    <P>The changes proposed for Private Members' Business are of some significance too.  They will allow the party or parties in Opposition to have Bills printed with, of course, definite limitations.  There cannot be more than one Bill on the go at any one time.  We had a very unsatisfactory situation for years.  Unless a Bill was read a First Time it could not be printed.  The practice grew up in the other House of Members actually printing the Bills themselves and circulating them.  There was some doubt if that was a breach of privilege in view of the fact that the House had never read the Bill a First Time. However, that difficulty will now be overcome.  If the present Government are prepared to co-operate with the spirit of the recommendations with regard to the making available of Private Members' Time, that time will be a great deal more useful than it was in the past.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1882" /> It is no harm to bear in mind that when the committee of which I was chairman met and brought in their report Fianna Fáil were in Government. The Government were prepared to make these various concessions to the Opposition of the day.  I hope there will not be any effort made by this Government not to honour the spirit of those recommendations as now proposed to be enacted to the Standing Orders of the House.</P>
    <P>The Parliamentary Secretary referred briefly to the various proposed changes in the Standing Orders.  He then went on to canvass at some length his own suggestions and ideas relating to further changes which might be made but which the committee decided either not to make or felt were outside its terms of reference. One of the things he suggested was that, provided the Opposition Whip of the day agreed, the Committee Stages of Bills might be taken in special committees.  The committee of which I was chairman considered this problem at some length.  We were all conscious of the need for more work to be done in committees outside the Chamber itself, in other words, committees other than committees of the whole House.  We ran up against the very practical difficulty which many people do not realise, that physically and in number this is a very small Parliament.  It is one of the smallest in the world with only 144 Members.</P>
    <P>The Parliamentary Secretary and many others tend to look on Westminister as being a system of Parliamentary procedure which we would do well to copy.  There are many things in Westminster which we have already copied.  They use the committee system to a considerable degree.  They have a vast number of committee sittings at one time.  What the Parliamentary Secretary and others fail to take into account is that they have over 630 Members in the House of Commons and about 1,000 Members in the House of Lords&mdash; although only about 200 of them partake in debates and in the day-to-day working of the House.  In short, they <Col N="1883" /> have a vast number of people on whom they can call for service in committees.  We do not have that. Even the existing standing committees such as the Committee on Procedure and Privileges and the Committee of Public Accounts, very frequently find it hard to get a quorum to start their business.</P>
    <P>If we are to have a large number of further committees sitting, as suggested by the Parliamentary Secretary, we will not be able to man them.  The 144 Deputies will not be available at any one time.  There are 22 or 23 Members in the Government, including Ministers and Parliamentary Secretaries. There are two more or less full-time occupants of the Chair. There are a certain number on the Opposition front benches who will not be readily available at all times to do this work because of their various other duties.  The result is that our numbers are narrowed down very considerably.  When we considered this three years ago we were very conscious of that problem.  It is an even greater problem now because there are ten Members of this House who are more or less permanently at the European Parliament.  There are also six, seven or eight Members who are semi-permanently in the Council of Europe.  In addition to those 16, 17 or 18 Members who are frequently not available here, there are many others, including Ministers, who may be away from the House, and frequently away from the country for one reason or another.  Desirable as it may be we will not be able to run more than one committee at a time. Indeed, one would find considerable difficulty even in running one committee unless it was considering a very technical Bill in which there was only very limited interest.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMKelly" hpid="Mr. Kelly Mr. Kelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree.  Would not one committee at a time be something?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>It would be something, but if one is putting in a highly controversial Bill, as the Parliamentary Secretary wants to do, such as the Planning Bill which is totally unsuitable for such a committee, <Col N="1884" /> one will find that one is chasing oneself around in circles.  The Parliamentary Secretary agrees that on such a Bill many Members would be interested in contributing.  He suggested in effect that almost anyone who wanted to go on that committee should be allowed to do so.  Surely the answer would be put the Bill into a committee of the whole House in the Chamber where there are proper facilities and the subject can be properly debated.</P>
      <P>I do not regard the Planning Bill as a suitable vehicle for such a committee. Suitable vehicles for such committees would be Bills such as the Companies Bill which was enacted in 1963 and the Income Tax (Consolidation) Bill which led to the Act of 1967, and other matters of a technical kind.  Many people might argue that the Finance Bill, which we are now discussing, is technical.  Nonetheless it most certainly should be debated in this House and not in a private room among a handful of people. These are matters of great importance.</P>
      <P>Most of the rest of what the Parliamentary Secretary had to say consisted of canvassing his own private and somewhat unique views about topics most of which have already been rejected, sometimes unanimously, by the Committee on Procedure and Privileges but he still seeks to canvass them.  I happen to disagree with most of what he has said.  He dislikes his job as Whip, which is of course his own privilege.  He feels that Deputy Lalor and Deputy Browne are wasted as Whips and that their experience should have them doing more important things.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I recall that when I came into this House about six years ago the late Deputy Gerard Sweetman, who was a very senior and valuable Member of the Fine Gael Party, had just ended an extremely long stint as Fine Gael Whip.  I am not sure how long he held the position but I think it was for something like eight years or longer.  I think the job of Whip is important and is particularly so in Opposition.  I do not think that Deputies Lalor and Browne are in any <Col N="1885" /> way undervalued by holding the jobs which they so competently carry out at the moment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMKelly" hpid="Mr. Kelly Mr. Kelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kelly</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>That, of course, raises the problem that the Parliamentary Secretary feels that parliamentary democracy or procedure as we know it does not make any sense. He objects to voting.  He objects to a lot of things that this and other Parliaments take for granted.  He refers to Deputies trooping through the lobbies like sheep.  That may be true in many cases but we have the occasional, memorable, spectacle of when they do not troop through the lobbies like sheep.  We had one only last week.  Presumably if the Parliamentary Secretary had his way all the members of the Government, all the Members of the Fine Gael Party and all the Members of the Labour Party would have been chalked up as having voted for the Bill the Parliamentary Secretary was so strenuously promoting.  They chose otherwise.  They expressed their disagreement with the view of the Parliamentary Secretary and of the rest of the Government, not by making a speech to that effect&mdash;because they did not&mdash;but by voting with the Opposition.</P>

      <P>It would not be anything new that the Parliamentary Secretary should interrupt me continually or that those behind him should help him to do it.  I think there is more or less unanimous agreement about the implementation of these recommendations.  When they are implemented a further committee might well be established, more broadly based than the purely Parliamentary Committee was established in 1971, to consider the functions and workings of this whole Parliament from a broader point of view, to look at its relevance to Irish life at the moment and see how its value to the Irish nation could be increased.  I think that the people who should constitute such a committee should be by no means exclusively parliamentarians; indeed, perhaps the majority of them should not be.  I think they would have, if they were established, an interesting and valuable albeit difficult task ahead of them but I think it would be in the interests of this nation that some committee should endeavour to make the workings of this Parliament more relevant to much of what goes on in this country and, accordingly, to enable its contribution to the advancement of our people be greater than at present.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not know whether this is the appropriate place to express again my disagreement&mdash;apparently it is not&mdash; with what the Parliamentary Secretary had to say about things that are not contained in this report before us.  He spoke for about 25 minutes and devoted most of the time to talking about matters which are not in fact in the report.  Without going into any great detail on what he said, all <Col N="1888" /> I can do is repeat once again that nearly all of what he said here today he has canvassed unsuccessfully in the Committee on Procedure and Privileges.  The fact that he has been unsucessful there, one would have thought, would have led him to refuse to canvass it any further; but, surprisingly enough, he keeps pushing his somewhat strange ideas on Parliamentary procedure.</P>
    <P>I want him to be assured that this side of the House at any rate has no intention of doing away with voting to all intents and purposes in the House.  It has no intention of facilitating a handful of Dublin Deputies by treating the National Parliament as if it were some kind of office job one dropped into some time in the morning and left in the evening.  As far as we are concerned, we will continue to insist that the sort of hours which now exists are retained, recognising that they exist because the great bulk of Members of this House wish to have them that way, because they are convenient for the great bulk of Members of this House.  I think any time Members of the House, as a general body, have been asked whether they wanted to change or not, the overwhelming view has been continuously against radical changes in hours, as suggested by the Parliamentary Secretary.  He probably fails to take into account the fact that about two-thirds of the House come from outside Dublin, perhaps more than two-thirds.  A great many Members have to earn their living outside of what they get here.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>Now that these changes have been made, I hope the Government will take the next obvious step, namely, to establish another committee to pick up where the last committee left off in order to consider further and more <Col N="1889" /> fundamental reforms.  I would emphasise that the terms of reference of the committee of which I was chairman did not envisage any changes outside the general context of procedure and Standing Orders as we found them.  To a great extent our recommendations, which are being implemented, are recommendations of detail.  What is needed is a more fundamental appraisal of the workings of both Houses of the Oireachtas, as a result of which they might be able to make a more valuable and relevant contribution to the nation and to the advancement of our people.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. B. Desmond Mr. B. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>At the outset, I should like to compliment Deputy O'Malley who acted as chairman and piloted through the report of the informal committee on the reform of Dáil procedure.  He was the most conscientious and competent chairman and, although I may not agree with some of his views on parliamentary reform which I regard as conservative, nevertheless he acted most effectively as chairman of the committee.  I should also like to compliment the secretary of the committee, Mr. Michael Kilroy, the Ceann Comhairle, the Clerk of the Dáil and Mr. O'Brien who acted as assistant.  They should be thanked for their most effective processing of the work done on the Committee on Procedure and Privileges in drafting the precise amendments to Standing Orders.</P>
      <P>In supporting this motion we must ask ourselves a number of fundamental questions about Dáil Éireann and its future.  We must ask how parliamentary democracy has served the Irish people since the signing of the Treaty in 1922.  We are under no illusions regarding the effectiveness of parliamentary democracy in Northern Ireland in that period.  The institutions there have failed signally to serve the needs of large elements of the Irish people.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It can be said that in the Republic our system of parliamentary democracy has major defects.  One of the many ironies of Irish political life is that we took the 19th-century Westminster model and we made Dáil Éireann almost an exact replica of <Col N="1890" /> it.  Likewise, the 1937 Constitution enthroned the British concept of the Cabinet and the workings of Cabinet responsibility.  Most Irish parliamentarians since 1922 have never acknowledged the full irony of that situation. It might be said that the British House of Commons for all its innate conservatism has proved more open to innovation since 1922 than has Dáil Éireann.</P>
    <P>Although we survived the Civil War, the reluctance of Fianna Fáil to participate in our developing democracy and the abrupt change of Government in 1932, nevertheless our parliamentary institutions are still very inadequate. In common with many Labour Party Deputies, I hold the view that the failure of Dáil Éireann to deal effectively with many of the vital economic and social issues as they affect the lives of ordinary people, and the obsession of the Dáil with procedures and constitutional practices of the Westminster variety, has not helped the effective operation of Parliament.</P>
    <P>Unfortunately this has influenced adversely the development of industry and of our economic and social affairs. Because Dáil Éireann has been ineffective and unresponsive, particularly in the last two decades, the industrial, economic and social development of the country has been hindered and has not got the impetus from Parliament which it needed and deserved.  We have had parliamentary democracy operated by Cabinet where it might be said that an Opposition and even Government backbenchers are superfluous, where the political heads, for the time being of the various Departments and the permanent civil servants run the country rather than Parliament.</P>
    <P>At least it can be said we have the institutions for what they are worth.  We must try to change substantially the structure of the Oireachtas and, above all, we must change the procedures of Dáil Éireann if we are to make the supreme law-making body responsive and instructive. I was elected to this House in 1969 and I have served both in Opposition and in Government.  I <Col N="1891" /> believe that the Dáil is far less effective than the current national situation demands.  There is a great need for procedures whereby individual Deputies, both of the Government and the Opposition, should be more directly and effectively involved in the main task for which they were elected, namely, to make the laws for the nation.  As was stated by Deputy O'Malley, there is a strong feeling throughout the House that the present Dáil procedures in some way are sacrosanct, in some way immutable. When a party go into Opposition they view with supicion any changes which emanate from the Government side because, of course, they have to overcome the trauma of being in Opposition and of being fearful that perhaps they might be further snuffed out in the Parliamentary process. It is not particularly to the credit of the previous Administration that only in the dying year or two of their 16 years administration an informal committee on Dáil reform was produced. We have the report, such as it is, before us today.  That is as things are and we must proceed from there rather than look into the past.</P>
    <P>With no disrespect I say that Dáil Éireann is in many ways a sanctuary of conservatism.  It is also a rather seductive place.  Once elected there is always a reluctance on the part of Deputies to change very much because they become absorbed in the system.  We have, for example, the parliamentary charade developed by the British politicians for us the Irish of parliamentary Question Time with which we have always failed to come to grips.  It inhabits a normal flow of parliamentary debate between Government and Opposition.  I am always amazed at the capacity of a Fianna Fáil Party in Opposition or a Labour and Fine Gael Party in Opposition to continue to operate the charade whereby a Minister will stand up and read out, parrot-like, a Civil Service brief and prepared answer.  Perhaps two or three supplementary questions may be asked and that then is the end of the discussion of a serious topic of national importance.  To me that is not democracy.  It is a peculiar <Col N="1892" /> device used on the floor of the House of Commons when the gentlemen waved their swords at one another and the right honourable gallant gentlemen decided that they should have some circumspection in their approach.  It is not an Irish solution.  It is inhibiting, stupid and certainly ineffective.</P>
    <P>Dáil Éireann has become more rigid, more unresponsive to the challenges of modern Irish society. It is important that we, as parliamentarians, should note that that society is becoming more complex.  It is becoming more technical, more planned, more programmed.  It is more demanding and it requires a political response.  I say, with respect, that the proposals in the report and the amendments to the Standing Orders are but a very slight contribution from Dáil Éireann towards reforming itself.</P>

      <P>I have suggested that with Irish society having changed so rapidly, in the past ten years in particular, Dáil Éireann has become very rigid and very unresponsive to the challenges of Ireland today.  It is fair to say that there is, among many electors, and particularly among the new young electors, those between 18 and 30 years of age, a fairly widespread and growing attitude of disinterest and cynicism towards the functioning of the Oireachtas.  Whether it is a free vote or a Government Whip vote, or any other kind of vote, I have seen that develop in the past three or four years while I have been in this House.</P>
      <P>We must, therefore, ask ourselves fundamental questions, particularly on the Government side.  We must ask do Governments of either the Fianna Fáil or Coalition variety see Dáil Éireann as having something more than a kind of institutional nuisance value whereby the Government periodically come to the House and then proceed with the work of the day and the nation.  Are we to be relegated to that kind of role?  Is Dáil Éireann to have no other function than to be a kind of democratic nuisance, a filtering pot for Deputies who want to ask occasional questions or make occasional speeches on various Estimates?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have to make an admission because one must be very frank about this.  I have not met many Government Ministers on the Fianna Fáil side and I have met very few also on the Coalition side who have said that they are terribly anxious for reform of Dáil Éireann procedures.  Naturally when the very same persons were in Opposition they spoke frequently about the need for reform.  This is a measure of the problem with which we are faced.  If I may be excused for saying so, I think Dáil Éireann is rather a sleepy place in terms of parliamentary work.  I think it is a rather <Col N="1894" /> old-fashioned, male-dominated place in terms of parliamentary work.  I think we are very semi-professional. The place abounds with lawyers, auctioneers and business people.  I do not think the level of political debate is at a particularly high level. Deputies, in my opinion, play less and less of a role in the formulation and enactment of legislation and more and more we are declining in our influence on the legislation that goes through Dáil Éireann.</P>
    <P>With respect to our own institution it can hardly be said that Dáil Éireann is a place where national opinion is sounded in depth before Government decisions are taken.  Certainly that is not my experience.  Government decisions are taken and they are discussed on a <i>post-factum</i> basis in Dáil Éireann.  That is not a good thing in a democracy.  It can hardly be said at present that Dáil Éireann as constituted is a really effective medium for the scrutiny and the criticism of decisions after they have been taken by the Government so that their full import may be conveyed to the nation as a whole.</P>
    <P>It is not unfair, therefore, to suggest that Dáil Éireann is a place where politicians assemble one might say in between fighting elections while the Cabinet and the Civil Service get on with the real job of running the country.  Therefore, one must ask the question very sharply, &ldquo;Is Dáil Éireann properly discharging the functions for which it exists?&rdquo;  As far as I am concerned, regrettably the answer is &ldquo;no&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>I welcome the decision of the Committee on Procedure and Privileges to adopt the report.  Almost all recommendations have been fully adopted. I welcome the changes to reform the Dáil.  In Dáil Éireann we are slowly getting away from the formal debating society type of approach with rigid rules, procedures and precedents on the Westminster model.  We are bringing it up to date to meet the needs of modern times.</P>
    <P>The output of legislation may, as a result, be improved.  The extent to which Dáil Éireann, if one looks at the period from 1970 to 1974, has <Col N="1895" /> produced futuristic, essential, progressive, social, economic and industrial legislation, has been an all time low in the history of the State.  Certainly during 1971-72 we had very little legislation other than essential legislation relating to the Finance Bill.  There has been a substantial improvement between March, 1973 to June, 1974. The recently enacted legislation has had a very important impact on the urgent needs of our economic and social life.</P>
    <P>I am pleased to note the proposition that new criteria be adopted for Adjournment Debates on urgent matters.  There will be serious and major issues in the years ahead, such as Northern Ireland, the rapid developments within our economy, inflation, the rapidly revolving British response to the Common Market, the question which has almost been shelved of the urgently needed reforms in Local Government, the social deprivation in our community and poverty, which could be discussed on Adjournment Debates.  Dáil Éireann in the 12 months ahead should be able to have these major issues debated.</P>
    <P>I do not think it is to the credit of Dáil Éireann that we should adjourn either next Friday or the following week and not meet again until about 13th October.  That is not parliamentary life.  I see no reason for a lengthy Summer Recess.  I have a good deal of constituency work to do.  I do not have a law practice or a business to look after.  I live on my Dáil salary, such as it is.  I would much prefer to be in Dáil Éireann with perhaps a break of a month which is long enough for any individual.  The long, sustained Summer Recess is presumably a feudal throwback to the days of the corn laws when the gentlemen of Parliament went to look after their farms, brought in the harvest, tasted the wine, and did not return to Parliament until late autumn, having replenished their London houses.  This is not good enough for a republican nation, which supposedly takes its parliamentary institutions seriously.</P>
    <P>I am amazed that in the 16 years of Fianna Fáil rule they did not examine <Col N="1896" /> this.  In the current situation there does not seem to be any fantastic urgency on the side of the Government to reform it on that basis. Unfortunately, due to a party meeting, I missed some of the Parliamentary Secretary's contribution, but I know in many areas I find myself in complete sympathy with him on these matters.  We may differ on some of the procedures, but as far as I am concerned I want to see Dáil Éireann made a much more dynamic and effective place in the political institutions of this state.</P>
    <P>The month of October should be far more important in Dáil Éireann. It will be the month of our annual conference for Labour Deputies.  The month of February tends to be far more important to Fianna Fáil, in terms of their annual conference, than Dáil Éireann, because we do not come back until the beginning of February.  From the time we return in October until mid December we will only have a few weeks of parliamentary time in which to put through legislation.  That is not good enough. We should have much shorter recesses.</P>
    <P>The other changes improve the general effectiveness of Standing Orders in the Dáil, and they should be welcomed insofar as they streamline the outmoded procedures which we have.  As a long term contribution towards meeting the more serious defects of Dáil procedures the report is not a major contribution.  This is no reflection on the former chairman, Deputy O'Malley, or on the staff of the Dáil who serviced this committee most effectively.  It is simply that the terms of reference and the attitude of the committee did not permit something more substantial to emerge.</P>
    <P>I want to deal with some of the points raised here and particularly to stress the fact that the informal committee on page 6 paragraph 5 of the report, which gave rise to the changes in the Standing Orders, seemed anxious to deal with Dáil procedures purely as they were and avoided the major questions in their anxiety to produce interim immediate recommendations.  I, therefore, <Col N="1897" /> go back to Deputy O'Malley's suggestion that there should be a further committee established.  I would not go wholly along the line suggested by Deputy O'Malley, that it should be an entirely outside committee of constitutional experts, parliamentary procedure experts and political affairs experts.  I would like to see a mixture of parliamentarians and outside people appointed to the committee.  I would like to see a Commission on Parliamentary Reform in this country. I would like to see the Ceann Comhairle sitting or represented on it and I would like to see us getting down to really amending the Standing Orders of Dáil Éireann, not for the 1974 period, but for the 1980s and bringing parliament into real relevance and future effectiveness.</P>
    <P>Under the amendments to the Standing Orders before us there is no agreed arrangement whereby the Dáil could designate a committee of its members to embark on a detailed investigation of a particular aspect of Governmental administration.  The Standing Orders, as proposed, provide for an agreed committee in relation to the Committee Stage of a Bill.  With the Whips' agreement, a Bill could be sent off to have the Committee Stage dealt with by a special committee.</P>
    <P>I can think of a number of pieces of legislation which could be most effectively dealt with at that level.  For example, there is the Local Government (Planning and Development) Bill, which is a very complex piece of legislation, a piece of legislation which would undoubtedly create a great deal of interest among many Deputies, particularly those Deputies who are on local authorities or who are former Ministers in that field, such as Deputy Blaney and Deputy Molloy.  Admittedly the whole of the Dáil itself constitutes a Committee for the Third Reading of a Bill, but the debate is rather closely confined by Standing Orders.</P>
    <P>We in the Labour Party did suggest four or five years ago that committees should be established not only for particular complex Bills such as the Bill on value-added tax and the Bill on company law, which were <Col N="1898" /> both quite a success, but also for specific Estimates.  In other words we should not rest our oars on the amendments suggested here.  We should have a small number of standing committees of Dáil Éireann for the purpose of debating Estimates directed to them by Dáil Éireann, in addition to considering the Committee Stages of selected Bills.</P>
    <P>It is rather a waste of parliamentary time that on Thursdays here a Minister stands up and reads out a lengthy Estimate contribution to which there is a response from the Opposition spokesman.  They could get together and deal much more effectively with the Estimate through a committee composed of those Members of the House with specialist knowledge on the particular Estimate. They could engage in a long and detailed analysis of the Estimate, and the Dáil could proceed to other business. We would not then have the ridiculous situation when everybody is wondering when the Dáil is going to adjourn, wondering whether the House is going to meet until midnight, and when everybody gets worried about the timetable of Dáil Éireann, as a result of which the work is not satisfactorily performed by Deputies.</P>
    <P>I regret that the innovation I suggest is not in the proposed amendments to Standing Orders.  I suggest that a permanent committee system should be established.  We might experiment further with joint committees of both the Dáil and Seanad with a qualified secretariat and expert staff, to enable Deputies to examine specific areas of Government administration. There is no real examination by Dáil Éireann of, for example, the question of the environment.  This is an area for a specialist committee of, say, 20 Deputies, ten from either side, with expert professional staff.  There is also need for an on-going review of education, not just confined to an Estimate debate of a couple of hours each year.  It is quite inappropriate that we should have one Estimate each year for a discussion on agriculture. There should be a standing committee on agriculture.  There is also the question <Col N="1899" /> of energy.  Why have we no opportunity, except once every 12 months, to debate this subject under the Estimate for the Department of Transport and Power?  It is wasteful and time-consuming to have the whole House discussing an Estimate for each Department every Thursday with a few Deputies present who may have a particular interest.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanCrinion" hpid="Mr. Crinion Mr. Crinion">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Crinion</NameTxt>
      <P>I am surprised at the Deputy suggesting that some Deputies would be away, seeing that he is a Whip.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. B. Desmond Mr. B. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>I would suggest that a time limit on Estimate speeches would stop some of the very lengthy contributions which are made from time to time.  Perhaps Deputies do not prepare their contributions, which are not therefore as tightly compressed as they might be, and as a result a great deal of time is wasted on Estimate debates.</P>
      <P>There is no excuse for any Government or any Opposition complaining about a backlog of legislation when the very system operated by Dáil Éireann does not permit the backlog of legislation to be dealt with in a most expeditious manner.  It would be less wasteful of time and of the resources of Dáil Éireann if non-contentious, specialist, technical legislation could be dealt with by joint standing committees. This is now proposed in regard to the Committee Stages of Bills.  It would be of interest to carry out a cost-benefit analysis of the amount of time taken up and the expense incurred by the National Exchequer in the processing of Bills through Dáil Éireann. This is a point of which we as custodians of the taxpayer's money should perhaps be more conscious.  Frequently there can be enormous and lengthy debates with the full House involved on a particular point when the matter could quite easily be dealt with by a specialist committee, and this is an area where I would like to see changes brought in.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I propose to deal with a few other matters when the debate is resumed, in particular the need for a committee to deal with the role of State-sponsored <Col N="1900" /> bodies.  I want to support the establishment of this committee.  I think the House will find considerable unanimity in the suggestion that the vital role of semi-State bodies in our national life and in our economic development cannot be ignored by Dáil Éireann.  Dáil Éireann cannot ignore forever the crucial role of such bodies and perhaps debate them in a desultory manner on occasional Estimates.  We have a specific role to play as a Parliament seeing that we established these bodies, seeing that we allotted clearly defined functions to them.  Despite this there is very little discussion among Deputies and Senators as to the precise role of such bodies.  I certainly want to take advantage of the discussion on these Standing Orders to support the setting-up by the House of a committee for State-sponsored bodies.  We should proceed in that direction.  I move the adjournment of the debate.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelOLeary" hpid="Mr. M. O'Leary Mr. M. O'Leary">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>The incidence of brucellosis in County Limerick, as part of the main southern dairying area, is of course understandably above the average for the country as a whole.  It was for this reason that I introduced last year the Pre-Intensive Brucellosis Scheme as the best approach for herdowners in that area to prepare, with the least possible disruption of their farming activity, for application of full eradication measures.</P>

      <P>Like all schemes which are not compulsory it can be claimed that it is not successful, but I believe the Minister would maintain that it has permitted farming to proceed and at the same time permitted the removal of reactors of those interested in the scheme.  It has been useful to that extent.  I believe the Minister would agree with the Deputy that the only satisfactory solution is the implementation at the earliest possible stage in County Limerick and adjoining areas of the full brucellosis scheme.</P>

In my view there is a favourable development amongst large creamery groups becoming more interested in this area and, with their co-operation, even the present voluntary scheme can achieve the limited improvements which the Minister visualised on its introduction.

      <P>With the permission of the Ceann Comhairle, I propose taking Questions Nos. 7 and 8 together.</P>
      <P>I have made representations personally to the French Agricultural Minister last week about the adverse effect on Irish lamb exports to France of the increase now made in the French minimum import price for lamb.  I will, of course, pursue the matter as far as possible.</P>
      <P>The increase in the French minimum price will have the effect of prohibiting for the time being imports of lamb from here and other countries into France.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Our exports of lamb to France represented just over 50 per cent of our total lamb exports last year and the <Col N="1909" /> sudden cutting off of this trade is therefore very regrettable.  Pending the introduction by the EEC of a common organisation of the market for sheepmeat individual member countries may maintain their own national organisation of the market.  The French authorities claim that their present import system is in conformity with that freedom but I have also been questioning this aspect.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GerardCollins" hpid="Mr. G. Collins Mr. G. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>Can the Minister tell us what progress, if any, his colleague in the Department of Agriculture and Fisheries has made with regard to the introduction of a common agricultural policy for sheep and lambs?</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelOLeary" hpid="Mr. M. O'Leary Mr. M. O'Leary">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>As the Deputy knows, better than I, there is not this agreement in the sheep meat area, and that is what the Minister is seeking to bring about.  It is the absence of this common agricultural policy in the area of sheep which has permitted the French to make their own interpretation of Treaty provisions in this area.  The Deputy is right in thinking that the final answer is common agricultural policy applied to this area.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>We may judge that to get this common agricultural policy would require the support of the French.  The French have taken this unilateral action which has damaged our lamb export.  It was of a high figure, about 50 per cent.  The Deputy may judge that so far we are not within sight of that common agricultural policy for sheep meat but that the Minister is making all realistic efforts to bring it about.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJFitzpatrick" hpid="Minister for Lands (Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick, Cavan) Thomas J. (Cavan) Fitzpatrick">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Lands (Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick,</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>Cavan</i>): The farm in question is being acquired by the Land Commission under their compulsory powers.  In such cases the law prescribes that payment must be made in Land Bonds and this has been the position since the passing of the Land Act, 1923.</P>
      <P>Since 1950, the Land Commission have had authority to pay in cash for land purchased by them on a voluntary basis.  In other words, when an owner is willing to sell and an agreement on the price is reached, they can pay in cash, just as in any private sale.  As to the farm referred to by the Deputy, however, the owners and the Land Commission, following negotiations which went on for some months, failed to reach agreement.  The owners then took the matter in the normal way to the Appeal Tribunal which, so to speak, acts as an independent arbitrator between the parties and it fixed the price to be paid.</P>
      <P>Once the matter was decided by the Appeal Tribunal the law required payment in Land Bonds.  As I have said already, this has been the statutory position since the foundation of the State and neither the Land Commission nor anyone else has any legal authority to vary the method of payment.</P>

      <P>I take it that the Deputy is referring to the Preamble to the EEC Treaty which sets the Community the objective of strengthening the unity of the economies of the member states and ensuring their harmonious development by reducing the differences existing between the various regions and the backwardness <Col N="1921" /> of the less favoured regions.  The Deputy may also be referring to Article 2 of the same Treaty which reads,</P>
      <P>The Community shall have the task, by establishing a common market and progressively approximating the economic policies of Members States, to promote throughout the Community a harmonious development of economic activities, a continuous and balanced expansion, an increase in stability, an accelerated raising of the standard of living and closer relations between the States belonging to it.</P>
      <P>There has been no change either to the Preamble or to Article 2.  Proposals for a regional policy which would partially implement these provisions have been made by the Commission but the Council of Ministers has not yet taken a decision on this matter.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Meaney</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs why regulations in his Department now stipulate that priority for telephone connections will not be given to any industrialist unless he employs more than seven people; and, if in view of the fact that this regulation militates against people who wish to establish small industries, he will make a statement on the matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ConorCruiseOBrien" hpid="Dr. Cruise-O'Brien Dr. Cruise-O'Brien">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Cruise-O'Brien</NameTxt>
      <P>The priority categories include undertakings with a fair employment content.  A minimum of seven employees has for very many years past been taken as automatically satisfying the employment criterion, but this does not rule out the granting of priority to undertakings with a lesser employment content where circumstances warrant it. I would certainly like to meet all applications for business lines.  The difficulty is that the priority categories now amount to about 40 per cent of total demand.  To increase the priority categories appreciably would make priority ineffective.  Nevertheless <Col N="1924" /> it can be taken that applications for telephones from persons wishing to establish small industries will receive sympathetic consideration.</P>
      <P>I should add that employment is not the only criterion employed in determining priority for business line applications.  Priority is also extended to specialised businesses, irrespective of employment content, for which a telephone is clearly essential, for example, a full-time auctioneer, a registered hotel or guest house.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJVMeaney" hpid="Mr. Meaney Mr. Meaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Meaney</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to ask the Minister: why specify seven?  It may have been there many years but, in view of what he has said&mdash;that there are other matters taken into consideration as well&mdash;I should like to see the figure of seven omitted altogether and have them all judged on their merits.  Is the Minister aware that people have come to me and said that when they made application and afterwards inquired, by telephone or by letter, they were told that the fact that they had not got seven employees militated against their chances.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ConorCruiseOBrien" hpid="Dr. Cruise-O'Brien Dr. Cruise-O'Brien">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Cruise-O'Brien</NameTxt>
      <P>I will consider what the Deputy says.  The fact is that seven is an arbitrary figure; it was fixed very many years ago; maybe we should fix another figure or have no figure restriction.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJVMeaney" hpid="Mr. Meaney Mr. Meaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Meaney</NameTxt>
      <P>Well, it is being used now.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ConorCruiseOBrien" hpid="Dr. Cruise-O'Brien Dr. Cruise-O'Brien">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Cruise-O'Brien</NameTxt>
      <P>Perhaps the Deputy will forgive me if I try to complete my answer to his question. The fact is that if a business has seven employees and over, they automatically rate as priority.  If it is below that, they are considered for priority. That is the difference between the two categories.  Clearly there has to be some weighting in favour of the larger business.  I should like to be able to provide lines for all businesses as soon as they apply.  I should like to move in that direction and I am sure the Deputy and the House will support me in that.</P>

      <P>No approaches from industrial promoters were received by my Department.</P>
      <P>I understand from the Industrial Development Authority that two industrialists for whom itineraries were arranged visited the former CBS school in Letterfrack in April last as well as a number of other locations. The promoters concerned ultimately decided to pursue their negotiations with the Authority on the basis of locating their projects elsewhere.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PeterBarry" hpid="Mr. P. Barry Mr. P. Barry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>The following is the position in relation to the several parts of the Deputy's question&mdash;</P>
      <P>(a)  The draft EEC regulation on concentrations is still under discussion by a Working Party of the EEC Council.  It proposes to give the Commission power to declare certain very large concentrations to be incompatible with the Common Market.  I consider the present draft proposals acceptable in principle subject to certain reservations in matters of detail.</P>
      <P>(b)  EEC Regulation 459 of 1968 refers to control of dumping into the Community from Third Countries. New Member States may take action under national legislation in certain circumstances, until 30th June, 1977.</P>
      <P>Article 136 of the Treaty of Accession provides for investigation and action by the EEC Commission on intra-Community dumping.  Article 137 allows Ireland to take unilateral action, until 31st December 1977, in cases of extreme urgency but the measures may be modified or abolished by the Commission.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>(c)  Discussions are still proceeding <Col N="1930" /> regarding the question of harmonising State aids to industry in the different regions of the EEC.  Everything necessary will be done to ensure that adequate provision is made for the industrial development programme of this country.</P>
    <P>(d)  The Community is in the course of drawing up a programme of action to be taken by it or by Member States for the protection of the consumer. The programme is very comprehensive, but is in very general terms and will not assume a precise form until action is further advanced. I have indicated my general concurrence in the proposed programme.</P>
    <P>(e)  Articles 85 and 86 of the Treaty of Rome contain the basic rules of the EEC regarding restrictive practices and the abuse of dominant positions. The implementation of those Articles has not given rise to any great difficulties for this country and I do not anticipate any such difficulties.</P>

      <P>The authority have also announced that work has commenced on a large advance factory of 42,000 sq. ft. at Ballincollig as an incentive to the early establishment of an industry there.</P>

      <i>Progress report by the Chairman of the Preparatory Committee:</i>
    </P>
    <P>The Ministers of Education, meeting within the Council,</P>
    <P>&mdash;approved the report by the Chairman of the Preparatory Committee;</P>
    <P>&mdash;noted with satisfaction that the three ratifications still pending were about to be made, thus enabling the Convention to enter into force by mid-July 1975;</P>
    <P>&mdash;emphasized their unanimous intention of expediting the preparatory work thereby enabling the Institute in effect to open its doors to research workers by the autumn of 1975;</P>
    <P>&mdash;asked the Preparatory Committee to take appropriate steps to enable appointed members of the future High Council to meet on an informal basis at an early date in accordance with the most appropriate procedure;</P>
    <P>&mdash;recognized that the standing of the Institute would be finally determined during the initial period by the choice of the teaching staff responsible for the academic work of the Institute;</P>
    <P>&mdash;expressed their unanimous intention that this choice should be so made, in close collaboration with the appointed Principal of the Institute, as to guarantee achievement of the highest quality standards.</P>
    <P>&mdash;<i>Mutual recognition of diplomas, certificates and other evidence of formal qualifications.</i></P>

    <P>The Council adopted the following Resolution:</P>
    <P>The Council of the European Communities,</P>
    <P>Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Economic Community;</P>
    <P>Having regard to the proposal from the Commission of 11 March 1974;</P>
    <P>Having regard to the Opinion of the European Parliament of 23 April 1974;</P>
    <P>Whereas certain principles and guidelines should be laid down for the promotion of work relating to the mutual recognition of diplomas, certificates and other evidence of formal qualifications,</P>
    <P>T/309 e/74 (EN) ans/JH(el)</P>
    <P>EEC:</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1937" />
      <Col N="1938" /> Has adopted this Resolution:</P>
    <P>I.The Council</P>
    <P>&mdash;acknowledges that Directives on the right of establishment, in particular those concerning the liberal professions, are of importance in connection with education policies;</P>
    <P>&mdash;emphasized that such Directives should be so drawn up that they do not impede efforts towards educational reform in the Member States of the Community;</P>
    <P>&mdash;considers it appropriate that educational policies should make a positive contribution to freedom of establishment, in particular with regard to the liberal professions.</P>
    <P>II.The Council expresses the wish that the further work in the field of the mutual recognition of diplomas, certificates and other evidence of formal qualifications be guided by the endeavour to introduce flexibility and quality.  In this connection, the Council agrees with the following guideline:</P>
    <P>Given that despite the differences existing between one Member State and another in the courses of training there is in practice board comparability between the final qualifications giving access to identical fields of activity, the directives for the mutual recognition of professional qualifications and for the co-ordination of the conditions of access to the professions should resort as little as possible to the prescription of detailed training requirements.</P>
    <P>III.In order to put this guideline into effect:</P>
    <P>&mdash;lists of diplomas, certificates and other evidence of formal qualifications recognized as being equivalent should be drawn up,</P>
    <P>&mdash;Advisory Committees, the terms of reference and composition of which are still to be determined, should be set up.</P>
    <P>IV.The Council instructs the Permanent Representatives Committee to ensure, in co-operation with the Commission, that this Resolution is implemented, especially as regards the examination of the proposals for directives on the mutual recognition of diplomas, certificates and other evidence of formal qualifications.</P>
    <P>
      <i>The Danish delegation</i> provisionally agreed to accept this Resolution.</P>
    <P>The Council also agreed that this Resolution would be published in the Official Journal of the European Communities for information purposes, after finalization in the official languages of the Communities.</P>

    <P>Taking into account the Statements in the Minutes, given on page 7 below, the Ministers adopted the following Resolution:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;The Ministers of Education meeting within the Council,</P>
    <P>&mdash;referring to the Final Communique of the Conference of Heads of State or of Government held at The Hague on 1 and 2 December 1969, and in particular to point 4 of this Communique in which the need to safeguard in Europe &ldquo;an exceptional source of development, progress and culture&rdquo; is affirmed and to the Final Communique of the Conference of Heads of State or of Government held in Paris on 19 and 20 October 1972.</P>
    <P>&mdash;recalling the conclusions of their discussions on 16 November, and the proceedings of the Working Party of Senior Officials,</P>
    <P>&mdash;taking account of the Commission communication of 6 March 1974 on education in the European Community,</P>
    <P>&mdash;confirming the need to institute European co-operation in the field of education and their desire to achieve that co-operation by progressive stages in matters agreed upon in accordance with a procedure to be laid down.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1939" />
      <Col N="1940" /> HAVE ADOPTED THIS RESOLUTION:</P>
    <P>I.Co-operation on Education shall be based on the following principles:</P>
    <P>&mdash;the programme of co-operation initiated in the field of education, while being conducive to the progressive harmonization of the economic and social policies in the Community, must be adopted to the specific objectives and requirements of this field;</P>
    <P>&mdash;on no account must education be regarded merely as a component of economic life;</P>
    <P>&mdash;educational co-operation must make allowance for the traditions of each country and the diversity of educational policies and systems.  Harmonization of these systems cannot, therefore, be considered an end in itself.</P>
    <P>II.At the present stage, this co-operation will relate mainly to the following priority spheres of action:</P>
    <P>&mdash;better facilities for the education and training of nationals of other Member States of the Communities and of non-member countries and their children;</P>
    <P>&mdash;promotion of closer agreement between educational systems in Europe:</P>
    <P>&mdash;compilation of up-to-date documentation and statistics on education;</P>
    <P>&mdash;increase in co-operation between institutions of higher education;</P>
    <P>&mdash;improvement in the possibilities of academic recognition of both diplomas and periods of study;</P>
    <P>&mdash;encouragement of freedom of movement for and mobility of teachers students and research workers, in particular by the removal of administrative and social obstacles to free movement for such persons and the improvement of the teaching and learning of foreign languages;</P>
    <P>&mdash;endeavours to create equal opportunity of free access to all forms of teaching and learning.</P>
    <P>It is self-evident that there must be no bar to broaching any subject the study of which would appear to be necessary for the attainment of the results sought in these fields.</P>
    <P>III.This co-operation must not hinder the exercise of the powers conferred on the Institutions of the European Communities.</P>
    <P>IV.In order to define the spheres of action mentioned under point II, an Education Committee shall be set up, composed of representatives of the Member States and the Commission. Its Chairman shall come from the country which holds the office of President of the Council of Ministers.  The Committee will report to the Education Ministers before 30th June 1975, in accordance with customary procedures.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Statements in the Minutes:</i>
    </P>
    <P>(1)It is expressly noted that point II presents certain essential aspects unquestionably falling within the competence of Community policies.</P>
    <P>(2)in adopting point III, the Ministers stress the fact that the Commission and other Institutions and bodies of the Communities have both the right and authority to undertake initiatives within the scope of their respective competences.</P>
    <P>(3)attention is drawn to the procedure adopted under point IV, which for the practical application of the consequences of decisions as presented under point II, creates a link between the tasks of the Council, of the Member States and of the Commission respectively.</P>
    <P>(4)by way of a compromise, the words &ldquo;the Council&rdquo; and &ldquo;the Representatives of the Member States&rdquo; are not employed in the introduction which reads as follows: &ldquo;the Ministers of Education meeting within the Council&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>
      <i>The Danish delegation</i> agreed provisionally to accept this Resolution.</P>
    <P>The Ministers agreed that this Resolution would be published in the Official Journal of the European Communities for information purposes, after the text had been finalized by the legal and linguistic experts.</P>

      <Col N="1946" /> SECTION 12.</P>
    <P>Debate resumed on amendment No. 7:</P>
    <P>In page 8, between lines 2 and 3, to insert a new section as follows:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Where, in any of the provisions of this Chapter and of Part I of the First Schedule, a specific sum is mentioned as a deduction falling to be made from the total income of an individual for the year of assessment 1974-75 such sum shall, for each subsequent year of assessment, be deemed to be increased by such percentage sum as is equal to the percentage sum by which the Consumer Price Index has increased during the 12 months period ending on the date to which the Consumer Price Index is calculated next preceding the commencement of the year of assessment.&rdquo;</P>
    <P Just="Right">&mdash;(Deputy Colley.)</P>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>Before we adjourned discussion of this Bill I was proposing amendment No. 7.  As I said at the time, while there may be some objections from a technical point of view to its wording it is clear, on its face, what it seeks to achieve.  What it seeks to achieve is to build into the Finance Bill a provision whereby the various tax allowances and personal allowances provided in the Bill would automatically be adjusted each year so that they would be increased by the same percentage as the percentage increase in the cost of living in the 12 months preceding the beginning of the new tax year.  This has, of course, the effect that what would be done would be merely compensating for an increase in the cost of living the previous year.  I acknowledge freely that is a defect but it is probably about the best we can do in the circumstances because I would imagine that to provide, for instance, that there would be an adjustment, say, every quarter with the consumer price index figure coming out, would prove to be totally impossible of administration for the Revenue Commissioners. I assume that is so, at any <Col N="1947" /> rate, and on that assumption I have proposed this amendment.</P>
      <P>It may well be argued that we, on this side of the House, when we were in Government did not introduce a proposal of this kind and indeed maybe on some occasions might have resisted a suggestion of this kind. However, it is important to realise that the situation now is totally different from any situation we have ever experienced before.  I say that because of the raging inflation from which we are suffering.  I do not know whether it is generally realised that the increase in the cost of living this year between February and May was at an annual rate of 24 per cent.  In other words, if it continued for the year the increase in the cost of living would be 24 per cent.  We have never experienced anything like this before, and consequently whatever arguments may have been made for or against this idea in the past they are totally irrelevant because we are now dealing with a new situation.  In that situation it is clear that without a provision such as is proposed in this amendment increases in allowances provided for in this Bill will be eroded by the time of the next Finance Bill.</P>
      <P>Furthermore, past experience shows that there is a historic tendency in regard to allowances of this kind, and indeed various other kinds of ceilings that are placed on allowances and different things in Finance Bills, to adjust them regularly.  It does not matter what good intention the Minister might have in that regard, there is no guarantee that this will be done.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the circumstances of the present raging inflation it seems to me that equity demands that we should have a provision of this kind in the Bill, but there is more than equity involved though that is the first consideration. The other thing that is involved is that providing built-in adjustment in the allowances in relation to increases in the cost of living one can go some way to ensure that wage earners do not feel a total sense of oppression by the income tax system which they are tending to feel now seeing the rate at which prices are increasing and seeing that the increases announced <Col N="1948" /> in the budget and not yet implemented will, when implemented, be in the view of most taxpayers inadequate to compensate for what has happened.  I have demonstrated on another occasion that they are quite inadequate even to restore the position to what it was under Fianna Fáil in the 1972 budget.</P>
    <P>The special circumstances which I believe make this proposition a very urgent and essential measure are the circumstances in which we have this raging inflation such as we have never before experienced.  This new situation requires a new approach.  I know the acceptance of this amendment would present certain difficulties to the Minister for Finance, but I do not believe that the difficulties would be insuperable.  Certainly I do not believe they would be such as to justify not providing in this way for some degree of equity and some degree of acceptability in our income tax system.</P>
    <P>One of the side effects of accepting this amendment would be, of course, to impose on the Government and on any Government which would be in power a greater degree of discipline than is at present imposed in their budgeting arrangements.  I do not believe that is a bad thing, particularly in the case of the present Government, who have shown themselves in the two budgets they have introduced to be totally undisciplined in their approach to the management of the economic affairs of this State.</P>
    <P>I do not wish to elaborate on that I have elaborated on it in relation to both budgets and I am merely referring to it now to illustrate that the introduction of a certain degree of discipline, which would be consequential on the acceptance of this amendment, would not be a bad thing at all so far as this Government are concerned. Furthermore, I believe, whatever the theoritical view may be, that the practical effect of the adoption of this amendment would not be a loss to the Exchequer but rather a net gain, because I also believe that the fact that taxpayers knew that their income tax allowances would automatically be adjusted in relation to the cost of living would tend very <Col N="1949" /> much to assist in avoiding excessive claims for compensation in the form of wage increases which people make, quite legitimately in my view, where they are in a situation of raging inflation with no guarantee that they can protect themselves against it or catch up with it.  While this would not be the whole answer it would certainly be a step on the road to making it possible to expect reasonably that there would be fair wage claims rather than excessive wage claims, which in turn simply fuel inflation and make the position worse.  It would be a step on the road to combating that problem, which is a major one in the economy.  For all of these reasons I hope the Minister will find it possible to accept this amendment.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Central Bank pointed out that the consumer price index includes elements of taxation because a Government may find it necessary to impose higher taxes on <Col N="1950" /> expenditure for a variety of reasons such as to reduce the budget deficit or to meet the cost of health or social welfare improvements and, therefore, to use the consumer price index is to use at best a very crude weapon for the purpose of adjusting either tax levels, wage or income levels or any other items.  The consumer price index is based on a basket of commodities and services, which is recognised today as being out of date, and as not including a number of commodities and services which are now very much in demand but is including some which ought now to be left out of it.</P>
      <P>Furthermore, one cannot overlook the fact that the consumer price index, as the Central Bank pointed out, is based to some extent on taxes which are imposed for good, social reasons as well as for economic reasons, the social reasons being those which require that income be redistributed from those who can afford something out of their surplus to those who have an insufficiency. Therefore, if that in itself was to be used as a base for adjusting tax allowances it would mean they would continue to be adjusted year in and year out because in the previous year or years adjustments were made in the tax-load so as to effect redistribution. So, every year, the better-off would be compensated because in the previous year they were asked to distribute some of their surplus to the poor.  The following year they would receive an increase which would compensate for what they did, so in fact we would not get the redistribution which should be the social objective of any progressive society.</P>
      <P>Deputy Colley is quite right in recalling that he and his colleagues voted down an amendment proposed from the Fine Gael benches in 1968 which was on a par with what he is proposing today.  At that time the esteemed Minister for Finance, Deputy Haughey, said about the Opposition Deputies, and I quote from the Official Report, Volume 236, column 163 of the 2nd July, 1968:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>They know, as well as I do, that if anything substantial is to be done <Col N="1951" /> with regard to personal allowances, the money will have to be got somewhere else or else services that are provided will have to be cut down...  The Fine Gael Party, however, want it both ways; they demand reductions in taxation and, at the same time, they demand increases in all sorts of services.  If they want a substantial overhaul of the income tax code,...then let them demonstrate to me where I will get the money.</P>
    <P>If those words were valid in 1968 they are valid in 1974.  Inflation is not a rubber you can use to rub out those words.  There is some validity in what Deputy Haughey said then. Those who are seeking to get cuts in taxes ought to say boldly, bravely and consistently where foregone revenue should be obtained.</P>
    <P>I would like to remind the House that, for the first time in the history of this State, this Government, being the first Irish Government to do so, have gone solemnly on record, as we did on the 19th February last, to undertake that the increases in the income tax allowances in this year's budget could mark the first step towards a policy of reviewing the personal allowances regularly and at frequent intervals.  That is what we will do.  We will review the personal allowances regularly and at frequent intervals.  With this object, which we also published, the object of this Government will be to avoid what has happened in the past, namely a substantial depreciation in the value of the allowances in real terms with the inequity caused as a consequence.</P>
    <P>I have indicated that this Government's desire is to produce an indicator for tax purposes but it is not an easy job to produce an indicator which would be a true one and a fair one which will not, because it is unsatisfactory, generate more inequities. We want an indicator which will be as precise as possible, which will not include factors such as taxation, which are in the nature of redistribution, but rather an indicator which will take into account the real depreciation <Col N="1952" /> which may have occurred in the value of money.</P>
    <P>That is not something which is very easily defined.  If, for instance, we were to take the consumer price index as indicator, what would it mean in this year?  It would mean that we would be using an indicator which in itself was a reflection of, say, the increase in oil prices which is taking £110 million out of Irish pockets. That is the reality of the increase in the price of oil, but it is also sending up the consumer price index by 3 per cent.  You do not compensate yourself for the loss of £110 million out of your own pocket by pretending that you can add on 6 per cent to your income to compensate for that.  That is the kind of folly which is being preached by foolish people, that you can solve all financial difficulties by printing money.  You simply cannot do that.  What we need is a true indicator which will exclude items for which we cannot compensate ourselves except by greater effort and greater productivity.  That is the only way in which we can pay for the higher cost of commodities we have to import.  We will not compensate ourselves by simply increasing the flow of money into our pockets, if that money is not based on an increase in productivity.</P>
    <P>To sum up, what I am saying is that I accept in principle the desirability of having indextation which would relate to real decreases or increases in the value of money.  What we have at the moment is not an adequate indicator for that purpose or for the purpose of adjusting wages and incomes generally.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>Did the Minister say he accepts the principle of the indicator in respect of income tax allowances?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I accept the desirability of having an indicator, but it is not easy to get the correct indicator, and it is certainly not the consumer price index as it is at present operated.  The National Economic and Social Research Council has itself now seized on this problem to study what might be an appropriate indicator, but <Col N="1953" /> this is not something which we can solve by the adoption of the suggestion which Deputy Colley made.</P>
      <P>The Government have given a very specific assurance that the income tax allowances will be regularly revised in order to ensure that the value of the allowances are not depreciated. That is the best we can do at the moment.  It is, in itself, a very substantial advance and, indeed, may I say with some humility, a great improvement upon the attitude of the Government in 1968.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad that we have got the Minister at least to accept the principle of this amendment.  It would be difficult for him not to accept it in the light of the inflation which I have referred and which, again I would point out, was, between February and May of this year, running at the equivalent of the annual rate of 24 per cent.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As I understand it, the substance of the case the Minister has made against the amendment is that the consumer price index is not a suitable index for the purpose because, among other things, it includes items related to tax.  That is not an unreasonable case as far as the Minister is concerned, and I would certainly agree with him that the consumer price index is out of date.  However, it is the only index we have got.  If the Minister brings forward proposals to revise the consumer price index we shall certainly give consideration to those proposals.  I myself believe that there is a strong case not only for bringing the consumer price index up to date but also for the production of a separate index which will be based on the requirements of those who are amongst the lower paid or dependent on social welfare.  There is a very <Col N="1954" /> strong case for a special index for them.</P>
    <P>All this, of course, is theoretical. The fact of the matter is that our consumer price index, defective as it is, is the only index we have got.  This is where we come to the practicalities of the matter.  Even if it were not to be the ideal solution, would it not be better to apply the principle, which the Minister accepts, to the existing consumer price index?  When we can produce a better, more efficient and up to date index, the provision can be changed, but in the meantime the argument for this amendment still stands.  That argument was reinforced when the Government found themselves having to make a public commitment to increase income tax allowance in order to assist the climate for acceptance of the National Pay Agreement.  Whatever the theory may be, that episode demonstrated the reality that a stage can be reached, because of inflation, where people will demand that they get adequate compensation in income tax allowances or they will get the benefit in some other way, in their wages.  That, in my view, is a very strong argument for acceptance of this amendment, plus the fact that it is a step on the road to achieving some kind of equity in the appalling situation of inflation in which we are now living.</P>
    <P>Since the Minister accepts the principle of the amendment, I would urge him very strongly to accept also the practical application of it.  If he puts forward proposals for a better index we shall certainly be prepared to consider them and they can be applied when it is available.  In the meantime, let us use the only index we have and apply the principle, which is acceptable in present circumstances to both sides of the House, to the income tax allowances.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnFOConnell" hpid="Dr. O'Connell Dr. O'Connell">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Connell</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 7a:</P>
      <P>Before section 12 to insert a new section as follows:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(1)  In calculating income tax in respect of senior citizens payments made by the Department of Social Welfare shall not be taken into account.</P>
      <P>(2)  For the purposes of this section senior citizen shall mean a person aged 65 years or upwards.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This is something the State should consider doing for our senior citizens who are in receipt of social welfare benefits.  These are usually retirement benefits.  By senior citizens I mean people who are 65 years of age and upwards.  They are mainly the working <Col N="1957" /> class people, the recipients of social welfare benefits.  It would be a gesture by the State to these people if in computing their income tax their social welfare benefits were not taken into account.</P>
    <P>Admittedly, it may be said by the Minister that their social welfare contributions in earlier years were allowed for tax purposes and in granting them tax relief in respect of their social welfare benefits it would be a case of double tax exemption.  I accept that this may be so, but in Britain they have inserted this clause into the Finance Bill and they provided that their senior citizens would not be taxed on their social welfare benefits.</P>
    <P>The amount would not be much because some of these people have nothing else.  Where they have a small pension from their employers it is grossly unfair that the total sum, the social welfare benefit and the pension, are combined for tax purposes. Neither on their own would qualify for income tax.  The people concerned are ordinary working class, social welfare contributors, and to combine the social welfare benefit and the company pension together for tax purposes is a serious injustice to these people.  Because of that I ask for the inclusion of this amendment and I hope the Minister will give it favourable consideration.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I can sympathise with the objectives which Deputy O'Connell has in mind and he is to be complimented for raising the difficulties of the people about whom he is very properly concerned.  However, the way to tackle this is to so amend the tax laws that we exempt from any liability to tax the people who are in the lower income groups.  If we can sufficiently alleviate the people who are in the lower income groups then such people would automatically go out.  There is a particular difficulty if we identify the certain class of people who are exempt because if, for instance, we were to exempt all social welfare pensioners we could have a situation in which social welfare pensioners would be exempt but people with small incomes from some other source would not be exempt.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1958" /> I feel we have a common objective, to relieve these people, and the Deputy knows that there is an additional relief available for elderly pensioners which operates to the advantage of the people he has in mind.  I can assure the Deputy that this is one of our objectives but the particular amendment, in itself, is confined to too small a class.  If we can advance, as we are advancing, along the road towards exempting a large number of people then we will be exempting the people he has in mind.  For instance, of the 60,000 people taken out of the tax bracket under this year's budget several of them would be amongst the pensioners the Deputy is anxious to relieve.  In my view that is the way to go about it.  In that way we do not leave any anomalies or any hardship cases behind.</P>
    <P>If we try to define what particular classes are to be exempt we are bound to leave other people in who would have, not unnaturally, a sense of injustice.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 7b:</P>
      <P>In subsection (1), page 8, line 13, to delete &ldquo;&lsquo;farm land&rsquo;&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>Section 13 is the first section in the chapter which deals with the Minister's proposals to apply the provisions of the Income Tax Acts to the farming community. This represents a very important and significant change in our income tax code and in the situation of the farming community.  They are now moving from a relatively tax free situation into a situation where they are subject to the income tax code.  It is essential, therefore, that we give the greatest possible attention to sections 13 to 28.</P>
      <P>Again, I wish to say that I regret very much that we will have to discuss them in a sort of pressure situation. They represent a fundamental departure. The proposals to bring farmers inside the income tax code is quite a complicated exercise.  The manner in which income tax to be applied to farming deserves the closest possible study by this House.  We will not be able to give that study in the time available to us.</P>
      <P>In this particular item I have endeavoured to direct attention to one aspect of the Minister's proposals which will give rise to a serious problem.  In section 13 (1) the Bill defines farming, farmland and occupation.  It says that these words shall have the same meaning, for the purposes of this Chapter, as they have in section 18, subsection (1) of the Finance Act of 1969.  First of all, I should like to complain about the drafting here.  As Chapter II represents a new set of proposals in regard to taxation of the farming community I think it would have been worth the draftsman's while, and desirable, to give new definitions which would be applicable to this chapter <i>ad initio</i> and not just give definitions in this way by reference back to other Acts.  I think it would have been preferable that farming, farm land and the occupation of farm land would have been freshly defined for the specific purposes of this chapter.  Subsection (1) states that these words shall have the same meaning as they have in subsection (1) of section 18 of the Finance Act of 1969.</P>
      <P>When we go back to subsection (1) of section 18 of the Finance Act of 1969 we find that we have to go back further again because subsection (1) of section 18 defines farming as meaning; farming farm land, that is land in the State, wholly or mainly occupied for the purposes of husbandry, the profits or gains from the occupation of which would, but for the repeal by this Act&mdash;of schedule B of the Income Tax Act of 1967&mdash;be chargeable under that Schedule.  So we find that section 18, subsection (1) of the Finance Act of 1969 brings us back to Schedule B of the Income Tax Act of 1967 if we are to find out the meaning of &ldquo;farming&rdquo; and &ldquo;farm land&rdquo; and &ldquo;occupation&rdquo; for the purpose of the Finance Bill we are discussing.</P>
      <P>The Income Tax Act of 1967 states at subsection (1) of section 30 in regard to Schedule B:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Tax under this Schedule shall be charged in respect of the occupation <Col N="1963" /> of all lands, tenements and hereditaments in the State chargeable to tax under Schedule A, except&mdash;</P>
    <P>(a)  any dwelling-house, or the domestic offices thereunto belonging, unless occupied, by virtue of one and the said demise, together with a farm of lands or with a farm of tithes, for the purpose of farming the same.</P>
    <P>Schedule A is stated in the same Act to cover:</P>
    <P>...the property in all lands, tenements and hereditaments in the State...</P>
    <P>and</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Paragraph I does not apply to lands, tenements and hereditaments the property in which, by virtue of section 53, is charged under Schedule D, Case 1.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>This process of definition brings us right back to Schedule A, as defined in the Income Tax Act of 1967. Schedule A covers all lands, tenements and hereditaments in the State except those excluded by section 53, and section 53 includes mines, quarries and so on but, in effect Schedule A covers all farm land, tenements and hereditaments.</P>
    <P>Schedule B brings things a stage further and results in the definition that we now have for the purposes of this Finance Bill covering any dwelling-house and buildings which are on the land.  The only dwelling-house or domestic offices which are not included are those which are not occupied together with a farm of lands or with a farm of tithes, for the purpose of farming the same. Therefore, the outcome of all this tedious, complicated process of definition, as I interpret it, is that &ldquo;farming&rdquo;, &ldquo;farm land&rdquo; and &ldquo;occupation&rdquo; for the purposes of subsection (1) of section 13 of this Bill include the farm dwelling-house and the farm buildings.</P>
    <P>In other words, the popular conception that, for the purposes of these provisions, it is only the valuation of the farm land itself which is to be taken is not correct and that, in the case of the ordinary farm holding, the valuation with which we will be <Col N="1964" /> concerned will be the total valuation, including the valuation of the dwelling-house and farm buildings as well as the farm land.  I think that is something of very considerable importance and significance.  I think also it is as well, when we are discussing this Bill that we make it perfectly clear, if my interpretation is correct, that what we are dealing with in this Bill&mdash;when we talk about valuation&mdash;is the valuation of the entity, including the valuation of the land, the dwelling-house, and the buildings.  I do not think it requires a great deal of imagination to realise what precisely that involves.</P>
    <P>Valuation in this respect is going to be important at three points.  It is going to be important at the point of £20; £50 and £100.  Anybody in general who has a valuation of over £100 is going to be fully taxed on their farm income; anybody between £50 and £100 valuation is going to be taxed on the profits from their farming in certain circumstances.  And people with a valuation of over £20 but between £20 and £50, or between £20 and £100, will have certain provisions applicable to them.  So these exact points&mdash;£20, £50 and £100&mdash;will be important in deciding whether or not farmers are in or out for certain purposes of these income tax provisions. If the farm dwelling-house and the farm buildings are included in the valuation, it will have a very significant disincentive effect on farm activity. If a farm bears a valuation of say £18, £48 or £98 the definition, in this section will have the very definite effect of preventing that farmer, in any circumstances, improving or adding to any of the buildings on his farm because, if he is anywhere near the limits&mdash;if he is anywhere near £20, £50 or £100&mdash;any improvement or addition that he might make would almost certainly have the effect of bringing him into a new category and making him liable, in two cases, to income tax on profits and affecting the allowances to which he is entitled in another.</P>
    <P>It is a very serious mistake for the purpose of the operation of these provisions to include farm dwellinghouses and farm buildings in the valuation. <Col N="1965" /> The purpose of my two amendments is to bring about a situation where the valuation figure that will be used throughout this chapter will be the valuation of the farm land only.  The valuation of the dwelling house and buildings will be excluded from the valuation to be taken into account for the various purposes of this chapter.  If my amendments are accepted, what will be taken into account will be the valuation of the farm land only.</P>
    <P>I recommend the amendments to the House.  This is a very important matter.  Whatever criticisms we may have regarding these provisions, the inclusion of the farm house and farm buildings in the valuation would undoubtedly have serious repercussions on the development of Irish farming in the future.  It is important that only the valuation of the land be included.</P>

      <P>I wish to make a very strong appeal to the Minister not only to consider sympathetically the amendments put forward by Deputy Haughey but to reconsider the question of the introduction of a taxation system for the farming community having regard to the circumstances prevailing today.</P>
      <P>This is not the time a matter like this should be discussed.  The main objective is to catch the few big speculators who are engaged in other profitable businesses and who shove their profits into land.  Presumably that was the basis on which a case was made for this legislation, but I would appeal to the Minister to consider the gloomy times in prospect for farmers.  It is not the time to discuss new taxation for a new category of persons.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>I appreciate the position of the Chair in trying to confine the discussion in this matter, but it is very difficult when trying to amend sections 13 to 28 to strictly confine one's remarks to any particular section. <Col N="1966" /> Deputy Haughey's amendments seek to ensure that only the valuation of the land will be taken into account. In that regard promises have already been made here.  We know that under the various farm building schemes, buildings of more recent structure are not rateable; they do not carry any onus to pay rates and in other cases they are only partially rated.</P>
      <P>I would ask the Minister to deal with this matter at a more suitable time when we may be in a better frame of mind and, in turn, he will get a more reasoned approach from the farming community.  They are up against it at the moment and, in fact, they have suffered massive losses. They do not know with any certainty when the situation will improve. Would it not be better for the Minister to withdraw the entire group of sections and to come back to the matter at a more suitable time?</P>

      <P>I will deal only with the amendment, not with the general issues raised by Deputy Blaney.  I will deal with them later.  If there was need for clarification or a more precise definition I would accept Deputy Haughey's amendment but it is unnecessary. There cannot be any doubt but that the test is the test of the rateable valuation of the farm land. Farm land does not include buildings. The amendments, therefore, are unnecessary.</P>
      <P>The Deputy has referred to section 13 which says that &ldquo;farm land&rdquo; has the same meaning as in section 18 of the Finance Act, 1969.  That defines &ldquo;farming&rdquo; as:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>farming farm land, that is, land in <Col N="1967" /> the State wholly or mainly occupied for the purposes of husbandry, the profits or gains from the occupation of which would, but for the repeal by this Act of Schedule B of the Income Tax Act, 1967, be chargeable under that Schedule:</P>
    <P>If you go to that Schedule you find it refers to more than land.  It also refers to tenancies and hereditaments.  We are dealing only with farm land, not with anything else, and there is no doubt but that this legislation can relate only to farm land and not to buildings.  It is, of course, land that is occupied for the purposes of husbandry.</P>
    <P>If there was any doubt about it I would be only too glad to have a look at Deputy Haughey's amendments, but it is a very good rule of parliamentary draftsmanship never to put anything into a Bill which is unnecessary and, as there cannot be any doubt but that the valuation is one related to farm land, I believe it is better to leave the situation as it is.  If any area of doubt arises in the administration of this Bill I will be the first to admit that Deputy Haughey was right and I will be only too ready to bring in an amendment on some future occasion to clarify it if there is anybody so foolish as to put a construction on this which would include buildings.  But, as drafted, I am satisfied that it relates only to farm land and I am strengthened in this belief by the fact that the parliamentary draftsman's office is of precisely the same opinion.  We are dealing with farm land only and accordingly the amendment is superfluous.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>I would ask the Minister if only <i>ex abundanti cautela</i> to accept my amendments but there is much more to it than that.  Certainly I am putting forward these amendments to endeavour to clarify the situation, but I think I can show that as the section is drafted at the moment farm land, for the purposes of chapter <Col N="1968" /> 2, will include not just farm buildings but the dwelling house as well.  I propose to endeavour to do that.  In any event if some very fine interpretation can be put on the wording which would indicate that I am not correct in my interpretation I still think my amendments could well be accepted if for no better reason than simply to clarify the situation but I think they are necessary.  I will go over the different steps in the definition again as I see it.</P>
      <P>I think the Minister does not disagree that section 13 relies entirely on section 18 (1) of the Finance Act, 1969.  Subsection (1) states quite clearly that &ldquo;farming&rdquo; and &ldquo;farm land&rdquo; are to have the same meaning as they have in section 18 (1) of the Finance Act, 1969.  Subsection (1) of section 18 of the Finance Act, 1969 reads as follows:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Farming&rdquo; means farming farm land, that is land in the State wholly or mainly occupied for the purposes of husbandry, the profits or gains from the occupation of which would but for the repeal by this Act of Schedule B of the Income Tax Act, 1967, be chargeable under that Schedule;</P>
      <P>What we are concerned with here are lands which, had it not been repealed by the 1969 Act, would have been chargeable under Schedule B of the Income Tax Act, 1967.  It is quite clear that Schedule B of the Income Tax Act, 1967, applies to land and to all dwelling houses and buildings and offices which are occupied together with a farm of land for the purpose of farming the same.  I do not see how the Minister can argue that the definition of farm land which in the old days was chargeable under Schedule B was not transferred to section 18 of the Finance Act, 1969, and from there transferred into subsection (1) of section 13 of this Bill for the purposes of Chapter 2.  This chain seems to me to be unbreakable.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If the Minister wishes I will go over it again.  Subsection (1) of section 30 of the Income Tax Act, 1967, defines farm land and it defines it as including dwelling houses and offices which are <Col N="1969" /> occupied with a farm for the purposes of farming the same.  That definition is brought into section 18 of the Finance Act, 1969, and from there it is brought into section 13 (1) of this Finance Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JosephMSheridan" hpid="Mr. Sheridan Mr. Sheridan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sheridan</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with Deputy Blaney that the farmers are not in any mood for new taxation at the moment.  I wish the Minister to know that valuation, either land valuation or building valuation, is no indication of whether a farmer is down and out or whether he is going well.  Deputy Haughey stated that buildings, offices and dwelling houses on lands will be taxable.  Let us consider the old estates, of which there are plenty in the part of the country in which I live.  Such an estate may have been taken over by the Land Commission. Some unfortunate person has been put into a holding on that estate which contains the old buildings and out offices.  This person has a valuation of, say, £90 for land and perhaps £50 for buildings.</P>
      <P>It is not bad enough that the local authority or the county council can come along and say &ldquo;we will charge you £6 in the £ valuation on buildings&rdquo; when the buildings are good ones but it is much worse when it is a small farmer and he has only a few small out-buildings.  There will be an absolute revolution in relation to this. The farmers were never more up in arms than they are at the present time.  I appeal to the Minister to give an undertaking to the House that this amendment of Deputy Haughey's will be accepted.  I would like to take the Minister for a walk some day and show him the type of building I am talking about.  They are an absolute burden on the people who own them. They are not compatible with what we call modern buildings.  I am very glad to support this amendment and I hope it will be accepted.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>It does not include them because the draft is based on the 1969 Act.  That Act exempted only farming from farm land.  The 1969 exemption is being removed.  It was based on farming and farm land.  I do not want to argue too long about semantics.  This is something I will certainly take a look at between now and the Report Stage.  If the clarification is needed I will consider putting it in but I do not believe it is.  There is no construction that could be put on this except that the rateable valuation test is in relation to farm land.  If anybody put any other test on it it would be condemned by the High Court. There is no doubt at all about that. Whatever about a layman's reading of it any legal reading of it relates only to farm land.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>I know I am right about this.  I know as this piece of legislation that is before us is framed in the way in which it is it undoubtedly includes within the ambit of this Finance Bill for the purposes of the taxation of farmers the dwellinghouse and the farm lands of the farm in so far as they are occupied for the purposes of farming that farm.  The Minister spoke about an exemption.  We are not talking about an exemption but about definitions.  There are three definitions involved, Schedule B, as defined in the 1967 Income Tax Act, farming and farm land as defined for the purposes of section 18 of the Finance Act, 1969 and the definition here.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>They all add up to one simple fact that, arising out of Schedule B of the Income Tax Act, 1967, they specifically <Col N="1971" /> include dwellinghouses and offices which are occupied for the purposes of farming a farm.  I am so convinced about this that I feel the Minister should accept these amendments now to put the matter beyond any doubt. If I could have his assurance a little bit more specifically I would be prepared to withdraw my amendments.  He has not brought forward anything to defeat my argument on the definitions but I am prepared to accept the situation if he is prepared to give me a categoric assurance that if there is any doubt whatsoever in the interpretation of these definitions, as to whether farm buildings are included or not, he will put in a specific definition which will make it absolutely clear that farm buildings are not included.</P>

      <P>I do not intend to say very much as Deputy Haughey has accepted the Minister's assurance but like Deputy Sheridan I want to assure the Minister there would be a revolution down the country if it was thought that farm buildings were included.  Like Deputy Sheridan I object to valuation altogether.  I put my case during the Second Reading of this Bill and I am not going back on it. I listened very carefully to Deputy Haughey when he quoted the different Acts and their relevant sections.  It seems to me, from what he quoted, that there is a grave danger that it may be found in a court case that buildings are included.  Apart from the big buildings Deputy Sheridan referred <Col N="1972" /> to, which are dotted all over the country, you have the man who, as Deputy Haughey says, has a very bad house.  He could not do anything with his house because he would immediately go into the classes for taxation. The inclusion of buildings would make the thing look ridiculous.  If Deputy Haughey is satisfied with the Minister's assurance I am satisfied but from what I have heard when Deputy Haughey quoted the relevant sections in the various Acts I would be very wary about it.  We should not let it go forward from this debate that there could be any misinterpretation on the question of buildings being included.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesMGibbons" hpid="Mr. J. Gibbons Mr. J. Gibbons">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Gibbons</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to say, especially in the light of what we heard going on this morning about the Minister's assurances, that I would have the gravest apprehension in accepting his assurance that Deputy Haughey's amendment is unnecessary. The matter could be very simply dealt with by accepting the amendment. The question is&mdash;the Minister has not clarified it at all&mdash;whether in the assessment of valuation, which of itself as a basis for the implementation of an income tax is totally wrong because it is not, in fact, an income tax at all, it is more related to a notional valuation, are all farm buildings included or are they not? The Minister intimated they are not. Will the final interpretation of this Bill rest with the Minister?  Surely the final interpretation, when it becomes law, will not rest with the Minister but with the Revenue Commissioners?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As Deputy Blaney has just said, this Bill is being given to the Revenue Commissioners to batter the farming community who were never in the history of this State harder pressed than at present.  It is typical of the cynicism of the National Coalition Government, who do not have a single farmer in their ranks&mdash;practically all of them are Dublin city-based and hostile to farmers generally&mdash;that they would come forward with a measure to tax farmers as well as load them with ever-increasing rates. There is no reasonable farmer who would object to reasonable taxation, no farmer who would protest that <Col N="1973" /> everyone must be taxed except farmers.  That would be an untenable position which nobody would attempt to defend.  However, the imposition of double tax is plainly unjust, and it is being implemented now on the very people that the National Coalition deceived so cynically 18 months ago with their talk about the reliefs they were going to give in estate duty.  This is the answer of the National Coalition.</P>
    <P>It was suggested in this debate that farmers have never been taxed before. This is the greatest nonsense.  This is the type of thing that is peddled by the Minister and his party and the jackals that follow them from the Labour Party.  Farming has been very cruelly taxed, as the House knows through the medium of rates.</P>

      <P>On a point of order. We are dealing with an amendment by Deputy Haughey.  If there is to be a general debate at this stage as to whether or not farming profits should be brought into the tax net, I want to join it.  It is unfair that some people should be asked to play the game according to Standing Orders while other people disregard them.  I would suggest that we would stick to this amendment and when we deal with that, then get on to the general debate.</P>

I personally am not prepared to accept the Minister's word after his exhibition here this morning and after these exposures by Deputy Colley and Deputy O'Malley.  Therefore, I suggest that the Minister's best course <Col N="1974" /> would be to accept the amendment without any nonsense.  This section 30 as it is in the Bill is, in my eyes, as a layman, a deliberate attempt to obfuscate the definition in order to provide the chance at a later date for its interpretation in another way. Therefore, if the Minister is sincere in what he says let him accept the amendment.</P>

      <P>I do not wish to be unnecessarily offensive, but, like Deputy Gibbons&mdash;and I gave notice of this this morning&mdash;I cannot accept an assurance from the Minister, as I said at that time, without looking a little more closely at it and what is behind it.  Therefore, I would wish to hear the Minister refute in some detail the arguments put forward by Deputy Haughey.  If he would take them step by step and explain to us why the arguments made by Deputy Haughey are incorrect, I would feel happier about the situation and about any assurance he gives.  It does seem to me that what the Minister has done is to give an assurance based on another section of another Act than that relied on by Deputy Haughey. I would be happier if the Minister would deal in a little more detail with the actual arguments put forward by Deputy Haughey and show us where they are wrong.</P>

      <P>It is very difficult to know just what you can do to enlighten the Opposition benches.  I repeat exactly what I have said already: I cannot go any further.  It is plain English; it is straightforward language, and it cannot be further explained no matter how often I repeat it.  At the end of that I expect once again to be subjected to the vituperative abuse which went on for about three hours this morning.  But I suppose this is an example of what every reformer can expect at the hands of those who are opposed to reform.</P>

      <P>So be it.  I can either stand up and exchange similar unpleasantries or turn the other cheek.  I will turn the other cheek, <Col N="1975" /> and if that exasperates the Opposition they may remain exasperated.  I have no intention of engaging in the kind of accusations that were made against me this morning, of lying, of breaking my word, of engaging in misleading conduct, of breaking assurances. These are things which are not said by people who have any regard for proper Parliamentary procedures, and which are totally contrary to the facts as seen by any fairminded person. That is why they may indulge in that reprehensible activity if they wish, but they will not find me ready to respond to them.</P>
      <P>May I return to the relevant amendment tabled by Deputy Haughey, who, I accept, had a problem in understanding the section, and many reasonable people might have. I would point out that the root of the definition we have here is that which is contained in the 1969 Act.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>The 1969 Act, if my memory serves correctly, was Deputy Haughey's Act.  This defines farming as &ldquo;farming farm land&rdquo;.  That is the 1969 root definition which we take. It is not going beyond that into anything else which was in Schedule B. The 1969 Act also referred to Schedule B, but it took out of Schedule B only that one piece which referred to the farming of farm land. That is exactly what we are doing.  We are not taking anything else out.  There are other things in Schedule B as there were in 1969.  I have given a categorical assurance.  Deputy Haughey seemed prepared to accept it; others engaging in a game of casting personal aspersions on me were not prepared to accept it.  So be it.  If the assurance is not accepted then the matter will now have to go to a vote.  However, as things stand at the moment I am satisfied that this Bill here has the same validity as the 1969 Act which has never been used to suggest that buildings were involved.  Buildings cannot now be involved, but I shall have this matter studied in whatever time is left for careful consideration of it, and if there has been a misreading&mdash;and <Col N="1976" /> people will now have the benefit of this debate to consider whether there is a misreading or misinterpretation which could arise&mdash; then I shall certainly offer an amendment for the Report Stage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>Is it not true that, regardless of what any Minister may say in respect of any piece of legislation going through this House it is what is interpreted by the courts ultimately that really stands?  This is not casting aspersions in any way on the Minister as to whether he is giving an assurance in good faith or not.</P>
      <P>It has been expressed clearly and unequivocally by the courts in various cases over the years that what a Minister or any contributor in this House, by way of explanation or otherwise, from front bench or back bench, has said and is on record as saying has no significance whatsoever and does not stand up in the ultimate judgment by the courts as to the interpretation of the words used.  Their judgment is based on the words used in the Act, not on the intention or the spirit in which the legislation was introduced and debated and ultimately passed.</P>
      <P>The Minister should keep in mind that any assurance, no matter how well meant, no matter in what spirit it is given, is not worth the paper on which it is recorded.  The right spirit or the right outlook or the right wish is not enough.  The Minister should just not hope to ensure but should undertake to ensure, if we are to discuss this further here this evening, that his interpretation is in fact the proper, legal interpretation of what is in section 13 and that it is not just what he hopes or thinks or wishes it to be.  During that time there must be available to him sufficient know-how and expertise to consult, even at this stage, even at short notice, to give him that assurance so that he can in turn assure us, if it is a fact, and inform the House that that assurance comes from an even closer scrutiny than undoubtedly the proposed legislation would have got in the normal course of events.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Let us not cod ourselves that what the Minister wishes or the spirit in <Col N="1977" /> which he presents any piece of legislation counts in the slightest when it comes to interpretation by the courts. The courts, perhaps jealously guarding their own autonomy, lean the other way more often than not, just to show that they are, as they are entitled to be, above being directed by this House.  They are there to do a job.  It is their job and when they come to do it they lean rather against what a Minister may have said by way of explanation of the spirit that prompted him to introduce the legislation and they will interpret strictly on the basis of the wording used in the legislation.</P>
    <P>From what I have listened to both from the Minister and from Deputy Haughey and others and the references to the 1969 Act and the 1967 Act and Schedule B, I would be inclined to the view that Deputy Haughey's interpretation is the more reasonable and more likely interpretation and the one which would be held and upheld if the matter went to the court <i>via</i> the Revenue people or in any other way.  In that context I would ask the Minister not to forget the appeal I made to him earlier in this connection. It may have been out of order then but it may be more in order as we proceed.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>In order that we may proceed, I would suggest to my colleagues that we accept the Minister's assurance.  I understand now that he is saying to me that he is giving a categorical assurance that if on examination with his advisers between now and whatever time we have left it appears to him that this is open to any interpretation other than the one which he intends it to have he will bring in an amendment on Report Stage.  I think we can accept that categorical assurance from the Minister but when he and his advisers are considering this matter I would ask them to keep this following point in mind.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The definition in this Bill is governed by what is set out in subsection (1) of section 18 of the Finance Act, 1969.  It seems to me absolutely clear &mdash;and this is the point I want kept <Col N="1978" /> in mind in this examination&mdash;that in subsection (1) of section 18 of the 1969 Act farm land is farm land which would have been chargeable under Schedule B&mdash;it is as simple as that&mdash; farm land means farm land which, had Schedule B not been abolished in 1969 would have been chargeable under the provisions of Schedule B of the Income Tax Act of 1967 and Schedule B clearly and specifically included lands, buildings and out-offices. That is the only point I want the Minister to keep in mind in this re-examination of the matter which he has promised us.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Crinion</NameTxt>
      <P>There is one aspect I would like the Minister to look at. For the purposes of every other Department it is always taken as farm land and buildings and the Revenue Commissioners could take their interpretation of the section when it is enacted and could say that all other Departments of Government take in farm land and farm buildings in assessing the full valuation of a farm.  Therefore specific mention should be made that farm buildings are exempt.  It is very easy for a civil servant to quote what is done in other Departments and the precedent set in other Departments. Therefore there should be specific mention in the Bill.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Section 14 repeals section 18 (2) (a) of the Finance Act, 1969 which exempted farming profits from income tax.  The repeal of the section prepares the way for the scheme to tax farming profits which is set out in succeeding sections. Section 18 (2) of the Finance Act of 1969 provided that profits or gains arising (a) from farming, or (b) to the <Col N="1980" /> owner of a stallion from the sale of services of mares by a stallion or to the part-owner of a stallion from the sale of such services or of rights to such services, or (c) from the occupation of woodlands managed on a commercial basis and with a view to the realisation of profits.</P>
      <P>The repeal of (a) means that farming profits no longer attract a general exemption from tax although profits from farms of less than £100 valuation are not being brought into charge by virtue of section 15 (3).</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Gibbons Mr. Gibbons">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gibbons</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to ask the Minister on what basis this very cryptic section is included in the Bill. On what basis did the Government, and the Minister, come to the conclusion that while beef farmers, dairy farmers and other farmers, get the full belt of rates on their lands and income tax, one fortunate class should be exempt from this, the stud farmer? I do not think it is necessary to say that people engaged in this particular trade very commonly come from the more wealthy sections of the farming community.  It strikes me as extraordinary that the Minister, and presumably his Government, especially the Taoiseach who has many friends among this particular class, should include in the Bill a provision that all farmers will be subjected to a full belt of income tax as well as rates in their lands while this privileged class, and this privileged class alone, are exempt from it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should like to hear the Minister's justification for this particular action. It has been said that the breeding of bloodstock is a notoriously uncertain game.  What could be more uncertain than ordinary livestock or tillage farming under the management of the present outfit, the National Coalition, who have not a single man for the land in their whole number?  There is only one rural Deputy sitting behind the Minister at present.  The Minister should tell us why the nobility, who are commonly associated with the breeding of bloodstock, are to be treated in this special, favoured way. Is it for the same reason that the Taoiseach, when he was nominating <Col N="1981" /> his eleven to the Seanad, felt obliged to bring some of them in?</P>

The ordinary working farmers&mdash;the acting chairman and I represent them in Carlow-Kilkenny&mdash;will get the double belt, the belt of income tax and rates increasing all the time.  It is probable that in due time the acting chairman will go in and vote for this measure.</P>

      <P>The only people exempt from tax are people who generate profits from farming, from the construction of works of art or who are engaged in the manufacture of goods for export.  We said we considered it proper that people should pay tax in accordance with their capacity to pay and that people with comparable incomes should pay comparable amounts of tax.  That is the cardinal principle upon which we stand.  I have said, and I say it again because it bears repetition, that Ireland has one of the most unjust tax codes in Europe because we have failed to apply the principle that people with comparable incomes should pay comparable amounts of tax.</P>
      <P>One of the reasons why reform did not take place before this was because Ministers baulked at such reform. They anticipated an onslaught against them if they had the courage to make the change.  We see a living example of it today and, no doubt, it will be with us until the end of the debate on this Finance Bill.  The truth is bad teeth have to be extracted and, even if it is uncomfortable for some people, at the end of it the body politic and the social and economic body will be a great deal healthier.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I want to reassure Deputy Sheridan that stud farms with valuations of over £100 are not being exempted. <Col N="1984" /> The farm will be brought into charge in the same way as any other charge. It is only the stud fees earned which will continue to enjoy exemption.  I am sure Deputy Haughey will explain to Deputy Sheridan the reason why it is desirable to have such exemption. It is because the stud industry is an international industry and many of the animals at stud here are owned by people outside the country, by international syndicates, which could switch animals around with perfect ease to various tax havens.  The main pressure for special treatment for stud fees earned in the bloodstock industry came not from the people who were chastised by Deputy Gibbons but from the owners of brood mares, the small people, and from the large number of people getting very good employment in the bloodstock industry.  These are the people who asked that their employment should not be jeopardised as, indeed, it would be if the animals could be airlifted from here to France, Japan or anywhere else.  The owners could do that by lifting a telephone. That is the only reason for the exemption.</P>
    <P>I do not suppose it will be accepted by the Deputies opposite or, even if they accept it, I do not suppose they will remain silent.  They are bound to have their little bit of fun at the expense of the Government.  So be it. There is no reason why we should not proceed with the overall reform of the tax system.  Another reason for ending exemption on farming profits was because such exemption gave a spur to tax evasion and tax avoidance of a very substantial nature.  It was becoming more and more widespread and many people involved in the farming industry, genuine farmers, were becoming very fearful of the way in which people with no serious relationship with farming were buying up farms in order to set off profits made elsewhere against their farming profits, thereby avoiding paying their fair share of tax on their non-farming activities.  There were several avoidance practices injurious to the genuine farmers.  It is very significant that all the farming organisations which came <Col N="1985" /> to see me, and I have seen innumerable organisations, thanked us for taking the steps necessary to stop these practices which were so injurious to the genuine farmers.</P>
    <P>If, in this year, farmers make a loss, the loss Deputies are suggesting they may make, and some farmers will make losses this year, they should realise that we are doing them a favour by introducing the taxation of farming profits in this year because one does not pay income tax if one makes a loss.  By bringing in the liability this year they will be able to use the losses generated this year to set off against gains in future years. Far from crying about the change, if this year turns out to be a loss-making year, from the farmers' point of view it could not be a better time to introduce a tax.</P>

      <P>If we were to postpone the introduction of farm taxation, as has been suggested, we would be doing farmers a disservice because, if they made a profit in 1975, they would not be able to use against that profit any losses they may make this year.  You cannot use losses to set off against gains until the liability exists. I suggest to Deputies, including Deputy Sheridan, that they might carry that piece of good news to people who may be anxious, naturally about the losses they are making this year and, if they are not prepared to accept it from me, then let them go and consult their accountants.</P>

    <P>Debate resumed on the following motion:</P>
    <P>That the amendments and additions to the Standing Orders of the Dáil relative to Public Business recommended in the Report of the Committee on Procedure and Privileges on Reform of Dáil Procedure (T.235) dated 31st January, 1974 be adopted with effect from the first day on which the Dáil sits subsequent to the adjournment for the Summer Recess.&rdquo;</P>
    <P Just="Right">&mdash;(Parliamentary Secretary to the Taoiseach).</P>
    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. B. Desmond Mr. B. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>A new standing Order should be introduced to set up a new Joint All-Party Standing Committee of the Oireachtas to review the role of State-sponsored bodies in the Irish economy.  State-sponsored bodies play a vital role in our national life and economic development.  Dáil Éireann established these bodies and allotted clearly defined functions to them.  Despite this, the extent to which the Dáil subjects the activities of these bodies to public scrutiny is extremely restricted.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>By and large, Ministers take advantage of the present ambiguity as to the role of these bodies by maintaining that they are not wholly responsible for the various policy decisions of these bodies.  If Dáil Éireann is to play any real role in the planned development and efficiency of our State-sponsored bodies, it is vital that we should have a joint All-Party <Col N="1988" /> Standing Committee of the Oireachtas to undertake this work.</P>
    <P>In the future we will see the further establishment of such bodies in the fields of energy and the environment. The field of natural resources is an obvious area for the extension of State-sponsored activities.  If we are to bring this about there will have to be a major joint Standing Committee of the Oireachtas to propose this development and ensure that these bodies contribute towards full employment and full economic development of the country.</P>
    <P>Five or six years ago the Labour Party proposed in the Dáil that a permanent Dáil committee, representative of all parties, should be created for the purpose of examining and reporting on the activities of these bodies.  It is time the House established such a permanent Standing Committee and I urge that we give consideration to it.  It is not enough that we should have established such bodies in areas of power, transport, export promotion and tourism.  These bodies account for very substantial employment and a major share of the public capital programme.  Yet we have nothing in the Dáil which would be the equivalent to the House of Commons Select Committee on Nationalised Industry which was set up in 1955 and expanded in 1967.  For that reason I am disappointed that the Committee on Procedure and Privileges did not forward Standing Orders for the provision of such committees in specific areas of Government policy.  Naturally there was no great pressure on the committee to do so.</P>
    <P>I am pleased to note that in recent months serious consideration was given by the Minister for the Public Service to these approaches.  We hope to see, certainly in the lifetime of this Dáil, the Opposition and the Government agree to the setting up of a joint committee to deal with State-sponsored bodies.  As Opposition Members know, informal discussions have taken place on this matter between the Opposition and the Government. At that level the matter is now developing.  I am hopeful that a very <Col N="1989" /> firm Government proposal on the structure and functions of such committees will emerge in the near future.</P>
    <P>I am pleased to note the proposed amendment to Standing Orders which provides for Ministerial statements.  I welcome this innovation.  There was always an appalling inhibition on any Minister that if he stood up in the Dáil to make a statement only one Deputy would need to object and automatically the statement could not be made.  That, of course, was quite ridiculous.  Now a Minister can, as of right, stand up in the Dáil and make a statement on a matter of urgent public importance and nobody can challenge him.  We have a general understanding and agreement that there will be provision for the shadow spokesman to answer.  This will update the procedures of the Dáil which, in relation to Ministerial statements, have been found to be entirely inadequate.</P>
    <P>I should hope that Ministers and Parliamentary Secretaries will avail of the opportunity to make important statements of policy or to convey Government decisions direct to the Dáil when it is in session, and, of course, giving the Opposition an opportunity to reply.  They can then get rid of the criticism which was made from time to time that Government Ministers of all parties made major pronouncements outside the House.  I think this is a useful change in Standing Orders and I welcome the change contained in this report.</P>
    <P>I would suggest that we also need another form of Standing Order.  I know it has been mooted by many people, notably by the current Attorney-General when he was in opposition&mdash;that there should be a Standing Order making provision for a list system of speakers.  I favour this and have seen it in many of the Western European Parliaments.  I think it would be a useful innovation to streamline procedure in the Dáil.  This system has been in operation for many years now in the Council of Europe whereby the names of those who desire to take part in Dáil debates&mdash;excluding, say, Committee discussions such as we have just had on the Finance Bill&mdash;on perhaps the Second Stage of <Col N="1990" /> a Bill or on an Estimate debate would table their names to the Speaker of the House, the Ceann Comhairle, and this would help Deputies enormously in knowing when they would be likely to be called upon to speak.  It would obviate those very ridiculous occasions when there are half a dozen Deputies queueing up waiting to speak; waiting to catch the eye of the Ceann Comhairle.  It would also get rid of some pre-occupation which some Deputies seem to have about making contributions.  Had we a list system of speakers, it would mean that no Deputy would be denied the opportunity of speaking.  It would mean that Deputies would be able to prepare their contributions in a considered manner knowing at a given time, when they would be most likely to be called upon to speak rather than queueing up for hours on end in the Dáil chamber, not being quite sure if in fact they are going to be given an opportunity of speaking at all.  Unfortunately, this recommendation was not contained in the amended Standing Orders.  Of course, it should apply only to Second Stage speeches and to Estimates debates.  I think it is a waste of any Deputy's time and certainly not conducive to his concentration, that he should have to wait for hours upon end to catch the eye of the Ceann Comhairle in order to speak.  Surely Irish parliamentarians are mature enough not to emulate this kind of schoolboy/teacher relationship.</P>
    <P>Another provision which I would welcome in terms of amendment of the Standing Orders which is not contained in this report but which I feel should be included is, of course, a substantial change in the daily time table of Dáil Éireann, which I consider to be utterly outmoded.  As we now know, the Dáil meets from 3 p.m. until 10.30 p.m. on Tuesdays and Wednesdays and from 10.30 a.m. to 5 p.m. on Thursday, while the practice of adjournment debates up to 11 o'clock on Tuesday and Wednesday evenings and 5.30 p.m. on Thursdays has continued to grow. In my opinion these hours should be amended, by a Standing Order, to 2.30 p.m. to 10 p.m. on Tuesday; from 10 a.m. to 5.30 p.m. on Wednesday and from 10 a.m. to 5 p.m. on Thursday <Col N="1991" /> with the additional half hour being available each day for an adjournment debate.  Those hours&mdash;with provision for one late evening only in the week&mdash; I would suggest would be more conducive to, first of all, a higher standard of parliamentary performance and a higher standard of public debate.</P>
    <P>It would also, in my opinion, ensure far better coverage by the outside media, particularly by newspapers and television, which tend to go to press earlier than the closing of the Dáil on the late evenings that we sit.  It would enable half of the Deputies of this House to return home to their constituents and families at least on the Wednesday evening and I have no doubt it would prove &mdash;which I think is not a small consideration, seeing that we are supposed to be sympathetic to trade union aspirations&mdash;more suitable to the staff of both Houses of the Oireachtas.  For these reasons I would urge that the House should amend Standing Orders to provide for sitting hours as I have already outlined.  It would not interfere with the normal Cabinet meetings on Tuesday and Friday mornings but would rationalise the situation.</P>
    <P>Certainly I would hope&mdash;and here I would disagree completely with Deputy O'Malley&mdash;that those Deputies who are pre-occupied with their other business and professional employments would give some consideration to the reform of the ossified hours of work of Dáil Éireann.  The suggested change in timetable I have outlined would not extend the total number of hours working each week of Dáil Éireann but would mean that we would have a more effective Parliament.  I think it ridiculous that, for example, we are now discussing a Finance Bill, a discussion which may well extend into the small hours of the morning.  It is preposterous to suggest that Deputies can be at their best at 9, 10, 11, or 12 o'clock midnight arguing the small print of parliamentary business when we could have a much more effective system of working hours in Dáil Éireann.  I have no time for those Deputies who are more worried about <Col N="1992" /> the law courts than being in Dáil Éireann, or who are more worried about attending to their businesses. They are paid to be in Dáil Éireann when the House is sitting and I think that consideration should be paramount in the overall position.</P>
    <P>I want to deal briefly with a few other points.  I do not want to delay the House unduly.  I dealt with the question of Dáil recesses.  I consider them to be completely outmoded and a throw-back to nineteenth century tempo of government when the Houses adjourned for lengthy Christmas and Summer holiday periods.</P>
    <P>I would suggest that there should be a couple of other amendments to Standing Orders.  I feel we should have taken our courage in our hands on this occasion and made a specific provision for the introduction of radio and television into Dáil Éireann. Each evening when the Dáil is sitting I think there should be a screening on radio and television by means of &ldquo;Today in the Dáil&rdquo;.  It is ridiculous that we should ignore this vitally important system of communication. The technical difficulties are not insurmountable, and indeed I might point out that there have been very few complaints of partiality in relation to the news programmes emanating in relation to Dáil Éireann on RTE and the objectivity of presenters is generally respected even if they have to do it at second hand.  I do not think the problems of editing a taped radio programme and video taped television programme are insurmountable.</P>
    <P>In this regard, I regret that the current Committee on Procedure and Privileges is hostile to the idea.  I am confident that in the years ahead the viewpoint I have expressed will come to be accepted; we will not become excessively Americanised or anything like that in the coverage of proceedings in the Dáil by way of direct television and radio.  It is ridiculous that Deputies should have such conservative reaction to this proposition. While I know that many Deputies may feel that some of their number might be tempted to speak just for the benefit of the cameras, <Col N="1993" /> I would suggest that Deputies are mature enough; and get used to that aspect of their work quite quickly. I am sure that this futile distaste which many Deputies have for a common-sense communications reform will be overcome and the innovation brought in.</P>
    <P>The Standing Orders of Dáil Éireann should make specific provision for minimum standards of accommodation and secretarial assistance for Deputies.  It is not enough that Deputies should be dependent on the goodwill of the Committee on Procedure and Privileges.  Elected parliamentarians should be entitled by virtue of Standing Orders to minimum standards of accommodation and secretarial facilities in the House. The standard of accommodation should be sufficient to enable Deputies to perform their parliamentary duties, to meet constituents and deputations and to deal with correspondence.  By western European standards, the accommodation is absolutely abysmal.</P>
    <P>I have little sympathy for those Deputies who have tolerated such a dreadful state of affairs for decades. They deserve what they get; Fianna Fáil never made an effort to improve the situation and they richly deserve the discomfort and lack of facilities they now suffer in Opposition.  However, that is no excuse.  The facilities for Deputies are among the worst in Europe and there should be provision in Standing Orders for better facilities.</P>
    <P>Standing Orders should include references in connection with allowances for Deputies, income tax and pension provisions and similar matters. They are enshrined by regulation but I think they could more effectively be included in Standing Orders.  Here I might add that the Minister for Finance has done excellent work in this matter in the last 15 months and he deserves the thanks of the House.</P>
    <P>Unless the Government and Opposition implement the rather conventional reforms I have mentioned, the electorate will have increasing recourse to outside community pressure groups.  I put to the House the question: do we want to find that we have <Col N="1994" /> the same kind of irrelevance as a parliament as Stormont?  There is need to arouse a more concerned public opinion and we must ensure we have a more responsive parliamentary system.</P>
    <P>I would ask the three party leaders to take a continuing initiative in the area of Parliamentary democracy. Deputy Cosgrave, Deputy Lynch and Deputy Corish have spent almost half of their lifetimes in Dáil Éireann but apart from an occasional foray in relation to Parliamentary reform very little has been done with the problem.  It is only now that we are tending to come to grips with the matter.</P>
    <P>I would ask the three party leaders to treat seriously the suggestion of Deputy O'Malley for the establishment of a more broadly based committee. We should have an ongoing continuing committee and we should ensure that the Standing Orders of Dáil Éireann are but the beginning of the reform of Parliamentary procedures. The Government and the House can be sure of the full support of the Labour Party in this matter.</P>
    <P>Much passion has been expended in the Dáil and outside it about the need to defend and preserve the institutions of the State.  If we are not careful the Oireachtas may ossify into a permanent state of preservation unless we reform the system as rapidly and democratically as possible.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Education (Mr. R. Burke)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move:</P>
      <P>That a supplementary sum not exceeding £10 be granted to defray the charge which will come in course of payment during the period commencing on the 1st day of April, 1974, and ending on the 31st day of December, 1974, for the salaries and expenses of the Office of the Minister for Education (including Institutions of Science and Art), for certain miscellaneous educational and cultural services and for payment of sundry grants-in-aid.</P>
      <P>The proposals for which the Supplementary Estimate is being introduced are non-controversial and will not, I expect, lead to a lengthy discussion. Dáil Éireann is not being asked to vote additional funds in respect of these proposals.  There are three subheads involved as follows: (i) National Library, Subhead E.4&mdash; Development Schemes&mdash;£10,000; (ii) National Museum, Subhead F.4&mdash; Development schemes&mdash;£10,000, (iii) Subhead B.10&mdash;European Institute, Florence&mdash;£10.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It was considered necessary to open the two new subheads E.4 and F.4 as it was felt that it would not be appropriate to make payments from the existing subheads E.1 and F.1 for the charges to arise in respect of certain new developments now proposed. <Col N="1996" /> The existing subheads relate to specific purposes&mdash;&ldquo;Purchase of Books <i>et cetera</i>&rdquo; in the case of the National Library and &ldquo;Purchase of Specimens&rdquo; in the case of the National Museum and, furthermore, the subheads are designated as Grants-in-Aid. The original provision made in each of these subheads is, accordingly, being reduced by £10,000, so that the opening of the new subheads E.4 and F.4 represents no additional charge on the Vote.</P>
    <P>The developments for which provision is being made in the new subheads E.4 and F.4, relate to the organisation on a trial basis of an educational service the purpose of which is to promote interest in the National Library and the National Museum more widely, to encourage the establishment of local centres in which information concerning the collections available in both institutions would be readily available and in which exhibitions of Library and Museum material of educational interest could be arranged from time to time.  It is considered that a sum of £20,000, divided equally between the two institutions, will be sufficient for the period to the 31st December, 1974.  Provision is accordingly being made for payments not exceeding £10,000 during this period from each of the two new subheads being proposed.</P>
    <P>A new subhead B.10 for a token provision of £10 is being opened in connection with our assession to the convention setting up the European University Institute at Florence. The original six members of the European Community drew up the Convention formally establishing the Institute prior to the accession of the new member States.  Three of these six original members&mdash;France, Italy and Luxembourg&mdash;have formally ratified the convention and it is anticipated the other three will do so shortly.  In fact the Ministers of Education at their June meeting in Luxembourg &ldquo;noted with satisfaction that the three ratifications still pending were about to be made&rdquo;.  I now understand informally that ratification procedures are completed in Germany and the Netherlands but not yet in Belgium.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1997" /> The Irish Government have authorised the appropriate steps to be taken in connection with Ireland's accession to the convention.  It is intended that the Instrument of Accession should be executed as soon as formal ratification of the convention has been made by all six original members.  In this connection Deputies are aware that the Government made on 20th June, 1974 an order entitled European University Institute (Designation of Organisation and Immunities of Organistation and its Officers and Servants) Order, 1974, and that the order has been laid before each House of the Oireachtas.</P>
    <P>The institute will have four Departments, History and Civilisation, Economics, Law, Political and Social Science.</P>
    <P>It is envisaged that the institute will function from October, 1974, and that it will cater for 50-80 post graduate students, perhaps from 1975, and for 400-500 eventually.</P>
    <P>A preparatory Committee, on which my Department and the Higher Education Authority are represented, has been meeting since 1972 to determine the budget, conditions of service for staff scholarships <i>et cetera.</i> Dr. Max Kohnstamm, Netherlands, has been appointed President provisionally and Dr. M. Buzzonetti, Italy the provisional Secretary General.</P>
    <P>The selection of the first members of the institute's staff is at present being made by the provisional Academic Committee.  There are many applications for these posts including a number from Ireland.</P>
    <P>The financial arrangements for the institute provide that it will have a separate budget, financed by contributions from the member States. Ireland's contribution will amount to 0.62 per cent of the total budget.  It has not yet been decided what will be the amount of the budget for the first year of the Institute's operation.</P>
    <P>A draft budget which was under consideration estimated possible expenditure at £1.4 million sterling in a full year of which Ireland would be expected to contribute about £8,800. It is not now anticipated that expenditure <Col N="1998" /> would be of this order in the first year.  Until arrangements for ratification and for staff recruitment are farther advanced it is not possible to say what amount would be required. For this reason only a token estimate is being presented at this stage.</P>
    <P>It is anticipated that there will be sufficient savings on other subheads of the Vote to meet the required charge.  The Government of the Italian Republic have agreed to provide free of charge land and buildings for the Institute initially at Badia Fiesolana and later on a permanent site at Villa Tolomei, Florence.</P>
    <P>Each member State will have two representatives on the High Council of the Institute.  It is envisaged that these representatives would be at official level.  The High Council is expected to hold its first meeting as soon as the six original States have ratified the convention and the three new States have deposited their instruments of accession in Rome.</P>

I should have thought though that there would be additional funds available for the development of an educational service. I know that museums and libraries in other countries have been engaged in setting up historical pacts and various programmes of slides, illustrations and so on.  All this kind of thing costs money and I should have thought that some additional funds would have been made available for a new development like this.  The Minister has not dealt with the National Library in general.  I presume we will have an opportunity on some later date so to do.  Nor has he dealt with the National Museum.  He has simply outlined this new departure, the provision of an educational service to promote interest in the National Library and in the National Museum.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The establishment of local centres <Col N="1999" /> is a good idea.  Frankly, I cannot see how the costs can be kept down if this is to be done on an adequate basis in all the suitable sites that off-hand and without having to study the thing in detail occur to me.  I suggest that the centres should be based on towns and villages where the people have shown an interest in archaeology in the case of the museum and in the development of the library in the local area.  I know that many towns and cities have been doing trojan work in this regard.  There are many voluntary organisations involved in development of museums, local archaeology and the local library and even local arts councils. I am sure that if it was a matter of suggesting to these areas to apply to have a centre established for these purposes there would be a large number of applications.  For this reason I cannot see the total sum of £10,000 for the Library and £10,000 for the Museum being adequate for the purpose at all.  I just wonder whether there will be an attachment of £10,000 to specific museum projects or projects connected with archaeology or museum exhibits and £10,000 confined to the Library side of the scheme.</P>
    <P>The token estimate for £10 for the new University Institute at Florence is welcome also.  The development of this institute, a purely European institute, is awaited by people who are interested in the development of Europe as a community with some impatience.  I myself on a number of occasions in making contributions in the House have decried the fact that the emphasis in the Community has been, and that was natural to begin with anyway, on the economic aspect, to the almost total exclusion of the educational and cultural aspects of the European Community.</P>
    <P>I put a question to the Minister in the recent past about this University institute and I got most of the information which the Minister now gives in his speech in reply to that question. The Minister did not mention if the two other countries that are new members with ourselves, Britain and Denmark, had taken any steps to <Col N="2000" /> ratify the instrument of accession.  I presume they will do so.  One could be accused of a lack of logic if on the one hand one said that we were desirous of the development of a community dimension in educational and agricultural matters and on the other hand began to look quickly to see what we could get out of it.  I suppose a little intelligent self-interest helps to keep idealism with its feet on the ground.</P>
    <P>I am glad to see that there have been applications from this country for positions on the staff.  During the past year, when we discussed the EEC report, I called for a different kind of institute but this particular one, I am sure, will not be frozen in its format or its structure.  I am sure if the development at post-graduate level is successful&mdash;that seems to be the only thing envisaged here&mdash;there is no reason why Florence should not house an enlarged institute dealing with under-graduate and even pre-university themes and courses.</P>
    <P>I see in the Minister's speech that 0.62 per cent of the total budget seems to be the amount assessed on Ireland.  I am sure as the institute develops the amount to be expanded will increase and I am also sure this House will examine carefully how this money is spent.  As I mentioned already it is no harm to look on it, not merely in the context of a developing European educational dimension, but also in the context of how we are faring out of the institute as well.</P>
    <P>When the Minister is replying I would like him to state out of what funds the total contribution until the 31st December will be made.  I see in his brief that the draft budget was estimated at £1.4 million sterling in a full year and Ireland would be expected to pay about £8,800.  Is that sum to be paid this year for the period up to the 31st December or is it only when the institute is in full sail that that money will have to be paid?  I know in this country at the moment there are many places crying out for extra expenditure and there is a feeling that there is a kind of vacuum, that the captain is not in <Col N="2001" /> charge of his ship and directing it with the confidence that prevailed for a number of years in many aspects. I will not widen the theme of the debate but I hope the Minister's colleagues in Government are prepared to afford him money for many projects which are crying out at the moment for development.  The dental hospital, the higher technological colleges, the question of the university merger, the development of the community schools, which seems to have been frozen, are all crying out for money, so I wonder how he will screw out of his colleagues money for the new institute in Florence.</P>
    <P>I am always a little sceptical when somebody says it is anticipated that there will be sufficient saving on other subheads in any Vote to meet the required charge.  The only time you have any saving under subheads is when the people who are responsible for that money are asleep and allow the financial year to go by without making sure it is spent.</P>
    <P>The Italian Republic deserve the gratitude of all member states for providing the institute with a temporary home and also in providing the new site.  How much of the expenditure on the new building, when they come to erect it, will be undertaken by the Italian Republic?  Will it be a joint effort as soon as building starts?  Will we have financial responsibilities in the actual construction of the institute when it comes to its permanent site at the Villa Tolomei?</P>
    <P>The Minister also stated that two representatives on the High Council of the Institute will be provided by each member State.  Who will appoint these representatives?  Will they be Government appointees?  Will a certain number of people be recommended to the institute from a country and will the council be free to choose them?  Will two representatives be appointed by the Government or will they be appointed by the university colleges in Ireland?  I presume when the constitution is worked out their term of office will be specified.</P>
    <P>The Minister said the new High Council is expected to hold its first meeting as soon as the six original <Col N="2002" /> states have ratified the convention and the three new states have deposited their instruments of accession in Rome.  Perhaps there is an answer to one of my earlier questions implied in that, that Denmark and Great Britain are also in the process of signing the instruments of accession.</P>
    <P>I look forward to the wider debate on the National Library and the National Museum and I also look forward to the success of this institute and, as I suggested earlier, to its expansion to under-graduate and pre-university levels.  I hope its range will not be confined to the higher echelons of learning only.  While higher scholarship is very important in any country or in any community by its very nature it does not affect as many as are affected at the lower levels. Consequently, I welcome its expansion in the future to other levels.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GusHealy" hpid="Mr. Healy Mr. Healy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Healy</NameTxt>
      <P>I will be very brief.  I want to join in welcoming this measure.  I do so because it means an expansion in the activities and the interests of the National Museum and the National Library.  I hope that means something more will be done to encourage the establishment of similar branches throughout the-country. We have an admirable museum in Cork and more should be done to exchange the contents with those in the National Museum in Dublin to the benefit of both.  Something similar appertains to the National Library and the National Art Gallery.  I also hope it will mean the interchange, on a wider scale, of specimens, literature and evidence of the links we have, especially with the countries of Europe now that we are part of the European Community. We have many links in the past with those countries and evidence of that could be exchanged to the benefit of our country and the countries from which specimens would come and to which we could supply specimens, books and documents proving our long association with their cultures.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I hope, as the previous speaker has said, that this Bill will mean an expansion of interest in cultural matters.  In this age we are leaning too much towards material things <Col N="2003" /> and not spending enough time on cultural matters, which should engage the extended leisure periods that we are all enjoying now, but not to the extent we could if we could appreciate the cultural windows that would be opened for all of us if we had the necessary direction from the top.  In anticipating that I would like to express my welcome for this measure.</P>

      <NameTxt>Major de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>I am afraid I am going to come down to a more mundane aspect of this rather than the higher educational aspect.  Naturally I am interested from the Public Accounts point of view.  I am glad to see that it is realised by the Minister's Department, and indeed I should hope it would be realised by all Departments, that it is necessary to conform to proper accounting procedures and that, when money has to be applied in an unforeseen way, which of course is going to happen in Government administration, it is properly provided for in this House.</P>
      <P>The Comptroller and Auditor General has had occasion in the recent past to comment in a way that suggests to some of us who have been on the Committee of Public Accounts that there might have been a certain laxity creeping into our public accounting to this extent, not that there is anything wrong with the accounting but that in the charging of an unforeseen item to some subhead that was not intended, this tendency could easily creep in in this age when Government accounting, like every other accounting, is becoming extremely complex.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Therefore, it is a pleasure to see that this detail is properly attended to by the Minister here in presenting the supplementary estimate.  I just want to emphasise in the few minutes available to me the importance of this for this Parliament, for the administrative service itself, and for the confidence the country must have in the integrity of our system.  If the Minister will bear with me, I shall only take a minute.  This is very important, and I would have to go into a specific sphere if I cannot say this in general terms.  I know the Minister wants to <Col N="2004" /> reply and I do not want to delay him, so will he allow me just to say this: I am not satisfied that the broad heading &ldquo;Development Scheme&rdquo; is enough to cover the point I have to make.  As time is pressing, I shall leave this particular point in detail now for another place.  Again, I am glad that the Minister has in this way explained the necessity for dealing with the accounting.</P>
    <P>The other point I should like to make briefly is in regard to the National Library and the National Museum.  The accommodation problem there does not arise on the Supplementary Estimate, but any money that is spent on that Department is something that should be attended to on a later occasion.</P>

      <NameTxt>Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Education (Mr. Bruton)</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister gave me responsibility for the National Museum and the National Library subject to his general direction.  It is therefore a privilege for me to be associated with this initiative here today in the organisation on a trial basis of educational services.  I should like to inform the House that the educational services and the local centres referred to will be integrated into a composite whole. There will be no question of having an exhibition and educational services which are separate one from the other.  I should emphasise in response to Deputy Wilson that they are on a trial basis; hence the limited expenditure. I expect that we shall learn a lot; I expect that we shall make mistakes, but I hope we shall have an ongoing system of assessing the results of this service as it is initiated and learn from them; hence the trial approach.</P>
      <P>I should also point out that it is hoped to use the resources of both the National Library and the National Museum to present an educational impact rather than to separate one from the other.  This is a new initiative.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Generally speaking, I am very pleased that the House has given such a generous welcome to this initiative which I think is the first really new initiative to have taken place in relation <Col N="2005" /> to the National Library and the National Museum for some time.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DickBurke" hpid="Minister for Education (Mr. R. Burke) Richard Burke">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Education (Mr. R. Burke)</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to thank the House for the way in which they have received this Estimate.  I shall try to conclude in the two moments which are left, so that others may continue with the other matters with which the House was dealing before we came in.</P>
      <P>I welcome, in particular, the intervention of Deputy de Valera, Chairman of the Public Accounts Committee. It is precisely because of our desire to conform with this procedure that we are doing this.  I seem to remember from my own accounting officer that, while neither he, the recently appointed Secretary, nor I, the recently appointed Minister, has any responsibility for the periods which are being scrutinised by the Public Accounts Committee, nevertheless the intervention of the Deputy was quite opportune.  I have noted it, and I am doing my little bit to help.</P>

      <P>Additional funds are being provided in the 1974 Estimate which will be before the House later in respect of the services about which Deputy Wilson was questioning me. What is in question here, as the House knows, is a technical operation of freeing the funds from the educational mould so as to enable us to allow planning to go forward.  It is not intended, may I say in reply to Deputy Wilson, to have a specific attachment of funds to separate Museum and Library schemes but rather to combine the resources, as the Parliamentary Secretary has said, to both institutions in developing an integrated service.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is our understanding that the process of accession will proceed in the United Kingdom and in Denmark as soon as ratification is complete. <Col N="2006" /> There are, however, some questions arising out of renegotiation with the United Kingdom and of referendum arrangements in Denmark.  We in Ireland would, however, wish to be in a position to accede without delay.</P>
    <P>In regard to the budget, Deputy Wilson will realise that it was only a draft budget and is not being finalised. It is therefore expected that it will be some time before the Institute expenditure reaches a level which would require £8,000 from us.  This will not occur in 1974 and perhaps not even in 1975.  In regard to the point on representatives, representatives will be appointed by the Minister for Education.  Normally the representatives are an officer of the Department of Education and a representative of the Higher Education Authority.</P>
    <P>With regard to Deputy Wilson's question about the amount of money which we would be required to expend on the buildings, in my speech I indicated that the Government of the Italian Republic had agreed to provide free of charge land and buildings.  The Deputy did not have, perhaps, the opportunity of reading the speech closely because it had just been given to him.</P>
    <P>These are the points that I would wish to make.  I want to thank all those who contributed and to say that I hope the services, particularly in this country, which will be provided will be such as to give an earnest of this Government's intention of widening the availability of the services.  In reply to Deputy Healy and any other Deputy who may have aspirations, we will do all we can but we do not want to encourage any false hopes in these things.  We will proceed slowly and perhaps the first step is the important one. Cork Deputies, no doubt, will press us as will Deputies from other areas, to look after their particular areas.</P>

      <P>The Library and Museum will be working together on this educational project.  Does the Minister envisage the appointment of a liaison officer to co-ordinate the activities of the Musuem and the Library when they are preparing these things?  I should think there <Col N="2007" /> would be a necessity to have somebody to take in both institutes, the Library and the Museum.</P>

It will be necessary to have a person who will act as a means of communication and consultation between the two services, but I would ask the Deputy not to press me on this point because we do not wish to give any further details.  What we are really seeking here is the authority of the Dáil in principle to proceed with these arrangements, and when we have finalised the arrangements we will come back to the Dáil with further information, perhaps on the occasion of our annual Estimates.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>Just before the House moved from the discussion of the Finance Bill we had been talking about section 14 and I was appalled by what the Minister had to say on that section.  Deputy Sheridan and others had referred to the appalling losses farmers are in the course of sustaining during the present <Col N="2008" /> time and to the inevitable unprecedented drop in farm earnings that will come in the course of this financial year, and the only comment the Minister had to make in this regard was the favour that the Government had done the farmers by creating this situation of disastrous losses because the Minister said that farmers had this favour conferred on them which would enable them to claim on these losses when it comes to the payment of income tax.</P>
    <P>The Minister also referred to all farmers, certainly to those who will come within his tax net this year, as a class of tax evaders.  I think the expression he used was &ldquo;devils&rdquo;.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I did not say that, and the speakers are not saying that either.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesMGibbons" hpid="Mr. J. Gibbons Mr. J. Gibbons">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Gibbons</NameTxt>
      <P>I think I alluded to this earlier.  If I could continue in spite of the Minister's conversation.  I thought I had made the farmer's position, as far as this party is concerned at any rate, fairly clear on an earlier amendment, but it seems necessary to refer to it again in the light of what the Minister said before the adjournment of the discussion.  I am fully conscious of the fact that there are no farmers in the Government to advise them on these matters.  We will do it for them.  The farmers' attitude is that they make no claim to some special position which would put them <Col N="2009" /> above paying taxation that is levied upon everybody else.  I hope the Minister understands that.  What they object to, and what we object to here, is that they should be taxed unjustly as they are being in this Bill.  This legislation borrows heavily from British practice but it differs from it very sharply in this regard, that rates on agricultural land are not levied in the United Kingdom or Northern Ireland but they are going to be under the Coalition Government.  Farmers not only will share the common taxation that everybody else shares but they will also be expected to pay very high and increasingly high rates on their land on top of that, with one extraordinary exception, the people whom I referred to earlier as the nobility and the gentry.  I put that in inverted commas, of course.  They do happen to be as a class by far the best off people who live in rural Ireland&mdash;the bloodstock breeders.  The Minister justifies exempting them from taxation on the grounds that if they are not exempted they can pack up their troubles and go somewhere else.  With the greatest respect, this is a damn poor excuse for exempting these very wealthy people from taxation on their agricultural operations. It is tantamount to saying that the ones who can escape will be permitted to escape but the ones who by the nature of their occupation as working farmers cannot escape will not be allowed to escape by the Minister.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I fully appreciate the pathetic position of the National Coalition Government. Made up as it is of Dublin lawyers, university dons and Labour types of the more intellectual kind, the kind referred to one time by a Fine Gael front bencher in the last Dáil as the horny-handed sons of toil with the transport union pins in their coats, people like the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs, the head of the present Government.  A collection of people like that could not reasonably be expected to know what is going on beyond the outer reaches of Ballyfermot. I should like to tell the Minister that there are a great many people out there who are waiting for the chance to remove these gentlemen from office.  I am glad to see in <Col N="2010" /> recent times that the sorry set-up of which the Minister is part is coming apart at the seams of its own accord.</P>
    <P>Farmers should not be stigmatised by the Minister or anybody else as people who are more likely than anybody else to attempt evasion.  For my money, as a farmer, and a person who represents farmers, I feel they are as ready to pay a fair share of the national tax.  The Minister should get that into his head but they are not agreeable to pay double taxation on their lands.  This is what the Minister is proposing under the section, with the exception of the Taoiseach's friends, the people who are so wealthy that not only will they be exempt from taxation but if they are wealthy enough they will be made members of the Seanad.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to take up the point raised by Deputy Gibbons.  He is suggesting that people who will be liable to income tax or their farming profits will be subjected to two forms of tax which do not apply to other sections of the community.  This, of course, is totally without foundation.  It is now 14 years since the Commission on Income Taxation recommended that profits from farming be subjected to tax We should be thoroughly ashamed that it has taken 14 years since ther to implement that recommendation which was made by an impartial body of experts which received advice and representations from all sections of the community, including the farming community.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Those who have been in Government in the intervening period deserve to be chastised for their failure to have the courage necessary to introduce a system of taxation which apply to people who had profit from farming.  It is an indication o their lack of moral courage that they did not do it during all those years There is no use in the people who failed to do it now saying that they are in favour of taxation of farming profit because they had 13 years in which to prove that they had the courage and that they believed in that but they did not do it.  That is the test <Col N="2011" /> and not what they are saying now.</P>
    <P>Even if we accept that there is a conversion let us see how sincere the professed conversion is.  It is clear from their attitude today, and on the Second Stage of the Finance Bill, that they intend to obstruct our efforts to apply the taxation laws to farming profits.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GerardCollins" hpid="Mr. G. Collins Mr. G. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>In the way the Minister is doing it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>It seems to me that there cannot be a genuine conversion when their actions speak much louder than their words, when their obstructions are obviously intended to be more effective than their protestations. The truth is that they are on the horns of a dilemma.  They know that the modifications of the tax code which we are suggesting will apply to only a very small fraction of the total farming community.  They know that the vast majority of the Irish people are sick and tired of the privileges which certain people can enjoy in our community as a result of which they do not pay their fair share of tax.</P>
      <P>I have met many farmers who have expressed their willingness to pay taxes; who have long since realised the total injustice of a system under which they were obliged to deduct PAYE from their labourer's pay packets while they, with incomes up to 20 times greater than their labourers, paid no tax at all.  These people represent the decent farmers of this country and I believe they are in the majority in accepting that the time has come for them to be subjected to taxation laws the same as anybody else.</P>
      <P>There is a certain argument advanced that rates on agricultural lands are more onerous than rates on commercial or industrial buildings.  That is now not so.  It was so in 1960 but it is not so in 1974.  In 1974 rates on industrial and commercial buildings represent a higher percentage of profit than do rates on agricultural land.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="BrendanCrinion" hpid="Mr. Crinion Mr. Crinion">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Crinion</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>They also vary from area to area.  It is very difficult to get any figure which would be a norm, but even accepting that farmers in the higher brackets would pay more tax because they get less relief the truth of my assertion is still valid.  Under the proposed system of taxation which we are bringing in farmers will be entitled to set off as an expense of farming the rates which they pay.  That is the right of any person who is in a similar position and who has to pay rates in respect of their means of production, their office, their factory or their shop.  The effective reduction in rates liability for the people who will be brought within the taxation net will be 35 per cent so that of the rates for which they are liable it is not a question of them having to pay 100 per cent of the rates liability, plus tax, but 65 per cent of the rates liability, plus tax.</P>
      <P>It should be remembered that 77 per cent of the agricultural holdings in this country are totally exempt from rates.  They pay no rates whatsoever.  The balance receive reliefs which are not available to industry, to commerce or anybody else in any line of production.  The comparison which must be made is not between this country and another country but between taxpayers in our society.  If we want to bring in an equitable code it must be trimmed to the burdens which have to be borne in this country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The situation in Northern Ireland and in Britain is not comparable because in Britain industrial properties are also virtually exempt from rates. That is not so here, and we would not be justified in giving the special exemption to the agricultural community if it was not enjoyed by industry and commerce in general.  To have equity we must give the same concession of this exemption from <Col N="2013" /> rates to industry and commerce, and the result would be to throw a greater burden on the rest of the community either by way of paying tax or by paying an increased burden of rates. All the EEC countries have other forms of taxation in addition to income taxation of farmers with the exception of Britain.  There are property taxes, land taxes, municipal taxes related to property values, and in no case is any exemption given because the farmers are liable to national income taxation.  These are the realities of the situation which must be faced up to, and, having regard to these realities, it will be seen that there is no good reason to exempt the farming community from rates.  If the farming community were to be exempted it would mean wiping away the £30 million at present paid on agricultural land.  Of that, £27 million is paid by the general taxpayer towards the relief of rates on agricultural land and £30 million is what would be the cost of removing rates from agricultural land.  In the light of the fact that that £30 million would have to be recovered elsewhere it will be seen that there could be no justification for the removal of rates from agricultural land.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>On section 14, as I understand it, the repeal of section 18 (2) (a) of the Finance Act, 1969, under section 14 means the repealing of the exemption farming profits enjoyed under that particular section of the 1969 Act.  I understand stud fees are not being brought into the net but bloodstock farming as a whole is being brought into the net so there is just one single exemption.  Any profits derived from bloodstock farming will be dealt with as per the provisions of various sections of this Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should like now to raise a particular matter in relation to which the Acting Chairman ruled I was out of order at an earlier point of time.  The reason why I raised the matter at that particular point was because, if the Minister saw the light then, it would be better that he should see it at the beginning rather than half way through <Col N="2015" /> or towards the end, and the time saved could have been usefully used discussing other parts of the Minister's financial proposals and we could have then dealt with other business which must be completed before the Dáil goes into recess.</P>
    <P>I shall now repeat, more elaborately and with perhaps more relevancy, what I said earlier.  I repeat that this is a measure that should not now be introduced and I say that because of the harsh reality of the situation and not because of any carping political criticism. The farmers are hard hit in the cattle industry and they cannot be offered, even by the most optimistic member of the Government or anyone else, any hope that there will be any real improvement in their lot in the foreseeable future and the probability is that they will take a further beating before any light will be seen.</P>

This is madness.  We are talking about taxation on a hard-pressed community. I oppose the whole idea of a motion at this time.  There is nothing wrong with using tomorrow or the day after, or next week or the week after or the week after that, to do this business in a proper way and at a proper pace rather than with the haste with which we seem to find it essential to finish this business.

      <P>As far as I personally am concerned I would prefer to deal with this matter next week or, indeed, after the recess.  The Minister has convinced me that this is not feasible and we must finish it before we go into recess.  One is faced with more problems than one's own personal position.  As I said, I have no objection personally to dealing with this subject next week, but there are many people other than members of this House who are involved in any such arrangements we make, including <Col N="2017" /> members of the staff of this House. My understanding is that, taking all these factors into account, the most satisfactory way of dealing with this is the way which has been agreed between the Whips.  While it is unsatisfactory that we should sit through the night, nevertheless I am confident we will be able to give the Bill reasonably adequate examination, but not perhaps as adequate as we would wish. The Bill arrived quite late this year but there is nothing we could do about that.  In the circumstances with which we are faced it would seem that the proposal agreed between the Whips is the best way out of this dilemma, not necessarily the ideal way but the best way open to us.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>Again I protest.  This matter should not be proceeded with. This section under discussion is relevant to all other sections.  By the repeal of this section, and this section only, is it possible to apply any form of taxation to any type of farming profits.  In that context, the entire spectrum of the farming activities and their gloomy situation at the moment can properly be discussed, relevantly and within the rules of the House.</P>
      <P>In my view the Minister has chosen a bad time to tax farmers.  I was amazed, amused and then appalled by his insistence that the farmers should be grateful that last year was so bad.  It was brought home to them that they could claim in future years against their profits.  That was the clear interpretation given by the Minister this evening.  Whether these people survive the present crisis or not is a matter which does not seem to have entered the heads of the Minister and the Cabinet.  The whole thing is madness in the extreme.</P>
      <P>In anticipation of our entry into the EEC, and taking our deductions and calculations based on the shortfall of production of those in the EEC, our farmers were encouraged to expand and enlarge their beef output, even at the expense of other farming activities. None of these promises which were made freely against the background of our impending entry to the EEC, was justified.  Farmers have been in dire straits over the last nine months and will be in even worse straits over the next nine or 12 months.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister sees merit in the repeal of the exemption which was enshrined in the 1969 Act so  as profits were concerned.  At this stage, we should ask ourselves what will be the effects and impacts of adding this new unknown <Col N="2019" /> burden to the backs of the farming community, who are already bent under the impact of the losses they have suffered and have no hope in the immediate future that their losses will be recouped.  Even if all the Minister's proposals were proper, right and agreeable, surely this would be the time to say that we will not add further misery to the lot of the farming community who have been so badly misled&mdash;not deliberately but misled nevertheless&mdash; so badly left out.  They have lost much and are still losing heavily at the present time.  At this stage should we not be doing the reverse and trying in various ways to encourage those farmers to stick it out, to hold on and to part with nothing they can keep on their farms for the better times which must come?  Should we not be doing that rather than driving a further nail into the coffins of the cattle producers of this country?</P>
    <P>One might well say&mdash;and I am sure this will be said&mdash;but these are the bigger farmers.  Bigger by what amount?  bigger in what way?&mdash;in the capital investment that they are carrying at the moment with no return on it and net losses against their stock as they stood 12 months ago; farmers designated as big farmers by virtue of being £100 valuation or over; a valuation which goes back 120 odd years, that in many cases has no relevance today whatsoever to the value of land in the different parts of this country.</P>
    <P>If we are to use the poor law valuation surely the first thing that should have been done&mdash;in deciding who should and should not come within the code&mdash;was to update the code. That has been sought and talked about for longer than has the lack of taxation or a tax code on the farmers. Less has been done about it and apparently less will be done about it. We are just going to allow it meander on in its own way; let it hammer away, accepting these figures of valuation as if there were something sacrosanct about them whereas we know, for a fact, that from county to county, barony to barony, indeed even from townland to townland, we <Col N="2020" /> have the most extraordinary variations in valuations of land in this country. This is capable of being explained if we go back to the time when that particular Valuation Act was brought into being, in that the activities in farming at that time were different and have changed immensely since then; lands producing crops which appeared to be of a particular value at that time were more heavily valued, naturally, than those nearby producing different types of crops. But the whole scene is and has changed in many cases.  If the positions of valuations were reversed as between barony and barony, parish and parish or county and county we might be nearer an equitable land valuation system than obtains at present.  But we are giving no consideration to that whatsoever.</P>
    <P>Apart from my appeal to the Minister as to the common sense and wisdom of setting aside this proposal until the weather on the sails front has cleared, there is very good reason and argument that that which is based on the Valuation Act of 1850 or thereabouts cannot, should not and could not be justifiably used as a yardstick to decide what farmer comes within and what farmer stays outside the code of taxation now proposed.</P>
    <P>In addition to that I would add that this may merely be the beginning, that while it is being slipped in rather quietly on the basis that it is a very small percentage of farmers only who will come above the £100 land valuation, have we any guarantee that that will not be reduced to £90 next year, £80 the year after or £70 or £50 or £40 or that the valuation limit will not be eliminated? I am quite sure the Minister has no intention, nor would it be in the minds of his advisers, that any such stipulation will be given to the passage of this piece of legislation.  No: I believe that what is intended here is not only to do as those who talk about the racketeers of land, land speculators and companies burying their profits, showing them as activities under farming and getting away with the exemption in the 1969 or <Col N="2021" /> previous Acts.  I believe that in order to catch those the Minister is starting something which may well, in its own time, sound the death knell of the moderate-sized farmer, not to mention the small farmer.</P>
    <P>It is a rather strange contradiction that we have the Land Commission strenuously trying to step up the size of farms and giving every good reason why they should so do, refusing their consent to sub-divisions, to sales.  Yet the effect of the Minister's proposal for taxation of farmers&mdash; were it to continue with the £100 limit and upwards&mdash;must have the effect of fragmentation and reduction by legitimate means of the area of holdings so as to bring people under the £100 valuation and keep them outside the code he now proposes.  It is my belief that while the £100 is mentioned at the moment, it is merely the thin end of the wedge; it is the manner in which it may well have been slipped across the farming community; that their fight&mdash;if they were to fight on this issue&mdash;would be for the few large farmers in the country only and not for the general body of farmers.  I am amazed that the farming community has taken this in the manner they have done.  The only conclusion I can reach is that they have taken such a hammering in recent times there is no fight left in them.  If they were as cocky as I have seen them before, the Minister would not be attempting to put through this legislation without very drastic amendments even at this stage.</P>
    <P>I say to the Minister that he is wrong in applying a tax code at this stage.  I say he is doubly wrong in relating that tax code to an outmoded, and totally false valuation system that should have been revised every year since 1850 but which has never been touched since then and about which nothing of any practical use is being done, or is likely to be done, judging by the lack of activity by the Government in the foreseeable future.</P>
    <P>I believe he is wrong also in adding this particular burden of over £100 valuation on those in some counties, <Col N="2022" /> who are paying, on that valuation, as much as £9 in the £ rates.  The Minister talked here a while ago about the amount of relief being provided&mdash;I think £27 million or £30 million, some figure like that&mdash;and talked about that relief as if it were something by way of a gift to the farming community. It may well be so regarded and written down in the book but it is not done for the love of the farming community.  It is done because it is believed by this and previous Governments that it was necessary that such relief should be provided because of the ever-increasing and intolerable burden local taxation has become in relation to the poor law valuation under which our land has been valued well over 100 years ago.</P>
    <P>We are asking that they should pay on the double.  I wish to leave the Minister in no doubt that that is what he is proposing to do regardless of what he says about the reliefs being given.  The fact remains that the farming community are paying as much as £9 in the £ in some counties and are paying substantial sums in all areas.  The relief is given because it is regarded as vital in order that the industry should prosper, thus benefiting the economy in general.</P>
    <P>This is what all of our handouts and aids to any section is about.  We do it because it is the right thing to do, that it is in the general interest.  The money spent by the Exchequer on farming has been in a good cause. Agriculture is our largest single industry, it is the largest employer of labour, it is the basis of our entire economy and it is the industry that accounts for the major part of our exports.  Yet in this legislation we ignore the fact that our cattle industry is our biggest single export earner and is expected to continue as such for a considerable time in the future, despite the gloomy situation at the moment.</P>
    <P>How can we justify the relief of tax on profits earned on exports generated from other sources of industry and, at the same time, introduce legislation at this time that will hammer the farming community?  It seems an absolute and total contradiction.  We are also <Col N="2023" /> ingoring the fact that the risk in farming is an ever-present one and is not solely related to the state of the market for our cattle and beef.  There is also the risk of bad weather, and this does not affect any other large industry which is enjoying relief on their export profits.</P>
    <P>Is the Minister aware that certain industries in the country have paid more in dividends than the total capital structure of the industry in question? They did not do it for just one year; they have done it for two years and I hope they will do it this year also.  In other words, they will get back three times the total output costs in the first three years of their establishment as an industry and they do this on the export market.  They are able to do this because they do not pay tax on their export profits and I think that is justified.  However, the people who have been practically forced into the cattle industry by the measures adopted by the various Governments have to cope with the crisis that has arisen within the Common Market.</P>
    <P>We talk about keeping faith with farmers and other sections of the community, but no section can have the same sense of grievance as the cattle breeders and producers against the background of our recent efforts to encourage them into further production. There were glowing reports from the Common Market but despite the fact that the EEC area is short of their own requirements, supplies are coming in the back door from third countries. The result has been that there is sufficient additional cattle so that we are in the lurch, without as much as an apology from the creators of the situation.</P>
    <P>Our Minister for Finance is going to add to that situation by slapping this imposition on the people most concerned.  His only suggestion to them is what he said earlier this evening; he told them that it was well for them that they had lost so much this year because they will be able to claim it back against the profits they will make in the time between now and 1975.  I hope the Minister will withdraw that statement before it is <Col N="2024" /> seriously examined.  If he thinks about it I am sure he would not like it to be regarded as a considered statement; it would be better to regard it as a poor joke rather than a serious suggestion.</P>
    <P>The Minister mentioned that rates formed a higher percentage of industrial profits than in the case of farming.  How does the Minister know this?  We do not know what profits farmers have been making as we have not been collecting taxes from them. Somebody on the Fianna Fáil side intervened to inform the Minister on the matter.  The Minister said that 77 per cent of farmers do not pay rates on their land.  Could we have from him another calculation and statement with regard to the percentage of rates in the profits of farmers when we consider that the total rates paid on land is, according to the Minister's statement, paid only by 23 per cent of farmers? We must relate the rates to those who pay them in the farming community and take it as a percentage rather than a percentage of the total rated valuation of the agricultural land of the country, on which 77 per cent of the farmers, according to the Minister, do not pay rates at all.</P>
    <P>An earlier speaker, drew the Minister's attention to the fact that this new imposition of tax on the farming community, added to the existing tax that is being paid to the tune of very many millions, regardless of the millions of reliefs trotted out by the Minister, will put our farmers at a further disadvantage, and I deliberately say &ldquo;further&rdquo;, with their opposite numbers in the Six Counties and in England. The Minister's reply to that was lacking in reality.  I understood him to say that we must look at what the situation is here and that we cannot be looking outside to England or the Six Counties or elsewhere.  I say we must have regard to what is being done there.  We must have regard to the relative costs of production, the relative overheads, since these farmers are in the Community with us.  Since they can be, and in some cases are, our competitors we must have regard to their overheads in relation to ours.  The idea that we can close our eyes to what is being done there is just not sensible.  We can argue, <Col N="2025" /> and it sounds very well, that it does not matter a damn what they are doing outside, that what we must do is keep an eye on our own taxpayers and spread the load evenly here.  This is not so and the Minister knows it is not so. The statute books in existence at present are full of efforts on the part of this House at various times and for various reasons to make special provision for people in various enterprises who are in the export market with their produce, to try to put them into a competitive position with their would-be competitors in whatever part of the world they may be trading.  The Minister knows this is so and he knows we will be doing it again and again in any context in which we think it is of value to us.  It is no use to turn around and say to us here that what they do in the Six Counties or England is of no real concern to us, that we must have regard purely to the internal tax structure and to nothing else.  That concept I do not believe the Minister seriously believes, and I totally disagree with it.</P>
    <P>The Minister has talked about moral courage or lack of it here this evening.  I would ask him to display real courage at this juncture and withdraw the whole shebang contained in this chapter of the Finance Bill.  Let us get on to the rest and get finished with it without having to wait until four, five or six in the morning.  He need not concede by so doing that what is proposed is, in all respects, wrong or that it is being withdrawn for that reason, but that it is being withdrawn because of the fact that it is no time to add to the burdens and fears of our hard-pressed farming community who have little prospect of their lot improving in the immediate future.  This would be real courage on the part of the Minister and would make real sense of his charges this evening that others who went before him did not have the courage to do this, that or the other despite the fact that recommendations were made as many as 14 years ago.</P>
    <P>When I heard him talk about the 14-year-old recommendations it struck me that digging it up now and putting it into operation might not necessarily imply courage but could imply <Col N="2026" /> many other things that would be far from virtuous, and that in fact the courage was displayed by not accepting the recommendations made 14 years ago.  We set up inquiries and we set up commissions but we should not be slaves to them and indeed in the case of some of them it would be very foolish if we were.  Those who are set up to sit and inquire into any particular aspect of legislation do not expect that everything they recommend will <i>holus-bolus</i> be taken by the Dáil and put into Statute.  They do not expect it nor do we expect them to prepare it in such a manner that it could be so absorbed.  If this were capable of being done there would not be any need for this House.  We could set up a few committees, give them a life span of 20 or 25 years and the power of co-option, self-perpetuating, and we would never need an election thereafter.  We could let them run the whole show.  However, we are very far from that.  The Minister, in using this 14-year-old recommendation as a justification and indeed as an argument in favour of the courage he is now displaying, could well be hiding behind a recommendation that is 14 years old, 14 years out of date, that is as far from the realities of today as the last century is and that could have misled him and his Government into doing something at this particular time that could be very wrong indeed.</P>
    <P>I ask the Minister in all seriousness to consider the general implications without prejudice to future action in regard to applying a taxation code of this or some varied nature to farming profits against the present background of a gloomy present and an even gloomier future for the farming industry at this time.  It would be a terrific morale-booster to the farming community if, even at this stage, the Minister were to take that step for that reason and without prejudice to its application or re-introduction at a time that would be more suitable and more hopeful for the community on whose back this burden is now being placed.</P>
    <P>It is my belief that somewhere along the line a great deal of pressure <Col N="2027" /> may have been exerted by Members of his own party and of the Labour Party on the Government and on him as Minister for Finance to do something about taxing the farmers and those who are speculating in land, companies which were dodging the column and burying their profits in various ways through land ownership.  If he thinks he is catching them by doing this he should have another think.  I can visualise the full impact of what the Minister is proposing here having the reverse effect on, say, a farmer with a valuation of £120, £130 or £150 who is genuinely farming and who may have built his farm up from a very small beginning over the years and have worked hard to repay the money he expended in purchasing all or part of it, in modernising it, in building and bringing it into good fertility.</P>
    <P>These farmers are now faced with the difficulty of getting labour to work as farms must be worked for an unreasonably long number of hours at certain times of the year and working over week-ends, as they must do in the dairying industry, the difficulty of getting a labour force to do this sort of work, added to the soaring costs of every single item which goes into farming today, the alarming rises that have taken place even in the last 12 months, together with the new imposition that is enshrined in these proposals which will bring about the situation wherein the books must be kept and, as my colleague earlier said, the accountant must be brought in.</P>
    <P>I know a number of farmers who are very concerned about this particular aspect of the matter and who are seriously contemplating getting out, while they are capable of doing so, and leaving the headaches in the future to somebody else.  I can see a lot of genuine, good and useful farmers doing that because it must be known to the Minister and every Member in this House that if the capital value of land were to be realised by anybody with a land valuation of £100 and upwards today, together with the stock, machinery, equipment <Col N="2028" /> and so forth, what he could get on the open market for the money he would realise on such a sale would be anything up to five to ten times greater than he is capable of making by working hard on his farm at the moment, and nobody else in any other walk of life would work so hard for any money at the present time.</P>
    <P>Is the Minister intent on driving out the farmers who farm not only for profit but because it is their way of life, getting in the big combines, getting in the companies and the bigger units, which are now being sought after not only by the Land Commission, for their own good policy reasons, but by the EEC and all that we hear coming from behind the scenes there?  Is this where we are going?  Is this part of the pattern that is devised to bring about the situation of the huge farming complexes in the future to the exclusion of the traditional farming community in this country?  If those people were over the years and at the present time to measure their profits and set beside that their efforts and the hours they put into the work on their farms and think in terms of how much more they could get by realising the lot and investing their money in gilt edge securities, surely the Minister must realise that these people have a place in the community, that they should be retained, that it is vital they are; and if the time comes when these people are driven out and are replaced by the very type the Minister and his Government seem to be trying to prevent accumulating land in this country, he will be a sorry man then and we will all be sorry but it will be too late.</P>
    <P>It is for these reasons that I say again to the Minister in all honesty, no political gimmickry whatsoever intended, that this measure is ill-timed, whatever about being ill-conceived or badly constructed.  It should not in my estimation be pursued further at this particular juncture.  I believe the Minister can honourably, without any loss of face, withdraw this part of the Bill without prejudice to his actions in the future and do it for the reason that farming as an overall industry is going through a very bad time, a time contrary <Col N="2029" /> to the promise we all felt was there a few years ago and which we believe will return.  The Minister could thus give a boost to the farming community at a time when they badly need it.  It is about the only thing he can give them at this time, particularly in the cattle and beef industry of this country. The Minister stated in another context that the losses made this year can be written off.  If the losses are made in the coming year the Minister cannot expect to lose anything by not applying these taxes, so he does not have anything to lose financially.  He does not have any face to lose in the matter and he does not have any political side to consider in this matter at this time.  He could help the farmers' morale greatly, he would show the courage he has been talking about here this evening, and he would be applauded for it.  I think the Minister is man enough to do it.  I hope, while he is thinking of saying no at the back of his mind he is still considering saying yes.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JosephBrennan" hpid="Mr. Brennan Mr. Brennan">

      <P>I want to put on record my abhorrence and opposition to this measure.  I believe the Minister does not want to go down in history as the man who opened the door to tax on farming generally, because that is what this is.  There was a ditty some years ago: &ldquo;Open the door Richard&rdquo;.  I hope this will not be the tag attached to the Minister after the introduction of this legislation.</P>

      <P>It has all the marks of a Government devoid of any rural thinking.  It has the hallmark of a Government dominated by Labour thinking, by urban-minded thinking and that has no regard whatever for the agricultural community.  We had several reports on the income tax system over the years.  I remember one report which suggested there should be a tax on farming but we did not act on it.  The report admitted that there would be an uproar if this was suggested but they said it could be brought in quietly by applying it to those with a valuation of £100 or over.  That is what we are doing here tonight.  We are getting the thin edge <Col N="2030" /> of the wedge into taxing farmers as they did in England.  They started with £100 valuation and today every farmer in England must make income tax returns.</P>
      <P>It is a bad day for agriculture in Ireland.  It is all right to get up and talk about the incomes farmers are enjoying, but I do not see many rushing into agriculture in this country.  This party for years strove to build up agriculture and to stop the flight from the land.  We did everything possible to encourage agriculture by incentives of one kind or another, grants and subsidies, to bring the drudgery out of farming and to make it more attractive.  When we joined the EEC the farmers for the first time saw a light at the end of the tunnel.  While their interests at EEC level have not been very well protected recently we still hope, and the agricultural community are hopeful, that better EEC conditions, as are intended under the Treaty of Rome, will be enjoyed by the agricultural community eventually.</P>
      <P>Now after all these years, after all the efforts that have been made to reverse a serious situation in agriculture you have a Government that is dominated by urban-minded people who can snigger and jeer at the farming community and do not give a damn if they are up to their neck in debt, and who propose a new tax to ensure that they will not get their heads above water.  The farming community will forever remember this night in Leinster House.</P>
      <P>Nobody for a moment believes that it would be confined for very long to the £100 valuation limit.  Any of us who have any experience of the brilliance of the Revenue people&mdash; and I do not say that with any sarcasm&mdash;realises their resourcefulness in coming up with suggestions for new means for raising taxes, and any Government can find means of spending the tax, and that the limit will be dropped from £100 until every farmer in the country is eventually brought in.  That is what we are doing here tonight.  That is what those who will go into the lobbies to support this Finance Bill are doing. It is a sad day for Ireland.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2031" /> It can be easily pointed out that other countries impose tax on farmers.  I am sick listening to talk about what other countries are doing. I do not think that in the field of agriculture there are many countries comparable to this country.</P>
    <P>We are unique in being so largely devoted to agriculture.  We were unique in that we had no tax.  We were exempt under the 1969 Act. This is a reversal.  I am surprised at the rural Deputies, some of them farmers and some of whom were very loud in their condemnation of Fianna Fáil at the time when the NFA were blocking the roads.  I remember being held up six hours in Navan on one occasion.  I could not get to this House because the roads were blocked by the NFA due to something simple that was not operating to their benefit.  That was politically instigated and exploited to the last at the time by those on this side of the House.  Those people who are posing as the champions of the agricultural community, where are they tonight?  There is scarcely one of them to be seen in the House since this debate began.  Looking back over the years, I believe no condemnation could be loud enough or strong enough to put on the record of this House as to how we feel about the imposition of this tax on the agricultural community.</P>
    <P>There was a decline in the number of people employed in agriculture to the extent that no matter how rapidly we could increase the industrial production and industrial development in this country, it was unable to absorb the fall-out from agriculture.  Now we are making sure that when agriculture gets its head above water we are going to skim the cream of anything they are likely to get after years of struggling and suffering in trying to achieve some social standing and financial independence in our economy.</P>
    <P>I would like to hear the Minister say that is forced upon him, because I do not believe that he is happy about the situation either or that <Col N="2032" /> many others in the House are happy about it.  Further, I do not believe that many in this House would come with the Labour mentality in relation to taxation generally.  As an indication of the feeling there was at any hint of taxing farmers, I can recall a Senator we had one time&mdash;the man is long since gone to his reward, Senator Quirke&mdash;who made some reference in the Seanad years ago to the taxation of the farming community. It became a slogan quoted on every Fine Gael poster and advertisement in the country for many elections afterwards.  It was so distasteful and so abhorrent to the community that even when a Senator would suggest that there was a possibility of finding tax by resorting to the taxation of farmers, we were scourged with the statement for which we were not even responsible. The same people who exploited that situation are the people who introduced this tax.</P>
    <P>We introduced VAT as the best means of ensuring that everybody in the country paid his or her fair share of tax.  If there was any excuse for extending taxation to a new section of the community before VAT, there is none now.  There are many people paying tax three times from some of the products they are handling.  Indeed, when VAT was recommended to the Government at the time, one of the selling points that appealed to me most was that it would obviate the necessity of turning to new sources of revenue and tax.</P>
    <P>This again illustrates the resourcefulness and the able minds of the people whose job it is to suggest means of raising taxes.  A section of the community who were beginning to feel their way out of the misty past and the darkness under which they laboured will now find a new obstacle to ensure that they will not get their heads above water.  This awful depression that has hit agriculture now is only temporary, but that this time should be chosen to oppose tax on farmers makes it all the more difficult to understand.  It is inexcusable to introduce such taxation at a time when agriculture is <Col N="2033" /> calling out for assistance, is screaming for aids to offset the losses farmers inevitably faced last year and this year.</P>
    <P>I do not know if the members of the Government have any real idea as to how the agricultural community has to live.  Agriculture is in no way comparable with other sources of livelihood.  The instability of markets is only one of the more serious hazards.  It is virtually impossible for a farmer to budget for a year ahead. Farming is a continuous battle against all sorts of hazards&mdash;the weather, animal and plant diseases, world conditions. The farmer's day is not an eight-hour one.  His week is not a 40-hour one.  Sunrise to sunset usually marks the day for the agricultural worker, and if he is not making use of every hour of light he is not likely to exist.  He has to deny himself many of the pleasures that are available to the 9 a.m. to 5 p.m. worker who can sit down and decide on ways and means of making and spending money.</P>
    <P>Until recent times the social standing of the agricultural community was the lowest in the country.  Members of the farmer's family were sent to college and it was usually the fool of the family who was left to look after the farm.  Farming was regarded as the step-child in the economy.</P>
    <P>We in our time on that side of the House produced many incentives for agriculture.  The agricultural community responded.  The expansion of educational services for the agricultural community was regarded as one of the most important projects that the Government could undertake and to get farmers to make adequate use of the facilities.  An Foras Talúntais played a very important role in getting people to understand the better use of agriculture, in the development of agricultural education and appreciation of the need for it.  In general, we had broken through in the battle to bring agriculture out of the doldrums and into a position where there was hope that the flight from the land might be arrested and agriculture would not be regarded as the underdog in our economy despite the fact that it was our principal <Col N="2034" /> source of exports and this being an agricultural country was one of the reasons why we were able to exist at times when there was very little else going for us in the way of exports.</P>
    <P>We should not easily forget the importance of agriculture as the mainspring of our economy.  We should be mindful of those who worked hard to bring agriculture to a high level of development.  The day when any Minister, with so many sources of revenue having been made available to him, should turn to this last source of revenue will go down in history as the day when agriculture was given a blow from which it reeled.  That any Minister should do so is inexcusable.</P>
    <P>I do not expect members of the Government to have any sympathy for farmers because they are not concerned, they are not interested in rural life; they have no knowledge of agriculture; they have not been brought up on the land; they have no background experience of the drudgery and slavery that attach to agriculture.  Their backbenchers who might be interested or who might have a practical knowledge of agriculture are ineffective in advising the Government with regard to agriculture. That is perfectly obvious.</P>
    <P>I do not think that anybody who has been in touch with the agricultural community since taxation of farmers was mooted could say that he got any encouragement from any section of the agricultural community in relation to this proposed taxation.  The farmers spelt out the alternative.  That will arise in the course of the night on other sections. The alternative that was proposed has not been listened to.  Therefore, the tax is unjustified and is without acceptance by any person representing the agricultural community.</P>
    <P>The county of Donegal would not pay much tax under the £100 valuation limit and that is one of the reasons why that limit is now being set as a means of getting in the thin end of the wedge of this distasteful tax.  I am perfectly certain that not many years will have elapsed when a proposal for the reduction of that <Col N="2035" /> limit, if not its complete abolition, will be made to whatever government may be in office.</P>
    <P>Holdings of various sizes are necessary in a successful agricultural community. It would not be a successful agricultural community if all holdings were arranged in 100 acres or 60 acres or 20 acres.  It is necessary that there should be large, very large and small holdings to carry out their own particular type of agriculture, to fit into the scheme of agricultural development. It is necessary that there should be grassland, tillage farming, intensive farming on smaller holdings, even bloodstock breeding.  It is not the intention behind this tax to single out one particular type.</P>
    <P>Why should the man with the £99 valuation not pay just as the man with the £100 valuation must pay?  For that matter why does the man with the £98 or £97 valuation not pay?  There has been a suggestion that farmers with a £50 valuation are doing well. There is no doubt in my mind of what will ultimately happen in relation to these taxation proposals.</P>
    <P>We can expect that the Government will use their majority in the House to steamroll this through in spite of the fact that 90 per cent of the people on that side of the House do not believe in it.  It is now a Government decision and it has to be pushed through.  We are going to have the farmers from tonight onwards starting with a £100 valuation limit.  I should like to hear one Member on the Government side give us an assurance that the limit will not be reduced below £100 valuation.  I feel sure that the people in rural Ireland have not asked them to support this measure.</P>
    <P>That is the reason why I want to put on record, on behalf of the agricultural community, most of whom as far as as my representation in this House is concerned will not be affected by this legislation immediately, that they see the writing on the wall as plainly as we can.  It is only a matter of time before they are all brought into the net and they will have to make their own contribution to the <Col N="2036" /> already heavy burden of taxation which is weighing down the people of this small island.  To find money to spend in a Government is the simplest part of Government.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JosephBrennan" hpid="Mr. Brennan Mr. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>But to find means of raising it is most difficult.  The Government must decide what load the people can bear at a particular time and spend according to that. There will soon be few means left for raising money.  One means left after this legislation goes through is to drop the limit year after year and bring more farmers into the net.  The Government sees that as a fruitful source after a time but I think this will rebound on them, it will boomerang.  Nothing that the Government have introduced will hit rural Ireland more adversely than this proposal. Rural Ireland will rebel and take the first opportunity to record their detestation and disapproval of what the Minister is proposing.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Sheridan</NameTxt>
      <P>As a person who is unique in this House, one who has been elected by the votes of farmers big and small since 1961, one who has faced the electorate independently on every occasion and one who is proud to say that he was born and reared on a small holding in north Longford, I consider I have a genuine knowledge of what the farmers desire.  I should like to remind the Minister, as a person who will not use political gimmickry in any circumstances, that in my young days I was a member of Fine Gael.  It was always quoted to me then what the late and respected Deputy Patrick Hogan said, &ldquo;One more cow, one more sow, one more acre under the plough&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should like to ask the Minister if he feels that after introducing this taxation system the farmers will have one more cow, one more sow or one more acre under the plough.  Does the Minister want progress?  The farmers of Ireland were never found wanting if they were invited to put their cards on the table.  They have fought many wars, the Economic War, and even <Col N="2037" /> went over to join John Bull.  They may not have received much thanks for this but they did their job.</P>
    <P>These are the people who are now being harassed by the present Minister for Finance.  I do not like being offensive in this House, nor do I want to sound political, but I should like to remind the Minister that farming is still the traditional industry of this country.  We have now modern means and machines for farming.  We have gone a long way in recent years and we have been helped by successive Governments introducing various schemes.  Surely in 1974 it is not hard to realise that there is a greater depression in this country than there has been since the days of the Economic War.  Surely when we have farmers giving away calves which last year would have fetched £60 or £70 there is something wrong.  This is not the time to tax these very depressed people.</P>
    <P>I should like to remind the Minister that if this goes too far there will be a revolution.  We were near the point of revolution before when another Government was ruling.  At that time it would have been a good job for that Government to meet the people concerned.  We were on the point of revolution then.  Deputy Brennan mentioned that he was held up for six hours in Navan and I was held for up to five hours on a main road to Dublin by combine harvesters, bulldozers and tractors.  That could happen again.  I am not inciting anyone to do this but if it were not for the French farmers and their case the cattle trade of this country, which is our main source of livelihood, would be much worse.</P>
    <P>We have gained benefit whether through our Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries or not.  We have gained a little because of the actions of the French farmers.  This House should realise that when the farmer goes well everybody goes well but when he is faring badly everybody is hit.</P>
    <P>The point I am trying to make is that this tax is being imposed at a time of absolute depression.  It is something which will not be easily <Col N="2038" /> accepted by the people, and when the people make up their minds that they are not going to permit something to be forced upon them this just will not work.</P>
    <P>I would like to remind Members that we were told that, when we entered the Common Market, there was a ten years' shortage of meat in Europe and all we need do was get in and there would be no getting out; we were on the road to prosperity forever.  It just did not happen that way.</P>

      <P>I have my facts and I know my facts.  Any terrier that likes to bark at me here or anywhere else can bark.  It does not matter a damn to me.  I came into this House on my own and I will leave it on my own. This is the most unfortunate time for this sort of provision to hit the farming community.  I am wondering if the Minister is aware of the fact that over the last 12 months fertiliser prices have risen by 400 per cent.  I am not blaming the Minister for this.  Binder twine has risen by 200 per cent.  The price of machinery parts has risen. Everything the farmer needs and uses has risen in price and there is nothing there to recompense the farmer for these increases, absolutely nothing. This time 12 months calves were fetching £60 and £70.  You are lucky today if you do not find a calf in the boot of your car when you go home.</P>
      <P>It is said the milk farmer is doing well.  He has done well, but I would remind Deputy Coughlan that the milk farmer puts in, not a nine to five day but an 18-hour day.  The cows have to be milked 14 times a week.  If a cow gets mastitis or brucellosis the farmer is at a loss.  I am not blaming the Minister; he does not give the cow brucellosis or mastitis.  I blame the Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries and his predecessor.  If a cow is affected with these diseases the farmer is down at least £150 and the calf is down maybe 200 per cent.  These are things that affect farming generally. I would not speak here if I did not have my facts and, because I have my facts, I defy interruption from either side of this House.</P>

    <P>I know the Minister is a reasonable man but he could not introduce these provisions at a more unfortunate time.  With regard to the £100 valuation, I do not know who the valuer will be or where you will finish up with the £99 against the £100 or the £100 against the £120, but I can assure the Minister that, the moment the valuers come down the country, <Col N="2040" /> they will be met with the pike and the fork in the same way as others before them were met with the pike and the fork in the bad old days and I guarantee that 5p of that tax will never be collected.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanCrinion" hpid="Mr. Crinion Mr. Crinion">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Crinion</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister said that the Fianna Fáil Party, when in Government, neglected to pay heed to a report made in 1961 recommending taxing farmers.  It was he and his colleagues who pointed out in the 1960s that farmers were earning only £4 to £5 per week.  How could any sane man take tax from people earning as little as that?  That was the question posed.  The report suggested starting at £100 valuation and then going down.  The Minister has three forms of valuation.  He has income tax for farmers over £100 valuation.  If the farmer has a job or he or his wife has a 25 per cent interest in some firm, or his wife is working and he is over £50 valuation, he must keep books and return them to the Revenue Commissioners for tax purposes. That leaves a gap.  I suppose next year we will be down to that for everybody.</P>
      <P>Then there is the poor uneconomic farmer with a valuation of £20.  He or his wife may have had to go out to work to sustain their family.  If that farmer has a valuation between £20 and £50 he loses half his allowances for income tax purposes.  The Minister said that 9,000 extra people will be coming into the taxation net.  In my view, more than 9,000 people will be caught in the net because people with a valuation of £50 and the small farmers who must go out to work because they are unable to make a living from the farm will be caught also.  The small farmer now goes to work as a result of the Fianna Fáil policy of providing industries in rural areas.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The farmer is being taxed but not the man with the stallions.  The Minister said he was trying to keep the stallions in this country and if he did not give this tax concession they would be sold abroad.  Two of the best known racehorses left this country within the past month.  Even <Col N="2041" /> though the Minister has given a tax free incentive to owners they still sold those horses abroad for more than £1 million.  There are horses here who are syndicated at over £1 million. Their stud fees are tax free.  When one compares that with the poor farmer whose family has been ekeing a living from the land for generations with these horse owners, one realises that there is no justice.  This Dublin-based Government enjoys all the facilities of modern day life: running water, sanitary services, good roads, television and educational facilities, while the poor farmer must struggle to survive.</P>
    <P>The revenue from these horses is tax free.  It has been calculated that an owner will get the full value of the stallion from stud fees in three years. Before one of his progeny races, the owner has got back the money he paid for his stallion.  Now we have a Dublin-based Minister letting that money go tax free.  What section of the farming community could say that they will get their capital returned inside three years without paying any tax?  The progeny of the stallion might not even have been in a race but still the owner will get back all the money he paid.</P>
    <P>The Minister said that everybody should pay his fair share of taxation. It seems strange that he should let people away without paying tax on such high sums.  Stallion owners will get £8,000 to £10,000 for each mare that goes to them.  In the first year there will be 25 mares and after that 40-42 mares each year.  As anybody can see, in three years the owner will have £1 million back without very much cost for keeping the stallion for those three years.</P>
    <P>Farmers have felt over the years that they were paying a form of income tax&mdash;the rates.  They paid a set figure every year which bore no relationship to their incomes.  In the mid-1960s farmers were pressing for income tax on the understanding that the agricultural land be rerated on farmers who would be paying income tax similar to the system in England and Northern Ireland.</P>
    <P>The Minister said that industries are <Col N="2042" /> paying rates on their premises.  This is wrong.  A farmer with a valuation of over £100 paid 8 per cent of his income on rates in 1972.  A farmer with a larger valuation paid 13 per cent or even 15, 16 or 17 per cent in 1972.  In industry the average rate of their gross income which they paid was 5.7 per cent.  Take the comforts which the industrialist and his workers have.  The services with which they are provided from rates bear no relation whatsoever to those with which the farmer is provided.  In quite a number of cases you will find he has a bad road running down to his land; he may even be lucky to have a tarred road.  The road is widened for every factory and all the services provided to try to induce them into the area.  But the farmer has been paying for this without being provided with any of the services one would expect from local authorities. One can conclude from this that the farmer is paying a much higher rate on his gross income than is the industrialist.  It is highly unfair to take a farmer of £100 valuation and start taxing him when he is already paying a much higher rate than the industrialist or the urban dweller who has no sympathy with or understanding of the farmer.</P>

      <P>One sees industrialists paying 5.7 per cent only of their income in rates and what services are they receiving?  As well as that their export profits are completely tax free.  The greater portion of agricultural production is exported.  Yet the Minister has nothing in his Bill to give relief to those farmers, or to the industry itself, exporting so much and importing so little.  Practically all of the raw materials are derived from the land itself.  The exports being provided by the agricultural industry have not been taken into account good, bad or indifferent.  Where would the country be were it not for those exports?  As it is, the Minister is in trouble with his balance of payments. How much more difficulty will he be in when the exports of cattle and cattle numbers in the country start decreasing?  Calves which were fetching £80 and £70 last year are making at a maximum £20 and some of them are not even making that.  As has been mentioned here, some of them are even being given away as gifts. I know of sales yards in my constituency where the calves are left behind in a sale, their numbers ripped off and not a farmer will take them.  All the auctioneer can do is bring them up here to the Zoo to be fed to the animals.  It is sad to see that sort of thing happening and it is happening on a wide scale, as has been mentioned by some Deputies.  They have been given away or put into one's trailer and, when one gets home, one finds one has more calves than one started out with.</P>

Nothing is said in defence of the farmers of Laois-Offaly who elected Deputy McDonald and then he talks about representing the farmers of Ireland in Brussels. Not one word did he say in defence of them or in protest at the unjust taxation being imposed on them.</P>
      <P>The industrialist also benefits from export tax relief, something which is not passed on to the farmer, the farmer who has been exporting his commodities over the years.  We should be inducing the farmers to export more, to increase cattle numbers and increase production off the land, because a 5 per cent increase in cattle numbers or production on the farm is a very big one.</P>
      <P>It has been pointed out that the farmers are losing money this year. The Minister admits that they are losing money and the argument put forward is that they can place those losses against next year's profits.

      <P>It was certainly very interesting to hear Deputy Crinion speak.  I was amused to hear him say that he thought racehorses and stallions should be taxed and I shall take a special interest in listening to what Deputy Haughey will have to say in reply to that.  I think this racehorse business is a very chancey one and I think it is quite right that it is exempt. I am a practical farmer as well and I think I know what I am talking about just as well as Deputy J. Gibbons.</P>
      <P>It was very interesting to hear previous speakers mention the flight from the land.  They should realise that in the 14 years up to 1972 some 14,000 people had to leave County Donegal. It was not those with a valuation of more than £100 who had to leave; it was the smaller farmers who had to leave the county.  This tax will not interfere with their income.</P>
      <P>Have the single farmers forgotten that it was the Fianna Fáil Government who are now in Opposition, who took the dole from the small farmers.  Once again it was the small farmers who got the knock.  These things seem to have been forgotten but for the short time I shall speak in this debate I do not want to become political.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I personally think it is right that <Col N="2046" /> farmers with valuations in excess of £100 should be taxed.  It is quite wrong that single men who are earning more than £10 a week are taxed while, at the same time, farmers have made thousands of pounds without paying tax.  There is no point in our being hypocritical about this matter.  We want fair play for everyone, we want all sections to have a fair share of the cake.  It is quite wrong that a single person earning £12 or £14 per week has to pay income tax while the wealthy farmers are not liable for tax.</P>
    <P>It is easy to say that a Bill such as this which intends to tax farmers is unacceptable.  Of course it is unacceptable&mdash;any new form of taxation is unacceptable. The 2½ per cent turnover tax was unacceptable as was the 5 per cent VAT.  I am one of those people who will be personally affected by this new tax and I know that many similarly affected people will find it unacceptable.  We must be realistic and try to give a fair share to everyone.</P>
    <P>There has been much talk about the recession in the cattle trade.  Some people have said we should not have entered the EEC.  Had we not entered the Community, the farmers would be getting a price in the region of 22p per pound for their cattle.  I am the first to admit that it is a bad year but we must be realistic and say the farmers have an option.  If the farmer has a valuation in excess of £120 he is quite entitled to put his full losses against his profits, the same as any business.  He is entitled to claim depreciation of machinery, to claim for the money spent on fertilisers, for contract work and any other expenses.</P>
    <P>We should define exactly what is a farmer.  If a man has a valuation of £90, if he is classified as a commercial farmer if he keeps perhaps 500 pigs or 10,000 poultry?  Is it right that he should be exempt from tax?  It is easy for me to speak because very many farmers in my area will not be affected by this tax, although I personally will be involved.  It is only fair that we should have a just system for all who pay income tax.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnCallanan" hpid="Mr. Callanan Mr. Callanan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Callanan</NameTxt>
      <P>I can speak with authority on this matter because I was reared on a small farm.  I worked <Col N="2047" /> on the land and I know all about it. During the Second Stage debate I said farmers had no objection to paying taxes provided their earnings justified it.  I also stated that taxation by valuation was the most unjust form that could be devised because of the variation in valuations.  I explained the reason valuations were higher in some areas.  In the old days when there was the Grand Jury some landlords did not qualify to get on the jury because their valuations were not high enough.  They applied to have the valuations raised at a time when the rates were only one penny in the £.  This unjust valuation was carried on and this is the reason for the wide variation throughout the country.  It can be seen from this that it is most unjust to assess a person's liability for taxation on the basis of his valuation.</P>
      <P>Deputy White said that it was only those who had valuations in excess of £100 who would be affected by the tax.  There are people in my area who have herds of 100 cows whose valuations are approximately £20 but, on the other hand, there are people in the Shannon area whose land is flooded for half of the year but it is valued at £2 per acre.  Thus, a man with 50 acres would be caught by this tax even though he might be classified as a development farmer.</P>
      <P>There would be some sense if the farmers were classified in the three categories.  I accept that the commercial farmers should keep accounts but it is wrong to include the transitional farmers.  If the wife of such a farmer is earning she will lose half her personal allowance.  Is this not a case where the farmer's income is being cut, although such people have been advised on many occasions to have employment outside the farm? Yet, if their farm has a valuation in excess of £20 they are affected by this measure.  I can assure the Minister that a farm with a valuation of £20 is a very poor farm and one that would not give a decent standard of living to the farmer.  Liability to tax will also apply to those whose valuation is £50.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I represent the smaller farmer and <Col N="2048" /> many in my area will not be affected. If a person is taxed, it is grossly unfair that what he pays in rates is not deducted from his tax liability. We should not apply two methods of taxation to any person.  It is most unfortunate that the Minister chose this year to introduce this measure. As Deputy Sheridan pointed out, we do not want to make a political football out of this matter.  We cannot change the international situation but the outlook for farming was never more bleak and never were people so worried.</P>
    <P>Many people borrowed money.  The minute we went into the EEC all one had to say in a bank was that one was a farmer and one got money for development.  Deputy Sheridan quoted the price increases for fertilisers <i>et cetera</i> in 12 months and how the farmer's income has fallen. None of us in this House likes to talk about that situation.  It would be better for all of us if we had a brighter picture for the farming community.  The quicker the town dwellers get it into their heads that if the farming community are poor they will be poor, the better.  This is one of the things that is not being stressed sufficiently.</P>
    <P>I know there are not many rural Deputies in the Government.  I have sympathy with the Minister for Agriculture because I think he is doing as good a job as he can but he cannot get across to his Government the serious situation that exists at present. I can see no light in the future.  I am not blaming anybody.  This is something that has happened.</P>
    <P>Things have just gone wrong and no expert has told us that they will be right in six months' time.  The future is bleak for the farming community and this will affect the cities and towns because the farming industry is one of the most important industries in the country.  If it goes down the whole economy goes with it.  It took years to build up confidence in the farming industry.  Some of us who came into farming organisations years ago know that.  James Dillon made a famous statement that at one time the farmers were the <Col N="2049" /> hewers of wood and the drawers of water.  I believe they were.  The farming community at that time suffered from an inferiority complex.  The farming community was just beingning to have confidence in themselves and a certain amount of confidence in the future.  It is as if a platform was pulled from under them.  I am not making a political football out of this.  There may be international reasons for it but it has happened.  If the Minister is going ahead with the taxing of farmers I would ask him for God's sake to take into consideration that if a man is paying rates the amount of his rates should be deducted from his tax.  I would also make a special appeal to him on behalf of the development and transitional farmers.  I would ask him not to include those in this at all.  The target for a development farmer is £1,800 per labour unit.  I do not know whether this can be achieved by many farmers now with the reduction in livestock prices.  If the instructor thinks a farmer cannot achieve that target he is no longer a development farmer&mdash;he goes into the transitional category.  It seems ridiculous to give a farmer grants on the one hand to bring him up to industrial standards and to tax him at the other end.  Those categories should not be in the net. The farmers fear this is only the thin end of the wedge.  I am trying to be constructive.  I know this Bill will be passed whether we like it or not. No man should be taxed twice.  If he pays rates the amount of rates should be deducted from his income tax. Neither the development nor the transitional farmer should be included.</P>
    <P>I feel I am entitled to speak on this.  I have been all my life a practical farmer.  I had no other way of living.  I will not go back on what Deputy Sheridan said about the different types of farming.  The sheep trade has collapsed as well as the cattle trade.  The only thing left with any reasonable income is milk but milk is a slavish job.  It is something that some people would not dream of going into.  Deputy Sheridan mentioned the number of times a cow must be milked in a week.  Would <Col N="2050" /> any other class in the country be prepared to work the long slavish hours which a farmer must work if he is in milk?  I am afraid we have not got enough men in this House who have actually done the work on a farm.  Those of us who have know what we are talking about.  I sincerely appeal to the Minister to remove those two categories from the net and to ensure that the amount of rates is deducted from the income tax.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesLeonard" hpid="Mr. Leonard Mr. Leonard">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Leonard</NameTxt>
      <P>As a Deputy who represents a constituency where the £100 valuation is the exception rather than the rule I would like to make a plea to the Minister to rethink this idea of taxing farmers at present.  I believe he was ill-advised to embark on this system of taxation at a time when production costs are soaring, when the farmers' bills for fertilisers, feeding stuffs, sprays and all the other production expenses have exploded. In the last 12 months there seems to be no control at all by the powers that should control those prices. Added to that you have the dwindling returns from the farm.  Farmers who are engaged in suckling or in store cattle production are unable to recover production costs never mind pay tax.  This seems to be the thin end of the wedge.  Many people who purchased holdings had to secure off-farm employment to pay for those farms and to rear their families.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>They will now be faced with this added burden of tax.  It has been said that some of the best farmers at present are those who also have an off-farm job.  Deputy White mentioned a farmer with a valuation of £100 with a pig enterprise perhaps of 500 pigs.  If such a person were to be taxed at present it would be on losses rather than on profits.  To tax farmers on the poor law valuation is very unfair. The Minister would have been better advised to take a look at the valuation system.  It is outmoded and needs to be examined.  In areas of the county I represent it was based on flax production.  That was the system on which poor law valuation was based at that time.  It meant that some of the heavier soils and the less fertile soils suitable for flax production <Col N="2051" /> were based on very high poor law valuation.  The Minister should not have been stampeded into this tax on farmers.  It probably was pressure from his colleagues in the Labour Party but they should have resisted that pressure at a time when farmers, apart altogether from being unable to meet extra demands at a time when there is so little confidence in farming.  This was a cruel blow.</P>
    <Speaker pid="HughGibbons" hpid="Dr. Gibbons Dr. Gibbons">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Gibbons</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to restate what Deputy Callanan stated from another point of view in relation to the modernisation farmer or the development farmer.  It seems highly illogical to me, after so many years trying to develop farming and giving them confidence in the work they are doing, that we should now propose to tax them.  I take it that the Minister has definitely made up his mind on this and having done so I think there is an obligation on him to try to establish a new basis for this taxation as distinct from the taxation of industry.  It is a totally different type of activity.  It is subject to the weather, to different types of land ownd by different farmers and to the different land values, as pointed out by other Deputies.  All those things should be considered.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would like to make a point which has not been made by anybody else.  I refer to the losses which a farmer suffers due to the death of his animals. This occurred in many places last winter.  Many farmers lost animals. Some of them even lost up to 75 per cent of their production capacity.  If we assume those people paid income tax I take it those losses would be allowed and their assessment would probably be 26p in the £, which would be one quarter of what their losses are. If a man was unfortunate enough to lose all his herd, allowing him a quarter of this for tax purposes is not sufficient because he has lost all his capital.  He has nothing to start with the following year.  It is absolutely essential that whatever basis of tax is finally established for the farming community it must be designed in such a way that he will have some clawback if he has paid tax on a previous <Col N="2052" /> occasion or he will have a clawback for the future over a number of years.</P>
    <P>This is a totally different thing to saying that he can apply his losses over the five years.  As I understand the tax system it would only in fact be the taxable amount he would be allowed. This is a different situation to that of the industrialist.  If, as a result of a fire, the industrialist finds his means of production has disappeared overnight he is usually covered by insurance so he is able to start again.  The farmer has no such insurance to cover his stock.  An industrialist may find that markets are receding and there is some recession.  Here again he can sell at a lower price.  He may be selling under cost but he is not at an absolute loss. He has something to salvage out of his work.  The farmer who loses all his animals through disease is not in a comparable position.  This is the one point I would like to make at this stage.  The other things I would like to say have been said and I do not believe in repeating them.</P>

I am not quite sure what has emerged from those discussions but it would be desirable to say the least, if the Minister placed on the record of the House now the manner in which it is proposed to deal with that problem when dealing with the application of income tax to farming.</P>

The truth is it might well suit a person to take in one year the value of his stock at the commencement of the year and the value of it at the end and in another year he might prefer to have the tax based on the stock actually sold and the profit realised on them.  As we have said it is a complex matter and one that has not been finally determined. We hope in the course of the next few months to be able to resolve this matter by agreement between the various farming organisations and the Revenue Commissioners.  Obviously, this is a matter which does not arise in its finality with any impact until the end of the year when the question of the year's profits have to be ascertained.</P>

      <P>In view of the fact that the discussions are still proceeding I cannot press the Minister to put the matter any further but I can assume that the approach to be adopted will, as the Minister indicated, be one, hopefully on which there will be general agreement and not simply a dictated form of approach based on administrative convenience.  I assume the Minister will approach it in that way.</P>

    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to draw the attention of the House to the wording of subsection (1), indeed to the words which occur in the first line.  The wording is significant.  It states:</P>
      <P>Subject to subsection (3), all farming in the State shall be treated as the carrying on of a trade.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>To those Deputies who have spoken against this whole idea of the taxation of farming and the manner in which it is taken in Chapter 2 these words should be of special significance. <Col N="2054" /> Many Deputies have indicated that they regard these proposals as simply the thin end of the wedge.  I think that feeling is widespread outside this House also.  Many people are adverting to the fact that in Great Britain when the establishment wished to introduce taxation on farmers they proceeded about it in exactly the same way as the Minister for Finance is doing in these proposals.  They first of all introduced income tax for farmers who had a valuation of £100 or more. Then when they got that across and when it was in force for some years and had come to be accepted as a fact of life, they then in due course extended the provision to cover all farmers.</P>
    <P>It is quite clear to me that that is precisely the course of action which the Minister is embarking upon.  He feels it would be politically impossible to introduce income tax for all farmers at this stage, so he is proceeding to do it by this softly softly, step by step, method.</P>
    <P>I would point out to the House and to the farmers' organisations that the wording of subsection (1) clearly indicates that that is the purpose.  The approach by the Minister in this section is to introduce an omnibus, overall provision that all farm income is taxable and then proceed to exclude certain farmers for the time being. Let us be absolutely clear that it is only for the time being that these exclusions exist in this Bill.  If it were not so, the approach should be completely different.  He could set about specifically taxing the farmers he says he wants to tax, this mythical body of large-scale, wealthy, prosperous farmers.  It is significant that his approach is to say: &ldquo;All farming is subject to taxation, and I am for the moment, for political reasons, excluding farmers who are under £100 valuation in certain circumstances, and farmers who are under £50 valuation in other circumstances, and farmers who are under £20 valuation in other circumstances.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>It is quite clear to me at any rate, knowing something about the way the machine works, that what is involved here is to bring these proposals in in <Col N="2055" /> this sort of indirect way to start with, and ultimately to abolish the various exclusions and apply the proposals to all farmers.  In addition, section 16 clearly gives further indication of that thinking.  As Deputy O'Malley pointed out very clearly on the Second Stage, the £100 is significantly breached by the proposals of section 16.</P>

      <P>Subsection (3) says: &ldquo;It shall not apply as respects any year of assessment.&rdquo;  If it was only for one year, as suggested by Deputy Haughey, we would have said: &ldquo;It shall not apply in the year 1974-75&rdquo;, but we said: &ldquo;It shall not apply as respects any year of assessment&rdquo;. Again, Deputy Haughey wants to frighten the 200,000 farmers in this country.  It is significant that they were not frightened by all the Fianna Fáil propaganda during the local elections, or if they were there would have been a massive landslide by the <Col N="2056" /> rural community, but thanks be to God they are people who know the facts of life and who understand plain language and they know whom they can trust.</P>
      <P>There are 200,625 farmers in the country on the basis of the latest known statistics.  Of those the number with rateable valuations in excess of £100 are 8,120.  The number who have rateable valuations in excess of £50 and under £100, who are professional men or who have businesses or other income, is estimated to be in the region of 7,000.  The total number, incidentally, in that valuation bracket is 20,565, but of that it is estimated that the maximum number who would have other income would be 7,000.  Therefore the maximum number of people who have profits from farming and who are affected by our legislative proposals to tax farming profits is a mere 15,120 out of 200,625 farmers.</P>
      <P>I have been criticised, and I say fairly criticised, because the proposals do not go further.  I have been criticised by people who say we have not spread the net wide enough.  But we deliberately cast the net over the people about whom it cannot be reasonably said we have not got the capacity to make a contribution towards the revenue by the system of income tax.  Never was a more gentle, a more carefully refined tax introduced, never was a new tax introduced about which greater care was taken not to apply it to people who might have to suffer hardship by reason of having to pay it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If, alleged, people in this comparatively fortunate group&mdash;and I think people with property of this rateable valuation are comparatively more fortunate than people who have a lot less&mdash;make losses on their farming activities this year, they will not be liable to tax.  That is axiomatic.  Income tax is related to capacity to pay.  That is one of its virtues and the system will be one which will enable them to set off losses against future gains.  Of course this, as is typical of Fianna Fáil meanness, has been twisted into a suggestion that the Minister for Finance is rejoicing in the possibility of the farmers making losses this <Col N="2057" /> year.  It is quite the contrary.  If they were all assured of making a handsome profit, the yield from income tax would be so much the greater. However, I am stating as a fact which cannot be contradicted by anybody and which must be a consolation to people who may make losses this year, that income tax will in no way draw any money from them.  If they make losses they cannot be liable to income tax.  That is a simple fact of life.</P>
    <P>Therefore, I wonder if we could have just a little bit of reality in this debate, less emotion, and recognition of the fact that the number affected is infinitesimal.  May I remind the House once again that it was as far back as 1960 that it was recommended that income tax should be introduced for farmers of a rateable valuation of £100. That was when incomes were a great deal less than they are now.  Notwithstanding that they now find it took 14 years before we had a Government with the courage to make the decision which any reasonably responsible society pursuing equity would long since have taken.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMGibbons" hpid="Mr. J. Gibbons Mr. J. Gibbons">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Gibbons</NameTxt>
      <P>I am grateful to the Minister for his homily to the farmers of this country about how generous and kind the Government are being about the introduction of a totally new form of second taxation on farmers of £100 valuation and upwards. I should like to say first of all that the very fact that the introduction of an income tax code is related in any way to a notional valuation of land deprives that system in my opinion of a right to be called an income tax at all.  It should hardly be necessary to point out that there will be many farmers who will just escape the net&mdash; the £98 man, the £99 man who will find themselves possibly living in comparative comfort, with very few dependants, with very little debt, with well-equipped farms.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Under the Minister's provision pitching the incidence of tax as he does at the £100 level it will be very easy to put on another couple of pounds.  For the £101 man who may have several children at school, who may have very heavy overdrafts and, <Col N="2058" /> in spite of this, if he does at some future time find himself with a profit not only will he have to pay the everascending spiraling rates on his £101 valuation but on anything, if there is anything left, that is taxable.  The fairly prosperous person without dependants, with savings invested will be free, if this is what the Minister means, whereas the other person with the dependants who, by his own hard work and endeavour, may have made a taxable portion will come under the full force of the double belt.</P>
    <P>The Minister will have to pardon me if I do not accept the bland assurances that he seems to make that in pitching the incidence of taxation at £100 that is a for-all-time measure.  I must be pardoned if I do not accept that because everybody here knows very well in his heart that this simply is not so.  This is, as Deputy Haughey said, simply the thin end of the wedge.</P>
    <P>There may be some farmers who will be reading about this tomorrow, at least reading the version that they get in the newspapers, who will be rubbing their hands in glee and saying to themselves, &ldquo;I have escaped the income tax net by a couple of pounds and the Minister did say something in the House that there was no real substance in the suspicion which was voiced by Deputies on the other side that this is merely the thin end of the wedge&rdquo;, and they may go on from there to reason that they will not be reached at all.  They had better beware because I will guarantee that if this Government are in office this time 12 months that £100 level will be lowered because even now, with levels of unemployment rising rapidly, the economic situation is generally getting out of hand and in the time-honoured way of Coalitions they will avoid taking action until it is too late and the action they will be required to take in the end is to restrain spending by the imposition of tax and it would be my guess that the tax they will impose when that occasion comes&mdash;and it is upon us&mdash;will be the extension of the levying of income tax.</P>
    <P>I should like to point out also to the Minister who seems to have some extraordinary ideas as to the comparative <Col N="2059" /> prosperity of people with valuations of this level that, unlike other large sections of the community, they have no insulation, as the others do, against the incidence of inflation; they have no wages agreement; they have no escalator clauses in their wages agreement to protect them from the uncontrolled inflation that has hit this country so severely in the last 18 months or so and that, far from being comfortable, the average and typical person upon whom this tax will be levied has taken a cut in his income as against last year of about 40 per cent, I would say.  I do not think that figure is assailable.  I think it is absolutely correct.</P>
    <P>I would imagine when the thing is processed by the economists whose business it is to process it that this will be found to be the case.  It must be the case with people who have cattle for 12 months and who cannot now get the price that they paid 12 months ago for them having fed them on feedingstuffs the cost of which has escalated out of all recognition during that period and during which period in order to carry on the day-to-day expenditure on their farms they have had to go deeper and deeper into debt in the banks where they are already in debt, where they entered willingly into debt in order to build up their herds.  Of course, the build-up of the national herd will be seen to have stopped and to have taken a turn down before the end of the year.</P>
    <P>If the Minister for Finance does not know, I am quite certain the Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries does know that the slaughtering of cows in the factories at the present time was never equalled since the State was established and in a couple of years' time there is going to be a scarcity of cattle in this country and the problems that we are encountering now in the European Community will have resolved themselves because Ireland, being the biggest cattle exporter of the lot within the Community, will have reduced the size of her herds and consequently also will have reduced the earnings of the <Col N="2060" /> country.  As Deputies have been saying to the Minister for a long time during this debate, if you strike at the prosperity of the livestock industry you reduce the standard of living of everybody in the country.</P>
    <P>I can sympathise with the Miniister for Agriculture and Fisheries whose absence from this House today is remarkable.  I understand he is in Brussels.  I can understand the problems that he would have, although he is not a farmer himself, in trying to persuade his colleagues, all city men or professional people, trade unionists, of the error of the Government's ways but he would be completely shouted down.  The Labour Party Members of the Government would remind him of the resolution of the last Labour Party conference.  Whatever Deputy Clinton might think he would be steamrolled by this uniquely urban-minded Government we have.</P>
    <P>I imagine that the pitch in the level of the incidence of income tax on farmers at £100 valuation will be lowered very dramatically next year and, thereafter, probably taken away altogether in order to catch all the little fish in the net.  It is of very little use to the Minister to introduce any form of taxation on farmers during the current year.  Except farmers are able to prove that the losses that they are sustaining they would be levied on the other basis for which there is no reasonable foundation, the 40 times the rateable valuation.</P>
    <P>Since it is a fact that the greater part of the farmers of the country do not keep any accounts of a kind that would be acceptable to the Revenue Commissioners this other form of assessment would be used.  We will have farmers paying income tax in the coming year although they would have made serious losses and their overdraft would have shot up.  They will not be able to prove it to the satisfaction of the Revenue Commissioners in the absence of books kept in a way acceptable to them.</P>
    <P>As Deputy Sheridan pointed out earlier I would be afraid of very serious agrarian trouble when the agents of the Minister and the Revenue Commissioners come with or <Col N="2061" /> without their battering rams to collect this tax.  It has never been my opinion, and I said this publicly when my Party were in Government, that farmers have a right to escape just taxation. They have not got any such right.  I said that before when I was a Member of the Government and I say it again lest it be represented that Fianna Fáil are playing politics with this.  Fianna Fáil are not playing politics. This taxation will affect me personally but that is not material to this discussion.  Like most of my fellow farmers I feel that once it is established that the tax is fair and just no person, even if he wants to complain, has a right to complain and ought not to complain.  Why should he complain when people with very small wages are bearing their share?</P>
    <P>What we are protesting about is the incredible duplicity of the Minister for Finance in blandly ignoring the protestations of the farmers' organisations who say they will pay income tax but ask the Government to derate their land, to top taxing the means of their production.  Land is the plant with which farmers work and the organisations say that if the taxation is removed from that thereafter, if there is a profit, a just share of taxation will be paid upon the income assessed.  In my view that is a very fair offer.  Further taxation above and beyond that is patently unjust.  The reason the Minister for Finance is reluctant to take it away is obvious because he has not the ability, the wish, or the comprehension of the rural situation to dismantle the obsolete and ridiculous method of local taxation that we have at present and introduce a more equitable system in its place.</P>
    <P>The rating system of local taxation that has been in operation here is getting more unsuitable and inappropriate for modern times.  Since the Minister is so fond of the recommendations of the scholarly gentlemen who examine our problems from time to time perhaps he will have regard to the recommendations made in this connection several years ago.  He should take his courage in his hands and reorganise local government <Col N="2062" /> financing because it is so patently unjust and its injustice increases so rapidly year after year as the rates go out of control that some day somebody will have to tackle it.  The likelihood is that a Fianna Fáil Government will tackle it.  We have experience in the past that Coalition Governments, by their very structure, by their very nature, have not got the unity of purpose to do anything worthwhile.  We had an example of it last week in this House, an unparalleled example by the Leader of the Government slinking into the Division Lobbies, having safely seen his little herd over to the Níl side, slinking into the Tá side.  That is the type of performance one gets from Coalition Governments and I do not think the Coalition Government would revise this unjust system of local taxation that we have.</P>
    <P>As far as I know no farmer on the Government side has spoken in this debate as yet.  That is a very significant factor.  I should like to warn farmers that as sure as there is a Bill on a duck that £100 level will be blown out the window in next year's Finance Bill.</P>

      <P>When I was interrupted I was making the point that Deputy J. Gibbons had constantly adverted to the fact that the farmers were doing badly.  They are doing badly because of prices in the Common Market and there is nothing anyone can do about it.  One of the things a good politician with the wellbeing of the farmers at heart could do would be to try to instil some confidence into the farmers. Instead of getting up here and saying <Col N="2065" /> things are going very badly and prices are going down, he should point to the good things and engender hope that cattle prices will recover and try to lead the farmers into a situation in which they will endeavour to increase their stocks.  Deputy J. Gibbons deliberately suggested their stocks would be decreased in years to come and he said that he was absolutely certain there would be a scarcity of cattle in about two years' time and almost gleefully suggested that large numbers of breeding cattle were being slaughtered for meat in the factories. These are not responsible statements.  They are related to the possible future fortunes of a political party and they will certainly not help towards improving the farmers' lot.</P>

      <P>I have only a short contribution to make.  I listened to some of the speeches of some of my colleagues across the floor and I do not think it is altogether fair to allow the suggestion to go abroad that farmers are all exceptionally poor because of the decline in cattle prices and that there is poverty raging all over the country.  Figures do not bear that out. I see nothing wrong with farmers being assessed for tax because nobody will be able to collect tax if farmers do not make a profit.  We should bear that in mind.  I should like to see an end to the rating system but, until that change comes about, there is nothing wrong in assessing farmers for tax purposes.  I know that the vast majority of them will not be called on to pay tax because they have not got the money, even <Col N="2066" /> when one takes into consideration the family farm income.</P>
      <P>I should like to remind the House now of the increase in cattle in the first six months of this year.  At the end of June we exported on the hoof 91,843 more prime cattle compared with the corresponding period last year.  The intervention price has also helped this year.

One of the difficulties with cattle at the moment is as a result of the last Government not having the foresight to provide the country with cold stores.  Not only did they not provide cold storage but they did not provide transport.  Of all the carcases exported only 17 per cent was carried in Irish registered lorries or Irish containers.</P>

      <P>I am glad to have the benefit of Deputy McDonald's contribution, after the news from Deputy Donegan.  If I were to believe both Deputies&mdash;which I do not, but others outside may&mdash;the Minister for Defence's criticism of those who have spoken against the imposition of this tax on farmers at this time and his telling of the plight of the farmers would be what I would believe.  Those who criticise the plight of the farmers are doing a disservice to the farming community.  The Minister for Defence's formula is that we should be encouraging the farmers because of the good times that are coming.  We should help them to build up their stocks.  I mean no personal offence but Deputy Donegan knows, because he is in that provender milling business, that it may be difficult to feed the animals that are there without taking on additional cattle.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am realistic enough to realise that there is over-stocking at the moment. There will be danger in the Autumn <Col N="2068" /> that the feed position will be at an extremely dangerous level.  The losses incurred may not be only in the valuation of the stock carried through the winter but as a result also of the lack of sufficient feed there may be high mortality rates.  There is no point in blinding ourselves to this fact.  That would not do any service to the farming community.  We must not fool them into believing that they can hold what they have now and perhaps even more.  The whole problem is how to feed the animals when the winter comes.  We would be wrong to be preaching any other gospel at the moment.  There are increased numbers after the efforts of several Governments and Ministers over many years in anticipation of that which has now fallen apart, namely, the Common Market.</P>
    <P>There is a shortfall of 10 per cent but certain Member countries are importing meat.  The Ministers for Defence and Finance should see what the Ministers for Agriculture and Fisheries and Foreign Affairs should do about this matter instead of talking of providing additional cold storage. It is chilly enough at the moment without talking about more chilling. We have not enough trucks to transport the beef because of bad handling by the Government in the matter of taxation of trucks in this country as against what happens in the countries with which we have to compete. Perhaps Deputy McDonald may be able to do something abroad to redress the situation.</P>

      <P>If the Minister were realistic in this matter he would reduce the tax to zero.  We are paying higher costs than others for the trucks.  These huge juggernauts are a very heavy burden as regards cost. With high interest rates I would ask Deputy McDonald what about the trucks and cold storage.  To those who talk about holding on to cattle and building up stocks over a number of years I would say that unless the Minister for Social Welfare introduced some scheme to pension off some of the animals I do not know what we will be doing two years from now.  We are not being realistic.  The sooner we get down to the reality of the situation the better.  We have a cattle population which we will not be able to carry over healthily through the winter that lies ahead. The Minister's way of encouraging farmers is to tax them.  Could there be anything more contradictory than encouraging them to keep cattle and then taxing them on their profits? A Government Deputy says that there is nothing wrong in having a tax structure for farmers, because if they do not make a profit they will not have to pay tax.  That is daft.</P>

My reason for speaking on the section was to point out that to encourage farmers to keep more cattle and to build up their hopes by giving them a false sense of security is not only dishonest but is doing a grave disservice to the farming community.</P>
      <P>There has been much talk about the time of free beef.  According to reports, the commissioners in Brussels are thinking along these lines now.  They are wise after the event.  The fact remains that there is not one four-legged animal which does not owe its owner money.  Any question of adding up figures and saying that so many more cattle were exported in the first six months of this year as compared with the same period last year is merely adding to the debt created by the collapse of prices in the market.  No amount of talking can hide these facts.  Nobody should try to cod the farmers to the degree which has been attempted by the last two speakers.</P>

      <P>Earlier in the Debate the Minister said that 77 per cent of farmers do not pay rates.  I assume he means 77 per cent of the farmers with valuations of under £20.  The total number of farmers in the country was, he said, 600,625.  If these figures are correct this means that approximately 155,000 farmers do not pay rates, leaving 45,000 other farmers 16,000 of whom he wants to bring into the tax net immediately.  While he talks about 16,000 out of 600,625, in actual fact in so far as the agricultural economy of the farmers contributing to it are concerned, on a valuation basis he is really taxing 16,000 out of 45,000.  I should like to know if what the Minister said earlier is correct, and if not, if he could explain it further.</P>

      <P>Yes.  They are exempt and those holding up to a valuation of £33 are partially exempt, but there is relief for all farm holdings. This relief is not given to other people.  Deputy Gibbons spoke about the desirability of getting rid of rates as a system of taxation.  I recall to the Deputies opposite that their own Government produced a White Paper on Local Finance and Taxation in which they came to the conclusion that there was no alternative to the system of rates.  Yet today they are arguing that we should produce an alternative which they, after long deliberations, were incapable of framing.</P>

      <P>By so doing, one imposes an additional obligation on others.  That is the reality of what is being proposed.  There is a lesser burden on the farming community than there used to be.  Fourteen or 15 years ago the farming community carried out a higher load of rates than the commercial and industrial sectors but the situation has changed very remarkably over the years so that now they are in a much more favourable position.</P>
      <P>On top of that the relief which the Government is giving by way of transferring the local rates to the central exchequer&mdash;the housing and health subsidies&mdash;will provide greater material benefit to those who are at present liable for most rates.  Therefore, even if there is validity in the argument that the larger farmer pays more tax, he is the person who will get the greatest relief by virtue of the transfer of housing and health subsidies, a transfer which I would point out will cost&mdash;by the time it is implemented in two years time&mdash;£75 million.  Therefore, already they have an advantage which is not shared by the industrial and commercial community.  On top of that, they will reap further advantage in the years immediately ahead.</P>

      <P>The Minister did not mention the fact that if a farm contained 70 acres it was 5.4 per cent; that if it contained 133 acres it was 8 per cent and, if it was 332 acres, it was 13 per cent of his gross income and, if the farm was larger still, the percentage would be higher. Therefore, the people the Minister is going to tax are paying a much higher portion of their income in rates than does the industrialist at 5.7 per cent. The services and facilities provided to the industrialist for his 5.7 per cent are much more than that which the farmer receives for his 8 per cent, 13 per cent or 15 per cent.  It makes a sad story because the industrialist and business person will have all of the services, benefits, roads and so on. Also, if he is an exporter he will enjoy tax-free profits on his exports.  The farmer is being provided with none of those facilities or services.  He is not being given any facilities for his exports; he has not got tax-free profits on his exports; he has not any of the services of the townspeople; it was in recent years only that he had electricity installed and indeed has to pay a special service charge for that.  Also when one considers the roads they are of a much lower quality than those with which the industrialist will be provided, and the industrialist usually can crack the whip with his 5.7 per cent and get extra services.  Also, <Col N="2074" /> there is no piped water supply in the country; the farmer has to instal it out of his hard-earned income.  Therefore, it is completely unfair to quote those figures.  It was always an accepted policy over the years that the rates the farmers paid represented their income tax.  Now they are being asked to pay rates and income tax, that is, if they have anything left with which to pay.

      <P>Farmers are prepared to pay their fair share of income tax and, as I said before, the rates they pay have always been regarded as the farmers' income tax.  People with valuations of over £100 are paying much higher rates than the industrialist with the large factory and all the facilities.  I would say the farmer is paying twice the rate on a percentage basis on his gross income.  Even though it is a Dublin-based Government, they must remember that it was the country people who put them where they are, to a large extent, with false promises of revision of taxation.</P>

      <P>One final question &mdash;in the nature of the operation of section 15 and Case I of Schedule D, profits or gains from farming will now be taxed.  I understand that there is a particularly iniquitous monstrous form that is used by the Revenue Commissioners in regard to farming profits.  It is called, I think, Form 80 something.  Even if the farmer keeps proper farm accounts he is still required to complete this monstrous document.  I am sure the Minister knows exactly the form to which I am referring.  Could I avail myself of this opportunity to appeal to the Minister to get rid of this form completely or, certainly in a case where farmers or accountants submit for them proper farm accounts, they will not be required to fill up this document.</P>

      <P>I thought the Opposition were supposed to be making well considered comments.  The farmers found it a useful guide because it sets out in detail various matters that are pertinent, including the allowances to which they would be entitled which might not readily occur to them.  This is a matter about which we can have further useful discussions. I know that some farmers received the forms and considered <Col N="2077" /> they were far more comprehensive and understanding of their problems than they thought the Revenue Commissioners ever could be.  On many occasions I have been critical of revenue and tax forms and I will give this matter my personal attention as well as considering the wise comments we may get from the representative farming organisations.</P>
      <P>Question put and agreed to.</P>
      <P Just="Center">SECTION 16.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanTreacy" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Seán Treacy">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>As amendments Nos. 8 and 9 are cognate they may be taken together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 8.</P>
      <P>In subsection (1) <i>(a)</i>, page 8, lines 47 and 48, after &ldquo;profession&rdquo; to add &ldquo;assessable under Case II of Schedule D&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>I regard section 16 as disasterous in its implications and in its likely repercussions. Undoubtedly it will cause many problems in its administration and it will have serious implication for the development of farming generally. Certainly it will have inimical consequences from the point of view of the prosperity of the rural community as a whole.  If we had time to do our duty as we should on this Bill, either we should abolish section 16 entirely or fundamentally alter it.</P>
      <P>I do not think it would be a fruitful exercise for us on these benches to endeavour to have section 16 completely eradicated from the Bill.  If Deputies who have a knowledge of the rural community studies this matter carefully and if they were free to act as they would wish, undoubtedly they would support a move to take the section out of the Bill completely.  Even a superficial consideration enables one to recognise the many difficulties and hardships that will arise because of the operation of section 16.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The section was put forward for very limited reasons but in its operation it will have a much more comprehensive effect than was suspected <Col N="2078" /> when originally drafted.  I warn the Minister that it will cause endless trouble, apart from the serious hardships and injustices involved.  I have put forward the amendments in an endeavour to make a very minor improvement in the section.  It is obvious from the wording of the amendments what I am endeavouring to do.</P>
    <P>Broadly speaking, section 16 sets out deliberately to breach the concession in regard to the £100 valuation limit contained in section 15. Section 15 states that in the case of a farmer whose valuation does not exceed £100 he will not come within the ambit of Chapter II and the scope of the income tax code.  Section 16 immediately proceeds to weaken that section.  In effect it says that if a farmer or his wife is engaging in any business other than farming the limit of £100 does not apply and these people will be brought into the income tax net unless the valuation is less than £50.  The effect of section 16 will be that in the case of a farmer whose valuation is between £50 and £100, if he or his wife are engaged in any other business they will be liable for income tax not only on their other business but also on their entire farming profits.  As Deputy O'Malley pointed out on the Second Stage, immediately the £100 limit is breached.</P>
    <P>I wish to direct the attention of the House to the wording of section 16 (1) (a) and (b).  Deputies will see that the subsections are worded to ensure that if a farmer or his wife, either solely or in partnership with someone else, carry on a trade or profession they will be brought within the net even though the valuation is between £50 and £100.  I have sought to insert in both paragraphs after the word &ldquo;profession&rdquo; the words &ldquo;assessable under Case II of Schedule D&rdquo;.  It is important to make that distinction.</P>
    <P>If the Minister wishes to go ahead with this iniquitous proposal he should confine the provisions of section 16 to cases where people are actually carrying on a business outside their farming activities.  As the section is framed at the moment, it seems it will have the effect of including people who have <Col N="2079" /> valuations in the £50 or £100 category, even if they are employed in a profession outside farming.  In this instance a profession would cover a nurse, teacher, doctor, a veterinary surgeon or a host of other vocations.</P>
    <P>I want to make it clear that in this section we are not dealing with the provision whereby the tax allowances of a person who has off-farm income are reduced.  That comes later in the Bill.  In this section we are dealing with the case of a farmer and his wife who have any other business outside farming and, because of that, their farm profits will be taxed in full.  The exemption which applies to other farmers of between £50 and £100 valuation will be denied to them.  That is the situation and in that situation I think the appropriate test to apply from the Minister's point of view&mdash;and I do not, even though I am arguing his case, want it to be thought that I am going along with the Minister's thinking in this regard&mdash;but even from his point of view these provisions should be restricted to cases where a farmer and his wife are actually carrying on a business in the professional sense and not, perhaps, exercising that profession as a salaried employer or a part-time employee.  That is the effect of my amendment&mdash;to make it clear that these provisions would only come into operation if the profession is being practised perhaps, really in a selfemployment capacity.</P>
    <P>But if a farmer's wife or the farmer himself happens to have a profession and earns some income from it, the very fact of earning that income would not operate to make them liable for tax on their farm income in this £50-£100 bracket.  It seems to me that apart from anything else, as the section is framed at present it would give rise to this anomaly: if one farmer in the £50-£100 bracket had a wife who was a nurse&mdash;I take a nurse because it would be regarded as a profession&mdash;who practised her profession and earns some income from it&mdash; indeed, as the section is framed she would not have to earn a great deal of income from the practice of her profession; I think the section could <Col N="2080" /> operate even if she earned no income so long as she practised the profession&mdash;however, you would have the case of one farmer whose wife had a profession, a nurse or teacher or something like that and the fact that she practised that profession would make him liable while another farmer whose wife had a job which was not a profession in the accepted sense&mdash; for instance as secretary of a local business, a creamery or a factory&mdash; that farmer would not be brought into the tax net because his wife had an income from a job which could not be described as a profession and would not therefore come within the general terms of the Bill.</P>
    <P>Nothing we could do by way of amendment to section 16, unless it were pretty radical and fundamental, would make it acceptable to me but if we must have a section 16 the amendments which I am putting forward and urging the House to accept would, perhaps, do something to ameliorate the absurd situation the section creates and would have the effect of avoiding the type of anomaly I have described.</P>

      <P>As I explained on the Second Stage of the Bill this section is, to a large extent, an anti-avoidance measure to bring to an end some of the most appalling scandals which have arisen by reason of the fact that farming profits were exempt from tax and some people engaged in other businesses or professions set off profit from their trades or professions against farming profits in order to avoid paying a fair share of tax.  I instanced cases like a veterinary surgeon who claimed to be earning less than £1,500 in his veterinary practice&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>With respect, I am on the amendments and if I am <Col N="2081" /> extended the courtesy which I have extended to others of being allowed to proceed without interruption I shall show the Deputy how relevant my remarks are.  I instanced a case of a veterinary surgeon who claims to be earning less than £1,500 from his profession&mdash;he must be a very rare specimen&mdash;and who claims to be earning something in the region of £45,000 from his farm.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, but wait.  There is the case of a dentist who claims to be earning from his profession something around the £4,000 mark and twice that amount from his farming profits.  Or take a doctor who claims to be earning from his trade or profession&mdash;medical practice&mdash; £2,500 and in excess of £10,000 from his&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;farming profits. Those are cases which shows the absolute necessity to bring shameful practices like that to an end.  Why should such people who are making enormous profits from their trade or profession use a device to set these profits off against farming profits and thereby escape proper tax liability on their true income?  Deputy Haughey is interpreting the word &ldquo;professional&rdquo; in a non-tax way.  He is regarding any person who obtains a professional qualification as a person who would be caught by this section. That is not so.  If he is an accountant, a solicitor or doctor who happens to be the employee of another, that person will pay tax under Schedule E and not Schedule D.  A trade or profession for tax purposes refers to a sole trader, to a person who is self-employed, to a person selling his or her skills directly and that is the profession and there is no need to add the words &ldquo;assessable under Case II of Schedule D&rdquo;.  First, it is unnecessary to use the words that Deputy Haughey proposes.</P>

    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Further, there is a very good reason why we should not do it because there is at least one profession, which occurs to me, which is not assessable under Case II of Schedule D because it is an exempt profession and that is the profession or activity of writer, author or artist. Such a person is exempt under Case II of Schedule D.  If an author's earnings from his profession are exempt from tax he could then get exemption also in respect of his farming profits.  It would not seem to me that would be correct.  Many people envy authors and artists the exemption they enjoy and Ministers for Finance are under considerable pressure to remove this exemption which is a cause of annoyance to people who do not enjoy it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I consider that it would be very wrong indeed if in addition those people who were enjoying the exemption, were by reason of that exemption also to get exemptions in respect of their profits from farming, as suggested by Deputy Haughey's amendment.  They would be benefits not available to other members of the community.</P>
      <P>We will have to consider this matter in the light of the manner in which I have approached it and not risk any further loopholes than are absolutely necessary.  What we are trying to do is to close loopholes and to ensure that the proper tax is paid by people who are lucky enough to have a professional skill or a business outside their farm interests.  Many of the people who have businesses outside farming have inherited them and it would be totally wrong that such people should enjoy exemptions from two sources of incomes.  We want to close that loophole.</P>

    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>I am afraid the Minister has not attempted to answer my argument.  He has gone off into another irrelevant side issue.  In order to bring him precisely to my amendment <Col N="2083" /> I ask him is it his intention&mdash;I think it is&mdash;that these provisions will only operate where a person carries on a profession in a business sense; in other words, if a person is employed at a profession for a salary, he will not come within the ambit of these two paragraphs&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>In respect of their farming profits, of course such people will not pay income tax on their wages or salaries.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>But is it not the Minister's intention that if a person is simply employed in an office or profession that such employment will limit the £100 valuation?  That is what I have thought the Minister's intention to be and therefore I submit he must accept my additional words or some similar words.  If the Minister's only objection to inserting the words I am suggesting is that they would bring in writers who are brought in by virtue of the 1969 Act, then a simple proviso to exclude people in the arts profession would meet the case, and it is perfectly simple for the Minister to insert the words I have suggested and perhaps to add others. Then he would get over the difficulty in relation to writers, artists and so on. That would dispose of the Minister's argument in that respect which leaves us solely with his suggestion that my words are not necessary.</P>
      <P>Even on his own statement, they are necessary because he does not intend that people who are exercising their professions in employment should be involved in this.  Therefore, the Minister wishes these two paragraphs to apply exclusively to people who are practising their professions in a self-employed way as businesses and who are earning profits or gains in that respect.  In order to make a distinction, he must insert my words or append some similar form of words.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>If there was validity in Deputy Haughey's remarks, then such words would long since have been used in tax laws.  The words in this section have very significant meanings: there is no room for any doubt about them.  The fact that the person is a <Col N="2084" /> professional does not mean that the person automatically comes under Case 2, Schedule D.  People come under that only if they are operating on their own.  If they are employees, they come under Schedule E.</P>

    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>I ask the Minister a simple question.  Is it his contention that if a farmer's wife, who is a nurse is employed at a local hospital in pursuance of her profession, and her earnings are taxed under PAYE, that that will not operate to bring the farmer within the provisions of section 16 (1), thereby making him liable for income tax?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>If she is paying tax through PAYE this would not apply to herself or her husband, but if she is operating on a fee basis, it would.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>That is precisely the problem I am getting at.  If the Minister says that is the position, of course I accept it, but it seems to me that for proper drafting or, may I say, proper legislating, he should have spelled out here that it is only people who are fee-paid and are assessable under Schedule D who are involved.  Therefore, I do not see why the Minister cannot add the words I have suggested, or a similar form of words.</P>

      <P>I should like to ask the Minister if this would apply equally to farmers&mdash;there are many of this kind&mdash;who have trades like carpentry and so on.  They might use such occupations as adjuncts to their farming operations.  The scale of such operations varies a great deal and I should like to know what the position would be in relation to a farmer-builder or a farmer-carpenter. I am referring to people who would take work as they got it.  Will such a person be assessed first on his <Col N="2085" /> earnings as a carpenter and thereafter as a farmer with a valuation between £50 and £100?  There is another class of person I want to ask the Minister about.  Throughout the country there are a great many village or crossroads shops which sell bread, butter, tea and so forth.  The profitability of that type of business cannot be large but frequently it occupies most of the time of the woman.  What will the position of people like that be?  There are also people like sub-postmasters who have farming interests.  The office might be run by the wife of a farmer who would have a valuation of between £50 and £100.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 9a:</P>
      <P>9a.  In page 9, line 20, to delete &ldquo;£50&rdquo; and to substitute &ldquo;£50, or if it did so exceed £50, that any trade carried on by his spouse consisted solely of the provision of such accommodation being ancillary to the farming of that farm land.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>The purpose of this amendment is to ensure that where accommodation which is called farm guesthouse accommodation is offered, income arising from that activity would not disqualify the farm in question, even if the valuation of the farm in question exceeded £50, from being exempt from taxation.  I am sure Members will recall that in the course of my comments on the Second Stage of the Bill I said I thought this was an activity which should be encouraged, and, because it was so directly and immediately related to the farm, unless it is a farm that cannot be a farm house and therefore cannot have farmhouse accommodation, I felt that it would be appropriate that this should not be deemed to be a trade or occupation or profession separate from the farming activity.</P>
      <P>On that account I offer this amendment which will ensure that such cases&mdash;I think Deputy Gibbons shares my views on this&mdash;would not disqualify the farmer from the exemption which he can continue to enjoy on his farming activities, even though his wife may for some parts of the year take in guests under the farmhouse holiday scheme.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad that the Minister has accepted the proposal which I and other Deputies on this side of the House made on the Second Stage discussion, that farmhouse holidays should not be adversely affected by the proposals in this Bill. We were very concerned at this, and I am glad that the Minister has now found it possible to devise an amendment which apparently will secure this position.  I think this is a step in the right direction.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is all that the Minister can do in relation to this section, but I wonder <Col N="2087" /> whether a similar situation can arise on another section, that is, section 28 relating to the halving of this allowance, and whether the Minister has given thought to the effect, in the farmhouse holidays case, of section 28.  I am mentioning that now.  It may be inappropriate but since we are dealing with the farmhouse holiday scheme, perhaps the Minister could indicate, when replying, what he thinks of that situation.  Furthermore, I would hope that, as indicated earlier, the Minister would on this amendment enlighten us in regard to the queries raised by Deputy Gibbons before we adjourned.  Deputy Gibbons raised matters of considerable practical importance in rural Ireland and the answers to the questions he raised will be of considerable interest to all of us and to all of those who sent Deputies here from various parts of rural Ireland.  We look forward to the Minister spelling out the precise position of the various categories mentioned by Deputy Gibbons to see what is the position and, if necessary, what can be done about the position arising in regard to those people.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to deal with the first point that Deputy Colley made.  The situation of the £20 valuation in the case under section 28 and this one is not the same because there is no question of bringing in the farming profits of a person with £20 valuation or less for tax purposes. What I am doing here is ensuring that farming profits are not to be brought in for tax purposes merely because the lady of the house has taken in farm guests.  There is no question of taxing the farm income in that case.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, but there is a question of halving the allowances where the wife is earning in any capacity.  I think that would be a correct version of it, would it not?</P>

    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>First of all, the fact that the Minister has had to put down an amendment in this way underlines <Col N="2088" /> more clearly than anything else could the sort of situation this section is going to bring about.  This is just something that has surfaced.  The Minister realises that it is serious enough to warrant bringing in an amendment on it, but I am quite convinced that there are a multitude of similar situations which might arise and which do not perhaps immediately come to our minds.  It is the farmhouse situation that is involved in this amendment and I shall endeavour to deal with that.  The fact that the Minister has done this simply underlines the dangers of other situations which are not covered.  I want to suggest one or two of them that come to my mind.  For instance, what about the situation particularly in the scenic tourist areas where a farmer would decide to establish a caravan site on his land?  It would seem to me that that would be very closely allied to the farmhouse holiday situation.  Another instance that strikes me is the case of a riding school where an enterprising farmer or his wife could establish a riding school ancillary to their farming activities.  Would these kinds of activities merit the same attention the Minister is now giving in this amendment to the farmhouse holiday scheme?  They are just two things that strike me should also be catered for. I mention them because I am quite certain as time goes on and as this section comes into operation throughout the rural community it certainly will bring very serious problems in regard to many of those types of situations.</P>
      <P>I should like to ask the Minister about another point in regard to his amendment.  It would seem to me that the amendment will not relate to paragraph (c) where a prudent farmer and his wife, as they might well do, formed a company, in which they had a holding over 25 per cent, to enable them to bring in somebody else's capital.  It seems that the Minister's amendment does not cope with that kind of situation, because the Minister's amendment to subsection (2) and subsection (3) seems to confine itself exclusively to the situation where a spouse is carrying on a trade.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2089" /> Section 16, by virtue of paragraph (c), involves us in a situation where the trade in question would be carried on by a company.  Once the farmer or his wife would have a shareholding of more than 25 per cent and be a director of that company, section 16 would come into operation.  In a case where a farmer or his wife formed the company, in which they were directors and held more than 25 per cent, to run the holiday farmhouse business, they would not be saved by virtue of this amendment which the Minister is bringing in.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanCrinion" hpid="Mr. Crinion Mr. Crinion">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Crinion</NameTxt>
      <P>Some of the farmers are very worried about this aspect of the farmhouse holiday scheme because it is really seasonal work. Other aspects of it should be clarified. Quite a number of guesthouses have to provide other services such as fishing boats, particularly in the west of Ireland.  They charge for them.  There is a certain amount of income coming from that and I should like to know if that will be included in the exemption.</P>
      <P>In the hunting areas the farm guesthouses and others would be hiring out hunters during the hunting season.  This would be quite a substantial amount as the cost of keeping hunters for hire is high.  The charge for hunting has been increased to between £10 and £15 a day.  This could amount to a large amount of money and there would not be much profit made from it.  The person concerned would have a lot to show in his costs to an inspector of taxes.  The same thing would apply to pony-trekking in the mountains in Wicklow and Kerry, but it would not be quite as expensive.  I should like to know if these sports are included.  What way will assessment be made in the case of farm guesthouses where the farm is over £100 valuation?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In a number of cases those farm guesthouses are big old houses.  The farmer's wife would need to redecorate and restore them before deciding to go into the guesthouse business, as it would not pay her to build a lot of new rooms.  I have seen cases where the existing house has been remodelled, and it takes some <Col N="2090" /> time before the old house can be brought up to modern standards and to find money to do this. You can get only the normal reconstruction grant; you do not get the Bord Fáilte grants.  If the house is over £100 valuation you must keep full account of the work.  If the people with a valuation of over £100 have to show all their income for tax purposes, many of them will go out of business during the next year or two.  This would have a detrimental effect on our tourist trade, particularly when we have been trying to build up this type of catering and accommodation.  It is the one place where visitors can meet the Irish people at home.  It has proved quite successful, not by numbers, but the scheme has given a service and accommodation that cannot be got anywhere else.</P>
    <P>Another aspect of this is that in the section one should consider a person who is on a fixed salary, such as a civil servant who has a farm.  As in the case of a person with a valuation of over £100, he should be given the option&mdash;there may not be many who will avail of it&mdash;to obtain 40 times the valuation.  This would be an incentive to a person who is in the £50-£100 bracket, who is earning a salary subject to PAYE and whose wife and himself are doing this only to try to secure capital to put into the farm; or perhaps they have just bought the farm or are enlarging their holding and need capital for a few years in order to provide the extra stock to meet the extra repayments until the farm is fully developed.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LiamCunningham" hpid="Mr. Cunningham Mr. Cunningham">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cunningham</NameTxt>
      <P>Could I query the Minister on some of the terminology in this statement?  For instance, the word &ldquo;accommodation&rdquo; is very wide; it can cover the matters mentioned by Deputy Haughey and by Deputy Crinion, and indeed other activities as well.  Does the Minister intend that the word &ldquo;accommodation&rdquo;' should be confined strictly to guesthouse and holiday accommodation, or does he intend that it should be widened to embrace other types of accommodation, not only for persons but for animals, for greyhound training and other activities?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2091" /> If it does mean guest accommodation, then will the concession be given if the guest accommodation is not registered with the Irish Tourist Board?  Must the accommodation be registered?</P>
    <P>Under the terminology here: &ldquo;in buildings on the said farm land&rdquo; we can visualise something different from the farmhouse holiday.  In other words, the farmhouse holiday is confined strictly to the farmhouse which is usually registered.  Supposing it is a guesthouse, a hotel, a motel or other accommodation in buildings on the said farm land, would they qualify for the same tax concession?  Must the accommodation be ancillary to the farming of that land?  That is, if it is farmhouse accommodation, must the produce of the farm be used or, if a guesthouse is allowed for the purpose of this concession, could that be regarded as in the same category as the farmhouse accommodation?  These are points on which I would like clarification.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMGibbons" hpid="Mr. J. Gibbons Mr. J. Gibbons">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Gibbons</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not wish to prolong the discussion unduly, but before business was suspended I raised the question of certain categories of people and the Ceann Comhairle told me that it would be better dealt with under the Minister's amendment which is now before us.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As far as I can see, this amendment deals with a very carefully defined class of people, the people who cater for farmhouse holidays, who give farmhouse accommodation and for nobody else.  I am concerned about a much larger class of people.  Of course, I welcome the Minister's amendment in this area; I mentioned it before the Minister's amendment arrived before the House.  The Minister may not be aware that there are large numbers of rural people working at trades of various kinds, such as carpenters, builders, metal-workers and so on, who do not work full-time at their trades but take commissions from their neighbours and from people in their locality to carry out certain work.  The methods used in this type of neighbourly activity vary <Col N="2092" /> to such an extent that in my opinion they are completely outside the ambit of the Minister's amendment.  If the Minister's section 16 is implemented, this whole area of rural activity will be damaged and interfered with.</P>
    <P>I should also like to hear from the Minister what the position will be with regard to people who operate small shops in the country.  I know that the people on this side of the House are very familiar with this type of rural institution.  Some of them cannot be very profitable because the number of potential customers is very small.  They provide a very specialised type of service.  They sell bread, butter, tea, newspapers and a few odds and ends of this kind. This enterprise is usually operated by the wife in a rural family.  In all these cases of rural tradesmen&mdash;he may be a metal worker, a skilled building worker, a carpenter, a plumber, or he may be an agricultural contractor on a small scale, a man with a tractor and plough, a tractor and mowing machine, or he may be a more ambitious kind of agricultural contractor with a whole range of machinery&mdash;it is not at all clear from what the Minister has told us so far how all these categories of people will fare under the new taxation arrangements. Will the self-employed tradesman farmer be taxable once his valuation passes £50?  If he is, the Minister will have done a very serious disservice to people who try to augment their incomes by engaging in these extra-agricultural activities.  Those who do engage in these activities are the most industrious and active people in the community.  A good many of them have specialised skills of one kind or another.  It would appear from what we have heard so far that farmers of this kind will be liable for the full belt of rates and income tax after the £50 level.</P>
    <P>I should like to hear from the Minister if there is to be only one exemption&mdash;the exemption mentioned in his amendment 9 (a)&mdash;from among all these extra-agricultural activities envisaged in the case of farmhouse accommodation.  What about all the other categories?</P>
    <Col N="2093" />
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Perhaps we ought to add to the list of Deputy Gibbons the hundreds of thousands of traders, carpenters, and labourers who have not got any alternative source of income and who are at present caught within the income tax net.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMGibbons" hpid="Mr. J. Gibbons Mr. J. Gibbons">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Gibbons</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>So they are animals? We are trying to end the discrimination and privilege which certain people enjoyed.  We want to have people treated equally; everybody should be equal before the law.  We promised to cherish the children of the nation equally and these are children of all ages.  That requires that obligations as well as rights should be equal, and this requires that everybody pays his or her fair share of taxes.</P>
      <P>The reason why I brought in the amendment in relation to the farm guesthouse was that it is the kind of activity that several housewives can engage in for only a couple of months a year.  They, perhaps, do it when the children are on school holidays and it is something which brings in a little extra income.  In the olden days when it was proper to do so, the wife was rearing chickens and selling the eggs or fattening a few bonhams or something else.  She would be engaged in a farming activity and it would be treated as such.  The two activities are so closely related to the farmhouse, the farm occupancy, the operations of the family, that we considered it very appropriate that they should be treated as directly related to the family and to the use of family property by the family.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Now, suggestions have been made that we should go beyond that.  I do not think we would be justified in going beyond that.  Take the case illustrated of a person having an income by laying out caravan sites on the land or by conducting a riding school.  These activities are, at the moment, liable to tax; I am not saying they are all paying tax.  The Revenue Commissioners at the moment are more concerned getting after the bigger fish in the sea than chasing everybody for the small activities which, when minutely <Col N="2094" /> examined might throw up a few shillings or pounds.</P>
    <P>Deputy Gibbons mentioned the case of the small shop which is providing an amenity in rural areas far beyond the actual cash or profit it is worth to the person who is operating it. Again, let us face realities.  The Revenue Commissioners have more than enough to do to proceed to collect tax from the substantial people who are clearly identifiable without pursuing every huckster shop in the country to see who operates it and so on.  However, if a person is lucky enough to not only have a farm with a rateable valuation of £50 but who has some other pursuit as well then they will be involved.  Any person who is a carpenter or a builder, and who is employed by another will not, because he has £50 valuation and so on, be brought into the net.  But, if he sells the service as a contractor as distinct from being an employee he will be brought within the net.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>That is not in the Bill. What is in this section is whether the farm activities of between £50 and £100 valuation should be taxed.  The Minister is saying that where a person has a farm of over £50 valuation, and below £100, if he sometimes engages in an activity freelance, say as a carpenter, then his farming activities should be taxed.  Is that what he is saying?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>What I am saying is that if a person at any time in that year of assessment, is also carrying on solely or in partnership another trade or profession then his profits from the farm will be taxed.  If that person happens to be an employee that person will pay every penny that the law <Col N="2095" /> requires in respect of that income. Because they have not been involved in respect of their farming profits in the past we have had these disgraceful cases of people setting off profits earned from their trade or occupation against farming so as to get total exemption.  We either are determined to aid these cases or we are not.  What I am being pressed to do from the other side of the House is to extend the exemption provisions further and further so that instead of broadening the base for taxation, which we must do if we are to get near the more equitable codes elsewhere, and to keep the base as narrow as it is at the moment.  We are not prepared to do that.</P>

Does he want to have the kind of thing we talked about, the veterinary surgeon with the £25,000 or does he want to get at, on the farming side, the farmer who has a medium sized holding and who for a few months of the year may do some other activities?  There is surely a vast difference between the two categories. Which category does the Minister want to get at?  Is it both?</P>

One concerns the farmer who is a teacher and, therefore, a member of a profession; the other is a farmer who is, say, an electrician employed by a local authority.  The teacher-farmer, if he is single, earns £1,724 per year.  The electrician could have an income of, say, £2,200.  The teacher does not pay his income tax through the PAYE system but the electrician does.  Does this mean that the teacher-farmer, although his professional income is less than the other, will be caught by this and the electrician <Col N="2097" /> or plumber or any other person who is under the PAYE system will go scot free?</P>

Deputy Colley was trying to extract <Col N="2098" /> from the Minister the distinction that section 16 operates between a person who is engaged in a trade or profession on a part-time business basis and the person who is engaged in a trade or profession as an employee. This section does not make it clear that there is a distinction.  The Minister now says there is and that subsection (1) will only apply to people who make profits from their trade or profession as independent, self-employed business people and not as employees.  In reply to Deputy Colley who raised the question in regard to a person who has a trade or profession and is an employee, he said that he was taxed anyway through PAYE.  But that is not the point.  Both of them should be taxed and I presume they are both taxed.  The fact that the employee is taxed is not the relevant consideration.  What we are concerned with here is that the section involves him in paying tax on his farming activities.  The fact that he is engaging, whether as an employee or an independent, self-employed person in some other trade or profession and that the valuation of his farm is over £50, will involve his farming profits being fully taxed.  The fact that the Minister said, in regard to an employed person, that he is taxed already shows that he misses the whole point. I do not blame the Minister for giving what Deputy Colley has described as a misleading answer because the section is a mess.  The best thing the Minister could do at this stage is to drop it, abandon it.  It will involve all sorts of problems and difficulties and inconsistencies when it comes into operation, apart altogether from the social implications, as Deputy Gibbons has pointed out.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am cleaning up a polluted mess.  What Deputy Haughey suggests is the theory, the beautiful theory.  But the practice is, and has been, and this is widespread and is becoming more widespread and more corrupt, that many of these people are setting off the profits they earn on their extra-farming activities against farming profits and, thereby, getting total exemption for their income.  There have been cases of this <Col N="2099" /> kind challenged by the Revenue Commissioners in court, but, unsuccessfully because this mix takes place.  This is not the first time throughout the discussion on this Finance Bill that we have hit this bitter, really vicious opposition to our measures to stop avoidance of tax.  It does not surprise me.  Every time one moves against this there are a thousand and one anomalies.  The most far-fetched cases are illustrated to show how wrong we are.</P>
      <P>I could occupy the time from now until 9 a.m. giving lists of people who have two incomes&mdash;one from farming and one from other activities &mdash;and they claim that their income from other activities, which in some cases they spend 11 hours a day at, is only a fraction of what they claim to earn from small agricultural holdings.  If I were to use the profits which they claim are from their agricultural holdings as typical of the profits from agriculture I would have a multiplier of about 5,000 in some cases as the profit which some of these people claim to be earning for every £1 of valuation that they have at present.</P>
      <P>The ordinary small holder who is rendering service to his neighbour and is employed by his neighbour is not going to be caught by this.  Is there anybody opposite who wants to defend the scandal of the veterinary surgeon who claims to be earning less than £1,500 from his veterinary practice at which he spends 12 or 14 hours a day and claims to be earning £42,000 from farming?</P>
      <P>This can be stopped by doing what we are doing, which is a reasonable way.  The Fianna Fáil Party have two choices; leave things as they are, which will allow many rotten abuses to continue, or else tax all farmers. Do they want to tax all farmers or not?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>I had intended to wait, but in view of the way the discussion has developed it appears that what I have to say would be relevant at this stage, although we are technically on the amendment.  I agree entirely with Deputy Haughey's description that this section is a mess.  There is no other way one can describe it.  I have tried to analyse why it is such a mess and if one paid any attention to what was being said by various speakers from this side, one could see that they were mentioning, not, as the Minister suggested, outlandish examples, but examples of things that are happening every day in ordinary life in rural Ireland that are going to be affected by this section.</P>
      <P>The Minister presented his case for this section at the beginning, and again now, on the basis of huge tax avoidance.  That is the case he made. If that is what he wants to deal with there is one possible approach which I will come back to later.</P>
      <P>The more one listens to the Minister the more one wonders whether he really wants to get at the big tax avoiders and does not know how to do it and, therefore, has to get at everybody in sight or whether his real objective is that by talking loudly about big tax avoiders, to get at people who could not by any stretch of the imagination be described as tax avoiders, through the back door by using the alleged tax avoiders as the excuse.  I am not sure which is his objective but it is about time the Minister told us.  When we asked him what was his objective he said it was to produce an equitable tax system whereby everybody with a comparable income paid the same amount of tax.  That is not what he is doing at all in this section.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>He is providing in this section for a situation in which a farmer with farmland of a valuation over £50&mdash;it could be very little over £50&mdash;who engages in some other kind of trade on a free-lance basis is brought in.  Deputy <Col N="2101" /> Gibbons mentioned a number of examples.  If this man earns £100 a year in this way the effect under this section is that as a consequence of doing that his farming activities at £51 valuation become subject to income tax.  However, under the Minister's Bill, a farmer who does not engage in those activities but who has a farm with a £99 valuation does not pay any tax. In that circumstance, how can the Minister tell us that he is trying to create a situation in which people with comparable incomes will pay comparable tax?</P>
    <P>It is all very well to mouth these platitudes but the practicality of the matter is that the Minister is not doing that.  He is not trying to do that and if he gets wise he will realise it is not possible to do that and be equitable. One can be equitable in theory, on paper, but in practice one is not.</P>
    <P>The Minister is producing a section which has the effect of penalising heavily, as against much larger farmers, small and medium-sized farmers who engage, as they do, and as has been illustrated here in many parts of rural Ireland, in other activities from which they may not earn very much money, but because they engage in these activities their farming profits are to be taxed while much bigger farmers are not to have their profits taxed.  Is that not an unreasonable proposition?  This is a situation which the Minister could not defend.  There is no use the Minister talking about the most inequitable tax system in Europe.  He is producing here a system which is far more inequitable than any system we have ever known. One of the reasons for this is that he is blinded by all this talk about huge tax avoiders.</P>
    <P>I am giving the Minister the benefit of the doubt that he is not using this as the excuse to get in the back door.  The result is that he produces a section ostensibly to get at these tax avoiders.  Is he seriously telling us that there is no other way to get at them except by means of this section?  Is the Minister seriously telling us that the Revenue Commissioners, with the powers they have, if <Col N="2102" /> they come across a case of a veterinary surgeon who, according to the Minister, claimed he was earning £1,500 from his veterinary practice and £42,000 from his farming, do not sit on that man's practice, examine it thoroughly and give him an assessment based on what they think his real earnings are?  Let the man appeal against this and prove the situation. They have often done that where they had grounds for suspicion.  That is the right way to get at tax avoiders and not bring in every small and medium-sized farmer who engages in activities outside his farm in a small way.  Does it make sense to approach the matter in this way?</P>
    <P>The Minister cannot be serious in telling us that this is a reasonable section, the object of which is to get at tax avoiders.  That argument does not stand up to examination.  If that is what the Minister means, would he listen to what is being said and realise that what he is producing here is a Frankenstein which can do enormous damage in rural Ireland. Let him get at the problem another way.</P>
    <P>If his objective really is to get at these people, let him say so honestly. Then we will know where we stand and we can judge the Bill on that basis.  A great deal of the confusion which has arisen is because the Minister is giving as his reason for this an objective which is not being dealt with adequately in this section but which produces a totally different effect from the one which the Minister says he is aiming at.  Would the Minister tell us what he really wants to do?  We can judge the section, and the Bill, on that basis.  It is no use saying he is trying to achieve a situation in which people with comparable incomes will pay comparable tax.  It is demonstrable from the terms of the Bill that he is not trying to do that.  We can help him, perhaps, if it is really the tax avoiders he is trying to get at because we are as anxious, and, perhaps, more anxious, than he is to get at them but we are not anxious to have tax avoiders used as an excuse to get at the ordinary farmers in a way that their much bigger farmer neighbours <Col N="2103" /> are not being got at.  The Minister will have to justify the inequity which he is producing directly in this section.</P>
    <P>We feel that the number of cases of the kind the Minister described cannot be very great, but I am certain if the Minister were to have one or two of those cases tackled in the way I described it would be far more effective in stopping this kind of tax avoidance than this section could ever hope to be. The Minister will find that this section is going to produce so many anomalies that he will be coming in here with amendments and amendments to the amendments and further amendments and the whole situation will be chaotic. I appeal to him at this stage to have some practical common sense and look at what he is doing in this section.</P>
    <P>Does he realise that what he is providing here is that a farmer, with a valuation of just over £50, who engages in some kind of free-lance activity and makes, say £100 a year is going to have his farming profits taxed while a company director can own up to 25 per cent of the shares in a large company and will not have his farming profits taxed under this section which is supposed to be producing equity, which is supposed to be aimed at tax avoiders?  The Minister cannot be serious.  If he really wants to get at tax avoiders, would he assure us that is his real objective and we will try to help him?  If he wants to get at the other people we have referred to, let him say that and be clear about it so that we are not going to waste time in confusion. Do not let the Minister try to tell us that this section is aimed at producing equity.  On the face of it, it is demonstrably untrue.</P>

Is that fair to the farmer with just over £50 valuation? His farm will be subject to tax. Is that fair?

When that system came in people with moderate incomes, such as road workers, office employees, forestry workers and many other categories on modest incomes, became liable to paying the last penny of taxation.  They had and have no way out.  It is deducted from their weekly wage while, at the same time, many people earning far more than those in the categories mentioned, as well as, as somebody mentioned, solicitors, accountants, professional people of all kinds, self-employed people of all kinds, doctors and so on&mdash;&mdash;</P>

        <i>(Cavan):</i> I am coming to the amendment.  As a general principle, it was decided to tax farmers with a valuation of £100 or over.  The Minister found it necessary to look into the position of farmers who, in addition to engaging in the orthodox profession of farming were also engaged in other gainful activities and he had to look at the position generally.</P>
      <P>He decided that a farmer with a poor law valuation of £50 who is engaged in other profit-making activities should be brought into the net, generally speaking, and this amendment seeks to remove some people from that net.  The amendment seeks to relieve the farmhouse holiday activity from income tax even if the owner of that house has a farm with a poor law valuation of £50.  I consider that absolutely reasonable.  That is the amendment before the House. Is there any reasonable objection to that amendment?  I do not think there is.  But, arising out of that amendment, we have had a long debate here which seeks to exempt a variety of categories from paying income tax even if they have farms with a poor law valuation of £50.  I believe that, so long as the PAYE system compels a typist to pay income tax on an income of £25 a week, a woodworker to pay income tax on his wage, or a forestry worker to pay income tax on his wage, then the man who has a poor law valuation of £50 on his farm and, at the same time&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>What is the position where a farm has two dwellings and one of them is used to accommodate guests in the summertime or, perhaps the farmer moves into slightly inferior accommodation and has the main house for the entertainment of guests? Another point is the situation where the business is carried on by the spouse.  Suppose there is an unfortunate family where the spouse has died and the eldest daughter is carrying on the business to keep the family income up to a certain level.  Surely there should be some cognisance taken in those circumstances to ensure there will be no inequity when this Bill is passed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>First of all, the test will be whether the building itself is ancillary to the carrying on of the farming of the land.  That will mean an assessment in each particular case. Obviously if there were a farmhouse, or farm buildings on the land, or if the farmer were to build on a piece of land away from the family home a substantial building for a holiday camp, that would not, I think, be deemed to be ancillary to the carrying on of the farming of the land. These are cases where each case will have to be assessed on its merits.  I am interested in the point that Deputy Dr. Gibbons makes and I would certainly be prepared to consider the point between now and the Report Stage but we must be careful to ensure we do not extend any of these exemptions to a point at which they could be abused, where the situation might arise of a farmer renting out accommodation to a third party for the purpose of conducting a business.  What we have in mind is where the farm guesthouse is conducted as part and parcel of the family activity.  A case could arise in which a widower with an adult family might be able to conduct such an activity and one would not wish to see that type of case excluded.  I shall see if we can make an addition. I am sure the Deputy will join with me <Col N="2111" /> in not wanting to promote legislation which would allow this business to be conducted by people who were not genuine.  Families living at home would not like to see it rented out to somebody who lived far away; they would not, I am sure, like to see the business conducted in an artificial way by employees.  The Deputy's point is a good one.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>To come back to the point Deputy Gibbons made, the problem he sets would not involve the farmer in question in tax liability because his daughter would be regarded as a separate person and, to use a phrase that has a tax meaning&mdash;I am not using it in any other way&mdash;&ldquo;a connected person&rdquo;.  A spouse and farmer are regarded as connected persons for tax purposes.  Therefore, the non-farming activity of the wife would be regarded a non-farming activity of the farmer.  The daughter would be in a <Col N="2112" /> separate category and, therefore, the problem Deputy Gibbons visualises would not arise.</P>

    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>There are several provisions in this legislation where the Minister and the legislation positively bleed farmers from the point of view of income tax in a way which is worse than the way any other section of the community is treated.  No matter what else you may say about the income tax code, it always seeks to avoid a situation where anything is taxed twice.  It is typical of the Minister's approach to the farming community that that fairly sate principle in all income tax legislation is being callously abandoned here in section 17.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The situation, as I interpret section 17, will be that the same man can be taxed twice on a number of occasions.  The indication in the section <Col N="2116" /> is that if farmland is owned but let, it is going to be regarded as taxable by the owner.  Similarly, if land is occupied by letting from somebody else it is going to be taxable by the person letting it.  So, as the section is framed, we undoubtedly will have a situation all over the country where the same land is going to attract taxation by two different people.  I want to put forward the view that that is iniquitous.  I do not think it applies anywhere else in the taxation code and it is indicative of the Minister's cold, calculating callous approach to the farming community and indicative of the fact that he seems to have somewhere in his mentality and in his make-up some fundamental animosity towards the farming community as a community.  That is clearly illustrated by the provisions in section 17.</P>
    <P>I also want to raise the question of tenants in common and to ask the Minister the way in which they will be dealt with, particularly in the case of where one of the tenants in common would not be living on the farm and, indeed, might not be living in this country.  This happens very often in rural Ireland, particularly in the west of Ireland.  I want to suggest to the House that section 17 is unique from the point of view of income tax legislation in that it brings about a situation where the same land will come into assessment for tax in the case of two different individuals.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Of course, the two individuals may not necessarily be liable for tax: they may not be making a profit out of the same piece of land. If &ldquo;A&rdquo; owns a piece of land, which we shall call &ldquo;X&rdquo; and occupies a piece called &ldquo;Y&rdquo;; then if he puts &ldquo;X&rdquo; and &ldquo;Y&rdquo; together and has a £100 valuation, then &ldquo;A&rdquo; will become liable for tax if his profits are sufficient. If &ldquo;B&rdquo; owns land &ldquo;Y&rdquo; which is occupied by &ldquo;A&rdquo; and land &ldquo;Z&rdquo; and his profits come to more than £100, the same question arises as to whether &ldquo;B&rdquo; is liable for tax.  He should only be liable for tax on the profits he makes.  If he profits, say, out of the rents that he is receiving from the land occupied by &ldquo;A&rdquo;, he is making a profit which is taxable.  If he is not <Col N="2117" /> making a profit then the liability does not arise.  If he is making a profit, it is proper that he should pay.  There is no question of taxing the same profits twice.</P>

    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>This happens to be farmland and the people happen to be farmers, and for one isolated instance in the whole taxation code in this country we are going to make the same source liable to the same tax twice. Just because it happens to be farmland and the people happen to be farmers, in one isolated instance in the whole taxation code in this country we are going to make the same source a liability for tax in the hands of two separate, distinct people.  That is what you are doing.  Do not deny it.  Even Deputy O'Sullivan will not stand for that.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I will draw the parallel to show just how right we are. Supposing you have an accountant who has an office on the North Strand and he may make a profit out of his occupation and pays tax on it but the office may, in fact, be owned by somebody else who gets a rent out of it, so the owner of the office will have to pay tax out of the rent which he gets for the property.  There you have an identical case where the one piece of property is yielding profit to two different people and they pay the appropriate tax on their share of the profit out of that piece of property.  One pays it on the rent which he gains and the other pays it on the profit which he makes out of the use of it.</P>

      <P>I want to ask the Minister a question arising on this section and perhaps it needs reference to the following section as well to answer it. It was mentioned by Deputy Haughey and the Minister has not referred to it in his reply.  It is the question of how the situation of joint ownership is treated, whether it be tenancy in common or joint tenancy.  It would appear to me on the face of it that if you have a situation, which is quite common, where two brothers become joint owners of farmland of which, we will say, the valuation is £150, it would appear that if, as is common enough, one of the brothers is occupying the farm and working it and the other is living in London and working there, the effect would be that that farm would not be liable to tax because the joint ownership would mean that the rateable valuation should be apportioned between the joint owners.  But if, on the other hand, in a similarly arising situation you had the two brothers working the farm together then it would seem that it should be liable to tax because the ownership and the occupation would be of farmland of rateable valuation of £150.  I wonder if my interpretation is correct. Would the Minister indicate whether it is and, if not, why not?  If it is correct, is this a situation that he contemplated?</P>

      <P>If the land is owned jointly by brothers one of whom is absent, the other one would be in occupation of the total property of £150 valuation and therefore he would be liable to tax because he would be in occupation of land in excess of £100 valuation.  Is that the point?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>We are not dealing with rateable occupancy here.  What we are concerned with is actual occupation. There are all kinds of difficulties here.  We have to deal with actual occupation because there could be cases where a person could not, for instance, take out a grant of probate and make a profit on it&mdash;this is not uncommon, you know.  Such person could remain in occupation of land for decades and this often happens. We have to deal with real occupation and be in no way concerned with who may be registered as the rateable occupiers.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Meaney</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to ask the Minister if he does not think the section cuts completely across the land regulations.  After all, we in this country are experienced enough to recognise that it is the Land Commission we have to make application to when dividing a farm, no matter who you may be.  The Land Commission accepts that you can set aside, I think, five acres.  Is this section cutting across the Land Acts completely? Does that mean that you have to comply with both the Land Commission regulations and with the regulation of the Minister for Finance?  A person may come into the country or there may be somebody local who just wants a site of five acres.  That, as a rule, is allowed by the Land Commission. Otherwise they say it must be a viable unit.  This section is cutting completely across the Land Commission regulations.  It is something new. I should like the Minister's comments on that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Section 17 does not confer proprietory rights on anybody. <Col N="2120" /> It just confers propriety.  It simply refers to the use of the land.  If somebody has the actual use of land, he is in occupation of it, and the rateable valuation of the land is reckoned for tax purposes.  It is only the use of the land that is reckoned.  The fact that a person would have the use of land would not in any way confer a title on that person in respect of that land.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJVMeaney" hpid="Mr. Meaney Mr. Meaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Meaney</NameTxt>
      <P>As regards the use of land, the Land Commission already recognise that.  For the purpose of section 17, suppose the valuation is £101. The Land Commissioners up to now have recognised that that man can now transfer up to five acres to anybody he likes.  The Minister now says to that person: &ldquo;You cannot do that. You must comply with my regulations.&rdquo; That is contrary to Land Commission regulations.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>No.  The Minister for Finance or his officials have not power to stop anybody from transferring land or to confer title on anybody.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ThomasJVMeaney" hpid="Mr. Meaney Mr. Meaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Meaney</NameTxt>
      <P>Can I take it section 17 is still subject to Land Commission regulations and the Department of Lands, that section 17 is secondary to Land Commission regulations? Can I accept that as definite?</P>

    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJVMeaney" hpid="Mr. Meaney Mr. Meaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Meaney</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, but all this goes into the question of revision of land. Would the Minister say that it is secondary to Land Commission regulations as they apply at the moment?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJVMeaney" hpid="Mr. Meaney Mr. Meaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Meaney</NameTxt>
      <P>It is related to them because under the Land Commission regulations, one of which refers to a &ldquo;viable unit&rdquo; if a man wants to sell a plot of land, what has happened up to now is that a person can sell up to five acres.  The Land Commission gave that permission.  From now on, if this section is passed, the Minister can decide if the person sells a site it <Col N="2121" /> would put him below the valuation. This is the point I wish to make clear.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am in some difficulty about what the Deputy wants.  I want to emphasise this has nothing whatsoever to do with title.  It does not restrict or accelerate land transfers. If somebody deliberately transfers the ownership of five acres, that alienates that property from himself to another person, then that ownership will pass out of the assessment which will be taken into account in considering whether he has a valuation of £100.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJVMeaney" hpid="Mr. Meaney Mr. Meaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Meaney</NameTxt>
      <P>Can I take it that what the Minister says is that it is the regulations of the Department of Lands and those of the various Land Acts which are still the main consideration as regards the revision of land or the selling of land?  I am still not clear on this question.  Suppose it is £101 valuation and the person sells five acres for building or a factory site and that it reduces the valuation to £99 or £98, the Department of Finance cannot intervene and say the person must still be over the £100 valuation. The person might only sell one acre and the valuation might be reduced to £100.25.  What I want to know is whether the Department of Lands are still the main factor.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>If I might come back to the point I raised earlier about the two brothers in joint ownership, could I refer the Minister to subsection (3) of this section which deals with the situation where farmland is beneficially owned by an individual&mdash;I am leaving out the wife, for simplicity&mdash; jointly with any other person or persons but is not occupied by the individual either solely or jointly with any other person or persons.  That describes the situation we are talking about, where it is owned jointly by the two brothers, occupied by one but not by the other.  It goes on to say:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The individual shall be deemed to occupy farmland the rateable valuation of which is an amount <Col N="2122" /> which is equal to such part of the total rateable valuation of the land of which he is a beneficial owner as is proportionate to his or her share of the beneficial owner's said land.</P>
    <P>On the interpretation of that subsection, how would the situation which I have described be treated&mdash;joint ownership between two brothers, one of whom is occupying the land and the other, although a joint owner is, say, living abroad?  Who would be liable for what?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>I am afraid that will not do.  The Minister will remember that I talked originally about either tenancy in common or joint tenancy. As the Minister knows, that means that each of the partners is the owner of an undivided moiety and therefore you cannot say that either is entitled to a £75 valuation worth of the land, especially when he is not in occupation. The only connection he has is his joint ownership.  Therefore he is owner of an undivided moiety and how can you say that £75 is the valuation of what he is entitled to?  The Minister is not entitled to do that.  The result <Col N="2123" /> would be that some people not occupying the land would have to pay tax under this subsection.  It ought to be clear.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>All these problems that we are talking about spring from a basic misconception.  In my view he should apply the taxation principle of only taxing the same thing once and let him opt for one criteria or the other&mdash;ownership or occupation.  We should base this whole thing on the occupation of land and two people cannot occupy the same land at the same time and have the liability attaching solely and exclusively to occupation and nothing else.  This <Col N="2124" /> would get rid of all the problems.  But the Minister in some sort of legislative cupidity wants to catch everybody for everything.  He wants to make people liable because they are beneficial owners even though they do not occupy it, or might have the land let and he wants to catch people who take land on letting.  That is where the whole problem in this section arises.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Even if an absent brother is deemed to be in occupation, he is not making profits out of farming. The brother who is in occupation is using the farm; whether he is a joint tenant or is a tenant in common, he is in occupation of the total property.  Therefore, he is in excess of the £100 rateable valuation and he becomes liable.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Carter</NameTxt>
      <P>Could I ask the Minister a question?  When replying to section 17, which is for the purpose of extracting tax, did the Minister state that land let on the 11-month system would not attract tax but that land let for longer periods would?  Is this correct?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="FrankCarter" hpid="Mr. Carter Mr. Carter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Carter</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not referring to who would be liable for tax.  I am referring to the fact that 11-months' letting is out of the net, longer letting is in the net.  Is this not so?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrankCarter" hpid="Mr. Carter Mr. Carter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Carter</NameTxt>
      <P>Arising from that, is the Minister not aware that we have been advocating in this House for a great many years the undesirability of letting land on the 11-months' system, and further, that we were striving to advocate, in some cases with some success, that land should be let for five years or longer periods in order to give the person who would be taking the letting a better chance of <Col N="2125" /> better husbandry?  We have always claimed that 11-months' letting promoted bad husbandry.  Therefore, I would infer from what the Minister has stated that this section as it is now framed, is calculated to cut across the development which various Ministers and various Deputies in this House advocated in farming circles.  I refer back to the statement made by Deputy Haughey that this clause in the section, as it is set down here, is only calculated to promote bad husbandry, apart from whatever tax it may gain the Minister.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>

      <P>I appreciate the Minister is purely concerned here with revenue.  It could be submitted, from any side of the House, that the Minister in the long-term should also be concerned with long-term development and, therefore, the person who sets out to invest on the basis of a long-term arrangement should always get preference over those who could be deemed to be in and outers.

      <P>To give you an idea of a case, if you take 100 acres where 95 acres are given away but if five acres or even less are kept upon which to build a house, together with a small holding, then there has been what lawyers call an alienation of the property of 95 acres, and if there is a genuine legal transfer then that will be fully recognised.  The fact that someone keeps five acres for himself, if there is a division of 95 to one party and five to another and if this effectively breaks up the £100 holding declared previously, well, so be it, that <Col N="2126" /> is the luck of the transferees in the particular case and it has to be recognised as being valid.</P>

You could have a case where two people could be in possession of a piece of <Col N="2128" /> land which was valued as a unit but you would have to make an apportionment of their respective portions of that land to add to their other holdings to see whether or not they came within the £100 limit.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanTreacy" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Seán Treacy">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>Amendment No. 10 stands in the name of the Minister.  Amendments Nos. 11 and 12 are related.  I would suggest that we take amendments Nos. 10, 11 and 12, in the name of the Minister, together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 10:</P>
      <P>In paragraph (a), page 10, lines 53 and 54 and paragraph (b), lines 57 and 58, to delete &ldquo;which would, but for this section, be chargeable&rdquo; and to substitute &ldquo;appropriate to the profits or gains from farming.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>Section 19 provides for a sliding scale of charge where a farm is of £100 valuation or somewhat over that figure.  The scale of charge is one-twentieth of the tax at £100 plus a further one-twentieth for every £1 over £100.  That means that the tax charge for a farmer over £101 should be one-tenth of tax and at £102 it would be three-twentieths of the tax charge.  The section, however, as it stands is not adequate to deal with cases where there is other income in addition to farming income.  The amendments are designed to cater for this situation by relating the relief to be given under this section to the tax appropriate to farm income.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The first amendment provides for <Col N="2131" /> the textual alteration in section 19 by substituting the words &ldquo;appropriate to the profits or gains from farming&rdquo; for the words &ldquo;which would, but for this section, be chargeable&rdquo;. Amendment No. 11, makes a consequential alteration of the proviso to the subsection.  The proviso as it stands provides that the tax chargeable in any case is not to exceed, by an amount greater than £40, the amount which would be chargeable if the rateable valuation of the farm was £1 less than the actual rateable valuation.  The significance of the £40 is that a multiplier of 40 is used in the notional basis of assessment as the method of income per valuation and it was considered reasonable that in the sliding scale the tax charge should be limited to the figure of not more than 40 times the increase in the valuation.  When a sliding scale is being applied the proviso as it stands caters for the case where there is only farming income. It should not apply where there is other income since in that case it would operate to restrict the tax appropriate to the other income. There would be no justification for this and the amendment to the proviso now ensures that this limitation will only apply when there is no other income than that from farming.</P>
    <P>The third amendment adds two new subsections.  The new subsection (2) spells out how the tax appropriate to farming profits is to be arrived at, namely, on a proportionate basis taking the farming profits as computed on whichever basis the farmer elects.  The new subsection (3) says the section is not to apply where the rateable valuation of the farm exceeds £119.  This is the point at which the sliding scale expires in the ordinary case.  What is at issue here, however, is the case of a farmer with a farm of, say, £220 valuation which he sells half way through the year of assessment.  Such a farmer ought not to get marginal relief but he could argue that under section 17 (6) he is deemed to occupy land at a rateable valuation of £110 for that year and but for the present subsection he would seek marginal relief for it.  He is, <Col N="2132" /> of course, chargeable for the year either on an accounts basis or on the notional basis by reference to profits of £4,400 less deductions for rates, labour and depreciation.</P>

      <P>In order to deal with these amendments it is necessary to get a certain amount of clarification from the Minister on the section which he is amending.  In regard to paragraph (a), the second line where it says &ldquo;...does not exceed £100&rdquo; is that intended in practice to mean that it equals £100?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">

    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>In other words, it does not mean less than £100.  It means precisely £100.  It is rather oddly expressed&mdash;&ldquo;does not exceed £100&rdquo; when it is intended to mean &ldquo;is £100&rdquo; exactly.  Taking paragraph (a) as it stands and as the Minister proposes to amend it, it appears to me that what it seems to say is that a person whose valuation is precisely £100 will pay one-twentieth of the tax in the terms of the amendment, appropriate to the profits or dealings in farming.  Is it possible that that could cover the notional valuation and that the effect of paragraph (a) would be that the farmer would be paying tax amounting to one-twentieth of what he would pay on the notional valuation calculated on £100?</P>

The wording &ldquo;does not exceed £100&rdquo; is meant to bring in the £50 to £100 range and that would only apply to people who are brought in because of section 16, but the section says that the people to whom section 16 applies are not involved.</P>

      <P>The Minister is totally wrong in his approach in regarding all the people to whom section 16 will apply as criminals and people who have been or are going to go around avoiding tax.  Section 16 will apply to many ordinary, straightforward, legitimate income taxpayers who up to now have had off-farm Schedule D incomes and have been paying tax on them.  The only difference with regard to these people is that these new provisions will make them liable to pay tax on their farming profits also if their valuations are between £50 and £100.  It is totally wrong for the Minister to be sweeping all these people aside as tax avoiders.  There may be one or two of them tax avoiders but the vast majority of them will be ordinary straightforward legitimate taxpayers.  He cannot deny them marginal relief at the £50 point just because he has some vague idea <Col N="2136" /> that they have been or will be tax avoiders.</P>

      <P>I wonder has the Minister sold to himself or had it sold to him that section 16 is a tax avoidance measure to the extent that he is really missing the significance of what is happening in section 19.  Is it not true that the only difference between the people affected by section 16 and section 19, whether they are on the one hand ordinary farmers with some other activities, or whether they are in the Minister's book massive tax avoiders, either way they can have farms with £50 valuation or £100 upwards.  The only difference is the difference in their valuation.  Is that not true?  If so should not the same situation apply to those in section 16 as to those in section 19?</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 13:</P>
      <P>In subsection (1), page 11, line 15, to delete &ldquo;six&rdquo; and to substitute &ldquo;nine&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>The object of this amendment is to enable farmers who are offered under this section the option of being taxed either on last year's figures or this year's figures to exercise that option nine months after the commencement of the income tax year instead of six months as provided in the section.  The reasons for this are, first, that people who will be affected have not been affected heretofore by income tax.  They will not be very familiar with the procedures which will arise.  Secondly, by the time this Bill is passed, published and people concerned have an opportunity of having their attention drawn to it there will be very little time left if the six months period stays as it is. At this time of the year until the harvest is in farmers do not have time to sit down, look after forms and work out accounts and so on.  It seems to me that since this is a once-for-all, I assume, option exercisable only this year, it would be desirable to extend the period to nine months.  It would effectively give farmers until a date early in January, I think January 5th, to exercise the option.  The Minister indicated on the Second Stage that he might be prepared to consider something on these lines.  I trust he will find it possible to do so.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I recall that at the time of the budget I was faulted because I would not give what the Opposition considered a satisfactory answer on the question as to what people might be expected to obtain from taxation of farming profits.  I explained it would not be possible to give an accurate figure until the assessments were made and the result was known and that it would take some time to make a more accurate assessment.  That was on the basis of my difficulties on the basis of a six months' option being exercised by farmers.  Now I am asked to extend the period for nine months which would mean that, if accepted, farmers would be free to exercise this option up to 6th January, 1975.  That would be far beyond what was originally intended and far beyond any period given to any other taxpayers. With the exception of the transitional provision in relation to mining taxation, no other taxpayer enjoys an option of this kind to choose the form of assessment of taxation.  Farmers would be put in a very privileged position.  If farmers kept accounts last year, they know they kept accounts and they are in a position to exercise an option.  If they are keeping accounts this year they will certainly know by August that they are keeping accounts this year. If this year's accounts are to have any validity at all they must certainly be kept at the moment.  Consequently they will be able to make a decision by August.  This right to elect is not being furnished in order that the person may choose which of the three options will give him the lowest liability to tax.  The choice has been given so that he may choose the means most available for the purpose of paying tax.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The period which has been given is an extremely generous one.  If the option were to be left open until 6th January, 1975, the inspector of taxes could not make an assessment. Under general law the inspector would be entitled to require a farmer to complete a return showing the profits from his farming on the preceding year's basis.  Such returns <Col N="2139" /> will be issued by the inspectors to farmers as soon as this Finance Bill is passed so as to enable them, as they do in relation to other taxpayers, to make an assessment shortly thereafter.</P>
    <P>If farmers were to be allowed to exercise an option of proceeding on the current year basis instead of the preceding year up to 6th January, 1975, they could inform the inspectors in August, 1974 that they had not made up their minds which basis of assessment they would be adopting and the inspectors would then be in the difficulty that they could not insist on completion of the returns showing 1973 profits if in fact these were not to be used for the purpose of assessment.</P>
    <P>The result of this amendment therefore would be to suspend action in relation to the assessment of farm profits until January, 1975.  There is no logical reason why this should be done.  It would be contrary to the treatment to which all other taxpayers have to submit and I think we should therefore stick to the period of six months as originally proposed.  Might I remind the House of the good German saying that a bad end is better than no end at all.  When farmers have completed their forms and made their returns they will find in many cases good news: that they will not be liable to tax or that their liability will be a lot less than the Members of the Opposition or members of organisations&mdash;I dare not name them, they are so sensitive&mdash;might have already suggested.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>From what the Minister said it is apparent that he is not going to accept what we consider to be a very reasonable amendment. We consider that the period of six months is too short, because there are already three months or three-and-a half months of this particular period gone and there are only two-and-a-half months left.  It is not easy for those coming into the tax net for the first time to be ready to deal with the Revenue Commissioners.  Cattle prices <Col N="2140" /> were never so unpredictable as they are now and also accounts of contractors and millers for seeds, fertilisers and so on traditionally are not settled until the harvest, which is usually well into October.  We ask the Minister to accept this amendment because, as I said, this being the first time these people have been brought into the tax net, the procedure is going to be new to them.  The Minister should accept our amendment therefore so as to facilitate those who are going to be caught.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrendanCrinion" hpid="Mr. Crinion Mr. Crinion">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Crinion</NameTxt>
      <P>We should suspend it for nine months.  Much of the year has gone and farmers were hoping that, through representations from their organisations, they would not have to pay tax.  When this Bill passes through the Seanad and is law they will have to consult auditors.  Auditors work very slowly, particularly with new clients, and it would take some time to give a farmer a decision whether he should opt for audited accounts.  At that time of the year farmers are particularly busy and they do not want to be bothered with accounts.  It is more important for them to gather in their harvest and to secure food for the coming winter.  It would not be much good if they neglected their harvest in order to deal with their accounts and to consult an auditor.  The Minister for Finance would not be able to supply them with feeding stuff the next winter. At the present time farmers are extremely busy with haymaking, with silage, with the harvest.  This will continue well into October.  They may be engaged getting out cattle during October and November.  This would leave them only a few days in which to prepare their accounts and to consult an auditor.  It would be well into November-December before they could do anything.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Because of these circumstances the Minister should extend the period to nine months to give farmers a chance to deal with their accounts.  If the Minister were involved himself in farming he would readily agree with this amendment.  As he has no experience of farming I see the reason he put down this amendment; but if he were a farmer he would say that <Col N="2141" /> the period should be nine months.  At this time of the year the farmer has no time for preparing books.  If the Minister consults some of his farming colleagues he will find what I say is perfectly true and it would be a gesture on his part to change it from six months to nine months.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Esmonde</NameTxt>
      <P>I fully understand the difficulties that the Minister has in relation to the time limit but I would ask the Minister to have some understanding that the six months as mentioned here for election should not be called what lawyers would term &ldquo;of the essence&rdquo;, and Deputy Colley and Deputy Haughey will understand what I am dealing with when I use those words.  It is necessary, in the position of the Minister and the Revenue Commissioners, to fix the time of six months.  The reason I suggest this course to the Minister is that the farmer has to assess what his position was last year and what his position is likely to be this year.  He has to do two years' accounts before he can really exercise his election.  To take nine months would be far too long and would cause complications and difficulties.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ThomasJVMeaney" hpid="Mr. Meaney Mr. Meaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Meaney</NameTxt>
      <P>I am very much in favour of nine months also.  Farmers got the option of one year above another.  The Minister knows well that this year is the year the farmers will opt for.  If the Minister curtails him to the six months' option, he is going to cut him short.  Does the Minister realise that the nine months ending on 6th January will include almost every form of farming?  Six months would not give a true picture.  Does the Minister realise that all ACC repayments are due on two gale days&mdash;1st May and 1st November?  This should be included in any assessment made by the farmer. Take the example of a man who is on the calf suckling scheme.  He will not have his cattle inspected until October and his grants will not be paid until about Christmas.  He would have to get until 6th January to know where he stood.  The point is that the cattle within the six-month period will not even be inspected.  Take the grain farmers. Our beet factories are open at all <Col N="2142" /> times until early February.  Thus the grain man, the man who has roots and who sells carrots and beet, he cannot assess his position until well into February.  The Minister should think seriously about this and accept the nine months instead of six.</P>

      <P>In reply to what Deputy Esmonde had to say, the House can be assured that we shall not stick rigidly to 6th October.  They have power&mdash;it is being exercised in a flexible way&mdash;to allow departure from these dates.  But if we were to extend it to nine months, as suggested by the Opposition, it would in fact mean that there would be no collection of any tax from farming profits next January as there ought to be.  It would also mean that in many cases there would be a collection of two years' tax until 1976, because the assessments would be so late in being made.  Some farmers will go for the 40 multiplier&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>The extension to nine months would make a shambles of the whole system of taxation that we are proposing and would also be a disservice to the farming community.  They either kept accounts last year or they did not.  If they kept accounts last year they can decide to produce them. If they keep accounts this year they can decide to go on actual accounts for this year or they can go for the 40 multiplier.  There will be no difficulty for anybody coming to a decision as to which particular method they will choose.</P>
      <P>I want to emphasise what I said earlier.  This option is being given not that people can decide which one is going to put them in the more advantageous position <i>vis-á-vis</i> the tax collector.  It is being given as a facility because of the fact that in introducing a new form of tax farmers may not have kept accounts.  That is the purpose of it.  If they take other factors into account, that is their entitlement. Nobody can stop anybody reasoning what might be to his own advantage. But there is no justification for extending this into next year.  Sufficient advantage has been given by giving three options.  No other taxpayer will enjoy the same advantage.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Gibbons</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to put this to the Minister.  The Minister must know as well as every other Deputy that there are more farmers who do not keep accounts than those who do. When the Minister suggests that he is offering the farmers a choice, he must know that he is doing nothing of the kind.  Most farmers will lose heavily this year because of the quite exceptional ineptitude of the Government. There are other reasons also, but the ineptitude of the present Government is the contributory fact.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Unless farmers had been keeping accounts last year and during the current year, they will not have this option open to them.  In spite of the fact that they will be losing heavily on their farming operations, they will be assessed perforce on a calculation based on their valuation.  In my opinion, this is a very shabby trick <Col N="2144" /> indeed.  There is no real choice at all being offered by the Minister to the great majority of farmers.  They are going to be forced to pay an income tax although they do not have an income.  This is the plain fact of the matter.  The Minister cannot deny that this is so.  I want to invite him to say that it is not so: first of all, that there is no real choice for the great majority of taxable farmers, because they do not keep the type of accounts that would be acceptable to the Revenue Commissioners.  That is one part of the choice gone.  The other is that, in spite of the fact that a great many&mdash;most of them&mdash;will have a very, very serious loss in the current year, they will still have to pay income tax on an income they never had.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FrankCarter" hpid="Mr. Carter Mr. Carter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Carter</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Gibbons is perfectly correct.  It is the developing group of farmers you are going to come down on here.  This year, when those developing farmers cannot come by credit, when the banks have clamped down on them and when they are being pressed by the banks to liquidate their overdrafts and when other institutions are bearing down on them, it is mean, to say the least of it.  This applies, as has been said, to a section who up to now, had never kept accounts.  The Minister is baulking at a difference of a few months. The amendment is not asking for very much.  I should like to emphasise in this particular year&mdash;one of the worst facing farmers&mdash;that the profit returns will not be there, nor will the incentive be there to invest further, nor will the credit facilities be there.  It is in this year that the Minister says they are going to leave them to the tender mercies of the Revenue Commissioners. We know the sort of mercy that will be dispensed by the Revenue Commissioners to this section of the community.</P>

      <P>The object of this amendment is to give every farmer who becomes liable to income tax in the first year&mdash;I repeat only in the first year&mdash;the option of using the notional basis of assessment.  Many farmers have not been keeping accounts.  It is necessary to provide a transitional period.  The Minister referred on Second Stage to the necessity for a transitional period in relation to this section.  When I asked him why it stated that it was for the year of assessment 1974-75 only, he indicated that although that was stated in the section, it was intended to have a transitional period which he did not think would in any circumstances end after one year.  The Minister announced, I believe, that one should accept this amendment.  The only difference between the amendment and the Minister's proposals is that it will apply the notional basis of assessment at the option of the farmer taxpayer, but only for the first year.</P>

      <P>I will give the Deputy a good reason.  I am right. You want to provide that the notional income may apply to somebody to whom section 16 applies.</P>

      <P>I shall give a very good reason why it should not apply.  Section 16 provides that where a person who has a farm and who also has some other trade or business is to be charged tax on his farming profits, he is to be charged tax on an account basis.  The option of a notional basis should not be available to him.  I will give an example.  Suppose you take a person who shows a profit of just over £2,000 on his non-farming business while claiming that his farming activities produce a profit of £8,000.  Under the amendments he would claim that 80 per cent of his income was derived from farming and he is entitled to the benefit of the notional basis of assessment although, in truth, these figures might be fabricated figures.  His farming profit might be £2,000 and his profit from his non-farming business might be £8,000. Under section 16 as it stands, this man would be charged tax on his total funds of over £10,000 from both farm and business.  If, however, these amendments were accepted he could opt for a notional basis in relation to his farming profits.  After deductions for depreciation, cost of labour and so on, this might reduce the figure to well below £3,000.  He would then be charged on a total figure of £5,000, notwithstanding the fact that his total profits are £20,000.  In other words, to allow the notional basis here would simply be to promote further avoidance. The person who has an actual profit of £10,000 would end up paying tax on a notional profit of only £5,000. That would be contrary to the spirit of the section that the House has already passed.</P>

      <P>With all due respect, the argument put up by the Minister is absolutely ludicrous.  He is just taking figures out of the air.  We are concerned here with the different provision which the Minister is making for two separate <Col N="2149" /> groups of people.  In the case of the farmers who have £100 valuation or more in this particular year the Minister is going to give him the option of taking a notional assessment.  They are the bigger farmers, they are the people who are likely to have the higher income and they are the people likely to gain more from opting for the notional assessment basis.  The Minister is going to give them the option of to the people between £50 and £100 whom he is bringing in who would be farmers with smaller incomes who would gain less from adopting the notional basis.  It is completely illogical and unfair.  I think the Minister has no option but to accept this amendment.  These people in the range of valuation between £50 and £100 are small farmers.  They are being brought into this net now for the first time.  Surely if the larger farmer over £100 valuation can get this concession in the first year&mdash;that is all we are talking about here at the moment&mdash; the smaller farmer within the £50 to £100 range should be equally entitled to it.</P>

      <P>We have already demonstrated that we are, indeed, very displeased with the Minister in relation to section 16.  We are not at all, as the Minister would like to say that we are, helping or wanting to help those who are avoiding taxes. What we do say is that there are many ordinary farmers with valuations on their farms between £50 and £100 who should in all honesty and fairness be given this option.  It seéms to me that, apart from anything else, from the way the section is framed there is an anomaly in respect of the farmer in the £50 to £100 valuation category.</P>

      <P>As I explained on the Second Stage of the Bill, this section is to a large extent an anti-avoidance measure to bring to an end some of the most appalling scandals which have arisen by reason of the fact that farmers exempt from tax and some people engaged in other businesses or professions have set off profits from the trade or profession against farming profits in order to avoid paying a fair share of tax.  I instanced cases like that of a veterinary surgeon who claims to be earning less than £1,500 in his veterinary practice and yet claims&mdash;&mdash;</P>

I used the case of a veterinary surgeon who claims to be earning less than £1,500 in his profession&mdash; and he must be a very rare person&mdash; and who claims, nevertheless, to be earning something in the region of £45,000 on his farm, the dentist who claims to be earning from his profession something around the £4,000 mark and twice that amount from his farming profits, or the doctor who claims to be earning from his medical practice £2,500 and in excess of £10,000 in farming profits&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">

    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>All those are cases which show the absolute necessity to bring shameful practices like that to an end.  Why should such people who are making enormous profits from their trade or profession use a device to set them off against farming profits and thereby escape profit tax liability on their true incomes?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Haughey is interpreting the word &ldquo;profession&rdquo; in an non-tax way. He is regarding any person who obtains a professional qualification as a person who would be caught by our section.  Of course, that is not so.  If an accountant, a solicitor, or doctor happens to be the employee of another, then that person will pay tax under Schedule E and not Schedule D.  A trade or profession for tax purposes refers to a sole trader, to a person who is self-employed, to a person who is selling his or her skills directly, and there is no need to add the words &ldquo;assessable under case 2 of Schedule D.&rdquo;  That is why it is unnecessary to use the words that Deputy Haughey mentioned.  Furthermore, there is a very good reason why <Col N="2152" /> we should not do it, because there is at least one profession which occurs to me which is not assessable under case 2 of Schedule D because it is an exempt profession, that is the profession or activity of a writer, of an author or an artist.  That person is exempt under case 2 of Schedule D. Now if the author's earnings from his profession are exempted from tax, then he could get exemption also in respect of his farming profits and it would seem to me that there are many people who envy our authors and artists the exemption which they enjoy and, indeed, Ministers for Finance are under a considerable amount of pressure to remove this exemption which is the cause of annoyance to people who do not enjoy it.  I consider it would be very wrong, indeed if, in addition, to those people enjoying an exemption of this kind, they were, by reason of Deputy Haughey's amendment, also to get exemption in respect of their profits from farming, an exemption which would not be made available to any other person in the community.</P>
    <P>We would have to consider this matter in the light of the way I have approached it, and not risk any further loopholes than are absolutely necessary.  What we have done is to close the loopholes and to ensure that the proper tax is paid by people who are lucky enough to have a professional skill or a business outside their farm interests.  Many of the people who have businesses or trades outside their farm are people who have inherited it.  It would be totally wrong, it seems to me, that such people should enjoy the exemption when they have two sources of income.  We want to close that off and the language which we have used is language that is well established in the income tax Acts and is not open to any ambiguity.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 15:</P>
      <P>In page 11, between lines 33 and 34, to insert a new subsection as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(2) For the purposes of subsection (1), section 16 shall be deemed not to apply for any year of assessment in a case where farming is carried on in that year of assessment by an individual whose total profits or gains from farming exceed one-half of his total income from all sources in that year of assessment.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>Although there is a relationship to amendment No. 14 there is another point in relation to amendment No. 15, and I should like to make a case for it.  There is a similarity of principles to amendment No. 14. What is sought to be achieved here is to provide that where a farmer has a non-farming income as well as a farming income that if his farming income is more than half of his total income he would be allowed to operate the notional basis of assessment provided for in section 21.  I do not want to go back over all the matters that we mentioned already but I should like to point out again that under the Bill as it stands the position is that there is discrimination against a farmer who has some trade in addition to farming.</P>
      <P>I did instance the case where one could have a man with a valuation a little over £50 earning £100 a year from some outside activity and, as a consequence, being obliged to pay income tax on his farming profits based on an accounts system.  On the other hand, one could have a company director holding up to 25 per cent of the shares in a large company and he could still benefit from the £100 rateable valuation limit mentioned in section 15, subsection (3), so that he paid no tax on his farming profits or, if his rateable valuation exceeded £100, he could get the benefit of this notional basis of assessment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister has talked many times and at some length about achieving equity in the tax system.  He cannot in <Col N="2156" /> all conscience suggest to us that that situation is equitable; if ever one wanted an example of something that was most inequitable this is it.  The inequity cannot be remedied by this amendment but the amendment would go some of the way towards remedying the inequity by allowing the notional basis of assessment where more than half of the income comes from farming. If the Minister wants to tell me that it is not possible to establish that more than half the income comes from farming, I do not accept that that is so.  I am satisfied the Revenue Commissioners will have enough power on the passage of this Bill to ascertain whether that is true or false.  The Bill will also enable the Revenue Commissioners to get accounts from cases in which they are doubtful even if the net result is that the person can operate the notional basis.  In order to establish his right to do it under this amendment he, possibly in many cases, would have to produce accounts.  That, presumably, is what the Minister is trying to establish.</P>
    <P>I hope, therefore, the Minister will find himself able to accept this amendment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Where anybody is engaged in a trade or profession outside farming the notional basis will not be available whether he is between £50 and £100 valuation or above £100. That is the effect of section 21 (1) of the Bill.  There is no question, as has been alleged here, of giving privileged treatment to the better off who have properties in excess of £100 valuation, by allowing a notional basis to them even though they have an outside occupation while denying it to others.  Section 21 reads thus:</P>
      <P>Where for the year of assessment 1974-75, an individual, other than an individual to whom section 16 applies,...</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Section 16 removes the limit, the concession and the exemption granted by section 15 (3) which is the one that says that the liability to tax is not to apply under £100.  We have, in fact, trimmed this thing in such a way that a person who has an income outside of farming will not be entitled to the notional <Col N="2157" /> basis.  The notional basis is available to the genuine farmer who has no other occupation or source of income.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>That is the effect of section 21 (1).  Section 16 provides that section 15 (3) shall not have effect if the person has another trade or business, or his spouse has, and so on.  So the different treatment which it is alleged these people are getting does not arise once they get the same treatment if there is an outside source of income.  We are providing protection and certain concessions for the genuine farmer, the person who is not involved in a mixture of activities.  The genuine farmer will get this notional assessment if he wants to use it.  Nobody could go for the 40 multiplier this year because it represents far more than what their actual earnings would be and yet we are told at this stage that we are doing an injustice to people by not making that multiplier available.  I suppose on all sides of the House at any time people will contradict themselves in the arguments they produce in relation to different sections but there is this contradiction.

      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>For those who say that there is someone on my back I should like to say that such a person would have difficulty in getting there or staying there.  We are providing here a system which will ensure that any person who has an income outside farming will not enjoy this notional valuation.  Most of the valuations are on farms owned by people who have not any other source of income.  Others are in a position <Col N="2160" /> to render actual accounts and it is on that basis that they will be taxed.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesMGibbons" hpid="Mr. J. Gibbons Mr. J. Gibbons">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Gibbons</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to raise a number of points with the Minister.  One is that a farmer who in the beginning is a full-time farmer with no other occupation is deterred very effectively by this section from taking up other employment by which he might otherwise enhance his income. Therefore, a farmer who gets an offer of a part-time job that would be of assistance to him in the development of his farm will be prevented by section 21 from accepting it because he will be penalised for doing so.  In the event, he will probably find it not profitable to take any extra agricultural employment of any kind. He is having a condition of semi-bondage put on him.  He will not be allowed by this section to expand his operations beyond farming and if he tries to do so he will be heavily penalised under this section.</P>
    </Speaker>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Gibbons</NameTxt>
      <P>If I am wrong, I would be glad if the Minister would tell me where I am wrong.</P>
      <P>There is another point I want to mention to the Minister and it is the question of farmers who decide, for instance, to stand for election to this House.  Would such farmers, if they were successful in being elected, be deprived of the option of the notional method of assessment or would they be constrained to pay their income tax on the basis of accounts, whether such accounts exist or not?  I appreciate that a person of the Minister's lightweight, flippant attitude could regard this as a matter of amusement but I can assure the Minister that it is not a matter of amusement to the farmers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I was not regarding it as a matter of amusement and I do not see why the Deputy would think that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMGibbons" hpid="Mr. J. Gibbons Mr. J. Gibbons">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Gibbons</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister answer the question?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>If the Deputy wants to pass comments about my demeanour <Col N="2161" /> or disposition he cannot resent my explaining it.</P>
      <P>To deal with the Deputy's specific questions.  In the first case, I said he was wrong because if a person takes up employment he will not lose this advantage of the notional income.  It is only a person who engages in a trade or profession, as a sole operator, or in partnership with somebody else, not as an employee who loses the concession.  The question of a person wanting to supplement his income by going to work in a factory does not arise; there is no disadvantage arising from that.</P>
      <P>So far as the second case is concerned, that is the case of a person who becomes a Member of this House, that is not, God knows, a question of being the sole trader or of being in one's own employment: one is sent here as a Teachta Dála; a messenger of the people; one is&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Is cuma liom.  I do not see that there is anything lacking in status or importance as far as a messenger is concerned.  The Members here represent the people and are in receipt of an emolument from the State as an allowance because of that representation.  It seems to me that that is more within the nature of the employment which would not deprive a Member of this notional income rather than in the nature of being a sole trader.  Members are not a sole trader because while they may maintain a certain independence and I would trust they do, nonetheless, they are in a semi-contractual relationship with the electors and the State.</P>
      <P>Amendment put and declared lost.</P>
      <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That section 21 stand part of the Bill&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanCrinion" hpid="Mr. Crinion Mr. Crinion">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Crinion</NameTxt>
      <P>Section 21 sets out the deductions that may be made by way of expenses.  It waives deductions in respect of plant and machinery.  In subsection (4):</P>
      <P>... no deduction shall be allowed other than those specified...</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Section 496 of the Income Tax Act, <Col N="2162" /> 1967, permitted a claim for repayment of income tax in respect of bank interest paid.  This has now been amended in section 29 of the Finance Act, 1974.</P>
    <P>Section 21 (4) of this Finance Act should be amended to make it clear that it does not rule out a claim for bank interest relief.  At present this matter is rather obscure.  I should like to know what the Minister has to say on this.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>The situation here is that this notional provision assesses the profits from a farming activity.  We say that in relation to the assessment of the profits they use the 40 multiplier and then deduct these claims and that assesses what is the income from the farming activity.</P>
      <P>Beyond that, a taxpayer may be entitled to certain other deductions: personal allowance, married allowance, children's allowance&mdash;they have interest allowance as well.  The fact that we do not allow those items in relation to the forty is simply because the forty is an assessment of the farm's income&mdash;it is a purely notional assessment, but it does not rule out the application of all the other allowances to which any ordinary taxpayer may be entitled.  A taxpayer is entitled to certain allowances irrespective of whether or not he or she has an income from a business, or from particular employment, or from dividends.  The ordinary personal allowance to which a taxpayer is entitled in his personal capacity can, of course, be deducted after one has achieved the net figure assessed for the farm income.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrendanCrinion" hpid="Mr. Crinion Mr. Crinion">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Crinion</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister mentioned deductions of plant and machinery and did not mention bank interest. This is a particular relief that will be claimed by a number of people.  When the Minister mentioned that it is in the 1967 Act, I think it should be mentioned in this Bill as well.  It would make things much more clear if an amendment were put down on Report Stage to deduct bank interest.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Col N="2163" />
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not know if I would go along with Deputy Crinion in regard to bank interest.  The section, as it is framed, is somewhat anomalous even with regard to machinery.  The Minister is allowing a deduction in respect of the wear and tear of plant and machinery, but he is not allowing the running costs of the machinery.  That seems to me to be talking illogically.  If machinery is to be allowed, surely the actual cost of running the machinery is just as important as the wear and tear. There is also an anomaly in regard to the people employed.  The section proposes that a deduction will be allowed in respect of wages paid to employees.  It specifies that the wages must be paid in cash.  Anybody who knows anything about rural Ireland knows that very often wages are, to a considerable extent, paid in kind. It is quite anomalous to allow a proportion of remuneration which is payable in cash, and not to allow in many cases a substantial amount of remuneration which is paid in kind. They are two particular criticisms I have of the way in which the notional assessment system will be applied.</P>
      <P>In regard to this section I should also like to mention the Minister's apparent phobia about farmers who have income in addition to their farming.  There appears to be a total blind spot about that type of farmer. In my view, he differentiates in this regard between farmers of between £50 and £100 valuation and farmers of over £100 valuation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Section 16 applies only to farmers between the £50 and £100 valuation. That would be my reading of it.  Therefore, to that extent these particular farmers&mdash;those in the £50 to £100 valuation range&mdash;are penalised, whereas farmers who have a valuation of over £100, and have off-farm income, are not subject to the same disadvantages. The Minister disagrees with that interpretation.  As I understand him now, he says that section 16 applies to all farmers, whether they are under £100 or over £100, if they have income from non-farm sources.  In one <Col N="2164" /> way or another, he is quite definite. His whole approach to these sections is that where a farmer has income other than farm income he is not a genuine farmer, he is a person who is suspect a man who has to be penalised.  That, frankly, is thinking I cannot understand. Surely, everybody in this House would regard it as desirable that farmers at all levels would use whatever enterprise and initiative God gave them to improve their lot in any way they can, through their own efforts or through the efforts of their wives. Surely, it is a good thing that farmers, as Deputy Gibbons said, should be encouraged to find non-farm income. This is particularly so in these times when farming is proving a more uncertain occupation than it has been for a long, long time.  Any sensible farmer, who has the opportunity to do so, would certainly be wise to cushion himself against the vicissitudes of farming by having some non-farm income, if he can possibly produce it.</P>
    <P>The Minister is quite adamant that farmers who have any sort of non-farm Schedule E income must be penalised as if there was something venal about them, or something suspect, no matter who they are and, therefore, they must be subject to penalties.  In this particular case they cannot be allowed to have access to this notional assessment provision. That, to me, is quite incomprehensible. It is a very serious criticism of the Minister's whole approach to this system.  The Minister is making these provisions in advance.  One would, perhaps, have some sympathy with him if we had taxation of farmers in existence for a number of years and certain abuses began to appear and the Minister had to make some provisions to close loopholes.  But in actual fact he is bringing in these provisions in regard to farmers who have non-farm income in advance of the experience of the operation of the sections.  I despair of getting any further change out of the Minister on this aspect but he is doing something which is unwise and anti-social, something which will have serious repercussions from the social point of view on life in rural Ireland.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>There has to be a limit.  On that basis, every taxpayer ought to get some allowance in respect of the domestic chores performed by his wife and the children at home because, if they were not there, he would have to engage a housemaid. It just is not attainable and we are now getting into the realm of the ridiculous.  There has always been, as Deputy Haughey knows, a clear distinction between the services performed by employees and the services <Col N="2166" /> performed by one's own kith and kin. It would be quite impossible to try to get a subtle differentiation between these two in the tax code and to measure what was a service of a commercial nature and what was a service of a natural family disposition.</P>
      <P>On the issue of interest, I want to emphasise that the interest availability to a person operating the notional income is the same as is available to any person which will enable him to get interest up to an annual limit of £2,000.  If the interest attained by a person in the course of farming business were to exceed £2,000 annually, then that person would be well advised to go for the actual accounts. If one's natural accounts were able to show that the money borrowed for farming purposes propounds an interest rate in excess of £2,000, he would get the allowance in excess of £2,000. As long as he goes for notional income for the purpose of calculating farm income it will be notional income less these deductions I have mentioned. That would take all allowances into account, including such interest allowances as might arise.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>It is not specifically referred to here because it is not necessary to refer to it.  We are dealing here with the assessment of farming profits and we are providing a notional basis and allowing certain deductions from that for farm purposes. The farmer who is subject to income tax is entitled to the same entitlements as any other taxpayer. That includes, in relation to interest, a right to personal interest set off. If you want to put the interest on a business basis&mdash;no doubt they might do that if the interest liabilities are in excess of £2,000&mdash;they would then go for actual accounts.  They cannot be denied legitimate entitlements under existing law.</P>

I want to tell the Minister of the experience of a farmer friend of mine.  He is married with two children and his land is valued at £150.50.  When he first heard about this notional valuation business he was very pleased, and said: &ldquo;This is marvellous.  I will not be paying any tax.&rdquo;  Unfortunately, when he got down to doing his calculations&mdash;this is a perfectly ordinary, straightforward case&mdash;he found that the notional valuation basis would result in his paying an annual tax of £595.50 on a £150.50 valuation farm.  This notional basis is not any great god-send.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>The object of this amendment is to ensure that the allowance for capital expenditure provided for in section 22 will be available on a depreciation over a five years basis instead of ten years as provided in the section.  The reason for this is that in many aspects of farming the rate of technological obsolescence in the kinds of farm buildings that are required is extremely <Col N="2169" /> high and certainly a ten-year period is far too long in many aspects of farming.  Five years would be closer to reality than ten years.  It is for that reason, in order to bring the allowance more into line with the reality of the situation, certainly in a number of aspects of farming, that we propose this amendment to allow the depreciation over five years instead of ten years.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Crinion</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to support the amendment.  There was a period when all buildings that went up were built in bricks, mortar, steel, galvanised iron or stone, but quite a number of modern buildings which house poultry <i>et cetera</i> are pre-fabricated and have a life expectancy of only ten years and, after a couple of years, there is quite an amount of repair work to be done.  If you repair them you will get ten years out of them.  When I was in Holland five or six weeks ago I observed farm buildings on the modern farms there; for cattle and cows timber structures are used.  They are all short-life buildings. Anything built of timber needs repairing.</P>
      <P>There is a firm in my constituency in Meath which erects prefabricated buildings for cattle.  They are advertised in most newspapers.  They are only short-life buildings.  When thinking of the future, it would be more realistic to write such buildings off in five years instead of ten.  If this Bill had been introduced ten or 20 years ago I would have agreed with the Minister on this point but, when you take modern farming, modern trends and the type of modern buildings being erected today into account, a figure of five years would be more realistic.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Gibbons</NameTxt>
      <P>I, too, would like to support this amendment.  I would like to point out that anybody with even a cursory knowledge of the housing required for the milking of cows should realise that the people who a few years ago installed what were then modern in-line milking facilities had to replace them in a very short number of years.  That style of milking was superseded by the more modern type of milking parlour. <Col N="2170" /> A similar situation obtains in pig husbandry.  The continuously developing methods of housing pigs have been going on very rapidly over the last 25 to 30 years.</P>
      <P>There are eminently sensible grounds for accepting this amendment. The tendency is, as Deputy Crinion pointed out, in modern farm architecture to go for the purpose-built, rather short-lived type of structure rather than the splendidly built stone buildings that were inherited from the last century or possibly earlier.  These splendid buildings are of very limited use and cannot be adapted.  For that reason modern farming practice leans towards purpose-built modern buildings with not too much expensive durability built into them because farming, especially in transitional times such as these&mdash;ignoring, for the moment the present calamitous conditions&mdash;requires a certain flexibility. The EEC are actually offering incentive grants to people to get out of dairying.  If they have solid, permanent dairy buildings, and they accept the FEOGA grants to get out of milk production, they will require possibly to build houses for beef cattle.  They will get very poor consideration under section 22 of the Minister's Bill for so doing although the EEC are on the contrary subsidising farmers to get out of milk.</P>

Some have a very short life span and, after last year's winter storms, many farmers were sorry they had not erected more durable buildings.  Members opposite claim the Minister does not understand the problems involved. I myself erected buildings on my own premises with my own hands which, I am sure, will survive as long as myself and my children.  They will serve many purposes, even agricultural ones.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2173" /> The effect of this amendment is to allow claims for capital expenditure allowances as provided for in section 22 on farm buildings erected or farm works carried out before 6th August, 1974.  These allowances provided for in section 22 represent the cost of using the building or getting the benefit of the particular improvement concerned over the lifetime of the assets in question.  This should be allowed over that lifetime.  The effect under the Bill, as it stands, would be that, if a farmer last year incurred capital expenditure on, say, new farm buildings he will lose nine-tenths of the allowance he should get because, according to the section, he will be utilising that building for another nine years.  He will get no allowance, although he should get it.  Because of the period behind this section, he will be utilising that building for another nine years but he will not get any allowance as the section stands.  This is unreasonable.  In cases such as that I think the allowance should be given dating from the period when the work was done.  He would not get any allowance from April, 1974.  In so far as the remaining years after April, 1974, are concerned he should get the allowance.  This is a reasonable proposition. The contrary situation&mdash;the one provided in the section as it stands&mdash;is inequitable and does not do justice to farmers who expend money on this kind of construction and farm improvement works.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanCrinion" hpid="Mr. Crinion Mr. Crinion">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Crinion</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to support this amendment.  In past years farmers have spent large amounts of money on construction work.  This is particularly true of the year 1972.  The Department of Agriculture and Fisheries have been advising farmers over the past ten years to get cattle off the land for the winter and to invest in new buildings. Perhaps the Minister would clarify a few points for me.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>For example, a farmer erects a new building in January and pays for it in February; the grant from the Department does not arrive until July.  At which period would the building be reckoned to be completed?  Is it when the grant has been paid, when the <Col N="2174" /> building has been paid for or when the last nail is struck in the building?  The Department of Local Government maintain it is when the grant is paid. I should like to know the position of a farmer who erected a building this spring and the grant is paid this month.  When would it be reckoned the building was completed?  Buildings erected in the past ten years should have a certain write-off value for income tax purposes.  It has been said it is difficult to ascertain when the building is erected.  That is not so.  The Department of Agriculture and Fisheries have a record of when grants were paid and also of the cost of the building.  The allowance may be granted from that period on.</P>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>I support my colleague's approach to this matter.  I also want to discuss amendment No. 18 which is a subsidiary to the principal amendment, No. 17.</P>
      <P>The case has been made about the absolute necessity to allow these provisions in respect of expenditure on buildings which occurred before April of this year.  Farmers have been encouraged to embark on expansion programmes involving a great deal of building of one sort or another either-in preparation for or subsequent to our entry into the EEC.  A great deal of building has taken place prior to this year.  It is totally unfair that farmers are not allowed any write-off of that expenditure on buildings unless it was undertaken before April of this year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The reason for this is simply standard doctrinaire thinking.  It is inappropriate in this particular case.  There are strong revenue traditions that when an allowance of this nature is brought in the allowance is operative in regard to expenditure incurred after the provision is introduced.  Here we have a very unusual situation.  Farmers are moving from a tax-free position into a taxable position.  It is quite legitimate and quite justifiable and necessary to make special provision to cope with that situation.  This is not simply a question of providing a new allowance and making the normal provision apply to the new allowance, namely, that it is only applicable to expenditure incurred <Col N="2175" /> after it has been introduced.  This is a totally different situation in the background here and that is the change in regard to taxation of the farming community as a whole.</P>
    <P>My amendment has the effect of applying to expenditure on buildings the same provisions as the Minister is applying to expenditure on machinery. In regard to machinery, the Bill provides that even though the expenditure was incurred before April of this year, a notional writing down will be provided and the assets will be taken in to the income tax situation at a notional written down value at April of this year as if these provisions had applied from the date on which the machinery was purchased.  That particular provision has been criticised by the farming organisations as being unfair, but I would be inclined to accept it as a reasonable compromise&mdash;that machinery which was purchased at any time before April 1974 should be treated as if wear and tear provisions were in operation and it arrived at April, 1974 with a written-down value.  We then start at April, 1974 with that written-down value and allowances are given from then on based on that written-down value in the period of years involved.  That is not ideal but it is a reasonable compromise. What I am suggesting is that the same should be done as regards expenditure on buildings where that expenditure was incurred before April, 1974.  It is totally unfair that there should be no allowance from 1974 onwards in regard to capital expenditure on buildings.</P>
    <P>My amendment, taken in conjunction with amendment No. 18, provides the same procedure as the Minister is providing in the case of machinery, namely, that buildings will be regarded as having been written down in the period prior to 1974, will come into the system at a notional written down value at April, 1974 and from then on will be written off each year in accordance with the notional scale.  That is a fair compromise and I recommend it to the Minister and the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GerardCollins" hpid="Mr. G. Collins Mr. G. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister in his <Col N="2176" /> Second Stage speech said that in the interests of fair play the Bill contained a number of significant provisions. He enlarged on this in a number of places.  He wanted us all to think that fair play was his prime motive in introducing this Finance Bill.  In fairness to him, the idea was well sold.  The public were given the same treatment by the propaganda from RTÉ, who are on the Minister's payroll.  If the Minister wants the public to believe that he is acting in the interests of fair play, I think he should be only too willing to accept amendments Nos. 17 and 18 which are very fairly put.  If the Minister thinks he is acting in the interests of fair play by excluding buildings&mdash;very costly buildings erected by many in the past three or four years&mdash;I feel the propaganda effort in trying to sell the fair play idea will have back-fired. The Minister has an obligation to accept these amendments.  In doing so he would meet the wishes of everybody involved in agriculture.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>On all previous occasions when allowances were granted or extended or increased in respect of expenditure on construction of any buildings&mdash;one can think of market garden buildings, holiday camps, hotels, registered holiday accommodation&mdash;new allowances applied to expenditure incurred after the announcement of the commencement had been made.  It would be completely contrary to the lines followed on all previous occasions to provide now for the first time that new allowances for expenditure on farm buildings should take into account the expenditure incurred in previous years and particularly when in those earlier years the expenditure was incurred at a time when farming was not subject to any tax liability and correspondingly not entitled to any tax relief.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I recall that Deputy Colley advocated a similar concession on the Finance (Taxation of Profits of Certain Mines) Bill.  On that occasion Dáil Éireann considered it would not be appropriate to give that concession in respect of expenditure incurred before the liability for tax arose.  In respect of <Col N="2177" /> Deputy Haughey's amendment, I should like to say that it follows on the lines of amendment No. 17, which seeks to secure that a notional allowance of 10 per cent would be deemed to have been granted for every year prior to 1974-75 in which the buildings had been in use.  The Deputy proposes that the balance of expenditure in pre-1974 years would be available for write-off for 1974-75 and future years.</P>
    <P>The Deputy adopted this pattern from the provisions relating to the granting of wear and tear allowances in respect of machinery and plant used in an activity which was at one time exempted from tax but was then brought into charge, for example, in the case of the mining industry and co-operative societies from which the general exemption was removed in 1963.  What happens there is that the new legislation when it comes into charge to wear and tear allowances in respect of plant and machinery actually used in that activity, since they are entitled to wear and tear allowances in respect of this plant and machinery, the new legislation is confined to writing off notional allowances for the period during which the profits were exempt from tax.</P>
    <P>This position is being applied under this legislation to plant and machinery used on farms.  Section 25 contains the necessary provision.  This practice does not apply when new allowances are being introduced for the first time such as in this section.  These new allowances in respect of capital expenditure are always related to expenditure incurred from a current date.  If the Deputy can show me any case in the past where these allowances have been treated retrospectively I will be very interested and will have another look at it.  But I do not believe this has ever happened before in relation to capital allowances and I think it would be completely wrong to depart from that well established principle.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>The amendments in the names of Deputy Collins and Deputy Colley, whether taken singly or in conjunction are reasonable. Deputy Haughey's makes a great deal <Col N="2178" /> of sense regardless of what the Minister has just said, that he does not know of a precedent that could be applied.  If it is precedent we are looking for, as has already been pointed out, there is no precedent for taxing farming profits up to now.  Why then should we seek a precedent for reliefs or write-offs for allowances of this nature?</P>
      <P>The least that could be expected in this case would be that the section should be amended, whether by virtue of amendment No. 17 or amendment No. 18 or perhaps by a suitably worded amendment by the Minister and his advisers, so that the value of the asset provided at whatsoever time in advance of 6th April as mentioned in the Bill at the moment, would be taken as the starting value, taken as if it were a new asset created since 6th April, and that the write-off should then take place in the manner prescribed in the section.  In other words, whatever may be the value of the asset today, regardless of when it may have been created that this should be its written down or existing value.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If the Minister feels in this regard that there could be complications and that a great deal of work may be incurred for the people who administer the code, I would suggest to him a few ways in which the matter might be dealt with.  One way which immediately occurs to me is that a certificate from a properly appointed and recognised valuer would be accepted with, perhaps, spot checks here and there to ensure at the outset that the Minister was not being deceived as far as values were concerned, if he had any fears in that regard.  I would not have such fears.  I feel that the asset as it came in on 6th April, regardless of when it was provided, should qualify for the write-off for the period prescribed in the Bill.  In doing this the Minister would be creating no precedent that he or any of his successors as Minister would have to fear in that the possibility of new elements of the population being taxed for the first time in so far as their profits for an occupation are concerned is most unlikely in the future.  I do not think there are too many of these around for this or <Col N="2179" /> any future Minister to grapple with. But even if there are, relatively only a small number of cases would arise.</P>
    <P>Even if the suggestion in either of these two amendments or the amendment I suggest the Minister might consider seriously bringing in himself, were accepted, it would not be creating any difficulties for him in future, and even if such could arise and if any other elements can or will be taxed in the future for the first time, as is the case with farming profits in this Bill, it is only fair that whatever might be the asset which could be regarded as comparable to this particular asset can be dealt with in the future in like manner.</P>
    <P>Leaving the future aside, I put to the Minister as strongly as possible the view that since he is going to bring these people into the tax net for the first time, and if by their diligence and their own sacrifice and hard work they have created assets in the form of buildings which have made their enterprises more tax-giving, it is only fair that they should be regarded in the light suggested by various speakers.  I appeal to the Minister very strongly on this amendment that he should consider the idea of amending the section so as to give the benefit of the write-off in regard to any of those buildings at their present-day value.  That value could readily and very satisfactorily be ascertained by the use of recognised valuers certifying the present-day value.</P>
    <P>Another method could be taken into consideration by the Minister. That is the replacement value of the buildings as they now exist.  That could be taken as a yardstick whereby the write-off could take place.  But whichever of these methods the Minister might choose, I would again say to him not to have any fear of a precedent being created, not to be looking for precedents to justify taking this particular view, because we are dealing with the unprecedented in regard to this particular section.  There has been no precedent in regard to the application of the tax to farming profits and, therefore, there is no need to seek out a precedent <Col N="2180" /> for providing exemptions or write-offs as suggested here by these two amendments.  Perhaps the Minister and his advisers could bring in a more suitable and better method of doing the job that would incorporate either the replacement value or today's value, as it were, of the asset regardless of when it was created. These things would have been created in many cases by an amount of sacrifice by the present owners.  It would not now be fair to penalise those who had been more progressive and more far-seeing in making their buildings as they now exist because the date in April of this year happens to beat them in so far as the creation of a building or other asset is concerned.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanCrinion" hpid="Mr. Crinion Mr. Crinion">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Crinion</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister has been referring to lack of precedent. The reason for this is that there was no way of checking back on buildings erected in the previous years, but in the case of farmers there is a record of their buildings from the grants they were paid for them.  The inspectors who allocated those grants will have valued the buildings because the grants are usually on a percentage basis.  I ask the Minister to consider this and to have an amendment to cover buildings that have been erected in the past few years and grant them relief from tax.  I also request the Minister to give me a reply to a question I asked about buildings which were finished in February and the grants were paid in July.  Do they qualify?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>The date that would apply would be the date they were inspected&mdash;when the expenditure was incurred.  The question then arises of when it was incurred and does the date on which it became due matter.  It is very difficult to say in a general way what the formula will be or what the result will be by the application of that particular formula to the series of events in relation to any one particular building.  They do look at the case in which the liability to pay arose and that is regarded as the due date.  You could, therefore, have a situation in which the building was in course of construction before the <Col N="2181" /> operative date of this Bill but the liability to pay would not have arisen until after it.  It would then become within the period and it would flow from then to the exemptions thereafter.</P>
      <P>I am sorry that I find myself unable to breach this well-established principle that where capital expenditure falls into the state of an activity which is not liable to tax it cannot be given a concession thereafter.  The truth is that breaking of extensions occurred in the past at a time when liability to tax did not arise and the right to set off expenditure against tax did not arise either, so the question of the tax element did not enter into the reckoning of people when they made decisions to erect buildings. To change that well-established principle could have ramifications which could be, to say the least of it, extremely costly from every point of view.  I think it is better to apply the same set of rules as far as one can to all sections of the community.  No special case has been made here which would justify exceptional treatment which previously has not been extended to anybody else.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Plant and machinery in the past has been invariably treated separately.  It is the wear and tear of plant and machinery which is taken into account, not depreciation in the value of the commodity, except where it arises through wear and tear.  Of course, it can be argued that the capital allowance is, to some extent, <Col N="2182" /> compensation for wear and tear of buildings but they are not quite the same.  They are treated differently. The wear and tear allowance is applicable to machinery and not to buildings.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>But surely the Minister must agree that the depreciation and, indeed, the wear and tear of farm buildings, can only be differentiated from that of plant and machinery and/or equipment by virtue of the fact that you cannot normally &ldquo;up&rdquo; and take the farm building with you whereas you might do so in so far as plant, machinery and equipment is concerned.  Perhaps, this is really the reason why the differentiation would appear to be made at this particular time rather than what appears to me to be a rather naïve approach of the Minister that what is not done and has not been done in other somewhat similar situations should not now be done.  If it appears to the Minister that a change might be made and, therefore, it could be regarded as better done than we have been doing in the past in regard to these write-off allowances, why not do the job better by making the appropriate amendment?  Since the Minister is breaking new ground in bringing into the tax code profits from farming which heretofore were exempt, surely, in those circumstances he will consider the idea somewhat along the lines of either of the two amendments or perhaps one suitably worded by his own advisers.</P>

Capital allowances have never been available except from a current date.  We are applying the same principles to farming activities. To depart from these principles&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I mentioned other specific capital allowances which were new, which were introduced at certain times and were novel at the time of introduction but there was never any question of backdating them even though there was capital expenditure of a similar nature incurred in the years immediately preceding the granting of these allowances.  I think it is very important that we do not now proceed to grant new exemptions.  Any Minister for Finance knows&mdash;and there are at least two previous Ministers for Finance in this House&mdash;that if we open the way to any change in the existing principles the floodgates would be opened, which could have very, very serious ramifications indeed.  That is one aspect of it.  The other one is that no special case has been made and no particular difficulties have been identified which would justify a departure from these very well-established principles. Wear and tear allowances will be available for plant and machinery; the other allowances will be applicable from the date of the commencement of the liability to the tax charge.</P>

      <P>Again, might I suggest to the Minister that since the provision of farm buildings, particularly in recent times, but back over a number of years, has been encouraged by State subvention surely the making of due allowance for existing buildings and their replacement&mdash;as suggested in these amendments&mdash;could be regarded as an encouragement to farmers to improve the existing facilities or to erect new buildings?  Otherwise the Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries will, no doubt, be seeking moneys from the Minister for Finance and the Exchequer to pay out to them in order to encourage them to do this.  This is a consideration that may not have parallels in other regards as the Minister has mentioned and would to some degree set it apart and, therefore, it could make some impact on the Minister's thinking in regard to treating this matter, even if differently from other matters that he has in mind, before he would finally commit himself to this in its present form.</P>

      <P>On the section there are two points I want to put to the Minister.  First, I wonder if he could explain to us the significance of the reference in subsection (1) to &ldquo;the provisions of section 15 (1)&rdquo;.  Having regard to sections 20 and 21, in the first subsection in each case the reference is to section 15 without any reference to the subsection.  I would like the Minister to explain what is involved by the reference to section 15 (1).  The other point I want to put to the Minister is whether he has considered including in the items which would qualify for a capital expenditure allowance drainage work on wet farmlands.  On the face of it, it would appear to be the kind of thing that should qualify in the same way as the other items mentioned in subsection (2).  I wonder if the Minister has considered that.</P>

      <P>As I said earlier, the elasticity seems to have gone.  As I recall it, the Minister said that the losses that would be incurred this year could be written off in other years.  It is not quite the same thing as what I am asking, which is the reverse of what would be held out as justification for this measure by some members of the parties supporting the Government, and that would be to restrict as far as is possible the utilisation of farmlands and farming enterprises by business interests for the burying of their profits in the farm. What I am now asking is whether, in fact, the reverse can take place legitimately; in other words, can the losses on the farm be written off against the profits of the business instead of the business profits being buried in the farm which was exempted?</P>

      <P>There are different kinds of farm profits.  There are those which are chargeable and those which are not.  If profits are being made from a farming activity which are not liable to income tax and if that activity in a particular year suffers losses then those losses will not be available to write off against profits from some other activity.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 19:</P>
      <P>In page 13, between lines 36 and 37, to insert a new section as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(1)  This section applies to any person carrying on farming, the profits or gains of which are chargeable to tax in accordance with the provisions of section 15 other than a person who elects as provided for in section 21 (1).</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>(2)  Where a person to whom this section applies incurs, for the purpose of farming farmland occupied by him, capital expenditure on the provision of farmhouses, farm buildings, machinery or plant, there shall be made to him for the year of assessment in the basis period for which the expenditure is incurred, an allowance equal to one-half of the expenditure, and such allowance shall be made as a deduction in charging the profits or <Col N="2187" /> gains from farming the said farm land.&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>The object of this amendment is to provide an investment allowance for farmers paying tax on an accounts basis only&mdash;I should like to make that clear&mdash;and it would not apply in the case of those who are assessed on the notional basis.  An investment allowance in the case of those who are paying on an accounts basis would be an allowance of 50 per cent.</P>
    <P>The reason behind this amendment is primarily that where farmers are paying income tax on the same basis as another business or industry on an accounts basis, we say that as far as possible the same allowances, <i>et cetera,</i> should apply.  However, as has been mentioned previously in other connections, there is available to industry which engages in the export market, export tax relief.  It does not appear to be possible to apply export tax relief to the individual farmer but an allowance of this kind, applied on this basis, would be an effort to provide a somewhat analogous recompense to farmers, analogous to the export tax relief which is provided for industry.  Having regard to the fact that such a high percentage of farming output is exported, it seems reasonable that an effort should be made to provide some kind of allowance to farmers to correspond in some way with the export tax relief.  This is the thinking behind this amendment and it would apply only in the case of those farmers who are being assessed for tax on an accounts basis.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I find it hard to recognise Deputy George Colley as the man who was my predecessor in the office of Minister for Finance.  I seem to recall several occasions when he explained what a difference there was between profits generated by manufacturing industry for exports and profits from agricultural activities. The reason why&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;manufacturing industry was exempted in respect of <Col N="2188" /> goods manufactured for export was in order to stimulate the industrial arm.  It was revolutionary when it was introduced and indeed, it was objected to by the Fianna Fáil Party. It was introduced to transform the negative attitude that existed before then, which was one which forbade Irish industry to operate unless it had a 51 per cent Irish ownership.</P>
      <P>I was in Turkey&mdash;now very much in the news&mdash;about two years ago and it was very interesting to hear Turkish economists argue very strongly and convincingly and, I am glad to say, successfully, against concessions. Turkey had a law which was quite similar to the Control of Manufacturers Act which we had here.  It operated in the same way and very much against the interests of Turkey.  They are now changing it, with remarkable improvements as a consequence in the Turkish economy.</P>
      <P>I do not think it is in any way belittling to Irish agriculture to say that it does not require that incentive, because it is something that is here; its roots are down, the attachment to the farm, the love of the land, is something that does not require fiscal encouragement to generate.  Any realist knows it did not need and does not now need this very specific and artificial, but temporary injection, which had to be given in order to stimulate interest in the industrial activity which was so necessary in order to get us away from subsistence living which we had until we gave industry this injection. This injection I would remind the House was given in the days of the Coalition Government.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The amendment now suggested by Deputy Colley and Deputy Collins provides that where farmers elect to be charged tax on the basis of actual profits, they may be entitled to a remission allowance of 50 per cent of capital expenditure incurred on the provision of farmhouses, farm buildings, machinery or plant.  If the amendment were accepted it would mean that in relation to farmhouses and farm buildings&mdash;on which we have already provided a 10 per cent allowance per year under section 22&mdash;the total expenditure on such buildings <Col N="2189" /> could be written off in a mere five years, 50 per cent remission allowance of 10 per cent in the first year, plus 10 per cent in each of the following four years.</P>
    <P>If the other amendment from the same Deputies to increase the annual allowance from 10 to 20 per cent were also accepted it would mean the total write-off of such expenditures in a period of a mere three years&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not counting it in.  I am just pointing out how liberal the Opposition can be in throwing away allowances and concessions. A writing off of expenditure on buildings over a span as short as five years would be quite unrealistic. It certainly contrasts very sharply with the treatment for industrial buildings which has been referred to here. Industrial buildings can be written off over 39 years or 49 years.  That is quite different from what is being proposed in these allowances.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>In the case of hotel buildings and market garden buildings expenditure on those buildings can be written off over a period of nine years.  There is an initial allowance of 10 per cent, a first year allowance of 10 per cent, and then 10 per cent for each eight years thereafter.  When the initial allowance of 10 per cent was brought in for industrial buildings in 1956 during the time of the last Coalition Government, it also applied to hotels.  In 1959 an annual allowance of 2 per cent was made in the case of industrial buildings but it was decided that in the case of hotels the annual allowance should be 10 per cent.  There was a very good reason for that.  It was because, in order to keep our hotels up to modern, acceptable standards, to ensure that they are redecorated frequently enough and to maintain the proper standards, we had to ensure a very frequent reinvestment of money in them.  If we do not do that the danger is that the <Col N="2190" /> whole stock of hotels and our standards could slip back to the kind of thing we experienced up to about 20 years ago.</P>
      <P>I hope I have shown that by comparison with any other industry or activity in this country, the amendment proposed is quite exorbitant and would be out of pattern with any concessions available to any other sector of the economy.  In the circumstances of the agricultural industry, it would not be at all warranted.</P>
      <P>I would love to grant all these concessions that have been sought since early yesterday morning, but we cannot give any of them without having a look at the ramifications which the granting of these concessions would have.  If similar concessions were to be sought by all other sectors of the economy the whole tax position would become so topsy-turvy as to be meaningless.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>Could I bring the Minister back to the reality of the situation?  The Minister talks about niggardliness on the part of his predecessors and the granting of concessions. Surely he is forgetting entirely that he is far from granting concessions but is in fact imposing penalties for the first time.  This amendment seeks to make the penalties less severe than they are according to the proposals before us.</P>
      <P>In a Committee Stage debate as protracted as this, I suppose it is excusable and understandable that the Minister should get himself into the frame of mind of being less severe in the application of this the tax code for the first time on the farming community.  When amendments come from the Opposition perhaps he would think in terms of making a present of something to them rather than lessening the penalty that he is imposing on them for the first time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Replying to Deputy Colley, the Minister spoke about the reason for the difference of treatment for hotels as against the allowances for other buildings and industry.  But it is surely fully accepted down the years, and deplored, that we do not move fast enough in modernising our farming activities.  Various schemes have been <Col N="2191" /> devised&mdash;and no doubt will continue to be devised at considerable cost to the Exchequer&mdash;to encourage farmers to make improvements and incur the capital expenditure necessary to update some of their methods.  This applies very particularly to farm buildings.</P>
    <P>I would remind the Minister, as he has been reminded time and again, that the proportion of exports which derives from the farming community is a most significant part of our overall general exports.  We are not giving any recognition in any way to this while although we do so in so far as manufacturing industry and industrial products are concerned.  I have instanced to the Minister&mdash;and I have a particular example in mind&mdash;where the benefit of the concession on tax-free export profits of new industry has resulted in recent years of payment of a dividend&mdash;without tax being deducted, of course&mdash;which in each of two years has amounted to more than the total initial capital input for both plant and machinery.</P>
    <P>I am not cavilling at that.  I say to those people: &ldquo;Well done&rdquo;; but while that can be done in regard to manufacturing industry, surely in the case of our most important major industry which contributes so much directly&mdash;and an increasing amount indirectly&mdash;to our exports, some small consideration might be given to redressing the balance.</P>
    <P>This applies not only in regard to this particular amendment but to many of the following amendments. It would be better if the Minister could in some way relieve the imposition of taxation on farming profits for the future rather than straining his big-heartedness to make a concession to them.  We want to ease the impact of the penalty rather than seek a concession or hand-out for these hard-pressed people.</P>

Perhaps I might anticipate that the Deputy would make the point: &ldquo;Why do we not do the same in relation to capital expenditure on buildings?&rdquo;  All I can say is that it has never been so applied in the past and I am simply applying the law and the practices as they have previously been applied.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 21:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In page 14, between lines 30 and <Col N="2193" /> 31, to insert a new section as follows:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;(1)  This section applies to any person carrying on farming, the profits or gains of which are chargeable to tax in accordance with the provisions of section 15 other than a person who elects as provided for in section 21 (1).</P>
    <P>(2)  In any year of assessment in charging profits or gains of any person to whom this section applies no deduction shall be allowed in respect of rates payable for that year of assessment in respect of farm land occupied by that person for the said year of assessment but, instead, there shall be deducted from the tax which would, otherwise, be chargeable the full amount of such rates.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The objective aimed at in this amendment is to ensure that in the case of farmers paying income tax on an accounts basis, they would, having had their tax assessed, be entitled to deduct from the amount of tax payable, the amount of rates they paid or for which they are liable.  Effectively this would amount to derating for farmers who were paying income tax on an accounts basis.  A number of the relevant points and arguments were made earlier in the debate under other headings and I do not propose to go into them all in detail again.  However I want to point out that it is not correct for the Minister to argue, as he did in this connection earlier, that the correct comparison in this matter is between one taxpayer and another. It is quite unrealistic for the Minister to ignore the situation obtaining for competitors of farmers in this country particularly competitors in the North and in Britain.  Furthermore, as Deputy Crinion pointed out earlier, there are figures available which would suggest in relation to the figures available for 1972, which I think are the latest available under this heading, that the proportion of farm income of the farmers who would be liable to income tax is double the proportion which they pay in rates and, therefore, double that paid by other businesses.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2194" /> For these and many other reasons, which I am not going to advance at this time, I believe that it is important and just that, in the case of farmers who are being taxed on an accounts basis, they should be allowed to deduct the rates from the actual amount which would otherwise be due.  Failure to do this amounts to double taxation on the one asset, because it is undoubtedly true to say that the land for farmers is, as far as we can have any analogy, analogous to the raw material for industry, which is not subject to rates.  Furthermore, the services provided to farmers in return for rates are not in any way comparable to the services provided in general to industry and commerce in return for rates.  For these reasons I would strongly urge this amendment on the Minister.</P>

      <P>I referred to this matter earlier.  It is very important to have the facts right because we have listened to a great deal of unfounded, emotional talk on the matter of the rates burden on the farming community.  Taking the calculations which have been used since the Commission on Income Taxation, 1960, we find that by 1973 rates as a percentage of farm income was 3.8 per cent. Rates as a percentage of non-agricultural income was 5 per cent.</P>

We have not the relevant rates liability of the non-agricultural income sector who would be in the top sector.  Reliable calculations show that they are paying between 6 per cent and 7 per cent. Without going into too much detail&mdash; the statistics are not there in sufficient detail to be precise&mdash;certainly the picture which emerges is that the rates burden on the agricultural community is no greater than that on the industrial and commercial sector and there are certain statistics available which show that it is very significantly less.</P>
      <P>I am sorry that I cannot accept the amendment.  In considering the question of the grant to farmers of a special extra credit for rates, and that is what the proposal suggests, reference must be made to the relief by the Exchequer to try to provide relief for rates on lands by means of the agricultural grant.  This amounts to £27 million out of £43 million to which agricultural land is at present liable.  Farms with a valuation of under £100 as well as those over £100 are entitled to this relief.  Some of those&mdash;I mentioned about 7,000 out of 20,000&mdash;will be liable for income tax as a result of this Bill.  For the relief of farmers with land valuations of, for example, £100, £150 or £200, it amounts to 40 per cent, 37 per cent and 35 per cent respectively.</P>
      <P>That is a very considerable contribution which farmers receive from other taxpayers in the community. Farmers with a rateable valuation of £100 get 40 per cent relief; farmers with £150 valuation get 37 per cent relief; farmers with a valuation of £200 get 35 per cent relief.  In addition to that they get £17 for every male full-time worker.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Therefore, if account is taken of the admissibility under this Bill of rates as a deduction against income the aggregate relief provided to a farmer with a rateable valuation of £100 is 56 per cent; a £150 rateable valuation farmer gets 53 per cent relief and a £200 farmer gets 52 per cent relief.  These are <Col N="2196" /> very significant contributions from other taxpayers and certainly operate very significantly to the benefit of the agricultural community.  I would hope that in any future discussions on these matters these facts would be put in the balance rather than emotive talk about a tax upon a tax.  Everybody liable for rates&mdash;and the Fianna Fáil White Paper on rates says there is no alternative to rates&mdash;find invariably they have to pay other taxes as well. We all pay several taxes.  We pay direct taxes; we pay indirect taxes; we pay taxes for services; we pay taxes on the transfer of property; we pay local rates. We pay a multitude of different rates. The way to do away with all these taxes is of course to apply a flat VAT rate across the board to do away with any other form of tax.  But that would be anti-social because it would oblige people with little or no means to pay the tax burdens which the better-off sections of the community should carry.  I do not think that would be fair.</P>
    <P>I do not want to prolong the debate at this hour of the morning.  If Members desired it, I could give a half-hour dissertation on this, which I think would completely deflate the argument that farmers are being unfairly treated.  The truth is that the situation in 1974 is not at all the same as it was in 1960.  In 1960 they paid more than twice the amount of rates percentagewise as was paid by other sectors of the community.  Today they have overtaken other sections of the community and the burden of rates they carry is significantly higher.</P>

    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>May I just refer to the Minister's reply and, in doing so, support the amendment as proposed. The Minister says there has been too much emotive talk about these provisions but he himself then goes on to display this same sort of quality that he condemns in others.</P>
      <P>Leaving that aside, I think the Minister is making an error in so far as the 77 per cent of farmers who do not pay any rates on land are concerned when he makes his case about how well the farmers are treated by way of relief of rates paid out from the Exchequer.  He repeatedly falls into a mistake in regard to the remaining 23 per cent.  On his own figures they would be deemed to be paying rates on agricultural land.  But the Minister takes all of that 23 per cent and uses it in his calculations to show how the amount of rates in relation to the income of that group is lower by some 1½ per cent than it is in respect of industrial and manufacturing concerns.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This is certainly very misleading. I believe that, instead of the figure the Minister has given to us here just now, the percentage works out at something comparable to the 5 per cent that he indicates it is in the other walks of life.  If he could make a calculation, which I doubt is capable of being made at this stage, he might well find that the people in the farming community who are being brought into this tax net are far fewer than the 23 per cent paying some rates on agricultural land.  Therefore the Minister's 5 per cent may well have to be <Col N="2198" /> increased, perhaps by another 5 per cent or 10 per cent in order to be put in its proper perspective.  Perhaps the Minister or some of his advisers in the time that is left to them might correct this.  Whereas my suggestion that the percentage could be as high as 15 might be wrong, I have no doubt at all that the figure of 5 per cent quoted by the Minister is wrong.</P>
    <P>I think the Minister is totally and absolutely unfair to the farming community when he talks about the £27 million for relief of rates being paid out of the Exchequer, saying that this indicates the kind manner in which the present Government are treating the farming community.  Might I say to the Minister that he is forgetting to quite a considerable degree&mdash;I do not suggest that he is deliberately forgetting; he is genuinely forgetting&mdash; the fact that the annual amount which must be paid from the Exchequer in lieu of rates that should have been collected is the basis on which the strongest possible case can be made against this new tax code being applied to the farming community. That money is not paid from the Exchequer on the basis that we like the colour of their hair or their eyes, or because we want to cling on to the land as something that should be preserved as a national monument. It is done because Deputies from all over the country have made representations as to the financial pressures put on farmers by the escalating poundage being charged on valuations and also because of our knowledge through various Deputies of the inequities of the existing valuation system. It is because of the need for relief of the burdens that farmers have experienced in an ever-increasing way over the years that the Minister finds himself in the position that £27 million is required to fill the gap between what would be paid by the farming community as a whole and what is being paid.</P>
    <P>Surely the Minister cannot be serious when he suggests that this is a reason why favourable consideration should not be given to even the most modest suggestion by way of <Col N="2199" /> amendment of the new penalties that he is imposing by taxing farming profits for the first time.  It is in the other direction that the Minister should be looking.  He should take note of the pressures that have been borne in on this and previous Governments not only to continue the rates reliefs and remissions that have been in operation but to increase them, irrespective of the demands that there might be for money or the difficulty of raising money.  For a considerable number of years past the total amount in rates relief has risen and indeed in other circumstances&mdash;I suppose understandably so, particularly at election times&mdash;it was most difficult for the Minister's own party to know what they were doing by way of rates relief and what they were going to do in that respect.</P>
    <P>If that is the case then surely it can be said that these reliefs are given because they are absolutely necessary and the need for them has been established. In those circumstances the Minister is totally wrong in quoting this £27 million rates relief for the farming community as a justification for knocking every suggestion made to ease the new penalties involved in the tax code that he now proposes to apply.  I would ask him to refrain from reiteration of the £27 million as if it were a prize that he had handed out free, gratis and for nothing and for no reason good, bad or indifferent other than &ldquo;we like the farmers&rdquo;.  It is paid because we regard it as being required to be paid by virtue of the circumstances in which the farming community are trying to survive and in order to provide the basis for a thriving agriculture on which our very existence depends as it has done over the years.  The Minister is far from being fair in suggesting that in giving £27 million the Government are not doing badly and the farmers are not doing badly and while some of them may be losing there are others making money at the moment.  This is not a fair approach and certainly is not in keeping with what the Minister's attitude should be.</P>
    <P>In a situation where he is for the <Col N="2200" /> first time creating a situation that farming profits will bear tax as from now, I would ask the Minister to relax this attitude that unnecessary large sums of money are being given to the farming community by way of rates relief and that therefore the new tax code is justified.  That is a wrong attitude and one which can well be misunderstood and can do no good at a time when farmers are very, very hard pressed, particularly in the cattle production side.  Nobody can gainsay that they are losing. There is no point in saying otherwise. As has been interjected here by Deputy Gibbons the price of a calf or the lack of a price for a calf has a very direct bearing on the wellbeing and profitability of the dairying industry. Certainly in that regard the dairying industry has suffered a blow over the last 12 months.  Even though it may have been a less severe blow than was given to those who were induced by various devices of Government policy over these recent years to leave dairying and to go totally into beef production, nevertheless it is still true to say that the losses being sustained by beef producers are reflected to quite a considerable degree in the disasters that have occurred in the dairying industry in regard to the price of calves.</P>
    <P>So let us stop talking as if the farmers were really cleaning up.  Let us remember how far short of our promises has been the performance in regard to the bonanza and the markets that were to be available when we joined the EEC.  The farmers were misled, not deliberately, but misled they were.  They are paying the penalty at the moment and now insult is added to injury by the great fellows in the Coalition treating the farmers in the same way as they treat everybody else.  If we want to treat the farmers in the same way as everybody else then we should have regard to the importance of their industry without which there would be very little else capable of thriving in this country.  This is something which we should not forget.  We should keep in mind that we may well drive out of agriculture farmers who have held on <Col N="2201" /> through good and bad times and who have stayed with their land because they wished to do so, and not merely for profit.  I would hate to see the time when only those who regarded the land merely as a means by which they could literally or metaphorically milk profits would own land.  When that time comes the Minister and others may regret that they may have hastened that day by the measures proposed in this Bill.</P>
    <P>I would ask the Minister again, even in the small respects that the various amendments indicate, to recognise the special place that agriculture and the farming community have in the life of the nation and to appreciate that he is most unfortunate in his choice of year in which to apply a tax code to the farming community who at this stage need very special consideration and a morale boost rather than the kick in the pants which is being administered to them by this Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMGibbons" hpid="Mr. J. Gibbons Mr. J. Gibbons">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Gibbons</NameTxt>
      <P>When the Minister, with his appalling lack of understanding of the rural scene, was speaking earlier on this section, he said that while things were admittedly in a bad way in the beef sector of the farming industry, there were other things.  What did he mean?  Certainly not the livestock area.  Did he mean the dairy sector?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the files of his colleague the Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries there are carefully prepared accounts from one of the best dairy farmers in Ireland, who is a constituent of mine.  He keeps nearly 200 dairy cows with average yields of over 800 gallons each.  The standard of management could not be bettered not only in this country but probably within the European Community.  His stocking rate is one cow to the statute acre. This is on fairly good average Kilkenny land.  His net profit last year was £38 per acre and, incidentally, per cow because of the stocking rate &mdash;one cow per acre.  This year so far he is sustaining a loss of £18-£19 per acre and the key factor in this dramatic change that is putting this highly efficient farmer into a state of disarray <Col N="2202" /> is the disastrous drop in the price of calves.  Last year each cow and each acre would have made an average price of £60, £70, even £80. The last time I was talking to this man he told me that of the calves of his 200 cows there remain on his hands 100 calves, costing £1 a week each to support because they are unsaleable. The Minister ought not to imply even after his long and fatiguing day, that while things in the beef sector may be extremely chaotic, that things in other areas of the livestock sector are good.  They are not.</P>
    <P>Let me look back briefly at what happened at last year's cereal harvest. We discover that barley producers sold the profits of their labour at about £42-£43 a ton.  At one period early this year that barley, which was put into store at 14, 15 or 16 per cent moisture and required very little, if any, drying, was sold back to the farmers and cattle sellers at harvest time because there was no farm storage for it, at prices up to £70 a ton.  The Minister for Industry and Commerce told us here a couple of months ago that there was nothing he could do about it and there was nothing that he wanted to do about it.  The farmers who sold that barley sold it at a price that was considerably better than that of the year before, but the people who derived a real profit from it were not the farmers at all, but the middlemen, the merchants, the exploiters who sold back to the farmers, in many cases the same farmers, the produce of their own labour, having exacted £20-£25 a ton profit, for merely storing it in stores that were built by liberal Government grants.  The Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries and the Department have not yet seen the light and seen the urgent necessity of the provision of farm storage so that this does not again happen.</P>
    <P>I should like to refer to another remark that was made on this section. It was an implication that the decision to enter the EEC was in some way erroneous and that people were becoming disillusioned with it.  This notion is being carefully inculcated by members of the Government who opposed our entry into the EEC, in an <Col N="2203" /> effort to excuse themselves for the appalling mismanagement of this country's agriculture since 14th March last year.  It is a very distressing thing to see.  The Community beef marketers, in my opinion, badly mismanaged.  I said as much to the Commissioner in the European Parliament a short time ago.  When, too late, measures have been taken to alleviate the situation, I would expect that the pay-off of the measures that have been taken will not take effect in Ireland for six months.</P>
    <P>It is wrong, mischievous and destructive of Irish interests to suggest that our participation in the European Community was a mistake.  It is worth recalling that in 1970 we were informed by the British authorities that the <Col N="2204" /> amount of butter they would purchase from the Irish dairy industry in that year was 25,000 tons.  Thereafter we sold the best Kerrygold butter in places such as Mexico and Nigeria for as little as six old pence per pound.  We need not do that any more.</P>

      <P>I have a motion down to oppose section 26.  I might as well explain my purpose in putting down an amendment to sections 26 and 27 is simply to have farming regarded the same as any other trade or business, namely, that losses would be fully allowable both for income tax and CPT purposes, where there is a company involved.  As in so many other provisions in this chapter, less generous provisions are made in regard to the carrying forward of losses on farming than is the general rule in trade and the professions generally. My reason for putting down these amendments&mdash;that is, opposing sections 26, 27 and/or deleting subsection (7) of section 27&mdash;was to endeavour to have the normal provision for losses obtain in regard to farming losses.  In view of the time at our disposal and in order not to delay the House, as there are other perhaps much more important amendments later on, I withdraw these three amendments.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2207" /> In page 16, between lines 30 and 31, to insert a new section as follows:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;(1)  This section applies to any person carrying on farming, the profits or gains of which are chargeable to tax in accordance with the provisions of section 15 other than a person who elects as provided for in section 21 (1).</P>
    <P>(2)  Where a person to whom this section applies would, for any year of assessment, be charged to tax in accordance with the provisions of section 58 (1) of the Income Tax Act, 1967, under Case 1 of Schedule D on the full amount of the profits or gains of the year preceding the year of assessment, he may, by notice in writing in accordance with the provisions of subsection (3), elect to be charged to tax for that year of assessment and for each of the immediately succeeding four years of assessment on the yearly average of the full amount of the profits or gains of the year of assessment immediately preceding the year in which such notice is given and of the full amount of the profits or gains of the immediately succeeding four years of assessment.</P>
    <P>(3)  Notice of election under subsection (2) shall be given, by the person exercising such right of election, in writing to the Inspector within six months after the commencement of the year of assessment in which it is given and shall be irrevocable.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The purpose of this amendment is to provide that, in the case of farmers who are paying income tax on an account basis as distinct from the notional basis of assessment, they would be given an option, which option would be irrevocable, to have their profits and accounts averaged over a period of five years and their income tax liability eventually based on the average profit situation over that five years.  There are a number of reasons for this, but the primary reason is that because of the inherent nature of agriculture, it is affected by weather and climatic conditions in a way no other business is and by <Col N="2208" /> the inevitable cyclical nature of the agricultural industry.  I understand that there is a provision having the same effect in operation in New Zealand where, as the House knows, agriculture is a very important part of the national economy.  I would hope that the Minister would find it possible, having regard to the inherent nature of agriculture, to accept this amendment.</P>

      <P>It is not too early in the negotiations with the farming organisations to decide what should be their precise nature, but it is too early yet in the process of negotiation between the Department of Finance, the Revenue Commissioners and the farmers' association to say that the pattern or averaging suggested is the correct one in Irish circumstances. Quite clearly there cannot be an application <Col N="2210" /> of an averaging concept in the first year of the new tax.  You need to have experience of a number of years before you can measure what is the appropriate dimension of the average. I have assured the farming organisations that I am well disposed towards the idea of averaging.  I think we need to have some experience of profit-making and loss incurring before we can work out in the Irish context a satisfactory pattern of averaging.  My understanding of the position is that the farming associations accept that my approach to this is the right one and that it is reasonable that we would not try to construct an averaging clause at the moment of initiation of a new tax code.  I have indicated that this seems to be the correct thing to do.  Under our existing laws people have the right to carry forward losses in an industry where there is such a volatile performance, where there are peaks of profit and valleys of loss.</P>

      <P>You do get these variations, not due to the occupants of political office but rather due to the performance of nature.  However, it is proper to point out that the agricultural industry is not the only one which has these variations in performance. If new averaging principles are to be introduced for the agricultural sector, it may well be that these will be taken as a pattern for other sectors which might be inappropriate. Therefore, it is not something to be rushed into, and on that account I would ask that the amendment would not be pressed, and that my readiness to accept the desirability of averaging in principle would be seen as a recognition <Col N="2211" /> that I understand the problem, but that it is something which, in the interests of all sectors of the economy, and the agricultural sector in particular, needs to be teased out just a little further.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 25:</P>
      <P>In subsection (1), page 16, line 39, after &ldquo;apply&rdquo; to add &ldquo;but this section shall not apply if the rateable valuation of the farm land occupied by him does not exceed £50 and his spouse is not in receipt of income from a source other than that farm land&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>The effect of this amendment would be to ensure that the various personal tax allowances would not be halved if the farmer in question had some employment outside his farm, and the valuation of his land did not exceed £50, and his spouse was not in receipt of any other income than that obtained from the farmland in question. It is vitally important that attention should be paid to what is involved in this amendment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister showed by the provision he introduced in this section that he had learned, between the budget speech and the introduction of the Bill, something of the importance of what was involved.  In the budget speech he had provided that any farmer, no matter what the size of his holding, who had any other employment, would have his tax allowances halved.  In the Bill he provided that that would operate only in the event of his having a valuation above £20. Research in Ireland has shown that where farmers, particularly small farmers, have non-farm employment, the standard of performance in the farm goes up, and for a very simple reason.  For the first time they have some money to invest in the farm, and they do invest it in the farm. Consequently, it is in the national interest that we should try to ensure <Col N="2212" /> that farmers, those with small and medium-sized farms, who have this kind of employment are encouraged to invest in their farms.  The whole basis of the policy which was followed by successive Fianna Fáil Governments was to try to ensure, by the provision of non-farm employment, that the flight from the land was stemmed.  A very potent factor in this was the fact that people could get industrial and other kinds of employment and still maintain their holdings.  Research has shown that in these circumstances the manner in which they conducted their farming operations improved enormously, with considerable benefit, not just to them but to the whole economy.</P>
    <P>This is something that is very important. It should be maintained and there should be no disincentive introduced in this Bill to that kind of operation, As to how one arrives at the figure of £50 valuation as the right figure here in coming to this conclusion I relied on the Minister's own assessment, which he gave in his Second Reading speech.  He said that he had, in relation to section 16, fixed a valuation figure of £50, and said:</P>
    <P>This floor has been introduced so as to avoid bringing into the charge to tax the smaller farmer who has to supplement his farm income by working, for example, as a tradesman on his own account, or as a small contractor.</P>
    <P>On that basis it seems reasonable, if you want to get this category of farmer, to arrive at a figure of £50 valuation.  Having arrived at that, I believe that it is important that you should maintain the incentive that existed in the past.  I want to make it quite clear&mdash;because apparently there has been some misunderstanding and misrepresentation of our position in this matter&mdash;that this amendment does not apply to where the spouse of the farmer is engaged in an occupation from which an income is earned other than on the farmland in question.  Where that does not operate, in other words, where the farmer on the holding of up to £50 valuation has an occupation off the land, as well as farming his holding, he would not <Col N="2213" /> have his income tax allowances.  It is a matter of considerable significance that stretches far outside the confines of the income tax code.  I hope the Minister will look outside the confines of that code in dealing with this amendment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like also to urge this amendment on the Minister. Reference has been made already, particularly by Deputy Sheridan and Deputy James Leonard, to this whole question of valuation.  As you know, the different valuation&mdash;I think the date was 1854&mdash;was made at a time when in my native province and county and in Deputy Leonard's county also, the linen industry and the growing of flax were very important. Consequently, the yield per acre was high and on that basis land was valued very highly.  That valuation has been retained since then and it is in a sense a gross injustice.  The buildings, for example, in the Dublin city centre are grossly undervalued and the people feel a sense of grievance because of that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>For that reason the raising of the valuation to £50&mdash;indeed in some cases it is too low&mdash;as mentioned in the amendment is important.  This party have, in accordance with the findings of sociologists, attached great importance to the maintenance of the vigorous rural community.  As Deputy Colley has just said, much of our economic policy has been geared for that purpose.  The special designated areas and the support for small industries in rural areas and so on&mdash;all this was based on a policy which regarded the preservation of a virile, vigorous and populous rural community as important. This adds, if not eloquence, at least enthusiasm to my pushing of this amendment on the Minister. European rural sociologists have made studies in these matters and they regard encouragement to people who are living on farms that are not adequate to support a farmer and his family as very important.  Sociologists also show that where you have not got a vigorous rural community the large urban communities suffer, because the large urban communities are not able to support themselves population-wise. <Col N="2214" /> The words of the amendment are adequate. I, myself, would be a little more lenient with regard to the wife, but I am not permitted by the wording of the amendment to wander off what is here.  I would urge on the Minister the importance of accepting this amendment, particularly because of the anomaly in the valuation system.</P>

      <P>I support this amendment.  I believe that it is a terrible state of affairs when we have a Minister for Finance who should be a responsible Minister introducing a section like section 28 of the Finance Bill.  We all know that in rural areas, areas like County Kerry, we are trying to promote industry and trying to get farm employment.  I challenge the Labour Party members to stand over section 28.  When you are talking about a farm with a valuation of £20, you are referring to a farm of about 18 to 20 acres.  Do Deputies in the Labour benches expect a man with a farm of 18 to 20 acres to make a living on that farm and to support a wife and family on it in present circumstances?</P>
      <P>It has been the policy of Fianna Fáil Governments to provide for off-farm employment in industry for small farmers whose valuation was £20 or less.  It is only right that in an economy such as ours, in a situation where we have so many small farmers, we should provide employment in industry, and if we are going to penalise small farmers in the way the Minister for Finance intends to do in this Bill by cutting their tax-free allowances by 50 per cent for off-farm employment, then we are about to see the end of small farming in this country and force those men to emigrate to seek a living for themselves and their families.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I was speaking to the County Kerry chief agricultural officer recently, and he told me that industry in the Killarney area and throughout south Kerry was <Col N="2215" /> a tremendous boon to agriculture. Through their incomes from non-farming activities, those people were able to increase production on their farms.  They were able to maintain production at a high rate, and were it not for their industry many of the small holdings in south Kerry would have gone years ago and many of the owners would now be in England and America.  As I have said, if section 28 is passed it will mean the end of small farmers, and this would be the worst thing that could happen to the economy of this country.</P>
    <P>We must remember that between the age group 18 to 60 those engaged in productive work are fewer in number compared with the same group in any other country and, particularly, in the EEC countries.  Instead of passing section 28 we should encourage people to remain on their small holdings with valuations of £20. We should encourage these people to take up employment off the farm to help maintain and educate their families and keep them in the country.  I have an objection to section 28 as it stands and I strongly support the amendments to the section.  I believe that section 28, if passed&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Callanan</NameTxt>
      <P>I would make one appeal to the Minister.  I have not spoken for the last three hours, but this is an amendment of vital importance to small farmers.  He has accepted that up to £20 valuation there will be no cuts in the allowance, but from £20 to £50 there will.  I can assure the Minister that the majority of the farmers, even in the £20 to £50 bracket, will be transitional farmers and will not, therefore, qualify.  It is scandalous to do away with the incentive to these people to get off farm employment and, if this section is passed without the amendment, <Col N="2216" /> that is what will happen.  I would like to make it clear that there is more need for this amendment than for any other amendment.  I represent the small farmer and, on his behalf, I would urge the Minister to accept this amendment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanCalleary" hpid="Mr. Calleary Mr. Calleary">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Calleary</NameTxt>
      <P>I support this amendment.  I believe it would be a considerable help in bringing industries into areas like the area I represent.  There has been an intensive drive in the last number of years to bring industry to the western seaboard. In the Ballina area that drive has been very successful.  This amendment would benefit that drive.  If the Minister does not accept the amendment I can see a situation arising in which people will be discouraged from taking up industrial employment.  The average valuation in the Moy valley is roughly £1 per acre and that would leave under the section, if the amendment is not accepted, a holding of roughly 20 to 25 acres.  The EEC and various other bodies have said that in order to get an economic living out of a holding it must be in the region of 40 to 45 acres and, if it is not of that acreage, it is essential then that off-farm employment should be available.</P>
      <P>What the Minister is doing is, in effect, putting the onus on people with off-farm employment to prove to the Revenue Commissioners they are not making a profit from their farms. This will involve them in the expense of getting accounts prepared and getting an auditor to present their case on appeal.  What will happen is that assessments will be made on these people.  They will be paying PAYE and they will then have their allowances cut in half.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This section is an indication of the thinking of the Minister.  It is the forerunner of the ceilings of £100 and £50 that he has set, which apply to other sections.  The amendment includes categories of workers like county council workers, Bord na Móna workers, ESB workers, CIE workers, factory workers, forestry workers.  It will even include men who put in some part-time work <Col N="2217" /> assisting at cattle marts for one or two days a week.  It covers tradesmen and those who carry on business in a small way as handymen.  The implications for the economy are very very widespread.  In my constituency certainly there is deep resentment against this section.  Even the amendment will not satisfy quite a number of the people who rightly resent this section. But, if this amendment is not accepted, there will be an inevitable move away from the small industries that are being set up.  There is a definite pattern.  The men work in off-farm employment during the day and their wives and families do whatever they can on the farm.  When the men come home in the evening they work on the farm.  A 15-hour day put in by some of them.  If they make a profit &mdash;because of the size of the farm their profits will be small&mdash;they will now be in the position of having to prove to the Revenue Commissioners that they are not really making a profit.  If they are making profit it is as a result of many long hours of toil both by themselves and by their families.  I appeal to the Minister to help these people by accepting this amendment.  I do not believe it goes far enough.</P>

      <P>I thoroughly agree, but all kinds of puerile examples have been quoted against our efforts here to amend and purify the tax laws.  This is what we have had to put up with since the beginning of this debate.  I am coming down to the realities.  I am <Col N="2220" /> giving examples of two men and two women, performing exactly the same tasks, putting in exactly the same hours, coming from the same areas, one perhaps was born and bred in a small town, with a population of 2,000 and the other living just outside the town on a small farm; but because of the advantage of the farm relief in the past, the better-off man, with two incomes and a capital asset, is subjected to a lower rate of tax than is the man who happens to come from the working-class&mdash;&mdash;</P>

In respect of whatever number of man-hours a labourer puts in there ought to be drawn out from that an equivalent amount of tax, subject of course to whatever exemptions ought to be granted in respect of dependencies.

      <P>I am not going to enter into any competition about man-hours. I have heard very futile arguments over the years about man-hours. My own knowledge, which is a very realistic knowledge of both urban and rural environments, is that it requires as many hours for many people in the city to work in order to earn a standard of living equivalent to that enjoyed by their country cousins. There may be a basic argument of <Col N="2222" /> 40-hours a week, but it requires in a very large number of cases many hours beyond that before people can earn an income and a standard of living similar to that available to their country cousins.  Of course, there is the seven-day week for people in the country.  There is no such thing as the five-day cow.  Nobody is pretending that there is.  There is no such thing either as the five-day bus, or the five-day railway, the five-day sewer, the five-day water supply or the five-day electricity supply.</P>

      <P>I will conclude with these words: if what Deputies opposite are saying represents the view of rural Ireland, then we should have been slaughtered in the local elections.  But that did not happen because the ordinary people of Ireland, and that includes the people of rural Ireland, <Col N="2223" /> have an understanding of what is fair, of what is straight and of what is proper.  They know that our tax amendments affect only about 7 per cent of all those involved in agriculture. They are the 7 per cent who have in the main incomes far beyond the 730,000 unfortunate people who are caught in the net of PAYE and who have no opportunity of escaping. Even if the Opposition were to win the next general election, and we were beaten, I would have to live with my conscience.  I have to live with that which brought me into politics, namely, to try to do justice to the people of Ireland, to try to spread whatever opportunities and incentives there are equally amongst all our people.  Opposition Deputies failed when they were in Government and they are now trying to obstruct us, but they will not succeed.  I believe we will succeed.  We are doing what we promised to do and the results of the local elections prove that the people are on our side.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>We have had to listen throughout this whole debate to a great deal of drivel and we have had the Minister finishing up on a typical note, telling us that he is aiming at equality; he is aiming at equality of taxation on equality of earnings.  Of course, he is not and, when this is pointed out to him, he says they cannot do everything at once.  But that is what they are aiming at.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>What are the facts in relation to this section and the amendment tabled?  Is it not a fact that the Minister came in here on budget day and said he was going to disallow half the personal allowances in all of these cases?  That is what he said first.  Did he not then come in with the Finance Bill and say: &ldquo;No.  We are not going to do that for anybody below £20 valuation.&rdquo;  Why does the Minister try to bluff his way through right to the end?  The fact is that he said what he said in his budget speech.  Then he found out what the reality was and when that happened, he forgot all about equality and he comes back now and, in an effort to reach a practical political solution to the problem, he <Col N="2224" /> introduces the £20 valuation limit. Would he please think for a moment? How can he say that, if somebody is on an £18 valuation, he can have his full allowance but, if he is in a £22 valuation, he cannot because it is a gross inequity, a distortion of justice and an inequity in the tax system? The whole thing just does not make sense and the Minister should stop posturing in this way.  If he really means what he is saying, he is threatening to take away this £20 limit that is there, and I hope the Deputies on both sides will bring that message back to their constituencies. He is also saying that, as far as he is concerned, in order to achieve equality on the principle he has been enunciating <i>ad nauseam,</i> between not just one individual and another but one company and another, because companies are really individuals, he should abolish the export tax relief and, if he gets the chance, that is what he is going to do.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>Can the Minister deny that that is the logic of what he said? How can you have equality between two companies engaged in the same operations, one exporting and one not, if you are going to free one of them from tax and not the other?  Of course, what the Minister is doing here is having regard to the objective. That is the sensible approach and that is what we are urging the Minister to do.  Let him not tie himself down with this nonsense about equality and then run away when the political pressures are put on.  If there is any logic at all in what the Minister is saying, it means he wants to abolish export tax relief and, indeed, it would not surprise us very much if he did.  He has done so many things in the name of alleged equality, without any regard to the human consequences and social consequences, that he is capable of even that folly, were he allowed to get away with it.  But even he recognises that that would be such a task for him he would not like to take it on. That is the logic of what he is saying and he should recognise the nonsense to which he is subjecting this House <Col N="2225" /> and the people in his whole approach to the Finance Bill, an approach specifically illustrated in his approach to this amendment.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 1:</P>
      <P>In page 5, between lines 40 and 41, to add to section 3 the following subsection:</P>
      <P>(3)  Interest payable on any investment not exceeding £5,000 in a registered building society shall not be subject to the charge to income tax created by this section.</P>
      <P>This amendment is similar to an amendment in Deputy Colley's name on the Committee Stage which was discussed fully.  For that reason I do not think it necessary to go through all the arguments again <i>in extenso.</i></P>
      <P>However, there is a major difference between the Committee Stage amendment and this one in that in this instance the proposal to have the interest payable on investment in building societies not charged would be limited to an investment by any one person of not more than £5,000. This is to get over the difficulty that was pointed out on Committee Stage of the possibility of someone with a very large sum of money like £50,000 or £100,000 putting it into a building society for the purpose of avoiding tax on the income that would arise from it.  We feel that the limit of £5,000 investment&mdash;that does not mean £5,000 interest, because I think that suggestion was made from the Government side in the course of the Committee Stage&mdash;is a reasonable one and that it would not leave the situation open to the possibility of this concession, if it were granted, being abused by people of considerable wealth.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think it is necessary to reiterate briefly the necessity that exists in the country at the moment for an increase of investment and deposits in building societies.  It is notorious at the moment that virtually all of the building societies are not giving out loans or if they are giving them out it is on such a very limited scale that for the great bulk of potential house purchasers they are almost unobtainable.  I think we demonstrated here the last day that with the very stringent limits on income on the amount of the loans that are available through local authorities, most of the houses that are being built <Col N="2229" /> at the moment and most of the houses that are being sold at the moment cannot be purchased by people who have to rely on loans from local authorities.</P>
    <P>If you take the cost of the average semi-detached three-bedroomed house, which is the usual sort of one that most people buy&mdash;at the moment about £7,500 to £8,000&mdash;with a maximum loan from a local authority of £4,500, the prospective purchaser, usually a recently married man, is left with the problem of finding £3,000 to £3,500 or possibly £4,000 out of his own resources.  That, of course, is patently beyond the ability of the great majority of people, particularly young married people, to find at this time.  As the Government have refused to increase the amount which can be borrowed from a local authority and have also refused to increase the income limit of eligibility to borrow, the situation arises that a huge proportion of prospective house purchasers have no source of finance which is adequate to them to buy their own house.</P>
    <P>That is why we have the situation, despite what the Minister for Local Government and others say, that so many builders are this very week laying off large numbers of men.  It is why so many builders have indicated that in the next few weeks they will have to lay off more and more men.  The solution to that very serious, social and economic problem lies within the grasp of this House now if it will avail of the opportunity to pass this amendment.  It will open up new sources of finance for the building societies and when those new sources, which are not available at the moment because of the high cost of money elsewhere, are opened up immediately, the building societies can start to lend again to the sort of people to whom they have traditionally lent, and for whom in the last five years in particular they have proved a great boon.  I do not know whether the Government realise the serious straits that so many young married people are in today.  They simply cannot buy their own houses.</P>

      <P>The houses that were completed in 1973 were all started while the Fianna Fáil Government were in office.  The Central Bank have told us that in the first quarter of this year housing starts are down by 60 per cent on the corresponding quarter for last year.  I think that answers Deputy Flanagan's problem. I think he should reflect on those figures because they are very serious indeed.  Even with the reduced output of houses this year we have the situation in all our cities and larger towns that there are houses ready for occupation and plenty of people willing to buy them but they cannot do it because they cannot get finance from the traditional source of finance for such houses&mdash;that is the building societies.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Government by accepting this amendment can go a very long way to solving that problem now at the stroke of a pen.  This House has the opportunity between now and nine o'clock this morning, by accepting this amendment, to fill those houses and ensure that more and more houses will be built this year and to ensure that the trend we have seen on the Central Bank figures for the first quarter of this year will be reversed in the second half of the year.  If the House fails to pass this amendment it is ensuring that those houses will continue to remain empty because the people who are anxious to buy their own houses will be unable to do so.  It is perfectly simple now to solve that problem.  It cannot be argued as it was legitimately argued, I accept this, on <Col N="2231" /> Committee Stage that what we are now proposing would in any way help people who have a considerable amount of money to invest because the limit we are proposing here on investment is £5,000 which is a reasonably small sum and is not going to allow anybody of&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>May I take this opportunity on behalf of all Members of the House to express our very sincere gratitude to all the staffs of Oireachtas Éireann who have assisted us during somewhat difficult and strained and strange hours?  Without their help and their loyalty we could not have completed this business.  This reference is extended to the Captain, the Ushers and to the Official Reporters&mdash;this is something which might make us nervous because they have had to record every word we have spoken over many, many hours, hours when we would normally be asleep and when we may not have been very alert.  I wish also to express a word of gratitude to the gentlemen of the Press who were in attendance at all times to record our words of wisdom and otherwise for the benefit of our electorate.  Might I also mention on this occasion people who are never mentioned but to whom we owe a special debt of gratitude at all times, the civil servants.  When we are discussing a Finance Bill it is a time which is particularly difficult, with all sorts of technical difficulties, and I should like to say a special word of thanks to the officers of the Department of Finance and the Revenue Commissioners who at all times were at my elbow to convey to the House, through me, their guidance and wisdom.  To all these people, without whom the democratic machine could not operate, we owe a special debt of gratitude.</P>

When one considers that the staff are about to face another long day and also a session of the other House, one appreciates the strain that is being put on them.  We very sincerely appreciate the help and co-operation we have got from them.</P>
