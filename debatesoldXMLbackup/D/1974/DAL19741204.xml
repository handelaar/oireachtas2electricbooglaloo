      <P>I move:</P>
      <P>That Dáil Éireann formally expresses its support for the objectives of European integration in the economic, social and political spheres.</P>
      <P>The reason for this debate&mdash;and I am very sorry, indeed, if there was any error and the Opposition were not informed of this&mdash;is that we are approaching a summit meeting in the Community at which matters both of concrete policy, important economic issues and also institutional developments are to be discussed and it seemed an appropriate moment at which to have a discussion in which the House would have a chance to give its views on how it saw the future evolution of Europe so that the Government would have the advantage of those views in approaching this particular occasion.  The European movement at international level made the concrete suggestion that such debates should take place in the parliaments of member countries at this time and that reinforced our own feeling that it would be useful to have such discussions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would hope that the discussion would, and I would try to give a lead <Col N="769" /> in this, be concerned with the broader aspects of European unity and development towards it rather than with the matters that we tend very frequently and very properly to deal with, that is, the ways in which the membership of the Community may benefit us or at times disadvantage us and the steps we need to take to ensure the best results for our country.  It is right and proper that those matters should occupy us.  It is natural that Ministers attending meetings of the Council of Ministers of the Community should be concerned to ensure that Irish interests are protected within the overall process of evolution towards European unity.  It is right that the Opposition should be vigilant in ensuring that Ministers are doing their job in that respect and, naturally, as concrete issues come up for discussion and as decisions are taken, the question of their impact on this country has to be discussed and considered and, indeed, in advance of decisions being taken it is right that there should be discussion how best our interests can be served.  However, in all this discussion of our vital interests and how they can be protected there is a danger that the broader vision will be lost and that the broader interests of this country and of Europe and of this country as part of Europe will not secure the attention they deserve.  At a moment when we are approaching a summit which could prove to be of some importance and which, as I said in Brussels the day before yesterday, is I think now guaranteed against total failure in any event, it is right that the Dáil should have the chance to have a general discussion of this kind, right that the Government should indicate the lines of their thinking not merely on the matters of vital national interest but also on their broader approach to the future of Europe and right that the Opposition should have an opportunity to give their views so that the country may hear a constructive debate of this kind.  That is the purpose of this debate, that is the intention of it, and my intention in opening it is to give a lead along those lines.</P>
    <P>Of course, we have to be concerned <Col N="770" /> about our particular national interest, and the way in which the Community has evolved has been beneficial to us. It has also involved some difficulties for us.  It is, perhaps, natural that the difficulties should be highlighted rather than the benefits, but overall, the effect of membership has, if assessed objectively, been greater than was expected, that is to say, that given the international context that we are operating in, the difference to us in this country between being members and not being members is greater than we expected it to be.  It is also different in that the context is not quite what we expected it to be.</P>
    <P>The world economic situation has evolved differently and much more unfavourably than anybody had anticipated.  However, if one considers what our position would be if we were not members of the Community and the position we are in as members, one will see the difference between these two situations is very great, and the benefits to us through being members as against not being members is enormous.  These benefits accrue in practical ways through the working of the common agricultural policy, through the working of the social policy, through the very extensive relief of the Exchequer in terms of the inflow of funds from the EEC. But that is only part of the benefits of membership, and I do not propose to dwell on them today because it would divert the debate into the wrong channel.  We should be looking at it also in a broader sense.</P>
    <P>In a broader sense the benefits for us&mdash;when one gets away from the immediate, crude economic benefits measured in millions and tens of millions of pounds&mdash;are now being seen very clearly as we develop our membership of the Community.  The benefits include the new relationship with the United Kingdom made possible in this multilateral context.  The effect of this has been considerable in terms of the reduction in our economic dependence on Britain expressed not merely through the share of exports and imports going to Britain&mdash;which fell sharply last year and have risen again slightly this year, but which overall have dropped sharply&mdash;but in <Col N="771" /> the way in which our political and economic relationship with Britain can evolve in a situation where we are no longer in a bilateral relationship, which was a totally unequal one, one in which any agreement to be signed with Britain was bound to be more to Britain's advantage than ours, even if skilfully negotiated.</P>
    <P>Deputies will recall the free trade area agreement of ten years ago.  That agreement was a useful preparation for membership of the EEC and as such the Opposition at the time accepted it, even though it was an unequal agreement in its terms.  I remember myself assessing, as an economist, the inequality of it, and the conclusion I came to, which was not challenged at any point but which, in fact, in a number of important respects was confirmed by a much more profound economic analysis than I could undertake some years later, was that the benefits to Britain were approximately three times the benefits to this country.  In making that point at the time, I was not attacking the Government of the day for failure to achieve a better agreement.  It might have been a somewhat better agreement in some minor respects, but given the relationship with Britain it could not have been anything but an unequal agreement because the relationship was so unequal.</P>
    <P>The effect on our relationship with Britain of being part of a wider Community has been profound, not just economically but politically and psychologically.  It is exemplified in an interesting way at present where the so-called British renegotiation as it has developed looks like reaching its conclusion under the Irish Presidency. There is a certain irony in the situation that under this Presidency, with Ireland in the Chair at the meetings of the Councils of Ministers, the question of the modifications that can be made in existing policy with a view to meeting British political susceptibilities will be discussed.</P>
    <P>The fact that that is happening and the fact that in this situation the mutual dependence of Ireland and Britain and <Col N="772" /> the other members is such that each country is dependent on the goodwill of the others, creates a new relationship between ourselves and our neighbours. For the first time in our history Britain needs us as we need Britain, and that makes possible a much healthier relationship whose psychological effects may in time be very considerable.</P>
    <P>We must, however, look beyond this context, too, not merely beyond the question of the crude balance sheet of gains and losses, beneficial though that is in terms which probably involve, relative to our size, greater benefits to this country than to any other members of the Community.  We must look beyond all that and the question of its impact on our relationship with Britain, to see the whole European issue in its broader context.  The basic reason for the movement towards European integration has been that the key decisions which affect the lives of the people of these countries are no longer taken at the level of national Governments.  Not merely our Government but the Governments of great countries like France, Germany and Britain are no longer free to decide for themselves on crucial matters that affect the lives of their people.  They are too small for these decisions.  It is no longer possible for many key industries to exist purely on a national basis.  It is only if they can serve a much wider, integrated market that they can survive in competition with equivalent industries in other even greater countries, the super powers, for example.</P>
    <P>The only way for these larger countries, and <i>a fortiori</i> the only way for us, to control our future is to widen the area of decision-making so that it is big enough for really important decisions, and then to take these decisions in common.  Otherwise, we and the other countries involved lose all control over our own environment. We are at the mercy of outside forces, external inflation, the power of multi-national companies, international cartels, at the mercy of competitive deflation by which one country can bankrupt another in trying to protect itself, and then before long bankrupt itself also, as happened so tragically in the late twenties and early thirties.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="773" /> We, above all, as one of the smallest countries in the Community, are most vulnerable and most require the protection we get from working with others in these matters.  Our small size means that we are much more dependent on imports and have to export a higher proportion of what we produce, and, therefore, the relationship in trade with other countries is more important to us than to our neighbours. Our small market means, too, that industries here have not the possibility of developing on a large scale unless they can secure access to wider markets.  Our situation as an agricultural country has meant also, as we have seen for 50 years of political independence, that we can be left in a position of economic dependence and economic weakness because of discrimination in agricultural markets, a problem that can only be resolved in a much wider context when we and those people who provide the markets for our products are jointly members of a Community in which that kind of discrimination is made legally impossible.</P>
    <P>To work, this Community system requires a sense of mutual interdependence and mutual loyalty transcending the more extreme expressions of narrow national interest.  It means that the sense of belonging together must be strong enough to ensure that each country's real difficulties will be considered by the other countries. This plant of mutual interdependance and mutual loyalty is a small one and one which at times seems to wilt, and naturally enough it is the moments when countries conflict with each other, the moments when they press their own interests apparently almost to the brink and when there is tension and drama, that hit the headlines of the Press in the Community countries and, indeed, outside it.  The moments when, on the other hand, they hold back from pressing their interests, when they give consideration to others and when they work together in solidarity, are less dramatic, less headline-making, and the impression that our people and the other peoples in the Community can gain from the work of the Community in the Council of Ministers can, therefore, be a highly unbalanced one.  It is only in working <Col N="774" /> within the Community that one discovers how this sense of solidarity works, how when a country has a real problem, whether it be economic or social or even political&mdash;such as the political problems posed by the United Kingdom by the question of continued membership at this time&mdash;and when then it approaches its partners on a problem of this kind that one can see operating the system of mutual loyalty and mutual interdependence in making each country, faced with these problems, act differently from the way in which its immediate short-term national interest would suggest it should act.</P>
    <P>In the brief period we have been in the community, there certainly have been a number of occasions when countries have come to their fellows with problems.  They may have been problems in agriculture, such as Britain has had and Ireland has had. There are problems also of political sensitivity in some aspects of the Community's work, such as in Denmark, where the Government has a tiny proportion&mdash;not much more than 10 per cent&mdash;of the seats in Parliament and faces an 88 per cent non-government force on the other side of the House.  There are also the problems of renegotiation and, when these things come up, one sees at work a process which is new in international relations, but it is not dramatic and, even as this process is working, there is a moment of tension and conflict as countries probe each other's needs and, as the country which is seeking some concession to meet its particular problem is put under pressure, and rightly so, by its partners to make sure that it really needs whatever it is seeking, how much it needs it and how best it can be met without disturbing the interests of others.</P>
    <P>It is in the tension that arises as these probing movements are made that the drama is; that is where the headlines are.  But, at the end of that process, in no instance in the period in which we have been members and, to my knowledge, in no instance in the period before we became members, has a country ever been refused a concession it needed.  It may not always <Col N="775" /> get precisely the type of concession it sought.  We were taught in our youth that we may pray to the Lord for the particular gift we seek, but one does not always get what one thinks one needs but may get, perhaps, a better one.  I am not sure whether what one gets from the Community is always better for one.  It is not always precisely the kind of concession one seeks, but it is a concession designed to meet the real need and, at the same time, not disturb Community relationships, the Community pattern and the Community system.</P>
    <P>The fact that this is at work all the time and rarely secures much publicity means that our people are deprived to a degree of an understanding of what the Community is about and how it works.  It seems to me that at this moment, as we approach this Summit, where certain important decisions are to be taken, it is right that we should have a debate which will alert people to this aspect of the Community, a debate which will not dwell so much on the particular things we want, should get, have got and have not got out of membership of the Community, but on its real basis of common solidarity and how this actually operates, how we can strengthen the Community so that it operates more freely and more effectively in the future.  That would seem to me to be a useful matter for this House to discuss at this stage.  We have now got enough experience to know and get the feel of how the Community works intellectually, not always perfectly, indeed, rarely if ever perfectly, but works in this way to some degree.  As members, we can usually realistically see how, in fact, it operates and therefore this is a good moment to consider this aspect.</P>
    <P>We have seen in relation to farm policy that the British Government have faced certain difficulties and so have we here.  At times, in solving the British difficulty, a potential further difficulty is created for Ireland.  In each instance in which this has happened the Community has, in fact, been willing to make some additional concession to Ireland and at times to pay towards an Irish schemes, which is available only for Ireland, in order to <Col N="776" /> compensate Ireland for any damage that may be done to it by making a necessary concession to Britain.  At times, we have got concessions on our own account and not merely because of problems relating to Britain.</P>
    <P>In the last few days we have seen the Community operating also in regard to its regional policy.  It is clear in regard to the regional policy that the regional fund is something that in the strictest financial sense can only cost most members money to the benefit of a small number of members who will be net beneficiaries. If the question of a regional fund were to be determined solely on the short-term financial interests of member states it would be voted down probably by seven to two.  This has not happened.  Certainly the fund has been slow to evolve.  Certainly there has been great difficulty in finding a solution to it, not so much&mdash;in fact, not at all&mdash;because of the reluctance of member states to assist countries really needing assistance; at no point has that been the real obstacle.  The obstacle has been that countries and regions not in greatest need, such as the region of Northern Italy, have for reasons of their own, which one can understand because politics play their part in all these matters, sought also to benefit from the fund.  It is this that has created the conflict.  The British Government have felt it necessary to say that they should benefit substantially from this fund. The French Government have felt that, if Britain were to benefit, then so should France.  It is not seen that there is such a clearly distinct difference between Britain and France in this matter.  The German Government have had some qualms about transferring funds to their two leading competitors, France and Britain.</P>
    <P>The difficulty which has arisen in regional policy has not been one of unwillingness to create a fund to help the regions really in need, but has been rather a political difficulty arising out of the triangular relationship between the three major countries in the Community.  That is the problem that existed and it is the problem the Commission has had to overcome.  It <Col N="777" /> has now been overcome and overcome on a broad basis; that is to say, it has been overcome on a basis that there will be a fund of a larger type formed by the Commission into which Germany will pay substantial sums, some of which will be going to their competitors, and the German Government are now in the position they took up last Monday when they indicated that they are willing to proceed along these lines.  From the German point of view, the argument is not in their national interest.  They are willing to pay and the payments out will be going to countries which they do not regard as in real need, countries which may be competitors of theirs, and yet, recognising the need for community solidarity, recognising, on the one hand, the British political need and French sensitivity to Britain's benefiting from something from which France does not benefit, and recognising the urgency of getting the fund under way for the benefit of the countries in real need, the German Government are willing to make that move towards something from which they gain no immediate short-term advantage except the advantage that accrues to all when an action by one country, or a number of countries, strengthens the Community, makes it more vital, makes it more vigorous and more successful.</P>
    <P>There, too, as in the case of farm policy, a process is operating which is not simply one of short-term national interest.  It is characteristic of the Community and this is true also, for example, in regard to Italy.  Italy, in grave economic difficulties, secured a short-term loan from her partners, when that was necessary, and then that was converted by the agreement of most partners into a medium-term loan to see her through the difficulties, an action not to the immediate benefit of those who provided the money but which they saw as in their longer term benefit because it would strengthen the Community, maintain its solidarity and prevent it suffering as it would suffer, of course, if one member got into very bad economic health.</P>
    <P>In all this we are building on a narrow foundation.  We are making a <Col N="778" /> unique attempt to create really a multi-national federation in which each country will maintain its own cultural and national identity, to which each of these countries in Europe is fiercely attached, will share in the common decisions and key issues, some of them highly sensitive. There is no precedent for this.  Other federations that have existed have been on the whole mono-cultural rather than multi-cultural.</P>
    <P>This means that we are building something for which there is no precedent.  If you look at the other federations which have come into being, the German Federation, the United States, Canada&mdash;admittedly bilingual, there is a problem there but it is certainly not multi-lingual in the way Europe is or Australia&mdash;you will see that these have been set up on the basis of a single culture, or movement towards a single culture, which is so strongly indicated in the case of the United States.</P>
    <P>On the other hand, we are trying to create something completely new. There is no good in pretending that it is easy, or simple, or that the precedents that exist of these mono-cultural federations have much relevance. One of our problems has been that we have all tended to make a mistake because we all love looking to precedents&mdash;it is not just civil servants who look for precedents; we all tend in any situation to think by analogy and to look back and see what others have done before and, in so doing, we are in this instance making potentially a serious mistake.</P>
    <P>When we look towards a country like the United States and say: &ldquo;They have a big single market.  This works for them.  Let us create something similar in Europe&rdquo;, we can be very naïve about that approach.  In fact, it is possible to create, to a very high degree, a single market in Europe for the benefit of industry and, therefore, for the benefit of all who work in industry and, therefore, for the benefit of the whole Community, but it cannot be a single market of the American type.  There has been a certain naïvety about this in the past, <Col N="779" /> a tendency to think that you can create in Europe the kind of single market which exists in America and perhaps even to go beyond it.</P>
    <P>It is interesting that one of the aims that existed until very recently in the Community has been to have a single indirect tax system, a single system of tax on expenditure with the objective of eliminating barriers at borders.  The United States have not got that.  In the United States there are of course no customs between the states but there are different taxes on goods in different states.  It is against the law, and a criminal offence, to bring goods from one state to another without paying the differential in taxation.</P>
    <P>In Europe there has been a rather naïve idea that we could eliminate all the differences in taxes and get rid not merely of customs posts but of all barriers to movement of trade and that we would move towards a happy situation in which the same taxes would be payable everywhere.  This is part of the mistake of thinking in terms of analogies with other situations which are not relevant and perhaps even not thinking very accurately about what these analogies are.  From our point of view it is important that this should be looked at much more realistically.</P>
    <P>The fact is that within this Community the cultural and social differences between member states are vast.  There are climatic differences, differences in national character, differences in national attitudes. The result is that in fact in matters of common taxation the idea of a common tax system, in my personal view, is not feasible at all.  The fact is that the response of people in Ireland and France, for example, to a given level of taxation on drink is quite different because of different national characteristics, because of different climatic conditions possibly. The way in which people respond to a given level of prices for drink is quite different.  This is true of other commodities too.</P>
    <P>Each country has its own pattern of <Col N="780" /> consumption.  If you tried to make it uniform and have it the same everywhere you could have a disastrous situation in which taxation on wine in France was raised to a level which would certainly cause a revolution there, or taxation on spirits in Ireland had to be lowered to a level which would cause a considerable amount of alcoholism in this country.  One has to face these realities.  It is quite naïve to think in terms of a Community in which you will have a total harmonisation of everything.  This lesson is being learned.  We are learning as we go along in creating this Community.</P>
    <P>The present Commission have moved away from this passion for harmonisation of every detail which in previous Commissions was a serious mistake, and have abandoned much of the harmonisation programme in areas where harmonisation was not necessary for trade and where it was inappropriate to the extreme diversity of the Community.  In this area we had to learn as we went along that the rather naïve prescriptions of earlier idealists are not realistic and that in creating a Community of the kind we are trying to create, it should be one in which the key decisions must be taken in common because they cannot be taken by any one state but in which nonetheless there will be great diversity, more diversity, perhaps, than was envisaged by the founders of the Community, who did not think this thing through.</P>
    <P>The same is true with regard to the economic and monetary union.  Many of the earlier ideas on economic and monetary union were expressed in naïve terms.  They seemed to presume that each country could control its own inflation and, therefore, the Community could jointly control the inflation of member countries, that they could all be got to inflate at the same rate, that currency parities could easily be maintained.  The fact that for ten years currency parities within the Community were maintained at the same level by an accident of economic history led to the curious delusion that the fact of fixed parity for ten years was in some way due to the existence of the Community.  It was not in fact <Col N="781" /> and, as we have learned since, the fact is that the currencies of member countries can and do move and have moved in very diverse directions in response to very different economic patterns in member countries.  Unless these economic patterns are co-ordinated at a very fundamental level this will continue to happen.</P>
    <P>Government cannot simply prescribe that there will be a standard rate of inflation.  No Government have been able to control inflation within their own country.  Therefore, the possibility of a collective control of inflation is minimal.  On one of the first occasions on which I had to speak at the Council of Ministers, I made that point.  I am interested to see, 18 months later, that this is now becoming very generally recognised.  If you are to think in terms of moving towards a genuine economic and monetary union, you need much closer patterns in terms of rates of inflation.  This would imply much closer co-ordination of wage negotiations so that wage negotiations in the countries where wages go up more slowly would be in some way co-ordinated with those in other countries where they rise more rapidly.  This could mean a great extension of international trade union action.  It is only by tackling problems at that fundamental level that one will resolve that problem.  Here again there is a naïve tendency to look to analogies in other mono-cultural federations and to think that they are relevant to our purposes.</P>
    <P>The form of European integration and its pace in different areas of policy is now and will be different from what has been expected.  Our economic and financial contribution to the Community must inevitably be small.  We are and will be for a long time to come net beneficiaries with significant net payments made to us.  Our contribution to the Community cannot be economic or financial.  The one contribution we can make, perhaps, to the Community is by being, as a smaller country, more sensitive to other people's feelings, to the divergencies and differences which exist between other countries, less blinkered by absorbtion with our own domestic <Col N="782" /> problems, less fettered by national interests because, the smaller the country, the smaller the number of national interests it has to protect, and perhaps more imaginative. As we find our feet in the Community, it will be my hope that we can make such a contribution, a contribution of imagination, a contribution to the evolution of the Community which will be realistic as much of the thinking in the past has not been, which will be sensitive to the real problems which exist, and which will be constructive.  In our Presidency, which starts next January, it will be our aim to make such a contribution in what must be a small way.</P>
    <P>It is only natural and proper that we should take pride in the fact that we will hold the Presidency of the Community. It is right that we should do as we have been doing, that is, to make great efforts to prepare for this, to make sure that we undertake this task effectively and well and gain credit for this country.  It is right that we should try to ensure that we make a real contribution to the development of the Community in our period in the Presidency.  Of course we must not over estimate what can be done.  In so far as we can make a contribution to the thinking about the evolution of the Community, this is something which does not cost us any money, and it can be and already is to some degree appreciated by the other member states.</P>
    <P>What then are the issues about which we will have to be thinking? What are the issues which already are looming up in relation to the summit which takes place in Paris next week? There is the issue of economic integration itself.  This has made great strides although, as I said, taking a somewhat different form and pattern from what was originally sought.  If there is to be a movement towards greater economic integration, if there is to be a closer harmonisation of economic and financial policies&mdash;and this becomes vitally necessary now as Europe, like the rest of the world, faces a world economic crisis&mdash;then in this country and in Italy which are in the early stages of development, our <Col N="783" /> ability to accept the additional economic disciplines needed in the interests of all depends on our being able to get additional assistance through, for example, the regional fund.  The link between the regional fund and movement towards the Economic and Monetary Union is widely recognised.</P>
    <P>There is a need now for co-ordination of economic policies on a much closer basis than hitherto.  This is difficult.  If we do not do it, if the Community countries faced with the stresses of the external economic crisis, continue to pursue, as they have done even in the past year, divergent economic policies and if their policies drift further apart, and if some can proceed at a faster pace than others, then the solidarity of the Community, its unity, which is of vital importance to us as one of the smaller economic and weaker members, could be threatened.  Therefore, we have an interest more than most in securing a co-ordination of economic policies.  At the same time, as a country in the early stage of economic development, as a country which faces considerable economic difficulties, as one within which, because of its openness to the world economy its rate of inflation is higher than other member countries, we could not accept a rigid structure of economic co-ordination which took inadequate account of the divergencies of member states.  We must look for a flexible system of economic co-ordination which will take account of certain problems in other countries. That, indeed, is the approach we will be making to this problem at the Paris Summit.</P>
    <P>I am glad to say that in respect of this aspect of preparations for the Summit, serious progress has been made.  At the early stage of preparation, the emphasis in the documentation was quite deflationary in character, disturbingly so.  Pressures from our Government and others have secured a very considerable switch in the emphasis.  Now the whole pattern is concentrated more on the maintenance of employment and not so much on the question of taking direct action <Col N="784" /> to restrain inflation, even if this means adversely affecting employment.</P>
    <P>The kind of approach which the nine are moving towards in the Summit is a much healthier one and much more suitable from our point of view than seemed likely a month ago.  In this area there has been a convergence of views.  Instead of a conflict between countries which have different economic situations, there has been a growing recognition of the fact that account must be taken of these differences and that there must be a flexible approach.  This approach must place a very high priority on the preservation of employment.  We are not the only Government who feel that.  Other Governments have expressed this view, including Britain whose economic situation in terms of employment is also very difficult.</P>
    <P>The Summit may have a measure of success here, although it must distinguish between the question of the internal convergence of economic policies and the problem of the external position which the Community takes in regard to proposals to sort out the world's economic crises, in terms of energy policy, and recycling of petro-dollars.  In those areas there is not, perhaps, as yet the same degree of co-ordination of convergence of views as there is in regard to internal economic problems.  If we are to work towards a closer convergence of economic policies of member countries, this will be the only way to keep the Community together in the face of this crisis.  This means that we and others will have to accept this discipline.  It means also that we, in formulating our economic and budgetary policies, must have regard to the overall target of the Community. There cannot be a situation where each country pays lip service to the importance of having convergent policies and yet pursues its own policies, regardless of the interests of all. This aspect of economic policy-making is new to us and we must take it into account.</P>
    <P>At the Summit there will also be the problem of trying to secure agreement on energy policy and on the policy for the recycling of petro-dollars, which <Col N="785" /> means so much to world economy.  On energy policy, we must face the fact that there is an unfortunate split among the nine.  At the Washington Conference last February, France did not find it possible to join in the efforts which successfully culminated in the establishment of an energy agency.  At that conference, Ireland did her best to prevent that split occurring.  We were more active than anybody else on that occasion in trying to prevent it but it was beyond anything we or anyone else could do. The situation was too difficult for any effort at conciliation.  The problem now is to rebuild the unity within the Community in terms of energy policy which ceased to exist at that time.  I hope the Summit will take some constructive steps in that direction.</P>
    <P>On the question of the recycling of petro-dollars, for a small country like Ireland whose role in world economic policy in a matter of this kind must be quite negligible, it is extremely disturbing to find that the great powers who have it in their control to adopt a common policy and who could between them face up to this issue, have failed to do so.  We are now 14 months into the period of the world economic crisis created by the sharp increase in oil prices.  There is as yet no agreement even among the European countries, never mind among the world powers in general, as to the best way to tackle this problem. This is not merely disturbing but highly dangerous.  Our ability to influence this position is very small indeed.  Within the Community, so far as we can try to help our partners come closer together to decide on a common European policy which could then be put forward as the basis of a common world policy, we shall do what we can.</P>
    <P>All these issues will feature at the Summit.  In the preparation for the Summit Ireland has fought the regional policy issue to the point where we are assured now that this Summit will lead to the establishment of a regional policy as the Copenhagen Summit did not.  We have pressed hard and successfully with others who agreed with us against unduly deflationary economic policies. <Col N="786" /> We have worked to reconcile differences between other member states on energy policy and on the recycling of petro-dollars.</P>
    <P>There is another aspect of this Summit.  There is another dossier&mdash; the word used to describe the large amount of documentation&mdash;that of the institutional dossier on political integration.  Political integration, or political union as it is called at times, has two different aspects in the Community. On the one hand, there is the question of strengthening the democratic institutions of the Community and, on the other, the problem of Community countries working towards co-ordination of foreign policy and, ultimately, towards a common foreign policy.  These must clearly be distinguished although they both come under the general heading of political union.</P>
    <P>So far as the former is concerned, that is, the democratisation of the institutions of the Community, it is clear that this concerns above all the European Parliament.  That Parliament is the key to a democratic Europe.  At the moment it is a weak institution struggling not always successfully or, perhaps, even skilfully, to increase its powers and functions. It is not directly elected.  Its members are chosen by the Parliaments of member countries.  In practice, this means that they are chosen by the political parties in power.  This indirect method of choice of members does not give the Parliament the sense of directly representing the people of Europe so that they can claim the rights they should have to control democratically the decisions of the European Executive, whether one describes the Council of Ministers by that term or the European Commission.</P>
    <P>The European Parliament have not the powers they should have and do not claim these powers because they do not have the sense of having the right to them which they would have only through direct elections.  On the other hand, enthusiasm for direct elections to the European Parliament is somewhat united when the parliament is so powerless that, perhaps, in its present form, the peoples of the <Col N="787" /> community might not feel much enthusiasm by going to vote in such elections, just as we had the problem in the Presidential election 18 months ago.  In that election there was a low poll because people did not feel that the presidency had power of a kind that made it appropriate for a national election and one in which people would want to participate on a large scale.</P>
    <P>It is possible that direct elections to a European Parliament without power could also fail to evoke sufficiently widespread interest.  The question of direct elections, and the power of the European Parliament, are questions which are inter-related.  It is a hen-egg problem which can only be solved by tackling the hen and the egg simultaneously. We have pressed for progress on these issues.  Already the parliament has this year been conceded some significant budgetary powers including a power, which this Parliament has not got, to increase the expenditure proposed.  This is something which our parliamentary system cannot operate.  That power has now been given in a certain form to the European Parliament.  When the budget is presented to that parliament they can propose increases in certain parts of the budget.  Although the Council of Ministers originally reacted to this by saying that they would agree to it only on condition that these increases would require a qualified majority in the Council to endorse them, at our meeting in the last couple of days this has been changed so that now a simple majority in the Council of Ministers will be sufficient to endorse parliament's claim for more resources.</P>
    <P>The Council of Ministers, acting in accordance with normal procedures, may propose a budget which does not involve as much expenditure as we, and others, may think there should be on social policy and it may not be possible to obtain the necessary qualified majority to increase the allocation. When the matter goes before parliament, parliament can now vote that more money be provided and then, by a simple majority, the Council of <Col N="788" /> Ministers can accept that.  This means that countries who were reluctant to vote the money at the outset and were able to prevent it through the use of qualified majority will be frustrated from being able to maintain that position when it goes back to the Council after decision by parliament.  That is a very significant power and it is a power which our own parliament, and the British and French parliaments, do not possess.</P>
    <P>There is progress towards giving some greater powers to the European Parliament but the parliament still has no power of legislation.  The parliament can advise and recommend but these recommendations can be put in the waste paper basket; they do not have to be accepted.  A parliament which has no power to legislate, which has not even a power of co-decision to join in the decisions of the executive and to endorse or reject them, is a very weak parliament.  Until the European Parliament gets that kind of power, and is directly elected, the European system we are building up will not be a sufficiently democratic one.</P>
    <P>We would like to see legislative power given to the European Parliament and to see it directly elected.  On the question of direct elections, I should like to say something more in detail because this could raise some problems.  Our view is that we should move towards a completely directly elected parliament gradually; that the parliament when it is directly elected, or partially directly elected, should have representation of member countries in the same ratio as at present. We accept the fact that the present representation in the European Parliament is strongly biased in favour of the smaller countries.  In our case we have a representation which is five times as great as our population would warrant.  Of course, the slogan, &ldquo;one man, one vote&rdquo;, is one which we know of and endorse, in principle.  If we are reluctant to move away from the present system it is because we are talking, not of a nation State, but of a federation. In the federations we know of an analogy can fairly be made, if we look at their political structure.  Their political structure is one in which there are <Col N="789" /> two Houses.  There is an Upper House with very important powers which can safeguard the interests of the member states and in which, for example in the United States, they are equally represented; Rhode Island having the same number of members as California.  In the Lower House, the House of Representatives, representation is something approximating towards one man, one vote, a system of universal suffrage which, broadly speaking, is on a population basis.</P>
    <P>We accept that that is the aim towards which we should be moving in Europe.  We are willing to move towards that aim fairly rapidly.  What we are not prepared to do is to concede that our present representation, which is five times as great as our population would warrant, should be diluted until and unless we do have an Upper House with equal representation in which the interests of the particular nation, small in our case, can be protected.  We would like to see a three stage operation.  We would like to see a movement, as soon as possible, not in 1980 as has been proposed hitherto, not just before 1980 which are the words currently being used, but as soon as possible, perhaps in 1977, towards direct election for the greater part of the membership of the European Parliament.</P>
    <P>We feel that the present system under which the parliaments of member countries are represented in the European Parliament is useful&mdash;it is inadequate certainly&mdash;because in the crucial period of development of the European Parliament it maintains a link between national parliaments and the European Parliament.  What is intolerable in the present situation for those on whom we have imposed the burden of representing us there is that they should have to be members of the national parliament, of the European Parliament and undertake the whole burden of committee work of the European Parliament which can mean 20 or 30 meetings a year over and above the plenary sessions.  I do not know when I have travelled on a plane between Ireland and Brussels or Luxembourg and not found Members of our parliament travelling <Col N="790" /> backwards and forward; coming home for a day and returning for a committee meeting.  This is impossible.</P>
    <P>What we need is a system which does not prematurely destroy the useful link between the national parliament and the European Parliament&mdash; that can be maintained&mdash;but which does mean that the bulk of the European Parliament&mdash;I would have thought two thirds&mdash;should be directly elected and the burden of committee work could be concentrated on these people who will not have the additional burden of being members of the Dáil or Seanad.  The members of the Dáil or Seanad who are members of the European Parliament would then undertake the possible task of attending 11 plenary sessions each year and not have to undertake the impossible task of attending to all the committee work as well.  That kind of mixed system for a development period would maintain this useful link between the national and the European Parliament and would relieve the intolerable burden on existing members of the European Parliament who are members of national parliaments, would give an overwhelmingly democratic representation, would give the European Parliament, two thirds of whose members would be directly elected, the right to speak for the people of Europe against the executive bodies in the community and to hold their own against them.</P>
    <P>At a further stage one could envisage a movement to a bicameral system in which there would be an Upper House with each State equally represented and a Lower House in which we would then accept that representation should be proportionate to population.  It is through that kind of process that we on the Government side would see the matter evolving.  I am not being dogmatic about it; it is not a matter on which the Government have taken a firm decision but I am speaking of the kind of evolution which seems to us to be the appropriate one.  We would welcome the views of Members in Opposition as to whether they think along these lines or whether they would wish to put forward varied proposals.  On this Parliament <Col N="791" /> should try to find a concensus. It is not an area in which there has to be great party division.  It would be more effective if we could find a concensus as to how we think the European Parliament should develop.  Our minds are reasonably open on this.  I am merely putting forward what seems to me <i>prima facia</i> to be a useful approach but I would be willing to consider any proposals the Opposition might have on this point.</P>
    <P>Another point I should like to raise, and on this I believe there is a divergence of view, and quite a healthy one, between Government and Opposition, is the question of veto in the Council of Ministers.  I am quite clear that on matters of national interest the veto has to be maintained.  Other countries are not willing to give it up.  At this stage of the development of the Community&mdash;when it is still embryonic, has not reached a point of maturity, and when so many new policies have to be developed and evolved&mdash;the protection of the veto is, of course, of importance. There are two things to be said on this.  First, that the veto is frequently abused by all member countries.  Instead of being confined to cases where there is a real national interest, it is used to protect minor commercial interests and it is used only because, once it is there, every Government is vulnerable to any small interest group saying: &ldquo;We need your support to protect us.  There is £100,000 involved here and you must protect our interest.  You can do so and, if you refuse to do so when you can do so, then we will not forget it to you&rdquo;.  That means that you get a Europe of interest groups.  They are often very self-interested interest groups and not at all disinterested interest groups.</P>
    <P>The existence of the veto and its abuse in this way is self-prepetuating and is damaging to the general interest.  If we can do anything to restrain ourselves in this way, by some common convention, I think we should do so.  This is a matter which is coming up for discussion at the Summit.  Whether any very concrete proposal will emerge other than a <Col N="792" /> pious resolution to be better boys in future, I do not know.  I would hope so but I would not be confident.  I would have thought it could be useful if member Governments agreed, for example, that if they were going to use the veto they would have to notify this in advance at a meeting and go back and get at least a Government decision from their own Government formally to that effect, perhaps even a decision of their own Parliament.  I would minimise the abuse of the veto in minor issues.  We would be prepared to consider something along those lines which would still leave it, of course, as a protection of vital national interests.</P>
    <P>Looking ahead beyond that to the longer term, while I accept that the veto is there and must remain for the time being to protect vital national interests, I do think it important that our people should understand that that veto, in practice&mdash;because we are a small country&mdash;is much more frequently used against us than by us to protect our interests.  In recent times there was the situation where proposals to increase expenditure under various headings&mdash;regional policy, until the day before yesterday, expenditure on the social fund, expenditure on the European Development Fund&mdash;for the associates overseas were held up because one or two countries were unwilling to provide the additional money needed. It is in fact other people's right of veto which has prevented a regional fund coming into effect until now. Other countries, which are bigger, more important, which have more interests to protect, use the veto much more widely, because they have so many more issues to protect; which do not have to worry so much about hurting other people's feelings by using the veto too much as we have to worry, because, if a small country abuses this power, it will very soon find that its interests will not be looked after quite as enthusiastically in the future as in the past.  One has to use judgment here; it is not an absolute power to be abused on every occasion.  The veto system favours the larger country, which is less inhibited <Col N="793" /> in using it; which does not have to worry about losing friends by so doing; which has far more interests to protect by using the veto far more often, whereas the smaller country can use it very occasionally only on particular issues and sometimes finds itself using it in order to protect itself against the veto of the larger country.  In a sense, this is what we have been doing recently.</P>
    <P>We made it clear that we would, in a sense&mdash;though it is not a strict use of the veto&mdash;veto the Summit conference because we would, with the Italians, not attend and, therefore, we could not take our place at the Summit of the nine.  We made it clear that we would do that unless the veto that had been used on the regional fund by other countries was lifted. This is perhaps the first and only time that we have really effectively on a major issue threatened a veto and the only reason we had to do it was that somebody else had used the veto already.  A veto which, in practice, is really only used in those circumstances is not a particularly useful one.  It is arguable that, over the first two years of our membership, if nobody had a veto, this country would be much better off than all having a veto, including ourselves.</P>
    <P>I think that point should be considered. I am not pressing the point at the moment.  I think it would be premature to change the system of vetoes in case of national interest now.  But I was convinced, before we became a member, from what I knew of the system, and I am thoroughly convinced now through seeing it working in practice, that in the longer run the veto system is the protection for the great powers and the qualified majority voting system provides the protection for the interests of smaller countries and is one which would be much more suitable for our purposes in the long run.  I put that to the Opposition who, I think, have a somewhat different view here, as something that they should seriously consider.  It is not, at present, an issue between us.  But I would hope that if and when the Community evolves to the point where it has reached the <Col N="794" /> stage of maturity and near completion of its development process, when it would be possible to consider&mdash;and for the larger countries to consider&mdash; dropping the veto, the Opposition would, in its experience of the working of the system then, come round to the view that it might be perhaps more in our interest not to have a veto at that point.  I think it worth raising that issue at this stage for discussion.</P>
    <P>Finally, I want to come to the question of political co-operation and the co-ordination of foreign policy. This is not strictly part of the Community system but is an addition to it, carried on in the margin of Community activities, if you like.  It started on a small scale and only in the past 18 months or so has it developed considerably.  In a sense, we have been in on the ground floor of that development.  It is a very interesting development; it is intangible and hard to come to grips with.  Its achievements are not at this stage great.  Its failures are evident and significant.  Nonetheless it is not to be under-estimated.  The fact that these nine countries do now seek to co-ordinate their foreign policies, do seek to have common positions on foreign policy issues, is an important development. It carries with it great potential for the future, also, of course, some difficulties and, indeed, dangers.  The fact is that these nine countries are enormously different in their social and cultural outlook, in their historical traditions, in the way they see the world outside.  Some of them have very strong reason&mdash;for example because of their historical experience&mdash; to support the Jewish position in relation to Israel, because they had the direct experience of seeing the appalling way in which the Jewish race was treated in Europe during the war.  For that most honourable of reasons they are very concerned indeed that nothing would be done that would prejudice the State of Israel or its security.  Indeed, that concern is widely shared by all member countries but it is particularly acutely felt by some because of their historical experience.  Other countries which have not that direct experience <Col N="795" />&mdash;in which the treatment of the Jewish race in Europe during the war did not make the same emotional impact&mdash;look at the problem somewhat differently and their perspective of the Middle East situation diverges from that of the other group.  Here one has an example of where the different historical experiences create a somewhat different outlook.  This means that, when a vote comes up at the United Nations on a given issue&mdash;because these resolutions are always extremely mixed; in fact, in the current year, nearly all the resolutions coming forward are so mixed that they contain both features that one favours in principle and language which one cannot accept in practice&mdash;one is faced with the constant dilemma as to whether one should vote for the resolution, with an explanation about the things one does not like, or abstain explaining one cannot vote for because of the language or, because the language is so extreme, vote against the resolution.  One has a constant problem in that respect.  In a way I have found this to be the most difficult single task and the one in respect of which I am least satisfied with my own performance, because it is so difficult to feel in the end, when one has taken a decision, that it is necessarily the right one.</P>
    <P>Of course, this faces all member countries.  The attempt to co-ordinate foreign policy attitudes on such things as United Nations resolutions on sensitive matters such as the Middle East, Cambodia, Rhodesia or South Africa, is an attempt which does not always succeed.  But there is an honest effort made to secure consensus.  This has meant that countries have moved away from more extreme positions and, in particular, countries which took more&mdash;I do not know if right wing are the right words but I shall use them for want of others&mdash;right wing positions, because of their historical traditions, have been brought along to a more liberal consensus through this process. At times this means that a country which would have a more liberal outlook in seeking to get a consensus has itself, perhaps, to abstain rather than vote for something in order to encourage <Col N="796" /> and persuade other countries not to vote against.  Therefore, this process of co-ordination is one which involves concessions on both sides, concessions which I must say at times it is very hard to decide whether one should or should not support.  Nonetheless, this process is at work in which attitudes are coming closer together on foreign policy issues.  On the whole, it is beneficial and on the whole, in my view, the movement is towards more constructive foreign policy attitudes rather than the other direction although on individual issues one can question the individual decision taken and some of the decisions we have had to take have been difficult ones.</P>
    <P>Another feature of this process of political co-operation has been the operation of the new crisis management procedure which was tested in the case of Cyprus.  I cannot say, when one looks at the condition of Cyprus today, that we were brilliantly successful in the results we achieved.  Nonetheless, the Community managed to take up a concerted position, to act speedily and to put pressure on the two parties which in some respects and at a certain moment helped to produce certain constructive results although on the overall outcome the situation is now a very bad one and we have not yet succeeded in putting it right.</P>
    <P>This whole process of crisis management operating in the capital of the presidency as through the foreign ministry of that country and the ambassadors accredited to it, co-operating with their Governments, is a useful one and tested in the case of Cyprus showed it had merit and can be developed. Let me say, in the presence of the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs, that its effective operation depends on very speedy communications and problems can at times arise in this respect which are not confined to this country. We have to be sure we can communicate effectively and rapidly.  A view exists in the country which holds the presidency that one of the biggest problems they had in that Cyprus situation was that of communication, not solely with this country although there were problems with this country, but with all the member countries. <Col N="797" /> This is one of the difficulties of acting speedily and quickly in the matter.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>That is nothing compared with the problem the country which holds the presidency next year will face.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Dr. FitzGerald Dr. FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>That remains to be seen.  Certain efforts have been put into this and we hope they will produce good results.  The Minister for Posts and Telegraphs and I are working on this matter and I am sure something on which we are working together is bound to produce results of some kind.  Another area in which the co-operation mechanism has been working is in relation to the development of Euro-Arab dialogue.  It is too soon to say how this will develop and how successful it will be but it has been interesting to see the strength of the view among the Arab countries that they wish to have a closer relationship with Europe and they feel it is possible to achieve something constructive through a mechanism under which Europe can offer technical aid, which it has the capacity to do, helped by Arab finance, which they have a certain amount of.</P>
      <P>This is a potentially constructive area and one which we will endeavour in our presidency to pursue actively.  Another area which has been a great problem during the past 18 months for the Community has been relations with the United States which at certain periods have not been good and where tensions have existed between Community countries in relation to this matter.  Progress has been made here and there is a much better relationship with the United States today than a year ago and the tensions and difficulties between member countries on this issue have been greatly eased.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>All this area of political co-operation will be our burden from the beginning of next year.  It is an aspect of the Community which is under-estimated in terms of its importance by public opinion but is certainly under-estimated in terms of its burden.  The ordinary work of the Community as such, the EEC, is carried on in Brussels where there are <Col N="798" /> excellent staffs in the Commission, the Council Secretariat, to make the whole system work and where the burden of holding the presidency is eased by the existence of this staff, mechanism and procedures and where it is possible for a small country to take on the presidency without being totally overburdened.</P>
    <P>In the case of political co-operation, there is a more difficult problem because the burden of organising political co-operation during the presidency rests entirely on the country of the presidency which in its capital has to set up mechanisms capable of operating successfully, has to have enough staff to do the job and has to have adequate communications for the purpose.  All this has to be carried on through the medium of the French language because, whereas in the Community there is a multi-lingual system in political co-operation the basic language used is French.  Texts have to be prepared and issued in French.  It is not an easy task for a country like ourselves with a very small diplomatic service to undertake the work of co-ordinating European foreign policy for six months from its own capital through the medium of a language which for some centuries has not been the first official language of our country.</P>
    <P>We have taken on this burden and we hope we can carry it successfully. We are determined to do so but it is an aspect of our presidency which creates particular problems for us and offers particular opportunities.  There will be several meetings of foreign Ministers here and we have made preparations for them.  There will, of course, be very many meetings, perhaps 50, at official level during the six months in connection with political co-operation.</P>
    <P>I believe we are now recognised within the Community, after less than two years, as a constructive, forward-looking partner of the other eight.  We have loyally adhered to the Community principles and rules.  It is in our interest to do so but the fact that we have done so is notably in our favour.  The fact that we have not had the hesitations and doubts that our <Col N="799" /> neighbour, Britain, has had has certainly marked us out in contrast.  If there were any people in Europe who had any doubts about Ireland and Britain and how different they were two years ago&mdash;I am not sure there were&mdash;they certainly have no doubts now because of our contrasting positions, not merely in matters of concrete policy, such as agriculture, but in relation to our whole attitude to the Community, which in the case of Britain has had to be in this period a very hesitant one.</P>
    <P>Our presidency will help to extend the reputation which we have been building up as a constructive partner. It will also help to extend understanding at home of what the Community is about and, perhaps, help to get away for a while from a picture of the Community which people have in their minds as a battleground for national interests, which is only a part of the whole and not the most important part.  I hope during our presidency we will not have to spend too much time fighting our own corner but can concentrate our efforts to a large degree in playing a generally constructive role that will stand to us in the years to come.  I hope this debate can give impetus to fresh thinking on these matters and to a greater understanding of the Community and of our part in it.</P>

      <P>Like the Leader of our party, while I had some advance knowledge of the fact that this motion was being introduced in the House this morning, I find it very difficult to understand why a motion couched in these terms should be proposed to the House at this time. The Minister indicated it seemed to be an appropriate time in view of the summit which is about to take place. As well, in view of the presidency of the Council, which Ireland is about to undertake, the Minister felt this was an appropriate time that these broad issues of membership of the European Community should now be discussed, and analysed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Let me say at the outset to the Minister, the House, and the people that Fianna Fáil have no difficulty <Col N="800" /> whatsoever in doing now what they did two years ago, expressing our support for the objectives of European integration in the economic, social and political spheres.  We find no difficulty whatsoever in reaffirming, as I have done on many occasions, our commitment to the ideals of Europe and even more, in reaffirming those commitments, the difficulties Europe faces from time to time because of national interests.</P>
    <P>Lest what I have to say might in any way be taken as a criticism of the objectives of the Community, of the ideals of the Treaty or of the various summits or indeed of our common obligation to each other, let me reaffirm our commitment to the EEC. Much of what the Minister said this morning regarding membership of the Community was said in advance of the referendum on membership.  At that time the responsibilities of membership and the obligations imposed by membership were spelled out clearly.  We do not need to be told now that we cannot always plough our own national furrow in an international community.  We have recognised that from the start and spelled it out in great detail before the referendum.  We do not need to be reminded of how tensions arise, of how tensions are promoted when common interests are overlooked.  We know this to be a reality of membership of any international organisation, particularly of any international community.  We know, too, that each nation looks to its own interest and expects that a community will implement that national interest.  Much of the broad philosophical approach adopted by the Minister this morning is taken by us as read and will be taken as read in any association that we have with the European Community.</P>
    <P>The Minister pointed to some areas in which significant progress has been made and also to areas where there are yet tensions to be overcome as well as to some where, unfortunately, very little progress has been made. But in the light of the experience of the past couple of years this was self evident to us.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="801" /> I wonder what is the purpose of the Minister introducing this motion at this time.  It seems to indicate a lack of sensitivity for the feelings of the people in so far as they say that our membership of the Community is not being applied to their benefit.  The motion seems to be introduced in ignorance of the fact that the Labour Party, both at their annual conference and through their spokesmen, have been blaming the Community for rising prices, for the situation in which the small farmer finds himself and even for unemployment.  Let us hear from those gentlemen in this debate. When we reaffirm our support for the objectives of the Community we do so on behalf of the nation we represent but the Minister is asking us to do this at a time when the men who sit in Government with him are blaming that very Community he is now promoting for being the cause of many of our problems.</P>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesBMcDonald" hpid="Mr. McDonald Mr. McDonald">

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>We have heard on more than one occasion from the Labour Party that it was not the Minister for Industry and Commerce who suggested our joining the EEC but that it was he who had the wisdom and the foresight to see that membership would cause more problems than it would solve.  We are told that the Labour Party are not the ones who created the plight of the small farmers but that they had advised in advance who would benefit from membership. As they put it, it would be the big man in the rich man's club who would benefit and not the small man in the West of Ireland.  The Labour Party can prove that now, as they see it, to everybody.  But, despite that, the Minister has decided to introduce this motion.  It is my hope that before the debate concludes we will hear from the Minister for Industry and Commerce. Let him reaffirm his support for the objectives of European integration in the economic, social and political spheres.  Also let those other Deputies who have been talking about our problems and who have been blaming the EEC for the situation do likewise.  It is not easy to ask our <Col N="802" /> people to express support for the objectives of the Community when Members of this House, including a Minister, use every opportunity to vindicate what they see as being their own position and to blame the Community for ills which both the Minister and I know are not in any way attributable to our membership of that Community.</P>
      <P>The Minister need have no doubt as to where Fianna Fáil stand in relation to these objectives.  We stand where we have always stood in this regard. Let us have a clear understanding of where the Labour Party stand.  If the Minister wishes to have the views of the Labour Party they should let him have them but should they challenge a division let us have a vote on the motion.  This would end once and for all the dichotomy of view on this subject whereby one Minister can say one thing to promote his views while another can say something else.  Let us have the common view.</P>
      <P>We have said on numerous occasions recently that, if there is any characteristic of the attitudes and statements of Europe during the past couple of years, it is that they are high on principle and short on performance. We referred to the Paris Summit, to the guidelines for the regional proposals, to the Copenhagen Summit and to other statements that have been emerging from time to time. All of these have been high on principle, on objectives and on determination, but the reality that follows is to a considerable extent far short of these principles and ideals.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I take the Minister's point that there are national interests involved and which must be accommodated, that people must learn to take a Community view rather than a national view.  But, at the same time, the more these highly principled statements are promoted without some determined effort being made to realise them, the more cynicism is bred in the whole Community and among our people who voted so overwhelmingly for membership but who have suffered as much, if not more than most, in this connection.  It is fine for us to talk here in terms of political institutions <Col N="803" /> and of economic and social integration. What we might call the word factory of Europe continues to turn out all this sort of talk but the less we deliver the more we are giving rise to cynicism.  If we want support in any area, whether national or international, for what we are doing we must prove that we have an awareness of the problems of the people whom these policies are meant to benefit but whom they may not be benefiting. We must assure the people that we have a real concern for their situation.</P>
    <P>The Government's timing in introducing this motion is, to say the least, not ideal.  Broadly, so far as Ireland is concerned, there are a number of areas to be considered.  So far as the Community in general is concerned there is the question of Britain's re-negotiation of membership.  There is the whole problem of the disarray of the energy policy.  There was the problem of the regional fund and what that represented as an indication of the Community's commitment to its own ideals.  Then there were individual problems where member states have failed to use the advantages of the funds that are there. Here I refer specifically to the statements of Commissioner Thomson on cross-Border projects.</P>
    <P>We have seen in Ireland in particular, in cases where there are Community funds, that because of the manner in which the Government have handled the benefits which are available&mdash;for instance, their timing in introducing intervention, their failure to introduce it earlier&mdash;people who could and should have benefited have not done so to the same extent as they should have done.  The unemployment problem is being blamed to some extent on membership of the EEC and we have not seen the Government taking any steps to use our membership of the EEC, particularly the provisions of our protocol, to alleviate that problem.</P>
    <P>I shall take these point by point.  The Minister may express disappointment because I shall come down to harsh realities, but we on behalf of the <Col N="804" /> people cannot talk in terms of general support for EEC objectives unless we can recognise that individuals throughout the country can see benefits flowing from our EEC membership.  I should like to point to the expectations of certain elements in our community and whether these expectations have been realised and, if they have not been, whether it is the fault of the EEC or of the Government here in failing properly to apply the benefits that are there.</P>
    <P>I take as a first instance the regional fund.  It is a long story which has been promoted and publicised during a considerable period.  I do not know from which date it is best to take it up, but I shall begin at April, 1973 when guidelines were published which were entirely acceptable.  In October, 1973, new proposals began to emerge&mdash; earlier it had been indicated that there would be a fund of at least £1,000 million.  Then we found that there was interference with the Commission from various places.  The Minister then took trips to various places which did not bear any significant fruits.  I do not blame the Minister for that, though he had certain expectations from those trips which few of us shared.  In the end nothing came of them.</P>
    <P>I will bring it a little more up to date.  In December, 1973, the Minister made certain statements.  I want to warn the Minister of the consequences of such statements on our attitude towards EEC membership.  In <i>The Irish Press</i> of 14th December, 1973, the Minister is referred to in the following terms:</P>
    <P>The EEC is shifting to the Irish regional view and FitzGerald hopes for further decisions soon.</P>
    <P>After every meeting of the Council of Ministers, the Minister has been anxious to prove his performance but when we get such statements&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesBMcDonald" hpid="Mr. McDonald Mr. McDonald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McDonald</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Deputy suggesting the Minister has not made a genuine effort?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>At no stage have I criticised the Minister's efforts.  What I have been talking about are the projections of the Minister's achievements and the effects of those projections on <Col N="805" /> the community who are waiting for results.  We were told after a Press conference that the EEC were moving to the Irish position.  That demanded a fund of not less than £1,200 million, in a period of three years or thereabouts. Later this proposal was changed somewhat.  We were then led to believe that the EEC Ministers were moving to our position.  Was the Minister being naïve in thinking that they were moving to what was known as the Irish position?  Were they holding out on the Minister or was he a bit too anxious to project how much he had achieved, as a result of which our expectations were raised?</P>
      <P>On the same occasion, <i>The Irish Times</i> and us that the Commission's proposal for a regional fund of £1,000 million, if it were accepted, would mean that Ireland would be able to claim about £12.50 per head of the population.  The report said that the criterion then being suggested was a population basis.  The Minister opposed that and we accepted his attitude, but if that proposal had been introduced then on a population ratio, would we not have benefited more than what we are expected to get from the new proposal?  Significantly the Minister did not tell us this morning precisely how much, if anything, he has been able to negotiate from the recent meeting of the Council of Ministers&mdash;how much of a fund will be presented to the summit for final agreement.</P>
      <P>I suggest to the Minister, although he probably knows the answer as well as I do, that had that proposal, which he then opposed, been introduced even on a population basis we would have benefited more than we are about to benefit from what is about to be introduced.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In <i>The Irish Times</i> on 20th December last, it was reported that after a meeting the Minister had said he was hopeful that the situation in relation to the regional fund would improve between then and the meeting of the Council, likely to be held on 7th January.  I do not want to go into all the details of what follows from that.  I could bring in a sheaf of newspapers to indicate what the Minister has done after each meeting.  I am not blaming <Col N="806" /> the Minister's efforts but at the heel of the hunt we stand now even further back than we did 12 months ago when the Minister expressed certain attitudes on the regional fund.  On 16th January last <i>The Irish Times</i> reported:</P>
    <P>For the first time the Foreign Minister indicated last night how much he considered Ireland needed in net benefits from the Regional Fund when he gave the Community Foreign Ministers his own proposals for settling the deadlock that has prevented the setting up of a fund.</P>
    <P>The formula which apparently was agreed to by other Community members would apparently give Ireland £100 million in the next four years and £66 million in three years, roughly double what the European Commission had proposed.  The report stated the Minister had suggested that the total fund over four years should be nearly £1,200 million.  And so say all of us.</P>
    <P>Those proposals have been tailored and retailored and modified and we do not know even at this stage&mdash;we who have been asked to reaffirm our objectives&mdash;what the EEC intend to to in individual areas so as to enable us to convince the community we represent that we should have their support for these objectives.  There is no point in asking people in the west of Ireland or in the midlands or wherever to support notional objectives and high principled statements unless they see these objectives and these high principled statements being translated into real concern for them in the first instance and real benefit, concern which under the terms of the Community and of our membership of it should be a real indication and a real characteristic of Community action.  I want to say, as I said at the start, that we have had from Europe for too long far too many high principled statements and far too little performance and this has bred cynicism throughout Europe and here in Ireland.</P>
    <P>I want to agree with the Minister when he took up the attitude towards this summit.  We have said many times: &ldquo;Let us not have a summit unless you precisely and clearly know what it is you want to discuss at that summit and what it is you hope to <Col N="807" /> achieve at that summit&rdquo;.  Let me remind the Minister that before the last summit in Copenhagen I asked here in the House, and asked the Taoiseach particularly, what precisely they intended to discuss and there was passing reference&mdash;I mentioned this before&mdash;to the energy problem.  It really was a passing reference.  Of course the energy problem became the real hurdle over which the Community could not leap at that stage. Even now, unless the Minister can throw some light on this before this debate concludes, there is no clear indication to us in this country or to the people who really will express their support for these objectives, the community at large in the nine countries, not just we their representatives, of what this summit is really about to do.</P>
    <P>There are areas of difficulty that we can all identify.  Yes, there are. There is the energy problem.  There is this question of the regional fund, this question of economic and monetary union being discussed for the umpteenth time and the steps towards it.  We have the question of the institutions of the European Community for the umpteenth time and the steps towards it.  None of us knows the precise agenda and the firm conclusions which this summit is meant to reach.  This, I understood, was what the Minister was holding out for in his attitude towards this summit and the conditions under which we would attend.  He has told us this morning, and it is rather enlightening, that the only reason we were suggesting we would veto this summit was that others were vetoing the fact that the regional fund could be discussed at it but when they lifted their veto on that suggestion then, of course, we had no trouble in lifting our veto.</P>

      <P>Having established that, we now have been informed by the Minister&mdash;I am not talking of today &mdash;that the basis of agreement on a regional fund seems to exist.  What I want to say is that if we are not consistent with our own principles&mdash;I am talking here of the European Community&mdash;and this fund which we have heard of does not seem to be in any way consistent with those principles, does the Minister not recognise the effect that that will have on those people who have been led to believe by him and by me and many of us here that they would have a significant benefit out of this fund or other funds?</P>
      <P>A regional fund was meant to be particularly applied to the undeveloped regions of this country.  The Minister will recognise that, even in terms of our small national budget, £35 million over three years will not have any real impact on the undeveloped regions of this country.  We might as well be honest enough now to say to the people whom we told would benefit by being part of the European Community which was concerned about their lot that it will not be of benefit to them. We might as well tell them now that the Community has failed.  The Irish people recognise honesty above all else and do not want any more window dressing or statements made after late night Foreign Ministers' meetings that have been going on for the last 15 months as to where the Germans and the French stand and how near they have come to accepting the Irish view which would represent our getting three or four times what we are now getting.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not want to see cynicism in this country towards the Community.  The people are entitled to be cynical if the difference between performance and promise is as vast as it is.  As I mentioned to the Minister on a previous occasion here, a commentator has mentioned the fact that £35 million over three years, if one wanted to make a striking monument to our benefit from the European Regional Fund, would provide about 15 miles of road-way, if that much, from Dublin to the west.  In other words it only starts to the west, it never reaches it.  After what he and I and others have represented <Col N="811" /> to the people as the benefit that they would have in the Community, we had better be honest enough and say that it has not been realised.  Let us apportion the blame after that.  Let us not raise their expectations day after day, week after week, after meetings of councils of Ministers, and then tell them something entirely different from what they believe.</P>
    <P>We still express, even in times of difficulties, our support for the objectives but the Minister has proved himself to be entirely insensitive to the benefits which people are not getting from membership of the Community, in introducing this motion at this time.</P>
    <P>May I ask the Minister did we or did we not negotiate a special protocol in our Treaty of Accession to the European Community and if we did is it like so much that seems to be emerging in Europe now&mdash;mere words to dress up our involvement in this new Community in which I believe, even despite its weaknesses?  If we did, are we in any way attempting now to prove that the Community, if it is true to itself, will recognise the problems in this country at this time? Let me quote from this high sounding, high principled protocol:</P>
    <P>That the high contracting parties desiring to settle certain special problems of concern to Ireland and having agreed the following provisions recall that the fundamental objectives in the European Economic Community include the steady improvement of the living standards and working conditions of the peoples of the member States and the harmonious development of their economies by reducing the differences existing between the various regions and the backwardness of the less favoured regions&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <P>Does not that taste very sour at this stage?</P>
    <P>&mdash;&mdash;take note of the fact that the Irish Government have embarked upon the implementation a policy of industrialisation and economic development designed to align the standard of living in Ireland with those of the other European nations <Col N="812" /> and to eliminate under-employment while progressively evening out regional differences in their levels of development, recognises it to be in their common interest that the objectives of this policy be so attained.</P>
    <P>Has anything been done since our membership began that has in any real way given effect to that, and if there are problems&mdash;and there are many&mdash;in special industries, have we attempted to use that protocol to allow us to be exempt to some extent, from the provisions of the Community? Have we used it to ensure, particularly that we should be allowed, if necessary, to protect some industries, such as the clothing and shoe industries, to impose special protective tariffs for even a limited period?  There is no point in telling the small farmers from Leitrim, Cavan and Monaghan outside or the thousands who paraded last week that we are in favour of objectives.  They want to know what these objectives mean to them and what the Government have done to use our membership of the Community to their advantage.</P>
    <P>As regards the benefits that are in the Community and the manner in which the Government have failed to use them to the advantage of the people they were intended to benefit, take the intervention scheme.  I shall leave it to Deputy Gibbons to go into this in much greater detail but I should like to ask: can the Minister say that the man who is intended to be the beneficiary, the small man, the store man in the west of Ireland, is in fact the beneficiary of what is now being done?  First, had this been introduced much earlier, when it should have been, the market for the big beef man would have improved immediately almost.  Before the end of the summer the market would have loosened to the point that it would now begin to benefit the small store man about whom we are really concerned. The Government did not introduce it in May or in June.</P>
    <P>

    </P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>If the Government <Col N="813" /> had a sense of urgency and awareness of the plight of small farmers they would have introduced it earlier so that the farmer about whom we are really concerned, the small man, would have had the benefit of the market loosening at a time when he had feeding for his stock.  I am talking of August and September. No; they waited until October and then the small, west of Ireland farmer and the hill farmer in Tipperary or elsewhere found that because of the indecision of the Government they will come to benefit some time in February or March when the market will loosen.  Meanwhile the Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries said the other day that some farmers had been careless in making provision for winter feeding.</P>
      <P>This is an area where these small farmers somehow blame the European Community or at least they do not thank it for a benefit they are not getting when our membership of the Community could have been used to benefit them and ensure they would have a cushion in a very serious situation. We are being asked at this time to express support for these objectives.</P>
      <P>I do not suppose intervention was ever intended to benefit the meat factories or the big processors.  I wonder if the Minister has consulted any small farmer, any of those who have been queueing up to get cattle affected under the brucellosis or the TB scheme into the factories.  If he did, he would see they believe that the only people who have benefited from intervention and our membership of the Community have been the big man and the meat factories.  I think they are right.  The Government have failed to ensure that there would be a guaranteed entry to the meat factories for those intended to benefit under the scheme, not for the meat factories; they failed to ensure that those who needed the benefit would get it. Instead they have allowed those who do not need it to benefit and get a bonanza they never expected and which has proved to be beyond their wildest dreams.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This is the human face of the EEC among the farming community now&mdash;<Col N="814" /> the meat factories and the big men are lining their pockets while those the CAP was intended to benefit are suffering. That is not the fault of the EEC but of the Government who have not been able to administer the system properly.  The Labour Party are blaming the European Community because they told the small farmer over 12 months ago that the EEC would run them into the ground in any case. Instead they should blame themselves and their colleagues in Government.</P>
    <P>Let us see some real action to implement what little benefit may be there for the men most in need.  Even worse, it has come to the point that even our national schemes, the bovine TB and brucellosis schemes, are affected and those who need to clear their herds so that they can go freely to the market cannot now get their cattle into the factories for slaughter.  Their markets are totally restricted because the meat factories are making a bonanza and are going out themselves to pick up all they want in the highways and byways. I am sure Deputy Gibbons has gone into greater detail on this matter before.  I mention it only because we are talking about affirming our support for objectives and we must think about the people we represent and what they think of objectives.  Let us think particularly of what we have failed to do in implementing the benefits that are there as a result of our membership of the Community.  The Labour Party blame the EEC for the plight of the small farmer, for rising prices and for unemployment.  I hope we shall hear from the Minister for Industry and Commerce before the debate concludes and that he will tell us who is to blame and where he and his colleagues stand on this matter.</P>

      <P>I hope he comes back to Dublin when we are being asked to re-affirm our support for these objectives.  We are also concerned with economic social and political integration.  I had better say this while Deputy Thornley is here.  I do not have, although I know it is available, the precise record of Deputy <Col N="815" /> Thornley's contribution in the European Parliament recently on cross-Border projects.  We are being asked to express support now for, to take one area, economic and political integration.</P>
      <P>The Minister mentioned some time ago that the British Government had shown some reluctance to join us in applications for funds from the EEC towards the promotion of cross-Border projects.  On that occasion the Minister told me that if I wanted to know the reason for that reluctance I should put down a question in the House of Commons.</P>
      <P>I am not saying that this matter is an answer to all our problems in this area or even a fraction of them, but in a real sense it could be proof of the concern of the Community for the conditions of people in those Border areas.  Commissioner Thomson has said that there are funds available to the Irish and the British Governments even in advance of the establishment of a regional fund, out of which both Governments could initiate and promote cross-Border projects.  That is a fact although the Minister has denied it.</P>
      <P>Apparently we have not been able to persuade the British Government to join us in making joint application for such funds.  In any event, Deputy Thornley does not think there is any point in doing this even if the British Government could be persuaded.  I may have to paraphrase him on the matter but I will give him the precise record later.  I understand the Deputy said there was no point in talking about cross-Border projects at this stage until they stop killing each other up there.  This was more or less what he said, although he may have expressed it in even stronger terms.  Is the Deputy implying that the people in Monaghan are killing the people in Fermanagh?</P>

      <P>Initiative has been displayed by people in certain areas for political integration without the support of either Government.  We have to express support for such integration when the Government concerned show no sense of urgency.  This shows a dreadful lack of awareness of how people in Border areas, the unemployed and the small farmers, feel about the real face of Europe and the effect of our membership.</P>
      <P>It appears that the purpose of this debate was to enable the Minister to make broad-ranging speeches on what membership of the Community involved and to indicate what we hope to achieve when we assume Presidency of the Council of Ministers.  The speech of the Minister this morning was couched in exactly the same kind of phraseology as various general statements regarding the EEC.  I hope we will not have any more broad statements or confident expectations from the Minister when so little is offered at the end.  This party are concerned regarding the objectives of the EEC but we want the objectives to be applied in such a manner that they will benefit those with whom we are most concerned.</P>
      <P>Last July the President of the Commission referred to the Summit.  Let us consider in retrospect whether the conditions he laid down then are about to be satisfied.  M. Ortoli said in the Bulletin of the European Economic Community, No. 7/8, 1974, at page 122:</P>
      <P>...it must not be a &lsquo;second-rank&rsquo; Conference, otherwise it would not be worth holding.&rdquo;  He added &ldquo;that the Conference must be conclusive with a fresh and firm outcome bound by a time scale.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>Can the Minister tell us that the Summit will be conclusive, with a fresh and firm outcome bound by a time scale?  Have we become so confused with the continuous flow of words from Europe that we have forgotten to judge what we are about to do by the standards set some time earlier?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="819" /> With regard to the energy situation, the Minister has acknowledged that there is a difference of opinion within the Community, that despite his best efforts at Washington the Community were not able to take a common stand, and that all of them except France have agreed in principle to the new international energy agency.  Incidentally, I hope we will have an opportunity of discussing this matter in the House in the near future.</P>
    <P>I am sure the Minister will acknowledge that the failure of the Community to take a stand on the matter and to undertake a commitment in advance of the critical problems last year meant that they left themselves very vulnerable in the face of international pressure from other major countries such as America, Japan and Russia.  They left themselves vulnerable <i>vis-à-vis</i> the Middle East suppliers and in their common commitment to the development of European ideals. The fact that this test case proved that they did not have this common view makes it all the more vital that at this time this summit would set firm and hard principles and criteria and channels by which this Community will be directed in its attitudes towards the energy crisis and towards ensuring that Europe will take a common stand in future in this area. I shall quote again from the same bulletin of the European Community, page 108, column 2460.  The Economic and Social Committee in comment on the opinion formulated in the presence of Mr. Simonet, Vice President of the Commission, on the Commission's proposals relative to a common energy approach said:</P>
    <P>The Committee welcomed the Memorandum and Proposals and, in particular, the objectives for energy policy set out by the Commission and approved their purposeful and ambitious character.</P>
    <P>They welcomed the objectives set out by the Commission.  That is what we are being asked to welcome this morning.  It went on:</P>
    <P>But it was regretted that the detail with which the energy policy objectives had been defined had <Col N="820" /> not been reflected in the means for implementation which the Commission must now set out in greater detail.</P>
    <P>Apparently once again there is no difficulty in setting out objectives but when it comes to clearly defining the means by which those objectives will be achieved that is a different matter. The Minister should indicate that what we are concerned about is that if there must be objectives then let there simultaneously be determined the means to achieve those objectives. Otherwise a Europe which has not been too successful over the last couple of years will be even less so over the next few years.  It will become a Europe of words and not of action, a Europe of principles and of no concern, a Europe of prestige for those who are involved in the various deliberations but almost of suffering for those who are excluded from those deliberations and particularly for the people whom we were most concerned to benefit.</P>
    <P>I think I should touch on our attitude to Britain's renegotiating.  There seems to be a slight change of emphasis every day about the British position here.  The Labour Party conference seems now to have more or less decided that there will have to be a referendum on whatever terms Britain is able to renegotiate.  It can be interpreted in various ways.  Let me quote from Commissioner Thomson on the effects which British renegotiation has had on the Community generally and particularly on the establishment of a regional fund. I am quoting from page 96 of the same bulletin.  In reply to a question in the European Parliament:</P>
    <P>Mr. Thomson, member of the Commission responsible for regional policy, replied that implementing its regional policy Proposals, especially with regard to the Regional Fund, was a top priority for the Commission.</P>
    <P>Through bilateral contacts with the Member States the Commission was now trying to find promising compromise Proposals.  But this was by no means easy since various Member States were fighting shy <Col N="821" /> over regional policy primarily because of the British requests for fresh negotiations.</P>
    <P>If that is so and if that is the background to the failure of the Commission and the Council to come up with really meaningful proposals for a regional fund, then we have to look at the British position and British renegotiation in a very different light indeed.  We have to ask how long can progress be prevented by the prevarication of the British Government and the British people towards the community.  We here particularly have to undertake studies as to what the position would be for us if Britain withdrew from the Community.  We have to take our stand very clearly in that connection. We said some time back, well in advance of the Government and I do not think the Government have yet made their position clear: &ldquo;In or out, purely on political principles we stay in the Community.&rdquo; We accepted that the Government at that time had a responsibility and a facility that we did not have for undertaking certain studies of the economic consequences of British withdrawal. The sad thing is there is no evidence that the Government have as yet undertaken any studies as to what the consequences of British withdrawal would be.  If the Minister can tell us this morning that they have it will be very late news indeed.  If they come up with conclusions after some very hasty studies the conclusions will not be very valid because from any inquiries we have been able to make from the various Government Departments and from various State bodies and semi-State bodies no positive, broad studies have been undertaken by the Government as to what our position will be in the event of Britain deciding to withdraw.  Is it not about time we did such studies?  Is it not about time we considered, for instance, that in 1973 our exports to the European Community increased by £185 million&mdash;that is excluding Britain and Northern Ireland.  This made the EEC in 1973 an outlet for 21.3 per cent of total Irish exports as against 17 per cent in 1972 and 10 per cent in 1971. <Col N="822" /> Let the Labour Party, who blame the Community for all our ills, take note of that.  Let the spokesman of the Labour Party, apart from the European delegate, both of whom are going to speak and I hope the Minister for Industry and Commerce will, take note of that.  Let them take note, too, of the fact that at present approximately 80 to 85 per cent of our agricultural exports go to the EEC, about half of this figure going to Britain.  While the percentage of our agricultural exports to Britain has decreased sharply the percentage going to the Six old EEC countries has increased by about 11 per cent in the last two years.  When we take into account the decrease in the volume of our exports to the United Kingdom and the increase to the other countries of the European Community we can see that there is, indeed, great scope for detailed study as to where our advantage would lie economically in the event of Britain deciding to remove herself from the Community.</P>
    <P>In 1972 the percentage of our total exports to Britain and Northern Ireland was 60.9.  In 1973 that had dropped to 54.6 per cent.  In 1972 the percentage of our exports to the Six old Community countries was 16.9 and in 1973 it was 21.3.  In view of the economic condition of Britain at present and political reaction to events in Northern Ireland there is a continuing decline in the proportion of our exports going to Britain and a continuing expansion in the proportion of our exports to the European Community.  The message seems to be very obvious.  In 1973 Germany, for instance, imported £54 million worth of Irish goods as against £29 million in 1972, an increase of over 80 per cent.  France imported in 1972 £26 million worth and in 1973 £45 million worth, an increase of 75 per cent.  Europe has been an outlet for our markets, and Europe can be used to the economic advantage of this country.  Without overlooking our obligations as a member of the Community, our national interest can be served.  It is about time we stated our position, in view of the prevarication of the British Government and the acknowledged effect it has had in the <Col N="823" /> implementation of various proposals, and who is to say what effect their attitude has had on the failure&mdash;and let me call it such&mdash;of the Community to introduce a regional fund?  Let all the member countries, but us in particular consider whether we would even economically, in view of the graphs I have illustrated, be at any great net loss, even in the short term. The answer appears to be in the other direction.  I would hope that the Government would now clearly state their position firmly and finally on Britain's renegotiation and what our attitude should be if she chooses to withdraw. Secondly, I would hope, at this late stage, they would undertake meaningful studies and analyses of where the economic advantages would lie for us in that eventuality.  I am reasonably confident that if they did undertake such an examination, they would find the balance of advantage would still lie with staying in rather than leaving.</P>
    <P>The Minister mentioned some questions on which he said he would like to have the view of the Opposition. In regard to representation in the European Parliament, we recognise here, too, as the Minister does, the problems of people who are trying to serve a dual mandate.  I do not think this is an appropriate time to set our proposals out in detail, but I would be very glad if the parties in the House could come together in full consultation particularly with our members of the European Parliament and consider what proposals we could jointly put forward.  There are many suggestions emanating from the European Parliament itself.  However, we must remember that in the European Parliament our representatives sit in different groups and people might feel tied to the proposals emanating from the different groups.  Being geographically remote, we have special problems which our representatives share in common, and I would suggest consultations between them, and, after a committee of the representatives of this House in the European Parliament had been established, they could make suggestions as to how they think they could best <Col N="824" /> discharge their obligations.  I do not want to put it beyond that, but the Minister can be assured that we share his views and that we are anxious to see that, wherever our people serve, they will be able to do so to the best advantage.</P>
    <P>The veto seems to be more effective in the threat rather than in the application.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>It is the threat of the veto or the threat of non-involvement that has applied a brake on so much that might have happened in the European Community.  I do not think one needs to come to a firm and final decision now whether or not one actually applies the veto.  <i>In extremis</i> we would say the veto must be applied in the interests of our national survival, but I do not think the question of applying the veto in that sense will ever arise.  Subject to that, we would prefer to see the Council of Ministers influenced by the consensus of view.  We would prefer to see the Council of Ministers adopting, as the Minister quite rightly said this morning, the notion of Community concern, to see themselves for what they are meant to be, a council of the Community.</P>
      <P>In that connection let me remind the Minister of a proposal being made to achieve that end.  We have felt for some time that the Council of Ministers is more a negotiating table than a council, in the real sense, of the European Community.  We recognise that that is a healthy thing.  At the same time we have suggested&mdash;and again I do not want to go into this in detail&mdash;there is need for a permanent secretariat and, in particular, a Minister of each Government with responsibility for the European development, a Minister who could ensure that the various Ministers who go out to negotiate at the Council of Minister level, Minister for Energy, Minister for Agriculture, Minister for Industry and Commerce, or whatever he may be, will have both the Community view and the national interest in mind.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is this lack of liaison that seems <Col N="825" /> to have, to some extent&mdash;I am not saying it is the only factor&mdash;prevented the Council from taking this broad view.  We have Ministers going out late at night or early in the morning and attending meetings immediately.  They are going out with one purpose in view, that is, to come back with a package to the benefit of their own nation. Therefore, there are late-night negotiating sessions.  Without going into detail about our proposals for a permanent secretariat, our proposals for special Ministers for European concern&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>If I might refer the Minister to a document in this connection&mdash;I think the Minister will have it&mdash;in which we have set out our priorities for the summit, we said:</P>
      <P>The conference should check, in the first instance, whether the Community Governments and institutions have respected the commitments entered into during previous conferences. If not it should take steps to ensure that decisions taken prior to this are respected in the future. The conference should make concrete proposals for progress towards European union, providing for the successive transfers of national powers to a European authority.  This authority could comprise an executive drawn from the national governments&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      <P>This is what we had in mind in relation to our Ministers for what we might call European concern.</P>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;and a parliament representative, at the same time, of both States and individuals.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We envisage that executive drawn from national governments as being serviced by a permanent secretariat.  I know the secretariat of the Council of Ministers is in existence as well, and there might be an element of overlap there.  Nonetheless, what we would like to see is a coming together of Ministers who have that special European concern, which will ensure that as well as the negotiating at the Council of Ministers <Col N="826" /> level, there will also be this superimposed and parallel concern expressed by other representatives of the member countries.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Dr. FitzGerald Dr. FitzGerald">

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>The reason they are not fulfilling it is obvious.  There is a distinction.  First of all the Minister will recognise even from the problems he has himself in his capacity as Foreign Minister he has to serve on the Council of Ministers of the European Community, and then he has other obligations in various directions. If he takes the French position he will find it is even more complex because they have much wider obligations in the international area than we have, in other organisations to which we do not belong.  It becomes even more complex still with the United Kingdom. How can the Minister suggest then that these men can give their full time and attention to the European development?  It is because of the obligations they have in so many other areas that we suggest this proposal for a Minister for European Concern.  It is a suggestion worth looking at.  I thought the Minister was aware of it.  It is a matter some more of our speakers will develop later.</P>

      <P>We will, I hope, have a debate in January on the report of the European Community and we will then have an opportunity of discussing the whole range of our involvement at greater length.  I do not understand, as I said, why it is that the Minister has produced this motion at this particular time, so soon in advance, when there are so many areas in which, because of the Government's failure to give effect to what is there for us, so many people have been disillusioned.</P>
      <P>Our support can now be taken as read, as it always could have been.  I hope the support from the Government benches will now be clarified and that henceforth we will not have to listen, as I have listened, to Deputies on different platforms&mdash;I shall not name them&mdash;telling the people at local and other elections: &ldquo;We told you what the European Community would do for you.  We told you what would happen and now it is happening.  We told the small farmers.  We told the unemployed.  We told all of you and now you know.&rdquo;  Let us have a little bit of consistency and, if we are to have any benefit from this motion at this time, let it be that the party which has not as yet expressed its support for these objectives, will now express that support for evermore and, having done so, henceforth be silent.  Let us see some action and hear fewer words.  That applies to Europe as much as it does to Ireland.  If we see more action from Europe then we will have from the people we represent support for the objectives we are talking about here.  In the meantime, progress has not been made.  We stand where we have always stood: we support the objectives.  Now we want to see the performance.</P>

      <P>I rise without the slightest conscientious difficulty, let me assure Deputy O'Kennedy, to support this motion and I believe I speak for my party in that attitude.  I shall be mercifully brief.  We have had two speakers in 2½ hours and, having made that somewhat abrasive comment on the Minister and Deputy O'Kennedy, I trust I shall succeed in galloping on faster.  I listened with great interest to both the Minister and Deputy O'Kennedy and I intend to make a very academic speech.  I regret that Deputy O'Kennedy in the course of his speech departed from what was otherwise a very good and interesting contribution to make some partisan remarks.  I do not think this debate, in these very tragic economic circumstances, is a debate where partisan remarks should be made.  The only partisan remarks I shall make will be addressed to one or two points raised by Deputy O'Kennedy and I trust that this courtesy will be reciprocated.</P>
      <P>I speak without any preparation because I had no knowledge that this debate was coming on.  I speak without, if I may be forgiven here for a gentle aside to Deputy O'Kennedy, the benefit of the Fianna Fáil think-tank, whose work was admirably demonstrated in those parts of Deputy O'Kennedy's speech which were the results of careful study and less admirably demonstrated in those parts of his speech where he tried to extemporise at which point I wished, not for the first time, for the return to the lower Chamber of Senator Lenihan.  I speak without preparation. Perhaps I shall be able to contribute something because I spend roughly half my life in Europe and so I see these problems at first hand.  Sometimes, listening to discussions in this House, I think that more realism about Irish social problems is displayed by the Riordans than it is by Dáil Éireann.  I trust this will not cause me to be brought before the Committee on Procedure and Privileges, but that is my considered opinion.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I shall endeavour now to restore the debate to the extremely interesting and objective level to which the Minister for Foreign Affairs precipitated it <Col N="829" /> rather than to the level of party acrimony such as crept into Deputy O'Kennedy's contribution.</P>

      <P>
        <i>Chacun á son goût.</i> The possibility of my intervening in this debate is a coincidence because I should be in Brussels were it not for the mysterious happenings taking place here today.  Because of those I am making one of my rare visits to <i>terra firma.</i>  I praise the Minister for his opening contribution.  I found him fascinating.  I do not want to repeat what the Minister said though he has put me in some difficulty since he has said so many of the things I wanted to say myself.  This is really not surprising because the Minister and I are old friends and colleagues, having met on many battlefields.  I think the country is fortunate in having at the moment at the helm of its European policy so able and distinguished a Minister.  I am sure he is doing his utmost to wring the maximum degree of concessions from the Council of Ministers of the Commission in this present context.</P>
      <P>I should also like to congratulate the Minister for the work he has done in extracting some form of regional fund from the European Parliament. A great deal of nonsense has been and is being spoken about this regional fund.  A great deal of nonsense was spoken by Deputy O'Kennedy about this regional fund.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>It is nothing to the nonsense the Deputy is engaging in now.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidThornlet" hpid="Dr. Thornley Dr. Thornley">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Thornley</NameTxt>
      <P>I may be a bad politician because I have an unpolitical tendency to speak the truth and, if this makes me a bad politician, so be it.  The point about the regional fund is fundamentally whether we have a smaller share, if I may put it that way in rather academic terms, of a larger fund or a large share of a smaller fund.  Here the British, I understand, are arguing on the principle of what they call in Europe the <i>juste retour,</i> which would mean in effect that you <Col N="830" /> get back as much as you put into the fund, which is a very perilous condition indeed.  The Italians and the Irish are arguing for a larger share of a smaller fund specifically directed towards Italy and Ireland.  In this I gather they have gained the support of the French.  The negotiations as to the size of the fund are extremely delicate and far more intricate than Deputy O'Kennedy would give the impression that they are.  As to which is the better solution I do not know the answer.</P>
      <P>I would make one point here.  Very often&mdash;again to introduce a note of realism&mdash;our incapacity to avail ourselves of European money is due to our own inertia in putting forward projects which would qualify for grants from the moneys available from the European Economic Community. This is not something for which any political party can be blamed.  It demonstrates yet again a point to which I will refer again very briefly: the lack of national interest in the phenomenon of Europe and the fact that we are now a member of it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Finally, in this context I should like to add that, so far from their being hostility on the part of the socialist groupings to the application of regional money to Ireland, the prime architect of the parliamentary report on regional policy which specifically singled Ireland out was a socialist Belgian, Monsieur Delmotte.  The commissioner for regional policy, whose name has been much bandied about in this House.  Mr. George Thomson, is a socialist and a personal friend of mine.  We enjoy very close links with him in the socialist groups.  He is very concerned as to the needs of Ireland and very much prepared to take them as a priority.  Perhaps our principal hope lies there.  If I may say so, looking over my shoulder at those who are more extreme elements in the Labour Party and whom Deputy O'Kennedy has, in my view, rightly criticised, the Commission is not the anonymous bureaucratic enemy of our country which it is sometimes represented to be.  In fact, the Parliament and the Commission are the best friends we have.  It is, if anything, the <Col N="831" /> Council of Ministers from which the greatest difficulty arises.  I think Deputy O'Kennedy would agree with me here.</P>
    <P>I said I would say some rude things about Deputy O'Kennedy since he has said some rude things about me. I shall be as polite as is always my custom.  Frankly, I found Deputy O'Kennedy's speech totally internally contradictory.  At one moment I could still hear the swashbuckling advocate of common market entry of two years ago talking about the gains that could be made.  He said: &ldquo;I still believe in the Community.&rdquo;  If I had shut my eyes at that point I would have thought I was listening to <i>The Economist's</i> Mr. Crotty, or to official Sinn Féin, or to O'Loingsigh, or somebody talking about the failure of the whole enterprise.</P>
    <P>Deputy O'Kennedy changed horses so often in the course of his speech that he left me in a state of total confusion. Again, if I may introduce my customary note of somewhat satirical reality, at the risk of being called flippant by Deputy Gibbons, the reality of the situation is that Fianna Fáil negotiated the terms under which we entered the Common Market.  On those terms they resoundingly&mdash;and I congratulate them in retrospect&mdash;won the referendum which caused us to enter the Common Market.</P>

      <P>I opposed the terms, and I want that made quite clear to Deputy O'Kennedy.  I never opposed Common Market entry as such.  In my view, it was an inevitable step.  I opposed the terms and that was the plank upon which the Labour Party fought the election.  I want to make it clear here&mdash;and I do not care what damage it does to me in the grassroots of my Party&mdash;that we are in Europe and that decision is irrevocable. We must do our utmost now to extract the maximum benefit from it.</P>

      <P>That is my most earnest wish.  As I was saying before I was so rudely interrupted as the man said, the situation is that Fianna Fáil <Col N="833" /> triumphantly negotiated our entry into the Common Market on terms which the Labour Party thought inadequate and which have proved to be inadequate. Having enjoyed the brief glorious exaltation of victory in the referendum, they then, to their astonishment and possibly to ours, proceeded to lose the ensuing general election. The result is that the National Coalition have to bear the economic consequences of the terms negotiated so triumphantly by Fianna Fáil.  In my view Deputy O'Kennedy displayed massive inconsistency&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>Deputy O'Kennedy spoke about the apportionment of blame.  Quite how precisely you apportion blame for a desirable exercise beats me.  I admit that Deputy O'Kennedy has a difficult brief.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I want to turn very briefly to a point raised a few moments ago by Deputy Herbert, that is, the attitude of the British Labour Party.  I want to say with all sincerity, and with a charity which members of the Fianna Fáil Party would not show to me, that I totally disapprove of the action of the British Labour Party in this context. The renegotiation of the terms in the manner in which Mr. Callaghan originally laid them out can only be to the detriment of Ireland.  I admit that.  I am doing my utmost to use what little influence I have with my socialist colleagues in England to make <Col N="834" /> them see this point.  We face an enormous objective difficulty which should not be subject to the jeers and sneers of partisan commentators, that is, that the massive countries of Europe are urban-consumer orientated. It is a difficulty which Deputy Kavanagh and I have encountered in the socialist grouping.  They are cost conscious rather than producer conscious. To that extent, they are hostile to agricultural interests.  I admit this readily and that is why it is so important that such things as the common agricultural policy, the regional fund, FEOGA grants and social policy should be worked to redress the imbalances in a society like ours.  I concede that point freely to Deputy Herbert.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelHerbert" hpid="Mr. Herbert Mr. Herbert">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Herbert</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy is also hostile and he said so on radio.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelHerbert" hpid="Mr. Herbert Mr. Herbert">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Herbert</NameTxt>
      <P>To the CAP.  In explaining his vote last February on agriculture prices, the Deputy explained to an interviewer, Mr. Nolan, that he did not wish to raise consumer prices on housewives in Ballyfermot and Ballymun.  Therefore, the Deputy was against the CAP.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidThornlet" hpid="Dr. Thornley Dr. Thornley">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Thornley</NameTxt>
      <P>I intended to revert to this point also but if the Fianna Fáil Party want to reduce our membership of the European Community, and this motion, to a slagging match between me and them I do not mind, I am in their hands.  In my view, it is rather disedifying.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelHerbert" hpid="Mr. Herbert Mr. Herbert">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Herbert</NameTxt>
      <P>It is a matter for the record.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidThornlet" hpid="Dr. Thornley Dr. Thornley">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Thornley</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy O'Kennedy put the question, quite rightly, what we should do if Britain leaves the Community. I do not think Britain will leave the Community; I do not think Britain is in an economic position to do so but my personal answer, and I speak for nobody but myself here, is that we should remain in the Community even if Britain leaves.  We should do so because our economies are now so closely interwoven and also because&mdash;I feel the Minister will <Col N="835" /> agree with me here&mdash;this is, perhaps, now our own chance of leap-frogging our utter dependence upon the British market and upon the rate of exchange of the £ sterling.  We should stay in the Community if Britain leaves.</P>
      <P>The question of the veto was interestingly raised by the Minister and Deputy O'Kennedy.  This is also a subject I have not made my mind up about.  On the one hand, the veto is a valuable lifebuoy for a small country faced by large countries and, on the other hand, it is an inhibition to progress by majority vote within the Community if it is abused by a large country. Deputy O'Kennedy correctly said that it was so strong a weapon that all that could be done was to threaten to use it, one could not use it.  In my view that was one of the best points made by Deputy O'Kennedy.  In the same way parliament possesses the residual power of moving a vote of no confidence in the Commission which would cause the entire Commission to resign.  This, like the veto, derives its power from the fact that nobody uses it.  It is a little like possession of the hydrogen bomb.  My view is that the veto is necessary in the transitional period while the three additional EEC partners are absorbed but after that it will inevitably disappear.</P>
      <P>If I may be boringly academic, but I feel it is relevant to this motion, one of our problems in facing the parliament and the Community is that we approach it with completely what I might call, at the risk of being chastised, Anglo-Irish parliamentary experience. We tend to think of the Council of Ministers as a sort of cabinet, of the parliament as a British or Irish styled parliament and of the Commission as a sort of civil service.  It is not like that because the parliament, as yet, possesses no powers and the Commission is a strange, isolated and independent body and, I suppose, as the late President Truman would say, the buck stops on the desk of the Council of Ministers.  Ultimately, that situation will be resolved.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In my view the Minister correctly put his finger on the point when he described this as being a &ldquo;hen and <Col N="836" /> egg situation&rdquo;.  Parliament cannot be taken seriously until it is directly elected and on the other hand parliament cannot be given budgetary powers until it is directly elected.  Parliament cannot be directly elected until it has budgetary powers. One goes around in circles but ultimately, the two problems have to be solved at one time.  I support Deputy O'Kennedy in pressing for the appointment of a European Minister.  I hasten to add that this is not to be interpreted as expressing my candidature for the job but I would support Deputy O'Kennedy in that view.  In my view, the dual role of Minister for Foreign Affairs and Minister primarily responsible for European affairs is too heavy for even so gifted a man as the present Minister to carry at the same time.  Something should be done about that rapidly.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMGibbons" hpid="Mr. J. Gibbons Mr. J. Gibbons">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidThornlet" hpid="Dr. Thornley Dr. Thornley">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Thornley</NameTxt>
      <P>Because the Minister is not dead yet.  Having just administered Deputy Gibbons' bunch of flowers to the Minister, may I now, in my objective way, repeat a number of criticisms which I made in supporting this motion. The backup support of the Irish delegates to Europe is totally inadequate. I want it on the record of the House for the second time because I think it is vitally important, that very often, Deputies on the Government side of the House fly over to Europe with no more intimation of what Government policy is on a particular item than either nothing at all or a photocopy of an hour-long speech by a Minister.  Not surprisingly, we sometimes make mistakes.  This brings me back to Deputy Herbert's point because I think I made a mistake in my vote on mutton prices.  I lay the blame more on the people who did not tell me what Government policy was.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMGibbons" hpid="Mr. J. Gibbons Mr. J. Gibbons">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Gibbons</NameTxt>
      <P>There is not any such policy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidThornlet" hpid="Dr. Thornley Dr. Thornley">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Thornley</NameTxt>
      <P>That is something for wiser people than me to discuss <Col N="837" /> because my knowledge of agriculture is absolutely nil and I admit that readily.</P>
      <P>Briefing by the Government is inadequate. I should like to touch briefly on the problem of dual mandate. European parliamentarians go on at wearisome length about this problem but it is quite vital.  The situation is absolutely deplorable in which we have to exercise, all ten of us, the obligation to get re-elected to the Dáil on the one side and also to be members of the European Parliament.</P>
      <P>I should like to refer Members to an amusing article in the <i>Sunday Express</i> of 3rd November, 1974.  I consider the <i>Sunday Express</i> to be infinitely the most amusing Sunday paper published; I always read it from back forwards.  This article points out that since January, 1973, of the 16 Conservatives appointed to the parliament four have retired, four have lost their seats and the other eight remained in the promotional wilderness. Some of us will be consulting our futures in this regard, if something is not done about it.</P>
      <P>Deputy O'Kennedy, in one of his more constructive and valuable remarks, made reference to the possibility of a tripartisan policy in Europe. I say, with absolute sincerity, to my friends in Fianna Fáil that there is no one in this House who will be more happy to see a tripartisan policy developed but, apart from any animosities or antagonism that may exist between the different sides of the House over the issue of Europe, there are certain physical difficulties which have to be taken into consideration.  The fact that the Minister, my colleagues in the Coalition, and my Fianna Fáil colleagues are like Boeing 737s that pass in the night makes it rather difficult for us to communicate.  Very often, the ten of us are only here on Saturdays and Sundays.  The Minister is in a similar situation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I agree with Deputy O'Kennedy that if opportunities could be arranged for the ten of us to meet, either in Ireland or in Europe, to co-ordinate our policies within the limitations imposed upon us by membership of our groups, it would be a highly desirable <Col N="838" /> thing.  I should like to hammer another anvil which is one of my favourite anvils and that is the deplorable deficiency in modern languages which is displayed by people who are sent to Europe and who are members of the staff of the Commission. I am not boasting when I say that only Senator Yeats and myself would lay pretentions to fluency in French and Italian and Senator Yeats is a great deal better at both than am I.  I think the Minister made this point&mdash;that there is a certain incapacity to get totally involved in serious discussion unless the intimacy of knowledge of the language being used is present.  Instantaneous translation services can completely distort the meaning of, perhaps, a vital exchange, depending on the whim of the translator. I cannot help comparing our performance in Europe with that, for example, of Dr. Walter Scheel, who used to be the German Foreign Minister, and who is now, I think, President; who could take off his headphones every time anyone spoke in English, French or German on the most technical of subjects.  I found this a very humiliating experience by comparison with myself who can barely order a meal in French.</P>
    <P>With the permission of the Chair, I shall be what he may regard as irrelevant for one second.  I would appeal to the Minister to draw the attention of his colleague, the Minister for Education, to the necessity to expedite fluency in modern languages in this field.  I have spoken to members of the relevant section of the Commission about this and they are firmly of the conviction that either the, say, fifth year in Irish education, or possibly a pre-university year&mdash;and they tend to favour the second&mdash; should be used to force a student to go to Europe if he wants to study a modern language and live for some period of time in the country where that language is the vernacular.</P>
    <P>Again, being completely objective, I should like to refer to something which I think the Minister and Deputy O'Kennedy made reference.  That is, the fundamental, perhaps the most appalling, problem we face in the <Col N="839" /> context of this debate on a motion like this&mdash;the tragic lack of interest there is in this country towards the entire phenomenon of European membership.  Some day Ministers are going to rise in those benches, of whatever party, and are going to say: This is what we are doing about added-value tax, or about farms or whatever it is.  Then, and only then, will people begin to protest and say: Why are you doing it?  And the Minister is going to have to say: I am doing it because document PE/ 167/74 was passed in 1974; I have no alternative.  Then, and only then, will people come to realise just how significant is this phenomenon.  It is an absolute tragedy that that should be the case.</P>
    <P>I am sometimes accused of being anti-farmer.  I am nothing of the kind. Deputy Herbert here does misrepresent me.  I may not know much about farming but I have the utmost sympathy for the members of the farming community who, within the last two days, have been picketing this House. The problem here is that we are confronted by an enormous economic bloc which, as I have said, is consumer rather than producer-orientated.  I have been shocked and repelled by statements by some of my German socialist colleagues, for example, in the Parliament, some of my German Christian Democratic Socialist colleagues in the Parliament, who seem simply to think that agriculture is a phenomenon which should virtually cease, that the predominant factor in discussing the common agricultural policy should be the interests of the consumer and that the cheapest possible price should be paid for everything. This is a point of view which I totally and profoundly disagree.</P>
    <P>I have listened to debates in the European Parliament, in my group, and in the committees of which I am a member, in which I have seen displayed by representatives of the larger countries, particularly the socialists&mdash; I give that point to my friends in Fianna Fáil&mdash;particularly the socialists, the impression that the de-population of insignificant rural areas like Ireland is a matter of no concern to them whatsoever. <Col N="840" /> We are here faced with a dilemma&mdash;to which we should all face up&mdash;which is the consequence of all our neglect, every party.  Party points should not be made out of it.  A distinguished journalist once wrote a book about the decline of an Irish village called &ldquo;No One Shouted Stop&rdquo;.  But we had better realise that, unless we persuade the European Community of the importance, the social importance &mdash;I emphasise&mdash;of maintaining the livelihoods of small farmers, no one will be in a position to should &ldquo;stop&rdquo; because, far from being a Dublin-orientated country, we will, in fact, become a rural/London/Brussels-orientated country.  On the whole, the Germans&mdash;again, let me put this with my customary bluntness&mdash;having picked up the bill for the Economic Community, broadly-speaking, for the last ten years or so, are not sympathetic to the argument that an Irishman should be preserved on a 25-acre holding in Connemara simply for the reason that he is a human being.  They are not concerned with that.  I think it was Deputy O'Kennedy who anticipated me and used a phrase I was going to use myself anyway&mdash;the point of Europe with a human face.  Here we have got to work very hard to emphasise that migration, in massive numbers, is deleterious to what is euphemistically called the host country in Europe, that is to say, the continental equivalent of the Finchley Road; it is as deleterious to the host country as it is to the country which sends the departing, unwanted citizen.  I have made a special study of migrant workers, with particular reference to Turkish workers and the conditions under which they work in Germany.  I confess my interest in having done this was to prepare myself for the possibility that similarly unpleasant conditions may apply within the next decade to Irish workers, both town and country.</P>
    <P>Far from being anti-farming&mdash;a point which, according to Deputy Herbert, I obviously made badly on radio&mdash;my point is this: as rapidly as possible, the regional and social funds, FEOGA grants, the common Agricultural policy and so on should be directed towards those areas of most need.  I am not concerned with <Col N="841" /> gaining profits for either large farmers or for the middleman who, as has been correctly pointed out, are reaping profits at a time when Irish farming is in a very perilous condition. Here we face a problem which is academic in its proportions.  I know Deputy O'Kennedy accused the Minister of being, in a sense, too academic. Are we, in the European Economic Community, a consumer-orientated group or a producer-orientated group?  If we are a producer-orientated group, then high food prices is a fact we have got to face. In these circumstances the provisions of the regional and social funds are going to have to be directed to protecting my constituents of Cabra and Finglas&mdash;I make no bones about it&mdash; from the fact that if this is not done, if these transfer payments are not made from Europe, beef is going to be priced off their table.  If on the other hand, we are a consumer-orientated community, as many of the larger industrialised countries would like us to be, then the consequence is going to be this: the Community is going to seek food where it can get it, in the former Commonwealth countries in South America and elsewhere, and this will be to the detriment of the Irish farmer.</P>
    <P>In those circumstances the regional and social funds will have to be directed to repairing the appalling human damage which is going to be done to the west of Ireland, in particular, to the smaller farming community. What I dread most of all&mdash;I mean this&mdash;is a Dublin in which there will live two million people and a rural hinterland, with the possible exception of Cork, in which the rest distribute themselves at the doors of whitewashed cottages to be photographed for the benefit of the tourist industry.  I know that sounds flippant but it is not: I see this horrible tragedy about to overtake us if we do not utilise our European potential correctly.</P>
    <P>Here I want to say something I have wanted to get off my chest for a long time.  I think all Governments are equally to blame here.  About six or seven years ago the Buchanan Report <Col N="842" /> on regionalisation in Ireland was brought out.  The report met with hostility from some who felt it went too far in establishing growth centres, principally Dublin, and from others who felt it did not go far enough.</P>
    <P>I recall a television programme on which Professor Louden Ryan, when asked the question of what was the alternative to Buchanan, said &ldquo;Buchanan, only more so&rdquo;.  The point I wish to make is that the Buchanan Report has been gathering dust on the shelves of two Governments. Nobody has done anything about it despite the money that was spent on it.  So far as I can see there is no party in this House which have a regional policy within Ireland, let alone within Europe.  We have run away from this because as politicians we are afraid to say what has to be said&mdash;the painful truth that, to use horrible economic jargon, we have the highest labour-cost intensive farming in western Europe, that the flight from the land will be inevitably proportionately greater in this country than in any other country of the nine. We are afraid to face the problem of the retiring or the redundant farmer. We are afraid, too, to face the problem of the population explosion in Dublin.  All of us are afraid to say these necessary but uncomfortable things.  All of us, socialists included, are adopting a sort of Malthusian solution of allowing economics to take their course and that course, in my view, will be a very tragic and depressing one if it is permitted to drift into a situation where the laws of supply and demand determines where a man lives.  In that case a citizen of Charlestown would not be living in Dublin or on the Finchley Road but will be in Dusseldorf or Berlin like the wandering Turkish migrant workers.  These people are unfamiliar with the language and have not their wives nor children with them.  That is a nice prospect for a free and independent Ireland to look forward to.</P>
    <P>There are only two other points which I wish to make.  One of these will be laughed at by members of Fianna Fáil but it remains objectively <Col N="843" /> true.  This is, that there is a certain hideously historic, tragically amusing coincidence by which coalition governments seem to coincide inextricably with the times of world crises.</P>

      <P>Deputy Herbert is taking advantage of my capacity to laugh at myself.  I was simply making the point that the unfavourable balance in terms of trade has resulted in the value of sterling having decreased enormously.  It would be churlish to say that this situation and the result in the increasing of prices are consequent on our membership of the EEC.  I am not saying that but, to use a cliché, the situation is due largely to the circumstances beyond our control.  If, by his interruption, Deputy Herbert is insinuating that I am unconcerned with the state of the textile or the shoe industries' workers who have been rendered redundant or that I am unconcerned with the plight of small farmers who are rendered poverty stricken, he is being grossly unfair.  Nobody is more concerned than I am about these situations and nobody has done more to press their case at the European Parliament. Specifically, I have raised the issue of shoe workers and also that of car assemblers by way of questions. I am very anxious that social funds would be applied in those areas and in this respect I would give a bouquet to a former Fianna Fáil TD, Dr. Hillery, who is very anxiously aware of the need to apply social funds in that area.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="844" /> There is before the House a motion dealing with redundancy in the footwear industry.  That motion comes in rather bad taste from Fianna Fáil since people like Deputy Kavanagh and I and the much maligned Minister for Industry and Commerce pointed out the inevitability of such redundancies if we did not receive favourable treatment in the terms of Common Market entry. Let me say to all parties concerned&mdash; to the Minister who is an economist, to Fianna Fáil who were in power at the time&mdash;that if slightly more notice had been taken of the reports of the Committee on Industrial Organisation about 15 years ago we might not now be faced with these redundancies.  I see that the Minister is nodding agreement.</P>

      <P>Precisely.  Reference was made by both the Minister and Deputy O'Kennedy to direct election to the European Parliament.  Here, I shall be extremely academic although I think this point should be taken seriously.  I make it more as a professor of political science than as a member of the Dáil.  Two reports are circulating before the European Parliament. One is by a Dutch man, and a socialist, Patiijn, and the other by a Christian Democrat, Kletsch.  Both of these reports envisage the introduction of direct election by 1980.  One proposes that we should have ten members while the other proposes 13 members for us. The Patiijn report favours us a little more than does the other one.  The only point I wish to make is that 1980 is only a little more than five years away.  I wonder if anybody has given any consideration to this.  How are we to organise direct election from this country by 1980?  Are we to have multimember constituencies with three seats each, dividing the Twenty-six Counties into three or four constituencies, each consisting of about 400,000 voters all <Col N="845" /> voting by PR for direct election to the European Parliament?</P>
    </Speaker>

    <Speaker pid="DavidThornlet" hpid="Dr. Thornley Dr. Thornley">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Thornley</NameTxt>
      <P>How are we to have a system of direct election divided into either ten or 13 constituencies?  I would be inclined to favour the latter course.  This proposition must be considered because every country we compete with has the problem of the dual mandate but they have the great advantage of having something in the nature of a list system where one is nominated in proportion to the number of votes that his party gain.  I suppose in those circumstances one would have to be on good terms with the boss in order to be elected but it has the merit that one does not have to campaign in his constituency.  That is the system in use in Denmark but there could also be a situation like that which obtains in England whereby in, for instance, the borough of my birthplace, Sutton Cheam, with one exception, Conservatives have been returned with 20,000 majorities during the past 100 years.  In such circumstances one can afford to absent himself indefinitely from his constituency. Then, there is the House of Lords which, for better or worse, we do not have.  Therefore, I cannot be offered a life peerage.</P>

      <P>I think there was more imagination employed in regard to the nomination of the Taoiseach's 11 on the last occasion than there was during the previous 40 years.  Poor devils like the eight of us who are Members of the Dáil have to combine these two roles.  My constituents in Cabra are firmly of the conviction that I am dead and have been assumed corporeally into heaven, since they never see me.  I imagine most other people are in the same position.  I will not dwell on this and will not indulge in any more flippancy; but I do really make the point that if this is put on the long finger, as the ex-Taoiseach said in a more memorable context, <Col N="846" /> then we may find ourselves faced with the extraordinary situation in which this country is just not prepared to fulfil its European political commitments.</P>
      <P>I put to the Minister this point. Supposing the Parliament is given powers of budgetary control, which it is increasingly likely it will be given and supposing it is elected by direct elections, what steps are we taking to be prepared for this phenomenon by the year 1980?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have gone on longer than I said I would.  I apologise.  I always keep to 15 minutes.  Perhaps it is because I am a university professor and observe the proprieties in speaking for exactly the same time.  May I simply conclude by reiterating that the supreme and blinding tragedy of all of this is the lack of interest that anybody has in it?  A debate on the EEC will empty the House, will not get headlines in the paper.  If at Question Time I make a funny joke or get thrown out of the House&mdash;I mean this with no disrespect to the Press.  Do not misunderstand me.  It is the function of the Press to provide interest for their readers.  I am not criticising the Press&mdash;but if I get thrown out for abusing you, Sir, I will get headlines in the papers.  I can speak for ten hours on the European Economic Community and nobody will take the slightest interest.  Yet at the moment there is some boy of 12 or 13 or 14 just leaving primary school, perhaps going to be apprenticed to a factory, or perhaps he is a boy on a farm in the west of Ireland anticipating inheriting his father's place and growing up in his father's country and living as his father lived in his father's context and in five years' time he will wake up to the horrible realisation that this is an impossibility, that he has joined the world of materialism and of the inevitability of fusing economics.  Speaking as a socialist I join with all my colleagues in this House of every political description in hoping that this future does not take place.  There is something special about Irish life.  People should be offered the opportunity to remain rooted in the Irish soil and to retain <Col N="847" /> Irish values.  I hope that this and succeeding Governments will realise the challenge which faces that concept in the context of membership of the Community.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMGibbons" hpid="Mr. J. Gibbons Mr. J. Gibbons">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Gibbons</NameTxt>
      <P>I was intrigued listening to Deputy Thornley although I was also disappointed at the highly pessimistic tone which his speech took on towards the end.  His speech was remarkable for the way in which the reality of the Coalition situation obtruded over the surface.  It was remarkable also in its areas of sensitivity to the real problems that we face as a member of the European Community.</P>
      <P>I should say, of course, without any hesitation and rightaway that my party and myself are totally committed to the membership of this country of the European Community.  All of us are.  We cannot grasp the reasoning of people like the Labour Party who fought tooth and nail against our membership.  Deputy Thornley had the honesty to say that the Socialist group in the European Parliament of which we are both members is basically hostile to the Irish interest, hostile to the Irish interest because the Irish interest is and will continue to be mainly represented as a seller of food products. I believe that our main function in the enlarged Community that must eventually evolve will be as a producer and exporter of food for the Community. I do not accept, as Deputy Thornley seemed regretfully to accept, that this must lead to a denuding of the Irish countryside of its people.  My colleague, Deputy O'Kennedy, reminded the Minister this morning of the protocol that was added to the Treaty of Accession when we joined the Community in which very special attention was paid to the peculiar quality of our problem in that area and in which the intention was signified that the Community would take effective steps to guarantee the continued existence of the people that Deputy Thornley has been talking about and that my party very substantially represents in this House and as it always has.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not think any of the Opposition parties would dispute that fact that <Col N="848" /> the party that has always represented the small and medium farmers of this country is this party here.  Therefore, if you reduce it to its lowest and most political value, it is in our political interest as a party, as Fianna Fáil, to ensure that the denuding of the countryside that we have always fought against does not happen.</P>
    <P>It is stated in the Treaty of Rome and in many declarations after it that one of the main social objectives of the Community is the evening out of the economic capacities of people around the periphery of the Community. It applies in particular to ourselves and to the Italians.  The further towards the periphery you go the more acute the problem becomes, more or less.  That is not to say that there are not problem areas within the Community in Ireland, in other parts of Italy, northern Italy where the standards are normally higher but, by and large, the nearer the periphery you go the more difficult the agricultural and social problems become.</P>
    <P>It is significant that the Government, who have in their hands at the present time the conduct of affairs in Europe, the direction of the Irish interest in Europe, have not in their ranks a single countryman although we are still a community of countrymen.  The two contributors to this debate, the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Deputy Thornley, my colleage in the European Parliament, both are academics, both are professors of various things in different universities.  I do not doubt Deputy Thornley's sincerity in this matter in the terms in which he expressed it but I do say that neither his party nor the Fine Gael Party nor the Government collectively can possibly have any sensitivity to the realities in this area because of their composition.  If you look at the front bench of that Government and even the second bench of that Government, be they Labour or Fine Gael, you will not find a single representative of rural Ireland among them, you will not find a person with any connection with the problems of rural Ireland, the problems of the small and medium farmers of Ireland.  It is not to be wondered at that in the last 12 <Col N="849" /> months we have seen the most appalling disaster that has ever befallen Irish agriculture in my memory, which goes back to the &lsquo;thirties at any rate.  The only area in which I would pay tribute to the Government machine is that of Press relations.  We have had pictures of the valiant, silent, resourceful Taoiseach, striding forth into the future with an agreed policy under his hat, or in his bag, ably supported by the Tánaiste, Deputy Corish of the Labour Party who, at least, looked handsome in the background.  We had a picture of the Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries striving valiantly, fighting tooth and nail in the interests of the Irish farmer, coming home occasionally with another great victory, another wonderful triumph in Europe, but sometimes coming home and saying&mdash;and this is a point I want to underline very carefully&mdash;more often than not saying: &ldquo;I am sorry.  We have been unsuccessful. Do not blame me; blame the Commissioner; blame the Commission; blame the EEC&rdquo;.  This cowardly and unworthy refuge for the Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries or any other Minister is doing very serious disservice to our country in this way.</P>
    <P>It is definitely undermining the confidence of the people in their future in the EEC.  There is no future for the people of Ireland anywhere else.  It comes very badly from the Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries or from his public relations man, whom they brought into the Civil Service from RTE and appointed as an Assistant Secretary, to seek to shift the blame at any crisis from the Minister in question to anybody, possibly personally the Commissioner for Agriculture or the Commission collectively and sometimes possibly our own Commissioner, Dr. Hillery, who has been savagely attacked by the Minister for Labour on a couple of occasions and, I think, by the Parliamentary Secretary, Deputy Cluskey, also.  I am not certain of that, but I know that the Commission has been attacked in order to divert the people's attention from the reality of the fact that this is the most inept Government in this country in my experience.  The proof of this is the soaring unemployment in industry and <Col N="850" /> the really disastrous situation in the cattle industry.</P>
    <P>There is no single economic factor in our economy that I know of that is more important to our future than the cattle herd.  For the moment I am not talking of cattle prices specifically but of the very serious damage that has been done by the present Government and by nobody else to the Irish cattle herd.</P>
    <P>In the year just ending more than three times as many cows have been slaughtered in our meat factories than ever before.  Under our management the size of Ireland's greatest source of wealth, the cattle herd, was growing steadily and the rate of growth was increasing until the national Coalition got their hands on it.  The profitability of milk in the last year was seriously impaired by the obligation that there was on the co-operative dairy combines, such as Mitchelstown, Avonmore, Ballyclough, Waterford and so on, to levy on the milk prices paid to farmers something in excess to make up for the economic losses sustained by virtue of the fact that the milk that ought to have come in did not come in.</P>
    <P>I want to predict now that, while Bord Bainne expect a 4 per cent increase in milk production next year, I cannot see where it will come from because of the slaughter of hundreds of thousands of cows, many of them in-calf, and because of the sharp drop in inseminations and, allied to that particular problem&mdash;&mdash;</P>

It is possible, I understand, to find out a great deal about what goes on around the Cabinet table from time to time but I do not know what pressures were put on the Minister for Agriculture not to take the advice that he inevitably must have got earlier this year to devalue the Irish agricultural farm and devalue it fully.  Deputy McDonald made a great deal of unprincipled propaganda saying that the Fianna Fáil representatives voted against the green £.  I doubt if he understood even vaguely what the green £ meant.  We certainly did vote against the partial devaluation from October of this year that was produced after the cattle market had been thrown into complete and utter chaos by the failure of the Government to act before then. The astonishing thing is that the farmers' organisations seem to have taken it rather phlegmatically.  I remember a time when these organisations would rush onto the streets&mdash;&mdash;</P>

Once or twice the Commissioners concerned have been named.  I would ask the Minister to urge his colleagues to stop this practice.

      <P>Deputy O'Kennedy and Deputy Thornley dwelt at some length on the position of the British in the Community.  Deputy O'Kennedy mentioned the grave inconvenience caused to other members of the Community by the announcement by the British Government of their intention to renegotiate the terms of their membership.  These matters will become active before the Council of Ministers in the next six months when Ireland will assume presidency.  I hope our Ministers in the Council will underline very carefully for their colleagues that the delays that have taken place already in the implementation of any kind of regional policy are no longer tolerable.  I am glad to see the Minister has returned.  I hope that during the first half of 1975 the prevarication of the British and their obstructionist tactics with regard to matters such as the regional policy will be treated firmly by the president of the council.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is not yet clear to me that there is beginning to evolve an overall Community agricultural policy.  I should have thought that even the broad lines of such a programme would have begun to shape up by the end of 1975.  One has only to contemplate the agricultural potential of various regions in the Community to <Col N="854" /> realise that this is possible.  Because of our island position, the fertility of our soil, the influence of the Gulf Stream and other matters, this country is pre-eminently a place for livestock production and we should bend our efforts to this.  Similarly, areas such as the Paris basin are peculiarly suitable for the production of cereals, while in the more southern regions there is the production of vegetables and fruit and sugar beet in the lowland areas.  I admit this may be a difficult project on which to embark but it is necessary.  I am not aware that any initiatives have been taken in the matter and I would urge the Minister to seriously consider it so that the very serious mismanagement not only of the beef market but of other markets within the Community will cease.  This mismanagement is due totally to unplanned production.</P>
    <P>Deputy Thornley spoke very truly of the strong pressure that exists to get cheap food for the Community.  He had the decency to admit that this policy is substantially backed by the Christian Democrats of which Fine Gael are members, and the Socialists of which he is a member.</P>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesBMcDonald" hpid="Mr. McDonald Mr. McDonald">

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Gibbons</NameTxt>
      <P>I was attempting to paraphrase what his colleague said. If I did it incorrectly I apologise. Deputy Thornley spoke despairingly of the future of people in the outlying areas of the Community, the concentration of Irish around Dublin and Cork and larger numbers in Dusseldorf, Mannheim and other places.  It must necessarily be the function of any Irish Government to reject this idea totally.  We joined the EEC to ensure that this would not happen and I am disappointed with the results the Government are getting in this area. I admit there will not be very sudden <Col N="855" /> improvements in such a vast problem. In one sense the recession of people from small farms is a worldwide problem and it has been with us for many decades.  However I thought we had a united resolve.  Maybe I misunderstood the Government, but I thought we had now arrived at the stage where we would say to ourselves that this decay in rural Ireland cannot be allowed to go any further, that whatever the cost this imbalance within our own little part of the Community must be corrected.</P>
      <P>Deputy Thornley also spoke of meat disappearing off the tables of workers in Ireland in the next year or two. This is dangerous heresy for a number of reasons.  If workers do not eat meat obviously there is no country within the Community that will suffer more than we will.  We only have to look around in our own country, within our own context, in an environment that we can control totally ourselves, to see the appalling mismanagement there is at present in the meat market in Ireland.  I am not talking about the EEC.  There is, it must be admitted, a reasonably good market for certain kinds of cattle, for cattle that go into intervention and get intervention price, for cattle that qualify for the slaughter subsidy, and there are a couple of rackets hanging out of that.  Down from that there are other classes of first quality beef cattle, like small beef heifers, which can still be bought at a very low price.  But the workers of Dublin are not getting the benefit or the workers of Kilkenny either.  There is, I am afraid, a racket being worked in this, and the Government have done nothing about it.  But the residue of blame does not rest with the Government; it rests with the EEC, and it is permitted to do so by what I must call the dishonesty of the Government.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The peculiar position of Deputies who are members of the European Parliament has been referred to.  In this area even Deputy McDonald and myself can agree that it is not a tenable position for any Member of this House to do a fairly competent job both here and in the European Parliament. It will have to be resolved.  First of all, the democratic lungs of the <Col N="856" /> Community, that is the Parliament itself&mdash;whoever is in there must be made to work, that is another matter and not all that important&mdash;but the democratic Parliament for the Community must be made to work.  It will not work satisfactorily on a part-time basis because the matter is much too serious for that.  Neither can the Dáil or a Dáil Deputy work satisfactorily on a part-time basis.  The sooner we have direct elections to the European Parliament the better.  There remains a difficult problem of how European Deputies, if they were so elected, would liaise with their national parliaments, and I think it is necessary that they should.</P>
    <P>There are several proposals worth examining in this area.  I was glad to hear my colleague, Deputy O'Kennedy, saying that he would welcome three-party discussions on this affair because it truely does concern us all.  I regret very sincerely that from time to time party political interests have obtruded themselves to all Deputies in the European Parliament.  I recognise and confess that this is not in Ireland's interest. We are elected through a political process; we have a political loyalty, a political purpose; and we have to find some way of reconciling this situation with common membership with Deputies of other parties with a more or less common purpose in the European Parliament.  My personal feeling is that the Labour Party ought to stop this nonsense about socialism.  It is only a blooming cliché anyway.  I think they should be first of their own country and stop talking this twaddle about international socialism, calling one another brother and that kind of thing.  As for the Christian Democrats I could never, for the life of me, see any structure in that organisation at all.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesMGibbons" hpid="Mr. J. Gibbons Mr. J. Gibbons">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Gibbons</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not see that they are particularly conservative, particularly radical.  They are totally amorphous.  To the biggest ball of cotton wool in the world I would compare the Christian Democrats.  They are tasteless, amorphous, faceless, and really no Irish Deputy has any business <Col N="857" /> in that organisation.  That is purely a personal opinion.</P>
      <P>I do not wish to detain Deputy McDonald much longer because I am sure he has some things of great importance to say.  I regret that I cannot congratulate the Minister.  While half a loaf is always better than nothing, the small breakthrough in the matter of the regional fund is not an occasion for major rejoicing.  I was relieved to see that there were not banner headlines giving the signal for any such rejoicing.</P>
      <P>I was very taken aback that the very valuable proposition put by Deputy Herbert and the Christian Democrat from Germany in the matter of cross-Border co-operation was actually attacked by Deputy Thornley and was ignored completely by our colleagues in the Fianna Fáil Party. In that regard our intention was simple.  It was that certain constructive useful projects can be undertaken even without the assistance of the Community, but far better with it obviously across the Border, let us say, between Monaghan and Armagh, Fermanagh, Cavan&mdash;anywhere you like. There are certain specific projects in the minds of people like Deputy Jimmy Leonard, who is organising such cross-Border projects at present. I was disappointed that a proposition like that should have been jeered at by Irish colleagues in the European Parliament.  I hope they will come to understand that we are not being destructive all the time.  I urge the Government that, since they are totally devoid of any rural perception, rural sensitivity, themselves, they should adopt any measures at all that are available to them to switch them on in this area.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McDonald</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to welcome this opportunity, just a week before the summit meeting in Paris, of putting on record and passing on to the Minister the areas of discussion that would serve our country best, the items I would like to see on the agenda to give him and the Taoiseach some idea of the results we look forward to seeing emanating from this very important summit meeting in Paris next week.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesBMcDonald" hpid="Mr. McDonald Mr. McDonald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McDonald</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;Deputy Gibbons and Deputy O'Kennedy did not avail of this opportunity of putting their point of view across specifically in relation to the agenda for the summit meeting because I think this is what the Minister had in mind when he introduced this motion.  The motion extends to all members the opportunity of expressing their views and their hopes for the success of this meeting. I should like this meeting to discuss, first of all, matters of economic concern and, secondly to realise the grave and urgent need for the meeting to consider quite a number of institutional matters.  I and my Christian Democrat group in the European Parliament have expressed deep concern because the course presently pursued by national Governments is leading away from the true road to European union.  Inter-governmental co-operation or, what is worse, bilateral agreements within the Community, are no substitutes for the vitality necessary for the progressive integration of the Community's institutions and their effective democratic control.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The principle of fruitful co-operation between Parliament, Commission and Council marked the beginning of a development corresponding to that expressly demanded by the Treaty of Rome.  In recent years, however, the Council has increasingly favoured national interests at the expense of the Parliament and the Commission by regarding its functions as those of an inter-governmental conference rather than as an organ of the Community. This has had regrettable effects upon the balance of power.  The Christian Democratic group, to which many references have been made in the House this morning, is the largest group in the European Parliament.  It is the organisation which produced the founders of the Treaty&mdash;Gaspari, Schumann and Adenauer&mdash;and it is still very much committed to full European Union and to the full restitution of the Commission's powers of initiative.  In that connection we take the view that <Col N="859" /> the Commission should take part in all meetings of heads of state through the presence of at least the President of the Commission.  It is essential to have this type of arrangement if we are to inspire the Commission to work towards goals that heads of state presently visualise for Europe and its people.</P>
    <P>Equally important is a recognition and appreciable strengthening of the European Parliament's right of participation and control coupled with the election by direct universal suffrage of its members as provided for in Article 138 of the Treaty of Rome, the Treaty which established the EEC.  The implementation of this Article is long overdue.</P>
    <P>I was very glad to hear the Minister express such well-developed and concise views on the evolvement of the European Parliament and the democratisation of our community.  It is heartening to hear a man in his position expressing these sentiments, sentiments for which we all work and for which we find in our experience such great necessity.  By active participation in all the institutions of the Community we have a greater chance of gaining greater benefits for our people not only in economic spheres but in other spheres as well.  I hope that at the meeting next week when discussing economic considerations a final decision will be taken on the regional fund.  We know now that the regional fund will be somewhat smaller than was anticipated in the Commission's proposals put forward last July.  The important thing for our country is that there should be a regional policy and a heading in the Community's budget dealing with a regional fund.  The smaller fund will benefit the less well-off areas of the Community which are regrettably in our country and in Italy.  This is at least a start and we must compliment the Minister on the tremendous amount of work and energy he has put into this.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>May I clarify a point in case of misunderstanding?  The position is that the fund proposed recently by the Commission will be smaller than the fund originally proposed in 1973.  I may not have made that sufficiently clear.</P>

    <Speaker pid="CharlesBMcDonald" hpid="Mr. McDonald Mr. McDonald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McDonald</NameTxt>
      <P>The important thing is that there will be a fund and next year it will be possible through the medium of this fund to aid operations and organisations right across the country. Too much time is spent in this House and outside it bemoaning the fact that we do not have all these aids. More breath is wasted on what we have not got than is spent in reminding our people of the benefits and the finance we have received over the past two years since we became a member of the Community.  In our first year in the Community we must have benefited to the tune of at least £53 million net.  Some of that money must have rubbed off on practically everybody in the State.</P>
      <P>It is a little too much to expect that we should get a handout by virtue of our membership.  The moneys distributed by the EEC have to be collected in taxes or levies from all over the Community.  We pay our share. Last year it was only a little over £6 million.  We cannot go to meetings of all the institutions with what was described by an Opposition Deputy recently as a begging bowl.  We should set in motion a trend of thought which would assure people that they have the benefit and protection of the most powerful economic bloc in the world. This year alone, the guarantees under the CAP are worth £21,000 million.</P>
      <P>It is true that it is not possible to have a guaranteed price for each and every item.  It is only possible for the common agricultural policy to support the finished product or the finished article.  The same is true in regard to the cattle trade.  It is only the cattle that qualify by weight and quality for the intervention system that can benefit.  Most of the factories are striking a fair balance between the price they get for the cattle they sell on the Smithfield market and what goes into intervention.  It is prudent for the factories to retain, as far as possible, their own outlets other than intervention even if this means 1p or 2p less per 1b for the farmers because when the intervention system ceases to operate when the glut is finished, these people will have the markets which they supplied heretofore.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="861" /> Next week inevitably there will be discussions on the institutions.  Direct election to the European Parliament has already been mentioned.  There should be some talk about the evolution of European union.  This is a most opportune time for the nine heads of State to reach a concensus on European union.  The date set for that at the last summit conference in Paris in 1972 was 1980.  I was glad to hear the Minister saying that 1980 is not a magic date and that, perhaps, it can be achieved before that.</P>
    <P>I should like to see an energy policy emerging from the summit conference. It is too bad that there are a number of international approaches to energy and that, as yet, there is not a Community energy policy.  This is a year overdue.  When the heads of State meet they should be able to achieve a basis for a dynamic energy policy.  One should not for a moment underestimate the difficulties attached to this because of the Arab League and the PLO and other organisations.</P>
    <P>There should be an increase in the social fund.  The important thing about the Community is the people of the Community.  If the Community is to develop we must have an increase in the social fund.  We must endeavour to have greater harmonisation in the social fund.  In the past, perhaps, there was too much harmonisation of small things.  I was looking at the social programme some time ago and I found that old age pensions are paid in one of the wealthier countries quarterly but in retrospect.  When we think unkindly of the Minister for Social Welfare and the Parliamentary Secretary because of delays of four or five weeks on pension claims we do not always appreciate that.  It was an eye-opener to me to find that there are delays of up to six months in some of the bigger countries in Europe.  I know that is poor consolation for people here who have to wait.  Nevertheless, the service provided here is very high by Community standards.</P>
    <P>The summit conference cannot possibly be completed without serious thought being given to the difficulties of inflation.  The summit must lay down guidelines which will assure all the <Col N="862" /> people of the Community that we are determined to deal effectively with inflation and to follow a policy of stability. I suppose it is one of the thorniest problems which have confronted the Council of Ministers in recent months, but I hope that concise proposals will now be put forward and decisions taken in this regard.</P>
    <P>The problem of the European Parliament was mentioned by my two colleagues Deputy Thornley and Deputy Gibbons.  Before dealing with that, it is no harm to mention that in my view and in the view of many people in Europe, the Davignon system is not working.  The Council of Ministers should reconsider that system.  It is unnecessary to have Ministers making arduous trips just for the sake of complying with that system.  It makes the Ministers victims of nationalistic emotions. In my view it is the duty of this House to urge them to rationalise. Perhaps we should have a separation of the political co-operation.  I would hope that when the new secretariat is established it will be given a definite home because this would contribute to an improvement in the operation of the Community.</P>
    <P>Next year when the Minister for Foreign Affairs assumes presidency of the Council of Foreign Ministers his colleagues in the Government should assist him in becoming a full-time president. It is difficult for any business to operate if the boss is not full-time and the same applies to the Community.  It is a pity that provision has not been made for a more permanent or full-time office of president.  I know that the Commission has full time officials and that they work long hours.  Their contribution is tremendous but I hope that next year the Minister for Foreign Affairs will give a lead and spend most of his time as president of the Council.  In that way he will be able to give leadership to the Community and achieve progress in the Council. It must be possible to do this.</P>
    <P>Last year we saw how the Council at meeting after meeting reacted to crises.  There was a very clear lack of leadership.  We will have the opportunity next year of bringing about <Col N="863" /> some changes and developing the philosophies of European political and monetary union.  When these ideals are implemented they will be for the betterment and advantage of our people.  As we become more involved in the greater Europe we are not, as some people have suggested, losing our identity.  On the contrary, we are carving out a definite Irish identity and we are doing so in the teeth of the adverse publicity that small minorities of people who claim to be Irish are getting for us in the columns of international papers.  This is something we should be ever conscious of.</P>
    <P>The Minister spoke of his enthusiasm for direct elections to the European Parliament.  This enthusiasm is lacking in only some of the European Government circles.  All the members of the European Parliament find the dual mandate a very heavy burden. Some of the parliaments have, within themselves and through their pairing arrangements, been able to release their members from much of the business of the national parliament. These people have been facilitated in playing a full role in Europe and in working for their own country in the European Parliament.  We find it difficult to compete with these people who have great back-up services and who are well briefed.  They are helped to achieve the greatest possible concessions for their countries.</P>
    <P>On the question of direct elections to the European Parliament I agree with the Patijn Report, with the exception of that part which deals with the number of members who should represent Ireland.  From my experience over the last two years we need at least 13 Members adequately to represent us in a directly elected European Parliament.  We need one Member to specialise full-time in each of the 12 parliamentary Commissions. We also need a Member to act as vice-president and to act on the Bureau.  When the time comes that we must be full-time there will need to be a person to co-ordinate the efforts and to arrange the supplies to ensure that on every occasion it is <Col N="864" /> profitable for our people that an Irish representative be present.</P>
    <P>I see the development of a comprehensive regional policy as a complement to national regional policies and depending largely on close co-operation between member states. This policy should take account of social, cultural and environmental considerations and not be limited to industrial and service activities.  Our regional development programmes must be designed to adjust the balance between over-concentration in some regions and this can only be achieved by better co-ordination of national regional policies and by the implementation of a community regional policy based on European priorities.</P>
    <P>The Policy Committee of the European Parliament have undertaken a number of surveys in Italy, in the district between Holland and Germany and in Ireland.  A great impression was made by our regional development organisations.  The presentation of the facts, figures and data by our RDOs to this committee displayed a thorough knowledge not only of the problems and difficulties they are experiencing but their projections on the capital sums required.  The difficulties of carrying out the work envisaged by them were very concise.  I should like to express my thanks to those regional development organisations and to encourage them to continue on with this worthwhile work.  I hope that when the regional fund is implemented, hopefully next month, we will have a co-ordinating body to ensure that there will be an equitable distribution of funds through the RDOs.  This could be done through the IDA.  We have the difficulty that the entire country is reckoned as an under-developed area but we must support the services already in existence to ensure that they will be adequately financed and avail of their share of the regional fund.</P>
    <P>I thank the Minister for giving me this opportunity of letting him know what we would like to see discussed at the Paris summit.  I wish the Taoiseach, and the Minister well in their negotiations in Paris.</P>

    </P>
    <P>(1)  At the meeting last week in London between the Taoiseach, Mr. Liam Cosgrave, T. D., and the Prime Minister the Rt. Hon. Harold Wilson, M.P., it was agreed that a security meeting between the Minister for Justice, Mr. Patrick Cooney, T.D., and the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland, the Rt. Hon. Merlyn Rees, M.P., would be held to discuss practical measures to end political violence in Northern Ireland irrespective of its source and motive.  This meeting was held at Dublin today.  The Minister for Local Government, Mr. James Tully, T.D., joined the meeting for a working lunch.</P>
    <P>(2)  There was a full discussion on matters of mutual concern in the field of security.  The talks will be followed by further discussions between officials of the Irish and United Kingdom's Governments on specific aspects of problems deriving from politically motivated violence on the border and elsewhere.  Particular attention was paid to improvement of communications between the Garda Síochána and the Royal Ulster Constabulary.</P>
    <P>(3)  The talks also dealt with the arrangements to be made for the introduction in Dáil Éireann and the United Kingdom Parliament of legislation to implement the recommendations of the Common Law Enforcement Commission Report.</P>
    <P>(4)  After the meeting Mr. Cooney and Mr. Rees emphasised the considerable value of the talks and underlined the need for close co-operation.</P>

      <P>The Committee on Court Practice and Procedure have already, in their 19th Interim Report, made a recommendation which is relevant to the position of &ldquo;battered wives&rdquo;.  The recommendation is to the effect that if the court finds on the evidence offered that a spouse has reasonable grounds for believing that the safety or welfare of the family requires it, the court will have power to make an order prohibiting the defaulting spouse from entering or attempting to enter the family home &ldquo;until further order&rdquo; and from in any any way molesting, annoying or putting in fear the family or any member of it.  Consideration of this recommendation and of the other recommendations of the committee is at an advanced stage and I hope to be in a position to consult the Government on the necessary legislation in the near future.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="873" /> 1. The full range of available health services if his parents are eligible for a medical card.</P>
    <P>2. A limited range of services, including in particular hospital inpatient and outpatient services and assistance towards the cost of prescribed medicines of his parents are in the limited eligibility class.</P>
    <P>3. Services relating to tuberculosis and other infectious diseases and to certain long-term diseases and disabilities, irrespective of his parents' circumstances.</P>
    <P>These services are similarly available after 16 years of age but the assessment of eligibility is then based on the person's own circumstances.</P>
    <P>The school health examination service, which is available to children attending national school, has a more specific purpose.  It is primarily a diagnostic service for children, designed to identify at an early age the need for treatment or care in relation to any aspect of the child's health or development. Its relevance diminishes as the child grows older and, for practical reasons, it is confined to children who are attending national school.

As I explained on many occasions the emphasis now is on medical care for children in national schools, whether <Col N="874" /> they be 12, 13, 14 or 15.  There is also the fact that 34 or 35 per cent of the population are holders of medical cards and children described by the Deputy would be covered by those cards.  I certainly do see a difficulty in relation to ongoing treatment so far as dentistry is concerned, when there is this clamp down immediately a child goes to technical school or to secondary college.

      <P>Anybody in receipt of an allowance for which there was a means test should be automatically entitled to a medical card.  There is just one exception, that is, home assistance which would be provided for a temporary period.  Not necessarily then would an applicant be automatically entitled because the possibility is that after the two or three weeks during which he was getting home assistance he had a fairly good and regular income for the rest of the year.  These are all ongoing benefits and means tests have been applied. As I said in the original reply, I will ask the chief executive officers of the health boards to look into this question to make sure that these guidelines are observed over the whole country.</P>

      <P>I have no reason to believe that fish caught in the Irish Sea and sold in Ireland are likely to be unfit for human consumption because of chemical contamination.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cluskey</NameTxt>
      <P>Payment of widow's non-contributory pension to the person concerned was suspended in May, 1974, as she had refused to sign an authority requesting the United States Department of Health, Education and Welfare to disclose details of United States social security benefit in payment to her.  She did subsequently give the necessary authority which was duly sent to the United States Department concerned.  As, however, a reply had still not been received by October, 1974, her widow's pension was then provisionally restored to her with effect from the date of suspension.  Her case will be reviewed when a reply to Department's inquiries has been received.</P>

    <Speaker pid="FrankCluskey" hpid="Mr. Cluskey Mr. Cluskey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cluskey</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy's question is, to say the least, misleading when he suggests that the lady was waiting for a period of nine months. In fact, responsibility for any delay must lie with the lady herself.  This case has been going on for some considerable time.  The pension was given to the lady on the understanding that she would disclose if and when she received benefit from the United States. The lady did, in fact, receive benefit from the United States and only after some considerable time was it disclosed, not by the lady herself.  This gave rise to further inquiries and on two occasions the lady refused to authorise the relevant Department in the United States to confirm or deny that she was in receipt of benefit from them.  That, I regret to say caused suspension of payment to the lady.  Payment has been restored to her provisionally.  I must refute the suggestion in the Deputy's question that the Department was at fault.</P>

    <Speaker pid="FrankCluskey" hpid="Mr. Cluskey Mr. Cluskey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cluskey</NameTxt>
      <P>Increases of widows' pensions are paid in respect of all qualified children up to age 18, and in respect of children who are in full-time attendance by day at any university, college, school or other educational establishment up to age 21, as such children are normally still dependent on the widow.  This consideration does not necessarily apply in the case of apprentices between the ages of 18 and 21 who are independent wage earners rather than dependants, and in the absence of evidence that their exclusion is a source of hardship I have at present no proposals for the introduction of the legislation which would be necessary to permit payment of an increase in such cases.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cluskey</NameTxt>
      <P>I definitely agree that there is an element of education in an apprenticeship period but we have ascertained from AnCO that apprentices in the age categories mentioned by the Deputy&mdash;18 to 21 years&mdash;are earning amounts between £18 and £24 per week.  So, they could not be described as being in the same category with regard to dependency as a person of that age who is in full-time education in a school, college or university. They are wage-earners and, in some cases, reasonably substantial wage-earners.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Faulkner</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Parliamentary Secretary not agree that while that may be so in the case of certain apprentices being trained or retrained by AnCO, generally speaking, the income of apprentices is very low and does not provide any particular assistance to a widow?  In such circumstances, would the Parliamentary Secretary not agree that it would be a boost to education on the technical side if he were to make this concession available in relation to apprentices?</P>

    <Speaker pid="FrankCluskey" hpid="Mr. Cluskey Mr. Cluskey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cluskey</NameTxt>
      <P>No. I may have led the Deputy into a misunderstanding. My reply related not to persons being trained by AnCO but to apprentices generally in which the wages quoted &mdash;£18 to £24 a week&mdash;applied.  With trade union organisation and the proper regulation of apprentices, apprentices are not now as they used to be described when I was an apprentice, the lowest form of animal life. They are paid reasonably well and, as I stated in the reply, they could not accurately be described as dependants.</P>

    <Speaker pid="FrankCluskey" hpid="Mr. Cluskey Mr. Cluskey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cluskey</NameTxt>
      <P>I would refer the Deputy to the reply which I gave to a somewhat similar question on 24th October, 1974, in which I indicated that the increases in the rates of social welfare payments provided in the last two budgets outstripped by a long way the rise in the cost of living since the present Government took office. Since then, the Government in the recently published White Paper have announced their intention of further increasing social welfare payments in the forthcoming January budget and revising them during the course of the year in order to ensure that those who are dependent on social welfare payments, including pensioners, will be cushioned against price rises and will also be assured of, at least, the maintenance of their position compared with other sections of the community brought about by the last two budgets.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Faulkner</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Parliamentary Secretary agree that the benefits and other assistance given to social welfare beneficiaries were eroded month by month from the time it was given?  For example, the old age pension of £7.20 granted in July, 1973, had the purchasing power of £6 in July, 1974, and the increases went nowhere near giving back the purchasing power to social welfare beneficiaries.</P>

    <Speaker pid="FrankCluskey" hpid="Mr. Cluskey Mr. Cluskey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cluskey</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not agree with the Deputy.  It is not a matter of speculation but of established fact. There is no doubt that some of the benefits derived from the last two increases have been eroded by price increases but it is wrong to suggest they have been completely eroded. There is no doubt that people in receipt of social welfare payments are considerably better off.</P>

I am not trying to sell that because I do not believe it, but it is damaging to make statements that are not accurate.  There is no doubt that the percentage increases granted, 18 per cent in the last budget, have more than compensated for the increase in the cost of living.  The people concerned are somewhat better off than they were but I am not suggesting for one moment that the payments are adequate.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cluskey</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy is not correct in stating that the increases in last year's budget were to compensate for what had taken place before that time.  There was a contemplated increase in the cost of living and there was also an element to improve the standard of living of these people. There is no doubt that the cost of living has risen considerably more than was anticipated.  These people are not as well off as we had hoped they would be when the increases were granted.  However, the fact remains that they are better off than before the last budget and the benefits given have not been eroded completely, as was suggested by Deputies opposite. Surely some of the Deputies on the other side could find some other area where they could criticise the Government that would do less damage to the people concerned.  Deputies oppossite are not being helpful by distorting what I have already admitted is an unsatisfactory situation.</P>

      <P>Yesterday evening when I was speaking the Minister interjected to make the triumphal announcement that 65 per cent of CIE revenue goes in wages and he said it in such a way as to indicate an anti-labour bias in Government mentality with regard to the workers of CIE.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RayBurke" hpid="Mr. R.P. Burke Mr. R.P. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R.P. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to speak on behalf of the workers of CIE because it is obvious that the Minister's Labour Party partners in Government are not prepared to come in and speak on behalf of the workers of CIE.  The Minister will not get away with blaming this massive £11.3 million which will be £14 million in a full year on the workers.  Any worker is only as good as the direction he is getting from management. The point we have been making is that not enough direction is being given to the workers and the direction they are getting is incorrect.  We are calling for a complete, radical re-appraisal of the whole operation of CIE from management level.  We are calling for a new dynamic approach, a new drive, a new innovation in the management approach of CIE.  There is no use in the Minister blaming the <Col N="916" /> workers for this situation.  That does not wash with the Fianna Fáil Party and it will not wash with the people.</P>
      <P>I am surprised that some of the Labour backbenchers have not been on their feet to protect and speak out on behalf of the CIE workers.  What is needed is a joint committee of both Houses of the Oireachtas to examine the operation not only of CIE but of all semi-State bodies, a committee which would be in a position to examine in detail the management decisions made.  I am not talking about the day-to-day operations, I am talking about the general management guidelines set down for the operation of semi-State bodies.  If we had this committee we would be in a far different position from what we are facing today. The taxpayers are facing a bill of £11.3 million and rising.  At 4.05 today we estimate a bill of £14 million for a full year.  Only the Lord and the Minister and his colleagues know what the bill will be at 7.35 this evening when the Minister for Finance has made his announcement.  We do not know what the fuel bills will be by the time the Minister for Finance has finished.  Of course we will be told that it is the workers of CIE and not the Minister who is responsible and then we will hear about the oil sheiks and we will hear that because of our connections with British Petroleum and our &ldquo;domestic&rdquo; arrangements with British oil companies it was necessary to follow Britain and increase the oil costs.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I want to say now, before the Minister for Finance comes in and makes this announcement, that we will not accept any increase in taxation on fuel bills.  Because it was raised in England we do not have to follow suit like sheep.  We are an independent nation and independent we must stand.  We will not be led by the Government like sheep to follow the British taxpayers. I do not see why this should be put on the taxpayers and I want to warn the Government that we on this side will not accept those increases.  We are an independent nation.  Let us remain independent. As an independent nation we are in a position to make a clear decision as to whether transport is a social service or must be run on an <Col N="917" /> economic basis.  It is time we sat down and contemplated this question.  This is the type of question which could be dealt with by a sub-committee of both Houses of the Oireachtas.  I call on the Minister to adopt this suggestion of a committee of both Houses.</P>
    <P>I would like to mention the six-year modernisation programme which envisages a cut-back in CIE's rail haulage service.  Some guarantees must be given in regard to this programme, one being that there will be no cut-back in employment on the railways at any stations where goods facilities are being removed.  A guarantee must also be given to the customers who use CIE's facilities that there will be no cut-back in the service or facilities provided.  The Minister must answer these two questions.</P>
    <P>In conclusion, let us not blame the workers in CIE for the imposition of this £11.3 million burden on the taxpayers. Rather, let us blame the lack of direction at top management level and the Government.  It is on the Government the blame really lies in the first place.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JosephBermingham" hpid="Mr. Bermingham Mr. Bermingham">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bermingham</NameTxt>
      <P>Railways in almost all European countries are losing money and we must decide whether we want railways in particular and CIE in general as a social service or as an economic unit.  The present situation is nothing new, but it seems to be getting gradually worse.  CIE have been losing money for many, many years. I believe it was decided here years ago that we would have to keep the railways and CIE in operation.  This is something we must face.  The interjection by the Minister that 66 per cent of CIE expenditure goes on wages and salaries was not intended in the way in which the last speaker seems to have interpreted it.  I think the Minister meant to imply that this was a social service providing a great deal of necessary employment.  I do not believe the Minister was blaming the workers for the present position of CIE.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The workers in CIE are as good as management and supervision are.  If there is to be a pruning of expenditure <Col N="918" /> on salaries and wages, then CIE must start at the top.  In one particular instance CIE personnel came down to my town to investigate a serious complaint by an industrialist about the service he was getting.  These people arrived at the same time as the train arrived from Dublin, but they arrived in a huge car, chauffeur driven.  That is the kind of unnecessary expenditure that should be cut out.  That kind of operation by the top brass should be eliminated.  I believe there is a substantial amount of that kind of thing in CIE.  It was part and parcel of CIE long before the present Minister took office.  CIE management operates in a fashion that would lead one to expect the kind of results the normal firm would harvest from that kind of management. Again, if they intend to engage seriously in commercial haulage, then they should get out and sell their services.</P>
    <P>We are told that CIE will close down certain railways here, there and everywhere under their new rationalisation scheme and, at the same time, develop other railways.  The public are entitled to know how they arrive at these decisions. We, in Kildare, are very aggrieved because not one station in that county is scheduled for any kind of improvement under the new scheme of rationalisation.  It can be argued that we are very close to Dublin but those of us who have experience of the roads know that the roads from Naas down the country are choked with heavy lorries.  Indeed, the town of Naas itself is practically impossible from the point of view of traffic flow. Outside of Dublin, Kildare has the greatest industrial growth of any county.  It is very short-sighted policy that the first station to be developed on the line to Cork is just outside the county.  I would expect development to take place where industrial growth is greatest.</P>
    <P>CIE may argue that the industries in towns like Newbridge are not using CIE.  That is so, but there are reasons for that.  First of all, CIE are not providing the service for container traffic and industrialists naturally move their goods by container because it is cheap and easy.  I would ask the Minister <Col N="919" /> to communicate with those responsible in CIE and ask them to take a long look at their rationalisation scheme before they finally decide not to develop any situation within County Kildare.  The most suitable one would be Newbridge.  I know the decision is not final but it certainly was not one of the stations mentioned for development in the first plans sent out.  There was no mention of any station for development in County Kildare.  The top brass in CIE should be made to produce concrete evidence of what they have done to improve trade in these stations and what the position would be if they provided a service for container traffic, and so on, essential if one is to maintain a modern railway system.</P>
    <P>In conjunction with the Department of Local Government CIE should have a look at the road problem within that area.  Apart from the social service and employment element there would be the advantage of providing an alternative means of transport which would remove a great deal of heavy traffic from our roads.</P>
    <P>The time has come when we will have to spend colossal sums of money either on the railways or on the roads. We should seriously consider providing a service by CIE which would be able to substitute for what is presently being provided in increasing volume by road.</P>
    <P>Enough is not done by CIE to sell early morning services or commuter services between Dublin and areas within 30 to 40 miles.  On a number of occasions I asked CIE to provide early morning transport for people living in Kildare and working in Dublin, and people living in the Robertstown and Allenwood area working in Newbridge and Naas.  Buses could be filled in those areas and bring people to work in Droichead Nua and Naas, and they could continue on their way to Dublin and be refilled in Naas or Newbridge.  CIE are not doing enough research into that kind of operation.  If, as it now seems, we must keep CIE going whether it is economic or not, surely the people in these areas are entitled to a transport <Col N="920" /> service.  This would relieve even the small roads of traffic congestion.</P>
    <P>The same thing applies in many other areas.  CIE have made no effort to sell their goods traffic services to business people in the various towns.  They have very few, if any, salesmen visiting traders and so on.  I know people in my own town of Athy who organised a lorry service to and from Dublin for various industries.  This business was taken from CIE because they lacked the necessary drive to hold on to it.  If we are to devote large sums of money to keep CIE going&mdash;and I think we should&mdash;CIE should be forced to recognise that they have a duty to sell their services to every town and every village as well as to provide those services.</P>
    <P>I know of places all over the country where buses and trains are arriving half empty from the same place at the same time.  I do not think that is practical.  I do not think an ordinary businessman would do that. We were told some years ago that CIE need no longer provide any service they did not consider economic. In my own area, a CIE delivery service was withdrawn.  I accept that.  It probably was not economic to provide it and it would not under any circumstances be economic to provide it in the small way I am talking about.</P>
    <P>If CIE seriously tackled the question of sales they would find many areas where their services could be provided reasonably economically, provided they had the proper salesmen in the field.  I understand that dining facilities on some of the long distance trains have been withdrawn.  This is a mistake.  It would help to encourage people travelling long distances not to use their cars if they had that service on the train.</P>
    <P>In rural areas the bus services seem to be totally centred on transporting shoppers and sightseers and take no account at all of workers and of people needing transport from Athy or Kildare or Newbridge to Dublin. This is very necessary.  Very often the first bus leaves a town at 10 o'clock or 11 o'clock in the morning.  That is no use to the large number of persons <Col N="921" /> coming from the area I speak of to work in the greater city area.  Because of that they have to put their cars on the roads.  This is very expensive.  CIE could cash in on the actual expense of driving a car from those centres to the city, and they could run a highly successful early morning and late evening service for these workers.</P>
    <P>CIE will have to be kept in operation to provide employment and as a social service.  We could not operate without the service being continued in some fashion by CIE.  We should aim at ensuring that the service is available to the greatest possible number of people and the greatest possible number of areas.  In all walks of life there is a tendency towards centralisation. Many of the smaller stations have already been closed.  Now good-sized towns will be without a road freight service.  We are told it will be supplied from other areas and that everything will be hunky-dory with regard to deliveries to shops, and so on.  I have my doubts about that. When the small stations were being closed we were told that a better service would be provided but, to my knowledge, that did not happen.</P>
    <P>In County Kildare there will be no station development.  Outside Kildare, on the southern line towards Waterford, the first station is Carlow.  This station is in line for improvement.  On the other southern line, to Cork, Portlaoise is the nearest station to Kildare. I cannot see why the stations in Kildare are not developed.  There are large industries in that county and they are in need of a rail service. There is plenty of business available for CIE.  The Minister should treat the question of improving the facilities at Newbridge as a matter of urgency.  The people of that area will support CIE if the company are prepared to talk to those involved in business and industry.</P>
    <P>There is a great feeling of uncertainty among the workers in the smaller stations and this results in inefficiency. These workers feel that the stations where they are employed will close and that they will be either transferred or made redundant.  I urge the Minister to ensure that the people <Col N="922" /> who make the final decisions about whether these services will be retained and improved or whether they will be withdrawn consult with the business people and industrialists concerned. I am aware that the CIE officials will be able to produce facts and figures to justify their decisions.</P>
    <P>If this substantial sum of money is necessary to keep CIE going in its present form this House should provide it.  In return we should be given a guarantee by the Minister, and CIE, that every effort will be made to introduce efficiency and salesmanship to improve the position within the company and the company's balance sheet.</P>

      <P>
        <i>(Dublin Central)</i>: I welcome this opportunity of reviewing, briefly, the workings of CIE, in particular the bus service in Dublin city.  It is important that Deputies should consider seriously how the money we are being asked to give to CIE will be spent.  It is only fair to the taxpayer, who has to shoulder this in the form of taxation, that Deputies should ask if we are getting a good return for the money.  If there are failures in the company, it is the duty of Members to point them out.  Is CIE to be run as a social service or is it to be made an economic business?  To look upon CIE solely as a social service would be dangerous because it would completely lack enterprise.  We must avoid this and we must ensure that management and workers work towards a certain target.  It is not good enough that at the end of every year the company loses money they approach the Dáil for a subvention. We should outline to CIE what we expect from them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A number of years ago the late Seán Lemass, when asking this House for a subvention of £2 million, announced that he expected the company would be able to pay their way within a short time.  I accept that the company is playing an important part in the economic life of this country. It is serving two purposes, keeping a public transport system going and providing worthwhile employment for our people.  These factors must be taken into consideration when we are <Col N="923" /> asked to grant money to the company. CIE, and the Department of Posts and Telegraphs, are the biggest employers in the State.  This huge labour force must be kept working at all costs.</P>
    <P>Some people would say that it is not possible to rationalise and effect economies in the company unless there are redundancies or early retirements.  I am against such a move.  It is possible to expand the business carried on by CIE.  The company could expand the freight service and an expansion of this service would mean that some of the heavy traffic would be taken off our roads.  It is important, particularly in view of the advent of a regional policy, that CIE improve their freight service.  For a regional policy to be properly implemented CIE will have to co-operate.  For a regional policy to be effective the majority of the industries will have to be placed in the west but they will export through ports on the east coast and the products of these industries will have to be conveyed to these ports.</P>
    <P>In conjunction with the IDA, CIE should devise a scheme for the development of ports on the east coast, excluding Dublin.  It is not possible to expand Dublin because it is completely blocked and not capable of taking any more heavy traffic.</P>
    <P>A number of Deputies praised the rail service.  We can all be proud of the rail service to the south and west. The new supertrain on which I have travelled on several occasions is something which should encourage any traveller to use rail transport.  With that type of service there is every possibility of encouraging more people to travel.</P>
    <P>But when we come back to Dublin city, the picture is reversed completely. The image which CIE has in the country certainly does not stand up to the same examination in Dublin.  No section of the community has been abused more than that using public transport in this city over the past ten years.  We are all aware of the number of strikes that have taken place and which have caused these people great hardship.  It is no wonder so many <Col N="924" /> people are using private cars.  I think we should try to discourage the use of private cars in the city centre but what choice has one when one observes the services offered over the past ten years?  The management and unions involved in CIE will have to examine this matter very closely.  If my memory serves me right, there are something in the region of 27 unions involved in CIE.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JosephDowling" hpid="Mr. Dowling Mr. Dowling">

      <P>Thirty-three.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Dublin Central)</i>: Deputy Dowling informs me now that it is 33.  Imagine trying to negotiate terms with 33 unions.  The management and unions for the sake of the company and for the sake of the services they offer the public will have to do something to resolve this matter and reduce the number of unions involved. No personnel manager could possibly work out the day-to-day problems with that number of unions. Until such time as this has been done, there will be problems in CIE.</P>
      <P>Certainly, the last phase of the last strike which lasted four days should have been avoided.  Before that we had a strike lasting a number of weeks. Then two different proposals were put to the workers which they said they would consider.  During that time of nearly 12 weeks the management and unions should have got together because it was quite obvious things would break down unless some practical approach was made.  Of course that would not have been allowed in a private business.  Certainly, I could not foresee the manager of a private company letting such a matter drift until the eleventh hour, resulting in a four-day strike.  There incompetence on the part of both sides was displayed, that in the intervening period they could not iron out these difficulties which occur in every industry.  A more practical approach will have to be made in future if we are to encourage people in Dublin to use public transport.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If this is not done, some system will have to be evolved in Dublin to relieve city centre congestion.  We are all aware of the chaotic conditions obtaining at present.  If one were to go out now to Dame Street or O'Connell <Col N="925" /> Street one would find about 30 buses unable to move one way or the other. CIE management in conjunction with local authorities and Dublin Corporation will have to get together and work out a solution to this problem.  There is nothing more frustrating to a person who finishes work at 5 o'clock than finding that he does not arrive in, say, Tallaght or some such place until 6.30 p.m.  God knows, these people are paying sufficiently high bus fares not to be subjected to that type of punishment after work in the evenings.</P>
    <P>It is quite obvious that there are a few options only open with regard to the utilisation of public transport in Dublin.  One solution might be the building of motorways throughout the city but this can involve difficulties also.  At present where there are plans afoot for road widening and the building of motorways, there is a lot of agitation from and resentment on the part of people who may be displaced from their places of residence.  Could there not be a trial plan for the debarring of motorists from the city centre? One can see any morning or evening hundreds of cars leaving the city with a driver only.  This is something that should be discouraged if at all possible because as long as that continues things will become progressively worse.  Anybody observing the traffic situation in Dublin in recent years will have seen its deterioration.  It would seem that there are two options open only: first. to try to improve the movement of public transport within the city or. secondly, consider the possibility of an underground transport system but, under present conditions road traffic is grinding to a halt.</P>
    <P>I notice from the Minister's brief that more people travelled by public transport in Dublin last year than in any other year.  The number of persons carried in Dublin city buses last year was 220 million.  I agree that that is a sizeable number of people to be carried.  But that could be considerably improved by an efficient service making it possible for one to reach one's destination in the shortest possible time.  Certainly that is not happening at present.  People are totally dissatisfied with the service, even though they say: &ldquo;We have to <Col N="926" /> use it; we have no other choice.&rdquo; There are many people who cannot afford the luxury of a private car. There are people incapable of driving and who could not be granted licences.  However, if they were in a position to do so, I think they would drive their own cars.  But attitudes will not be changed until one can provide a good alternative service.  There should be an experiment carried out in some part of the city to keep private transport out.  Perhaps we could run small trolley buses.  There are some parts of the Continent where people are content to stand in these trolley buses for short distances.</P>
    <P>There are so many districts around Dublin where private transport could stop, districts like, say, Fairview, Glasnevin, Christ Church, Rathmines, Terenure and so on and have established an efficient public service into the city centre.  Those are some points which I regard as being important so far as Dublin city is concerned. Bearing in mind that last year 220 million people were carried by public transport in Dublin city, which is far more than were carried in the rest of the country, it is only fair that they should be entitled to an efficient service. I am quite convinced that very little of the subvention we pay goes towards Dublin transport services. The largest part of the losses incurred is on the railways.  Some additional attention should be paid to the people who utilise public transport in Dublin and who, I am sure, contribute substantially to the resulting revenue.</P>
    <P>I wonder would the Minister or the board carry out an experiment in regard to staggered working hours. For example, so many people employed in the public service at this hour will be leaving their places of employment which coincides exactly with the time other people leave factories and shops.  This creates further congestion with long queues for buses.  Perhaps people could come in an hour earlier in the morning and leave an hour earlier in the evening. It would lessen the number of people seeking public transport at the same time.  It might also stagger the hours of use of private transport and leave the buses more room to manoeuvre <Col N="927" /> within the city.  This would be an idea for the board, the unions and the FUE, but especially for the Minister within his own public services.  Perhaps he might implement a policy under which civil servants would finish work at, say, 3.30 or 4 o'clock and come in at 8 o'clock in the morning, which is done in several parts of the Continent.  These are some suggestions which might alleviate the chaotic conditions obtaining at the moment.</P>
    <P>Big improvements have been made in the railway stations and I am speaking of Heuston station in particular. This has been improved considerably and many facilities have been introduced for people travelling, but I am not very sure whether it was right to divert all traffic, especially to the west, to Pearse and Connolly stations.  I can see that in the case of people travelling to the west it was more convenient to travel to Pearse and Connolly stations than to have to go to Heuston station.  I have heard a few Deputies from the country complaining about this and there is a certain amount of substance in what they said.  Evidently, there must be some particular reason for it&mdash; whether economies were being effected, I am not sure&mdash;but centralising all that traffic in Heuston station led to a certain amount of congestion there.</P>
    <P>We should try to encourage more people to use the railway freight services.  It is certainly something which would increase the revenues of the Board of CIE.  If we are to have a good regional policy, we will have to have a good transport policy. These go hand in hand and we cannot expect industrialists to come here unless we can offer such a policy, even if it has to be subsidised at some stage.  It is important therefore that consultation takes place with the IDA in regard to their plans and where they propose to site factories in the west.  The Board of CIE might be able to formulate plans for the utilisation of their services to help these industrialists. It is important that we have an overall plan so that we may know <Col N="928" /> where we are going in regard to the functioning of the transport company, and of transport in Dublin for the future.  What public transport will be like in ten years' time if no firm decision is taken now one cannot imagine.  I should imagine that we will have an absolutely chaotic situation and therefore we need a comprehensive plan in this regard.  Let CIE draw it up themselves if they can get no co-operation from the local authorities or from Dublin Corporation, but at least let us have a plan on how best they can use public transport in the city and, in regard to regional policy, how best they can put their services at the disposal of industrialists.</P>
    <P>I appreciate that this money is necessary but I hope that this staggeringly huge increase can be checked in some way.  If this increase of £3 million on a subvention which is reaching £14 million is to continue, I would not like to think what it will be like in ten years' time.  Some effort will have to be made to check it to some extent and the best way to do so is to improve the business.  If you extend in any business, you cut down your overheads, and CIE should concentrate on extending their business and by doing so contain the subvention and keep full employment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JosephDowling" hpid="Mr. Dowling Mr. Dowling">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dowling</NameTxt>
      <P>Like other speakers, I wish to support this Bill.  I would like to start my remarks by referring to the passage in the Minister's brief in which he states that:</P>
      <P>CIE are fully conscious of the need for adequate communication with all parties concerned in relation to proposed changes and an extensive programme of consultation with staff, trade unions and customers has taken place and it is the board's intention to keep interested parties advised of progress.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would say that it is a great pity that CIE in the past did not have the same attitude to this matter of communication because if the management of CIE had been more interested in communication in the past, we would have avoided some of the unpleasant situations which we had in this city <Col N="929" /> in the not-too-distant past.  I refer to the Dublin bus strike.</P>
    <P>We are looking for finance now, but a considerable amount has been lost to CIE by that strike.  CIE management were not blameless in the matter because after a prolonged period of examination of the claims of the unions concerned, we saw on the day before the five-day week was to come into operation, CIE indicated what the rota to be provided was.  We saw that after almost 12 months of inactivity, there suddenly appeared on the notice boards in the garages this document which caused the Dublin bus strike.  It is because of the lack of communication between management, trade unions and workers that we had this desperate situation in which so many people in the city were driven away from CIE because of the recurring stoppages which had taken place in the past, a situation in which workers' jobs were put at risk because of their inability to get to their jobs in time because of lack of transport.  The bulk of the workers in the city rely on public transport and what we want is an effective and efficient transport system which we know will be permanent and in which if a breakdown occurs, it will occur only because every method of avoiding it has been exhausted by both management and workers.</P>
    <P>On the occasion of the strike, that was not so and I am glad to learn now that an effort is being made by CIE to communicate, and to recognise the need to communicate, not alone with the unions but with other interested parties.  There are many interested parties and the people who use the transport system are people whose views should not be overlooked. Recently in the city I was stopped by a person doing a survey, I imagine, on behalf of CIE&mdash;the questions were in relation to CIE&mdash;and I welcome this type of survey in which people are asked for their views about CIE.  I hope that as a result we will not have a repetition of the disastrous situation which struck this city and deprived some workers of employment and some works of a substantial <Col N="930" /> part of their take-home wage packets because they were put on short time. While the management would endeavour to place the blame elsewhere, blame placing is no solution of problems. The solution is communication.</P>
    <P>I was a CIE worker so I know something about CIE and I would ask the Minister in order to ensure that there will be no breakdown in communication in future to put into operation some type of worker participation plan by which the workers in CIE can participate in decision-making. I am quite certain that the workers who have given long and loyal service, in the workshops, on the buses and elsewhere, will be only too happy to enlighten some of the management, and we have defects in management, just as there are defects in the workers' system.</P>
    <P>However, I am positive that, with worker participation, there would be this desirable and essential communication between management and workers. I appeal to the Minister to ensure that there is some form of worker participation so that the worker can be given the opportunity of participating in decision making.  This would make for a better service.  Every area of the country is serviced by CIE, whether by the train or passenger bus service, by the school transport service or by the road freight service.  The field covered is very wide.  Unfortunately, however, the people at the top in CIE are very often not aware of the problems of out-of-the-way areas.  Some of these problems never come to the attention of those at management level.  We must ensure that if an individual has a complaint to make, that complaint is brought to the attention of the appropriate persons. This is a problem that would be solved by worker participation in management.  I trust that all these areas of communication will be made available as a result of this change in the system.</P>
    <P>On the previous occasions I have been critical of many aspects of CIE management but, as Deputy Fitzpatrick indicated, many desirable changes have taken place and to that extent the management deserve to be congratulated. <Col N="931" /> However, there is this vital aspect of communication between workers and management.  I am very much aware of this problem not only as an ex-CIE employee but also as one who interviewed CIE workers in the not too distant past and who has spoken with them throughout the provinces, particularly during the Cork by-election. Many of their problems have been taken up with the Department or with the company.</P>
    <P>I know that there are many forms of worker participation but it should be possible to find one that suits the circumstances of CIE.  Prior to the general election we heard a lot from the socialist side of the Government as to the necessity and desirability of worker participation.  They told us that workers should have a say in the day-to-day decisions of industry.  In the case of a semi-State organisation such as CIE the Minister has it within his power to ensure that some of the promises regarding the participation of workers which were made by his colleagues will be implemented fully.  I would be the first to give the Minister credit for any steps he may take in this direction.</P>
    <P>As well as the obvious areas, CIE are engaged in the tourist industry by way of the self-drive business and river boats.  Since their field of activity is so broad, they need all the expertise and advice possible from a wide section of the community.</P>
    <P>Deputy Fitzpatrick referred to there being 33 unions within CIE catering for 21,000 workers.  This is a substantial number of unions but there is a substantial number of workers involved, too.  We know that the recent bus strike resulted from inter-union problems within the company but these problems would have been avoided if CIE management had been more courageous and if there had been more communication with the workers in the prolonged period prior to the strike. I hope there will be a change in the system and that there will no longer be a situation whereby workers might be dictated to by some of those inefficient individuals who were in their positions merely because they were <Col N="932" /> useless elsewhere.  There has been an improvement in the personnel department of CIE during the past number of years and I hope that there will continue to be improvements so that the problems experienced in the past can be eliminated.  I suspect that if there had not been a bus strike this year the money required now by CIE would be a good deal less than we are being asked to vote here.</P>
    <P>I would agree with some of the points made in relation to the affairs of CIE because I, too, am of the opinion that their affairs should be subject to the Houses of the Oireachtas.  I say this because we are making available to them substantial sums of money.  Therefore, it is only reasonable that we should be in a position to discuss their expenditure and to see whether, in a broad way, we might make any contribution in that regard.  I have been told, though not by the present Minister, that the Minister has no function in this matter.  However, since it is the Minister's function to come here and ask the House to vote these moneys, we should have some say as to the accounts of the company.  At least, we should be able to satisfy ourselves that there is a real need for the moneys being asked for.  The Minister may say that CIE were established by a previous administration.  While that may be so, it is for the present administration to remedy any defects there may be in regard to the company.  When the people on the other side of the House were in opposition they called on many occasions for changes in relation to the administration of CIE.  I trust that their views and the views of Deputies on this side of the House will be implemented by the Minister.</P>
    <P>The Minister referred to rationalisation. This is a fairly fashionable word to use nowadays but generally rationalisation means the laying off of workers.  It is amazing, though, that people at the top in management are not affected by redundancy.  The ordinary worker is the one who is made redundant.  One might well ask what jobs are being made available for people who have been working in a supervisory capacity but who should not be required any longer when those <Col N="933" /> whom they have been supervising become redundant.  They seem to be retained in very superior positions from the pay point of view.  I hope that in the rationalisation which takes place there will not be large-scale redundancy, that there will be a phasing out of employment over a period rather than people being cast aside.</P>
    <P>Over a number of years CIE often cast people on the scrap-heap.  Men who built up CIE, who worked three days a week, who took a pay cut in order that the Great Southern Railway would survive ended their days on miserable pensions after 40 years' service.  They got approximately 25 shillings a week.  While under the new system there is a substantial pension fund, those who built up the system and who worked hard in the dark and difficult days of the 1930s and late 1920s, who had a genuine concern for the survival of the railway system were cast aside by CIE.  Notwithstanding the large amount of funds available, many of these men had pensions of 25 shillings a week or less.  I hope that something will be done for the aged CIE pensioners.  Their case cannot be ignored.  If they are ignored there is little chance of there being sympathy for the general public.</P>
    <P>Workers in CIE, especially those in the workshop with whom I was acquainted have proved themselves to be superior to others elsewhere.  Because of their experience in the CIE service, in the vast workshops at Inchicore, it was reasonably easy for them to obtain employment elsewhere when they left the service.  Workers must be respected.  When they are unable for health or other reasons to continue working they must be looked after in a reasonable fashion.</P>
    <P>The question of alternatives to the present system has been raised.  Are we willing to pay for alternatives? Some solutions that are suggested need not mean additional expenditure. They may involve a change of priorities or a change in funding.</P>
    <P>I would hope that there will be a policy of taking guidance from the people.  Far too often the public have been overlooked.  The need for a <Col N="934" /> public response to transport issues cannot be exaggerated.  Most people use one or other CIE service.  There have been surveys and questionnaires have been issued to the public.  It is desirable that there should be more communication between CIE and the public.  It is the public who will meet the bill on this occasion.</P>
    <P>Suggestions have been made about providing an underground transport system and the need for re-examination of the systems in Dublin and the large cities.  The transport systems in large cities were built on the horse and car as distinct from the new areas where they were built on the automobile.  The change from the horse and car to the automobile has been a change from a mare to a nightmare.  The roads system was never designed to take the type and volume of traffic of modern days.  CIE is responsible for a substantial volume of city traffic.  It is necessary to look well into the future.  While the immediate problem must be solved, attention must be paid to the far greater problems that are likely to develop in future.</P>
    <P>Having discussed the matter in Brussels recently, I understand that funds could be available from the EEC regional fund for the development of transport systems such as an underground system here.  I would hope that the Government and CIE would consider this aspect.  In the EEC context this country is regarded as undeveloped.  The question of funds being made available for an underground transport system should be fully investigated.  At least we should have a plan.  Sections of the city could be linked by an underground system to the railheads or to bus termini.  This would relieve some of the congestion that takes place.  I would hope that the Minister would consider this matter.</P>
    <P>Deputy Tom Fitzpatrick referred to the matter of flexibility of working hours.  Flexed time has become part and parcel of the work force in other countries.  While this kind of flexibility is not feasible on production lines it certainly could be employed for office staffs and for some store workers.  The <Col N="935" /> matter should be examined.  This would ease the problem created by the sudden rush of traffic at 7.30 a.m. and 5.30 p.m.</P>
    <P>In outlying areas and in particular in the perimeter areas of Dublin where there are vast housing estates, for instance, Ballyfermot and Ballymun, we find on wet days that people at intermediate stops have to wait a long time for a bus.  If flexed time were introduced in CIE and other organisations in connection with which the Minister has some power, some of the traffic problems would be relieved.</P>
    <P>The question must be asked as to whether the existing transport system meets our needs.  A person who has a car can commute reasonably easily but the person who has to rely on the public transport service finds that the service is infrequent at times.  This difficulty could be eliminated and we could have a more effective system.  I realise that every effort has been made in the past to eliminate problems. There are problems that take too long to percolate through to authority. Sometimes problems are covered up on the way.  It has happened that a problem is buried on the way up to management level because there might be a reflection on someone along the line. This has frequently happened.  I hope we shall have some system providing a straightforward approach to management.</P>
    <P>Provision of freeways for the buses in the city was tried on one occasion with some success, we were told, but suddenly these disappeared.  We should like to know if there is any intention, in order to secure a freer traffic flow, to re-examine freeways for the bus services.  While freeways in the city for buses and more and better dual carriageways may assist in relieving the situation at present CIE should be looking far beyond present problems. The Minister would be wise to have some other body examine in greater depth problems that may arise in future in relation to the free movement of traffic as a result of the congestion due mainly to the large number of buses in the city.  I know the Dublin traffic study group of the Garda, Dublin <Col N="936" /> Corporation and county council have made, and continue to make surveys of the situation but however good surveys are and however effective they are believed to be in perfecting the system, they are doing it against the odds of a city developed against a background, not of the motor car or mechanically propelled vehicle but of another vehicle.  For that reason any solution offered is only a short-term one and a more radical solution is required to meet the long-term problems of the future.</P>
    <P>Pollution from CIE buses and trucks causes grave irritation in the city.  In built-up areas this black smoke is emitted from time to time&mdash; some people call it &ldquo;black death&rdquo;.  It causes great distress in built-up areas and I hope some type of filter will be fitted to these vehicles to reduce the health hazard.</P>
    <P>I do not propose to delay the House beyond saying that I am glad to see in the Minister's brief that a reconstruction job is to take place at 22 railheads and that 27 more will undergo major reconstruction.  This is generally welcomed but while we congratulate the management on the effective measures they have taken, there are some matters, some of which have been mentioned today, that still need more effective attention on a long-term basis.</P>
    <P>Deputies voting such large amounts as the amount now required by the Minister, £11.3 million, should be able to ask for and receive the information they require regarding CIE affairs. That is a reasonable request and I hope in the near future we shall no longer get the stock reply that the Minister has no function in the matter and that the day-to-day affairs of the company are a matter for CIE. Nobody wants to interfere in CIE's day-to-day affairs but Deputies require information from time to time.  They are required to vote and every matter concerning CIE concerns Members of the House because the public are critical of Deputies if they do not play their part particularly when bills such as this arise.  If Deputies are found wanting their constituents let them know very quickly that their views are important.  The Minister has indicated <Col N="937" /> that CIE are now fully conscious of the need for adequate communication and that their intention is to ensure consultation between the trade unions and all interested parties. Deputies are interested parties and I hope that when they require information in future it will be forthcoming.</P>

      <P>I also am deeply concerned with the Transport Bill of 1974 as an ex-CIE employee.  This bill is a sizeable one but when one considers its contribution to employment, to industry and to the tourist trade it is a worthwhile investment.  With some pruning perhaps at certain levels, this is an industry that could bear fruit in the years ahead.</P>
      <P>When the Minister referred to the 65 per cent bill for wages I am quite satisfied that no reflection was meant on the staff of CIE.  He was simply impressing on the House the employment factor involved in the running of CIE.  I would not accept any reflection on the CIE staff and in fact would like to compliment all sections of it, from the porter to the goods checker, to the linesmen on the permanent way.  Over the years, because of the unfortunate situation in CIE, the railwayman was the butt of many jokes and when one is involved, it can be a depressing employment.  They do not know where they are going and are seeking guidance.</P>
      <P>Reference has been made to the need for consultation at top level.  I can bear witness to consultation at the lower level when in fact what is done is to prepare a list for submission to the Minister at the end of the year to show that management is consulting with staff. My honest belief is that much of this is insincere and merely a farce.  I was never satisfied with it but one could read the Official Report of the Dáil debates afterwards and I could understand the public saying that there was really consultation at both upper and lower levels.  On my own experience, I never accepted this.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In 1961, when area management was introduced, I was employed in CIE and at that time the great miracle-worker was brought in to run the company and we in CIE <Col N="938" /> anticipated a great new era.  In a short space of time we found the miracles being performed were the closing down of branch lines&mdash;much regretted now in many areas&mdash;and the creation of a monster called &ldquo;area management&rdquo; which has grown each year.  If there is to be pruning and rationalisation I believe that it should start at the top rather than at the bottom as Deputy Dowling said.  In my experience if there was any economy in the old days it was in regard to the half-hour a plate-layer worked on a Saturday or the hour the porter worked in the goods' store but there was no question whatever about the staff car or the petrol for the executive travelling around the country.</P>
    <P>Having handed out the brickbats I should like to deal with certain aspects of CIE and compliment the commercial staff on the development of passenger traffic and the good results achieved. The advertising and the clean trains have made the public realise that this is a very safe, clean and happy way of travelling to and from the metropolis. Perhaps some areas such as dining facilities have been overlooked and this is a matter the Minister might look into.  In the winter when one is travelling a cup of tea is very welcome but I suppose the question of economics comes in.</P>
    <P>In the past, I have referred to the complete phasing out of the carriage of livestock by CIE.  About 15 years ago it was accepted that this sector was a considerable part of the freight traffic but now on mart days in provincial towns while one can see trains in the stations, wagons for the carriage of livestock are not loaded.  When I raised this matter at another level, I was told it was uneconomic to handle livestock traffic.  Nowadays it is quite common to see 40 or 50 giant vehicles leaving the marts and travelling to Dublin by road.  One would like to relate the economics of this kind of haulage to the former traffic on CIE. I realise that there is a departure with regard to the mode of traffic but CIE, in their own way, have contributed by their discouragement of the carriage of livestock.</P>
    <P>The road passenger and road freight <Col N="939" /> sections are doing a good job.  In particular, I should like to refer to the school transport section.  In my area, the buses have to travel many miles. It is a social service and one worthy of CIE.</P>
    <P>We will always need the railways. As I pointed out previously, an unfortunate situation obtains with regard to the marts.  Road traffic is continually increasing and it is up to us to encourage the larger firms to use the railways.  If we do this, we will cut down our road maintenance costs which have increased to a tremendous degree.</P>
    <P>Deputy Dowling referred to pensioners and I should like to comment on their plight also.  There are not many of the older generation left.  The day should be long gone when a man is offered a pension of £3 or £4 per week after 40 years' service.  I appreciate that the situation has improved but much remains to be done. Having regard to the cost of living, £10 per week would be too little.  We read in the papers of a further golden handshake to a young man after leaving the service of the board, but we also have to consider what the man who joined the company in 1917 and who now draws a pension of £3 per week thinks of the situation.  It is poor consolation for 40 years' service.</P>
    <P>I should like to compliment the hotel section of CIE.  Since tourism became a vital part of our economy, CIE hotels have provided a first-class service and I should like to compliment the hotel managers on the good work they are doing.</P>
    <P>Deputy Dowling mentioned the need for sub-committees to investigate the work of semi-State bodies and referred to the fact that Ministers invariably said it was not the function of the Minister.  There is one plan about to be considered involving approximately a £27 million investment in the railway system.  A subcommittee should be established to ensure that this vast amount of money is invested properly and for the good of the people.</P>
    <P>My town is not on the list for major development and this has caused considerable <Col N="940" /> worry to the people in the area.  We are looking for industries but there has not been any consultation, through our urban council or the county development officer, to try to get industries into the district. After all our efforts it was sad to discover there was some interference with regard to the railway system that was needed for the transportation of goods.  I am not at all happy at the way the proposed plan is being considered and I would ask the Minister to ensure that a committee will be formed to investigate the spending of the £27 million.  This means a lot to rural Ireland and I hope the Minister will consider my plea for more consultation.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FlorenceCrowley" hpid="Mr. Crowley Mr. Crowley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Crowley</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Bill as other Deputies have done.  We realise the Minister will have an even tougher battle in the future to ensure that CIE as we know it remains in existence.  It is my feeling that not alone should CIE be economically viable but it should be regarded as a socially desirable State body performing a most important function.</P>
      <P>We are voting £11 million to CIE. As other Members have pointed out, our questions are disallowed when we inquire about the company.  In fact, it happened this week to Deputy Cronin and myself.  We were concerned that CIE have reduced the number of cattle wagons from Cork from 470 to 76. This is occurring at a time in the development of our country when we should be striving and straining to ensure that every source is explored to get cattle out of the country.  Yet, we have one of the major organisations adopting an attitude that can only be described as that of an ostrich with its head in the sand.  I cannot understand why CIE have taken that decision.  I know it has happened in England but that is another country.  England is highly industrialised, with very few people depending on agriculture for their livelihood but despite our development as an industrial country, agriculture is still one of our primary industries.  If we have a State body that will consciously and in a cold-blooded way make such a decision, we must take a serious look at it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="941" /> Deputy Cronin and I felt strongly about the matter and we wanted it discussed this week.  However, we were not allowed to do so.  The Ceann Comhairle can claim a precedent, and he would be right, that this has been the norm up to now but we have gone beyond that stage with semi-State bodies, especially CIE.  We must be accountable to the public for the expenditure and, accordingly, CIE must be accountable to this House.  I would support very strongly any suggestion of a committee that would investigate all semi-State bodies.  As we are talking about CIE, may I say I would specially welcome it with regard to that organisation.</P>
    <P>I would go even further.  Rather than have CIE reducing the number of cattle wagons from Cork and other areas, they should be getting involved to a greater degree in the transport of cattle.  I do not just mean within the country but also out of the country. CIE should consider the possibility of buying boats to take the cargo from this country through to England and the Continent.  Deputy Gerry Cronin and myself have been informed that there are thousands of cattle in the docks in Dublin that cannot be exported because we have no boats in which to take them out of the country. That at a time when we have a fodder crisis.  We have cattle that will inevitably die from lack of feeding and yet we have markets available to us that we cannot supply because we have not got transport out of the country.  CIE must investigate very carefully and the Minister, whose colleague, the Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries is already aware of the situation because he has received a deputation on it, would be performing a very good function for the country if he would investigate the possibility of the purchase of a boat or boats.  How can we tolerate a situation at present in which 5,000 or 6,000 cattle are hemmed in at the Dublin docks costing those who own them 30p a night to keep them there?  We have our prorities all wrong when we spend vast sums in this House and neglect the basics and the basic of any industry is the transport service that can be given to that industry.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="942" /> We must be very careful.  It is too easy to criticise management.  It is too easy to pick a fall guy when things go wrong.  It is my opinion that the management of CIE is as good as the management of any industry in the country.  They have proved it.  They have brought CIE into the twentieth century.  They have shown a very good sense of what people need.  I may not agree with every decision that has been taken.  I may not agree, for instance, with the purchase of the supertrains or that they are as comfortable as CIE claim they are. Nevertheless, they had the right motives in the purchasing of those trains.</P>
    <P>We are primarily an agricultural country.  We also derive a good proportion of our money from the tourist industry.  CIE generally are doing a fairly good job in relation to the promotion of tourism and the servicing of the tourists when they come here. My only criticism of CIE in this respect is the price of common items of food on the trains.  The whole food price structure in CIE calls for investigation because I believe a train is the dearest place in Ireland to eat. Perhaps the argument will be put up that this is the minimum price that has to be charged to make it a viable proposition but if other people in the same industry can give meals at cheaper prices CIE should look into their affairs and make sure that people are getting the best possible value.</P>
    <P>CIE will play a very important part in our development in the EEC.  Our whole transport structure will revolve mainly around CIE.  CIE will play a very important social function as well as an economic one in the sense that if we can give proper services to industry in rural Ireland, in other words, make CIE transport available to those rural areas we will have people establishing industries in rural Ireland thereby ensuring that we do not have the sort of mess that Deputy Dowling and others have been talking about&mdash;traffic jams that last for hours, a public that is not getting the service it is entitled to and employees in CIE who are absolutely frustrated <Col N="943" /> working in the conditions in which they must work in Dublin.  It is important that all rural areas be served as frequently as possible by CIE.  In that way we will attract industry to rural areas thereby keeping the people there instead of clogging up the cities.  This is where CIE can perform their most important function. It is very difficult to attract an industrialist to a remote rural area if there is not a transport service available. CIE may say that when the industrialists come they will consider providing the service but I believe CIE should provide the services first.  The rural bus service is a paying proposition and is subsidising, indeed, the losses incurred in the Dublin city bus service.</P>

      <P>Anyway it subsidised it up to now.  The Minister must give careful consideration to the functions of CIE.  I am not all that happy that everything is being done that should be done.  We need the Minister's backing in this House and the backing of the Cabinet to have a committee established to investigate the affairs of CIE and to ensure that their accountability is adequate and to ensure that the money we pass here on their behalf is spent in the best interests of the tax-payers. Ultimately we must account for our stewardship to the taxpayer. While CIE are endeavouring to give a good service and, indeed, on the whole have been giving a very good service, so many things have combined to take away from that good service that the <Col N="944" /> goodwill originally generated by these schemes has been eroded.</P>
      <P>The Minister must be as concerned as we are about the apparent complete breakdown in communications between management and the trade unions.  It is very hard for an outsider to understand why solutions are not arrived at either before or immediately on the threat of a strike, solutions which will ultimately be arrived at anyway whether it takes a week, two weeks, ten weeks or ten months.  The people who suffer most as a result of strikes are the poorer sections of the community. They are the real sufferers because, in the fixing of a strike, one can be sure that in the increased payments granted account is taken of the earnings lost by CIE workers during the strike.  If we could instil a sense of public spirit into both workers and management, if we could convince them that a strike must be the very last weapon and not the first, as would seem to be the case in some of the strikes that have occurred, the position might be very different.  I do not know how the Minister could ensure this evolution but the officials of his Department should set their minds to working out an adequate scheme whereby, in the event of an impending strike, some sort of stay could be put on and some sort of emergency measures brought into operation for a period of two or three weeks during which to have full discussions.  In the event of the discussions not being fruitful then, of course, one is faced with the inevitability of a strike.</P>
      <P>I believe that overall CIE are doing a reasonably good job.  Their management is very adequate, as I said. Certainly, the personnel whom I know in Cork&mdash;the Minister knows them too &mdash;are doing a professional job, endeavouring all the time to acquire up-to-date knowledge and training in order to carry out their jobs more efficiently.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="VivionDeValera" hpid="Major de Valera Major de Valera">
      <NameTxt>Major de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>There is one significant passage in the Minister's speech which was, perhaps, overlooked in the other generalities.  The Minister stated:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The latest estimate of CIE's net deficit for the current nine-month financial period ending 31st December, <Col N="945" /> 1974, is £13.95 million.  Of this amount, £9.25 million has already been met by way of subvention payments to CIE, the necessary provision having been made in the Estimates for my Department. The main reason for the excess of £4.7 million in the board's deficit over the Estimates provision was the decision of the Government to ameliorate the impact of the July, 1974, increases in CIE rates and fares by limiting the increases in Dublin city bus and suburban rail fares and provincial city and town bus fares to 20 per cent, instead of the 33 per cent increase proposed by CIE and approved by the National Prices Commission.  This, combined with a delay of three months in the implementation of the increases, resulted in a reduction of an estimated £3.3 million in the anticipated yield from the increased charges.</P>
    <P>Another significant factor is also mentioned, namely, the nine-week bus strike.  Now here is an example of one-sided remedies applied to meet an inflationary situation.  There is a lesson for us here.  One can find other examples in the record of the Prices Commission.  They had approved the proposal made by CIE.  The lesson is that, provided the scheme is found to be justifiable, provided the body making the claim is justified in making it, and that can be ascertained on the case made&mdash;it is usually based on the inflation in the cost of labour or materials&mdash;then it is worse than futile to reduce the award below what is necessary and it only compounds the difficulty by delaying the granting of it.  In this case you have a typical example of what may be occurring in other areas where certain action is taken, possibly through an anxiety to control prices, possibly because of political necessity and possibly from political motives; in the end one is faced with a more difficult position, with a complete inability to cope and with having to find the money eventually. CIE asked for an increase, which appeared to have been justified.  It was passed by the Prices Commission.  It was then deliberately reduced and <Col N="946" /> delayed.  What was the net result?  The net result is the inflating of what was £9 million up to £13 million, less whatever was affected by the strike.</P>
    <P>This is a very good example of the need for co-ordinating everything. The Minister for Industry and Commerce has appropriately joined his colleague, but I am afraid I shall not be able to repeat for his benefit what I have just been arguing.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PeterBarry" hpid="Mr. P. Barry Mr. P. Barry">

      <NameTxt>Major de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>I refer him to the relevant passage in the Minister's speech and to the dangers and difficulties inevitably consequent upon evasive action, because that is really what it is when an essential price increase is cut down and delayed.  That does not solve the problem.  That kind of action can only solve the problem if the increase was in itself unjustified and the Prices Commission are concreases are justified that the Minister and the prices commission are concerned. I take this opportunity of pointing out the trap involved in that particular kind of approach in the case of a public body.  That is the first point.</P>
      <P>I should like to make a point in reference to what Deputy Crowley said and another in regard to semi-State bodies as a whole.  But they must be deferred.  I should like to join in asking for the understanding of this House for the difficulties of the Minister, the House and the management of CIE.  Over a large number of years there have been very difficult problems indeed.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Faulkner</NameTxt>
      <P>I move:</P>
      <P>That Dáil Éireann deplores the failure of the Government to protect the footwear industry in this country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Seldom in this country has an industry faced such serious problems as those which are facing the footwear industry at present.  I am not overtec <Col N="947" /> reacting to the situation when I say that whole sections of the industry are in grave danger of collapse, with a resultant loss of thousands of jobs. The protest parade by the boot and shoe operatives on Friday last underlines the very disturbed state of the industry and, incidentally, the workers in the footwear industry are not noted for taking precipitate action.</P>
    <P>For quite a few months now it has been apparent to everyone, but very particularly to the workers in the footwear industry and to Deputies in whose constituencies boot factories are situated, such as mine, that the situation is serious in the extreme and that, unless urgent action is taken in the rapidly deteriorating circumstances, not only will those working in the factories lose their employment, but many others engaged in ancillary employment will also be out of work, and the economy in the areas where these factories are situated will be very severely shaken. There are some areas where the boot factory is the main source of employment and its closure would simply mean the end of all hope in such areas.</P>
    <P>During these past months Deputies on this side of the House have been endeavouring to impress on the Minister for Industry and Commerce the gravity of the situation but, apart from agreeing that there is a problem and generally playing around with words in an attempt to excuse his lack of initiative and effort, the Minister has done nothing.  If we were to analyse the answers to questions on this subject, and particularly to supplementary questions, we could only reach the conclusion that he has done little research on this whole problem and that he does not properly appreciate what is involved.</P>
    <P>When one remembers that he was not only pressed on this matter here in the House by us, but that he also had a number of meetings with the footwear manufacturers and with the Irish Shoe and Leather Workers' Union, one finds it difficult to understand why he has not got a true appreciation of the position.  When one finds that he very often lacks, in his brief, <Col N="948" /> relevant information sought by Deputies, one can only conclude that he simply does not understand the seriousness of the situation and, therefore, has not got the necessary determination and urge to take the steps which are very necessary and very urgent to overcome the problems involved.</P>
    <P>Lack of decision has been the great failing of previous Coalition Governments and the same applies to this Government, but it is a particular failing of the Minister for Industry and Commerce, whether it relates to price control, to mining policy, to off-shore oil and gas policy, to the textile industry, or to the footwear industry, or whatever.  At this stage, when very urgent and very important decisions must be made on which the continued employment of so many people depends, it is a calamitous failing.  If this industry is to survive, decisions must be made at once.  The decisions are not easy ones.  No decision reaching a Minister's desk ever is easy.  As a former holder of office, I can assure the Minister that the problems will not go away because he refuses to tackle them, or because he tries to ignore them.  In the present situation, it is nothing short of criminal for him to sit there in what might be termed a state of masterly inactivity while more and more boot and shoe operatives are lengthening the queues outside the employment exchanges.</P>
    <P>I admit that the Minister is a skilled debater and that his ability at times in debate to adroitly turn the tables on his adversaries appears to rate high with certain sections of the media, but I would advise him that he will be judged not on his facility with words but rather on his performance as Minister.  I do not say this in a personal way&mdash;I abhor being personal&mdash;but rather to underline&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="JustinKeating" hpid="Mr. Keating Mr. Keating">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PadraigFaulkner" hpid="Mr. Faulkner Mr. Faulkner">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Faulkner</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;the reaction on both sides of the footwear industry to their meetings with him when they described those meetings as cordial but totally unproductive.  The Minister should be aware that, for the past 18 months, the footwear industry has been plagued by the twin evils of <Col N="949" /> redundancy and short-time working to the extent that the foundation of the industry is being seriously undermined. Unemployment coupled with short-time working means low output, and low output ultimately results in an industry passing the point of no return and being no longer viable.</P>
      <P>Over this 18-month period I have been speaking of, hundreds of workers have become redundant in the footwear industry.  Few factories have escaped.  The plight of the people concerned, and of their dependants, is grave, facing life, as they are, in a world of escalating prices on a considerably reduced income, a situation which will become worse in the months ahead as those involved are only too well aware.  At least the transition from employment to unemployment is cushioned by redundancy payments and by pay related benefits both of which, of course, were introduced by a Fianna Fáil Government.  They are cushioned at the beginning of the unemployment period.</P>
      <P>The loss to the economy in the various towns and to the economy of the country generally is tremendous. The country cannot afford the loss of valuable skills developed over many years.  During the same period, most of the factories in which there were redundancies had also short-time working for months on end.  Some of the short-time working was little better than total unemployment. Taken together, both the redundancies and the short-time working triggered off unemployment in many other areas because of the loss of the purchasing power of the boot and shoe operatives.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Clearly then, it is vitally important that action should be taken by the Minister immediately if this deteriorating situation is to be halted.  The main cause of the problem is the vast increase in footwear imports generally. One has only to note the regular and rapid increase in the number of pairs of shoes imported over recent years, both as regards volume and value, to see that the home market is in the course of being eroded.  When one compares the relatively much slower <Col N="950" /> increase in our exports of footwear, it is easy to understand why the industry is in difficulties.  Because the circumstances in which certain factories find themselves might be different, their reactions to solutions may also be different. Nevertheless, it is recognised by all that the enormous increase in imports of footwear is the key problem.</P>
    <P>Some years ago exports of Irish produced footwear were approximately five times greater than imports.  There were 1,522,000 pairs exported as compared with 309,000 pairs imported, but this year it is estimated that the volume of exports of footwear will be less than the imports.  The comparison between the two situations underlines the gravity of the position.  A great problem is the importation of footwear from low cost countries, whether direct or indirect.  Some time ago it was felt by management that these imports would not constitute a danger to home produced products because of the fact that the quality of the Irish footwear was much superior.  The belief that low cost goods would not pose a threat is not the reality of the situation as the latest import figures show.</P>
    <P>The Minister, when speaking at the Shoe Fair, departed from his script and promised to do something about imports from low cost countries.  When I raised the matter in this House and asked the Minister what action he had taken since then he endeavoured to put a different interpretation on his words. Whatever the actual words used and whatever the literal interpretation of these words might be, the fact is that he gave an impression which was universally understood by both sides to mean that he proposed to take action in relation to low cost footwear and to take it soon.  Nothing has happened since.  I hope the Minister will let us know what action he proposes to take. I hope his decision will not come too late.</P>
    <P>The danger which arises at this late stage is whether, if a Minister makes a decision with regard to the import of low cost shoes, the industry generally, and the individual factories concerned, will be able to gear themselves to meet the increased demand.  I have been informed that certain orders are not <Col N="951" /> being placed with home manufacturers pending a decision by the Minister.  If the Minister's decision is delayed to a point where it is too late to enable the factories to cope then the fault will lie with the Minister although this will be of little consolation for the workers who will continue to swell the ranks of the unemployed.</P>
    <P>The real urgency can be seen from the fact that in 1973 the home production was 7.6 million pairs of which 3.1 million pairs were exported.  In addition, 4.2 million pairs were imported. The total market consumption was 8.7 million pairs.  The fact that 4.2 million pairs were imported in 1973 gives imports 48 per cent of the home market.  In 1974 the import figure is approximately 5.5 million pairs.  If the size of the home market remains constant and exports maintain their stability, then the share of the home market taken by imports rises from 48 per cent in 1973 to approximately 64 per cent in 1974.</P>
    <P>The first demand of the manufacturers and of the union is that all exports from outside the EEC be stopped.  In the light of all the circumstances it is not a request that the Minister can lightly brush aside.  Undoubtedly, it will present some difficulty for him but it is his task to overcome these difficulties. When I raised the matter of low-cost countries the Minister replied that he was aware that some low-cost countries were producing footwear and added that there was a tariff on such imports.  Nobody knows better than the Minister the total inadequacy of tariffs in this situation.  If a pair of shoes can be produced in Hong Kong or Korea at 50p per pair because of low wages and poor working conditions and if a tariff of 100 per cent is placed on them, it simply raised the price of the shoes to £1, A tariff of 100 per cent would be regarded as a high tariff but in these circumstances it does not make the slightest change in the competitiveness of the imports <i>vis-ávis</i> the home-produced shoe.  It has no effect at all.</P>
    <P>I suggested in this House that the dutiable quota system, based on, for example, the year 1972, was the only system which could be effective <Col N="952" /> because it gives to the Minister the power to control the volume of imports. I would remind the Minister that some years ago due to an international agreement when Ireland was obliged to change from the quota restriction to tariff protection, the Fianna Fáil Government negotiated on the matter and continued to provide quota protection for footwear for a further two years until the difficulties which faced the industry had abated.  There is no reason why the Minister cannot follow this example in this serious situation.</P>
    <P>The Minister could point out to those concerned that a vital sector of our economy is in jeopardy and that we must, if only for a time, apply the dutiable quota system of protection to avoid a complete breakdown.  This would enable the Minister to control matters in a vital area while not doing anything to injure Ireland's export prospects or our credibility in the market place.  Imports from low-cost countries, whether they are from Eastern European countries who do not buy even one pair of Irish shoes or from the Far East, are a serious threat to home-produced goods.  No effort must be spared to remove that threat while taking cognisance of the whole economic picture.</P>
    <P>I can understand the Minister's fears in relation to exports but I remind him that we must have a firm home base if we are to sell our production on the foreign market.  The footwear industry must be assured that if they are to put the necessary effort and money into development that they have a Government, and a Minister, who are prepared to make a realistic effort to help them achieve their aims.  Rationalisation is difficult to achieve in view of the size of our home market.  We can only hope to achieve this rationalisation if we can sell our products on foreign markets. To do this the footwear industry needs a breathing space because with the reduction of tariff walls abroad the time has come to utilise these benefits.  However, the import pattern has developed far too quickly.  Time is needed and the home market must be protected to the extent that it will provide a worthwhile base for future exports by our industry.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="953" /> I have a number of questions down to the Minister as to whether he referred any aspect of the importation of footwear to An Bord Dumpála. There are many reports of shoes being imported at prices and in quantities which must give rise to suspicion that these goods are being dumped here.  They do not necessarily come directly from countries outside the EEC, although in some instances they do.  In some instances it is known that they enter this country through the United Kingdom.  I should like to know if the Minister has heard of this and if he has carried out any investigation. I am aware of the fact that in 1973 An Bord Dumpála investigated complaints of dumping from Czechoslovakia in relation to men's working boots and that some action was taken.  However, a complaint was made to me that the process took a long time.  I have been informed that it took the board a considerable time to reach their conclusions and make a decision.  In normal circumstances we could overlook the length of time taken because the effect of dumping in such circumstances, provided it was ultimately stopped, might not have grave consequences but we are now receiving reports of further redundancies and short-time working being introduced and because of this any delay can be of catastrophic proportions.</P>
    <P>Those people laid off initially because of dumping activities are unlikely to regain their employment.  Therefore, the length of time taken to investigate dumping is of vital significance.  If An Bord Dumpála are reasonably sure that dumping is taking place, I would ask the Minister whether they have power to restrict or stop imports while the investigation is taking place.  If they have not got such power, would the Minister be willing to make it available to them?  I am aware that An Bord Dumpála could not of its own accord initiate an investigation even where it had received information from the Revenue Commissioners that there was a likelihood that dumping is taking place. Therefore, I would suggest that if An Bord Dumpála comes into <Col N="954" /> possession of such information it should immediately inform the Minister so that in turn he could request them to initiate an investigation.  An Bord Dumpála have the statutory right to seek information in regard to dumping from the Revenue Commissioners. I would be interested to know in prevailing circumstances when the footwear industry is being beleaguered by imports from many and varied countries, if An Bord Dumpála have made inquiries as to whether the Commissioners are suspicious of any of those imports; in other words, that An Bord Dumpála would take the initiative themselves.</P>
    <P>Since our entry into the EEC the problems of the footwear industry increased as we knew they would to some extent.  However, conditions generally at present have enlarged those problems beyond what was anticipated. Therefore, we have to take another look at the import situation from the EEC.  The figures I have are that 83 per cent of our imports come from the United Kingdom; 12.5 per cent from other EEC countries and 4.5 per cent from countries outside the EEC.  The Anglo-Irish Free Trade Area Agreement and the EEC regulations control the import situation to quite an extent.  In regard to the Anglo-Irish Free Trade Area Agreement, I feel the Minister should consider exercising the provision in Article 19 to meet this difficult situation because of the appreciable rise in unemployment in the footwear industry.  He could also consider sections 68 and 69 in the book in relation to the accession of Ireland to the European Economic Community relating to the transitional period, and serious persistent difficulties in that section of our industry.</P>
    <P>Apart from all of this, of course, the fact is that there is not one country of the EEC, apart from our own which has not, at one time or another, broken the rules when continuation of acceptance of them meant a serious problem for the country concerned. Normally, I would not advocate the breaking of rules in any context, international or otherwise.  I fully appreciate that it would be much more advantageous for this country if all <Col N="955" /> of the countries involved adhered to the rules and changed them by unanimous consent only.  But in the present circumstances relating to our footwear industry and taking into consideration the fact that other countries of the EEC have broken the rules&mdash;some of them in relation to footwear; I am thinking here of Italy &mdash;when their vital interests were under severe strain, then I feel we have an equal right.  Provided that discussion, consultation and negotiation between the Minister and those other countries first take place and then should they be a failure, I would feel he has got to take another look at that aspect of it.  In those circumstances I do not feel the footwear industry is asking too much when it requests the Minister to restrict imports from EEC countries to an amount equal to the exports from Ireland in the preceding year.  I think it was suggested that the figure to be taken would be the import figure for the year 1973 of 3.1 million pairs.</P>
    <P>I would assume that the Minister has been having discussions with the UK and with the other EEC countries in respect of their levels of exports to Ireland at this critical time.  I noticed recently a report that the countries of the Community were to have discussions relating to the footwear industry in the EEC <i>vis-á-vis</i> imports from countries outside the EEC.  I would suggest to the Minister that side by side with those discussions he should discuss the problems of exports from the UK and other countries in the EEC to this country; firstly, exports which are home-produced within the EEC countries and, secondly, exports to this country from EEC countries which are first imported into the EEC countries and then exported here.</P>
    <P>When talking about breaking agreements, we might very well remember that, even though the Anglo-Irish free trade area agreement did not under its terms permit an import deposit scheme, the British Government had no hesitation, on two occasions&mdash;if my memory serves me right &mdash;in imposing import restrictions on exports from this country to the <Col N="956" /> United Kingdom despite our protests.</P>
    <P>I should like now to ask the Minister what he proposes doing to encourage Irish people to buy Irish footwear, or at least to give first preference to Irish footwear.  This is the other side of our defence of employment in the footwear industry.  In addressing myself to that point I have already been considering the means by which we could reduce the pressures of foreign made footwear on the home market.  I should like briefly to discuss the prospect of improving the sales of Irish footwear on the home market because that aspect of the matter would help considerably in improving the situation in the industry here.  There are about 8.7 million pairs sold on the home market and, as I have already said, in 1973 4.2 million pairs were imported.  In 1974 it is estimated that the import figure will be approximately 5.6 million pairs.  That figure of over 5 million pairs is itself not much below the total Irish production of footwear for 1974. Obviously, if home production were to regain a reasonable proportion of the market, now taken over by imports, that would give a considerable boost to the industry and very particularly to the morale of those involved in it. How to achieve that is the main question.  I feel it is not sufficient for the Minister simply to make speeches requesting the people to buy Irish&mdash; and pointing out the consequences of not doing so.  First of all, he has to be seen to be serious in this matter by taking decisions necessary to protect the industry from without, decisions which, as I said before, nobody pretends are easy but which must be taken if we are not only to halt the unfortunate decline all too apparent but also to develop the industry.</P>
    <P>I have little faith in purely holding operations.  To succeed I believe it essential that the industry be geared to expansion.  The &ldquo;Buy Irish&rdquo; slogan has been used so often and to so little effect, relatively speaking, in the long term that cynics might tend to scoff at it.  Nevertheless, we must re-think the whole matter because despite all the problems involved, despite the relative lack of success in <Col N="957" /> the past, the fundamental idea of focusing the people's attention on giving first preference to Irish goods in a small country such as ours, is a very sound one.  We must bring fresh minds to bear on the development of the idea, to produce new ideas, new methods of presentation which are in keeping with modern trends and which can make an impact on the buying public.  Success in this matter means winning back a portion of that part of the Irish market now controlled by imports of foreign footwear. In my belief this in turn will establish what I feel to be a matter of vital importance&mdash;a firm base so essential to the development of our exports.  I feel the professional touch is necessary here.  We could well be on our way to success in this matter were we to succeed in involving those in the retail trade to a greater extent, by persuading them by convincing arguments that it is in their own best interest as well as that of the nation as a whole to sell Irish footwear.</P>
    <P>Looking at the matter objectively, I think it is asking too much of the hard-pressed housewife to concentrate on buying Irish goods at all times, if she is left without any guidance on this matter when she goes out to shop. It would of course be nice if she would do so and no doubt there are some people in this so-called affluent society who could without placing any great strain on themselves do this, but we know from experience that it is asking possibly too much of human nature and therefore our best hope lies in convincing the retailer that he has a special part to play in the presentation and display of Irish goods. Quality and price of course play a particular part.</P>
    <P>Let me say to their credit that the majority of our shopkeepers do their best and this goes also for some of the large stores but we know only too well that the big profit margin is the sole objective of some.  These people are not short of excuses when challenged but there is no hiding the basic reason.  I therefore suggest to the Minister that he should concern himself at once with a very thorough investigation of the profit margin on <Col N="958" /> footwear, particularly footwear coming in from low-cost countries.  I can remember a case some years ago of a large newly-opened footwear shop in Dublin which had its window full of foreign-made shoes and only a few pairs of Irish shoes.  A friend of mine employed in the management side of a boot factory in my constituency saw this and at a seminar of leather workers later asked the employees of the shop who were at the seminar why they pushed the sale of these foreign shoes, to be told that they got a bonus from their employers for so doing.  To put it mildly, the shortsightedness of these employers' policy appals me.  Do such people not realise that to continue in this vein could cause the collapse of the shoe industry and that the workers who are their customers would no longer be able to buy from them?</P>
    <P>From the figures available, it would appear that the supermarkets are the worst offenders, buying 2.4 million pairs from abroad out of a total of 5.6 million pairs imported and getting a large proportion of these by bulk buying, I understand, of low-cost footwear. I do not wish&mdash;again it would be unfair of me if I were to do so&mdash; to put all the supermarkets in the same category.  Some do their best, but it is heartbreaking to go into many of them in the city and see the enormous consignments of foreign-made shoes on offer.  How can we expect the ordinary housewife, with very limited time at her disposal, to go poking around a store packed with foreign goods in order to buy an Irish product? How can we expect young people, who are now an important factor in the business world because of their purchasing power, to concern themselves to buy Irish products when they find themselves in some large stores surrounded by imported goods? On second thoughts, perhaps it is at the level of our younger people that we should now direct our attention. We need to get across to our young people that to buy Irish is not only the essence of patriotism but the surest path to a worthwhile future for themselves.  We might take example from the commercial advertisers who <Col N="959" /> undoubtedly get their case across to the youth, not in the old arid way which means little in modern society but in a way which will get a positive reaction.  I commend to the Minister that he take particular note of that point.</P>
    <P>To sum up, home production from 1972 has dropped from 7.6 million pairs to 7 million pairs in 1974.  Imports have increased from 3.3 million pairs in 1972 to 5.6 million pairs in 1974. This is an almost unbelievable increase. Imports from the United Kingdom during that period increased from 2,720,000 pairs to five million pairs approximately, an increase which I feel would give rise to some suspicion of dumping which I think should be investigated. During the same period, imports from the EEC increased from 600,000 pairs to 700,000 pairs and from countries outside the EEC, from 100,000 to 280,000 pairs.  In relation to this last situation, that is, the imports from the low-cost countries outside the EEC, the increase is also exceptional and even more important, it appears to be a pointer to the problems which can develop in this area when the footwear industry in the countries concerned becomes fully developed.</P>
    <P>We have dropped our share of the home market from 52 per cent in 1973 to 40 per cent, or even lower, in 1974. It was recognised that in the context of the Common Market, we would lose out to some extent on the home market, but the lowest figure thought possible at that time was about 50 per cent. Our latest figure indicates the dangerous plight the industry finds itself in and the Minister will agree that the industry will find it very difficult to develop what we need most, a worthwhile export business in footwear, if the home market continues to deteriorate at the rapid rate it has done in quite recent times.  This highly intensive labour content industry must get a breathing space for quite a considerable period to get used to a higher rate of imports.  There is an urgent and grave need for rationalisation to meet the changes from the quota system in the sixties to the expiration of the duties in the seventies.  Firms are faced with <Col N="960" /> more redundancy this year and two are faced with imminent closure.</P>
    <P>From the figures I have given it will be seen that imports from the United Kingdom are quite a considerable problem and I would feel that from a danger point of view imports from countries outside the EEC constitute a very real danger.  If one takes cognisance of our relatively tiny population, it can be clearly seen that it takes a very small increase in imports to have catastrophic effects on the industry here.  From any research I have done into the matter I am convinced that given the time and given the assistance, both in finance and control of imports to which the industry is entitled from the State, we have the ability to rationalise production. Our boot and shoe operatives are highly skilled and if proof were needed of this, one has only to note the interest of manufacturers of footwear in other European countries in our labour force.</P>
    <P>Let the Minister make his decision at once so that orderly development can proceed, something which will be entirely frustrated if redundancy and short-time working continue, resulting in the scattering of our work force.  In making his decision, it is vital that the take particular cognisance of the proposals put before him by the Irish Shoe and Leather Workers' Union and by management.  I am convinced that this industry which is vital to the economy for the employment it gives and its contribution to our balance of payments, can be restored and developed and our boot and shoe operatives employment secured.</P>
    <P>Finally I would refer again to the continued and rapid loss which is being experienced by the industry in their share of the home market.  In 1971 the Irish share of the home market was 65 per cent, in 1972, 56 per cent, in 1973, 52 per cent and in 1974, 40 per cent.  The Minister will agree that this is an extremely rapid decline in the proportion of the home market.  It is something that will have an extremely severe effect on the industry in general because, as I pointed out before, if we are to develop the shoe industry it will be necessary to <Col N="961" /> develop exports but it will not be possible for us to expand without having that share of the home market that is essential as a firm base to exports.</P>
    <P>I appeal to the Minister to make a decision at once.  There is nothing worse for any industry than uncertainty.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JustinKeating" hpid="Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. Keating) Justin Keating">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. Keating)</NameTxt>
      <P>I find myself in two minds as to what tone to reply in because at certain stages of Deputy Faulkner's speech I was provoked to assail his position extremely vigorously. At certain moments I got the impression that there was an element of knock-about.  In one breath the Deputy said that my behaviour is nothing short of criminal and soon afterwards he said he does not like to be personal.  I thought that perhaps the line to take would be to mock what he said but then he went on to say serious things.  Whatever way this problem is approached by speakers, it remains a serious one.  Later, during the Deputy's speech I considered my own position to be sustained and helped for reasons that will emerge as I continue.  I would beg the Deputy to remain, if not for all of what I have to say, at least for the first part of my reply because I wish to make clear the legal position under which I am functioning and which he does not appear to understand fully.</P>
      <P>Having talked of the legal position I shall go on to put some statistics on the record.  I want to tell the House and the country what is the position at this moment and then I shall comment on what Deputy Faulkner has said.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I shall begin by indicating clearly the legal position under which we are functioning.  Deputy Faulkner and many other Deputies may not be aware of what is the legal position.  The remarks I shall make now will be made much more coolly than I had intended when the Deputy had been five minutes into his speech.  We are functioning under a legal position resulting from our signing the Accession Treaty.  We are functioning under legal disabilities which were negotiated by the Opposition while they were in Government <Col N="962" /> and the dangers of which were told to them very clearly but which dangers they pooh-poohed totally lightheartedly. They subverted some of the agencies of the State to propagate at public expense this totally lighthearted and irresponsible version of what our legal commitments would be in regard to protecting our weaker industries, industries which, for a decade, we had known were under threat.</P>
    <P>Legally, in the matter of imposing restrictions on imports we, nationally, are not free agents.  By provisions of the Treaty and by the Act of Accession we are precluded from imposing new financial burdens on imports, either from the EEC or from non-member countries.  I refer to Articles 12 to 14 and to section 2 of Chapter 1, part II of the Treaty of Rome and to Articles 32, 36, 39, 42 and 59 of the Act of Accession.</P>
    <P>These provisions preclude in the first place the imposition of new financial burdens and, secondly, they prohibit quantitative restrictions as between member States.  I know that Deputy Faulkner recognises that difficulty to some extent but he did not seem to recognise it fully when he talked of the idea of breaking the rules.  He said that normally he would not advocate this line but he mentioned that other countries had done so.  Certainly, he flirted with the idea of repudiating our commitment.  I will talk about that because it is something that must be talked of.  There is a certain irony two years on in the demands from the Opposition benches that the Government break the rules which that Opposition at the time negotiated and brainwashed the people into accepting very lightheartedly without understanding the dangerous ramifications involved. Although Deputy Faulkner made a serious speech, he could have been more honest by talking about the role of the EEC.  It was rather late in his whole presentation that he referred to that subject.  It is thinkable but not lightly so that we would break the rules but the effect of such action would have to be weighed very carefully. Deputy Faulkner has the privilege of opposition in that he can be more lighthearted in regard to suggestions <Col N="963" /> of that kind than we can be.</P>
    <P>The only scope for departure from our contractual obligations to the EEC is that provided, first, by Articles 108 and 109 of the Rome Treaty. These articles can be invoked in a balance of payments crisis.  Therefore, should we decide that a balance of payments crisis exists we could invoke these articles but such a measure would have ramifications of a very profound kind on our whole financial system, on the relationship of international financial institutions to us and on our relationship with countries with which we trade both within the Community and outside it.  I assure the Deputy that such a step would not be taken lightly.</P>
    <P>Article 135 of the Act of Accession deals with economic difficulties in certain sectors but it is well that we would understand clearly what the legal position is in that regard.  I am talking now to the whole industry and not only to Deputies on any side of the House.  From the sources available to me I must put on record the sort of situation that faces our footwear industry.  There was the removal of the quota in 1970.  That was under the EFTA.  Since 1970 we have had a very dramatic taking-over of our home market, starting before we were members of the Community and accelerating since our accession.  In 1969 imports accounted for 12 per cent of the home market, in 1970, 19.4 per cent, in 1971, 29.2 per cent, in 1972, 37.2 per cent, in 1973, 45 per cent and this year the best estimate we had is a little more than 60 per cent, not as high as the 67 per cent that has been quoted but a little higher than the 60 per cent that Deputy Faulkner said&mdash;a very dramatic taking-over of our home market by imports.</P>
    <P>I think it fair to put on the record the countries from which these imports are coming.  I shall not give the figures for as long a period but for 1972, 1973 and the first half of 1974. In 1972 of the imports the UK sent 77 per cent, the other EEC countries 6.6 per cent and the non-EEC countries 16.4 per cent.  That was the share of imports of the different inputting <Col N="964" /> countries.  Let me simply say that for the first half of this year the UK imports had declined to 74.5 per cent. This is pairage and not value.  The non-EEC countries had declined from 16.4 per cent to 11.7 per cent but the other EEC countries, not UK, not Ireland, the other seven, had gone from 6.6 per cent in 1972 to 13.8 per cent in the first half of this year, more than doubling in that period which, indeed, is the period since we joined the Community.</P>
    <P>It is worth nothing in parenthesis that though the Korean situation is potentially very dangerous and it is very dangerous currently in other sorts of production, in regard to footwear &mdash;I make that distinction between footwear and textiles and clothing&mdash; Korean imports of footwear are very small, indeed, at this time though potentially very threatening.  That is the circumstance in regard to the actual statistics of what has been happening to the industry and I share Deputy Faulkner's and all Deputies' concern as to the profound seriousness of the situation that those figures reveal.</P>
    <P>I want to say now something about what I called originally the current state of the situation, what has happened so far, and I would say in parenthesis that I have often heard Ministers reproached with using the media rather than using the House for saying what they are doing.  I could have floated off various things at various times in the past and I could to some extent have headed off certain criticisms today on the basis of releasing to the media what I am now going to say but I did think it was useful to have certainly Deputy Faulkner's speech and other speeches from the Opposition benches and this is the place, where possible.  It is not always possible.  Where possible, this is the place to talk about ministerial action if there is a choice in the matter.</P>
    <P>I have made it clear that our choice is to operate our contractual agreements, Treaty of Rome and Accession Act, or to break them.  That is the choice and we will talk a bit about the ramifications of breaking them in a minute but it is prudent first to <Col N="965" /> proceed along the basis of not breaking them but trying to make them work because breaking them gets pretty serious.  Apart from the ongoing intervention, the core of the matter is not in Dublin or London or any of those places, the core of the matter is, in fact, in Brussels. Deputies may like that or not like it but that is the truth of it.  I think Deputy Faulkner accepted that to some extent when he talked about thinking about breaking our obligation. But, of the total Commission I personally have seen and put the case to five of the Commission, to all of the Commissioners involved with this area and my staff have had ongoing meetings with the appropriate people at Commission level on two separate subject.  You will see from the statistics that the really rapidly expanding area is the area of imports from EEC countries, non-UK, but there is also a worry about imports from outside the Community and there is a worry about what the UK does in our market as well.  All three of them are important but the rapidly expanding one is the rest of the EEC.</P>
    <P>I am authorised by Commissioner Gundelach, who is the responsible man, to say&mdash;and while I cannot be satisfied, very far from it, with the position, it is fair to say and I will indicate the case in a minute&mdash;it is well that it is on the record of the House&mdash;that we have been making to Brussels&mdash;now that we have received a certain at least understanding of that case and the measure of that understanding is that Commissioner Gundelach has set up a Commission task force to look specifically, not simply at footwear, but at three threatened industries&mdash;this debate is about footwear&mdash;but three threatened industries in Ireland.  There is a special Commission task force in existence which will be in Ireland next week which has already received submissions.</P>
    <P>We may complain, as we all have complained in Opposition and, indeed, I complain in Government about the rate at which Government functions in a country this size.  Deputies on all sides will know that Community institutions function slowly also and in <Col N="966" /> some cases more slowly and irritatingly slowly.</P>
    <P>We, of course, also raised the question as other countries have raised it over some time of imports from outside the Community and we have made clear our dissatisfaction with the expected time of decision in regard to third-country imports into the Community. I cannot anticipate action.  I cannot anticipate the decisions of the Community, but I think it fair to say that they recognise the urgency and while they have not given promises we must hope for something more rapidly than their original timetable which I think would not have involved action until, perhaps, early spring because they understand it is more urgent.</P>
    <P>I cannot prejudge exactly what package will be offered to Ireland by this task force going back and reporting to the Commission.  I cannot prejudge exactly what the Commission will do but I do assure my colleagues on all sides of the House that the core of the answer is in Brussels and not in Dublin for reasons of their making in their time in office, which we can have our opinions about.  The choice, therefore, is to make the Community work for us which it shows some signs of willingness to do &mdash;the existence of the special task force is some indication of that willingness&mdash;or else to face up to the ramifications not just for footwear but for the whole of our economy and, indeed, for other economies because our actions will be taken as a precedent, of breaking our commitments under the Act of Accession. That is the choice.  That is the reality of it, putting it pretty bluntly.  That is where it is at.</P>
    <P>I think it correct and prudent that we exhaust the first possibility first and I hope my colleagues in the House, whatever they think of the quality of my actions, will at least grant me concensus on that.  That is the nature of the action that we have been pursuing and because of the legal commitments that I quoted we must in wisdom let those processes be exhausted before we go on to consider further action.  In other words, we have to assess what comes out <Col N="967" /> and, of course, we have to work, as we have been working, that those things come out quickly.</P>
    <P>It is fair also that I should put on the record of the House the sort of things that we said in Brussels to Commissioners and to other people at senior level in the Community.  We pointed out to them firstly that we were much the smallest country of the Community. If you count it in terms of gross national product rather than in terms of individuals we are much the smallest.  The next smallest one is three times as big as us.  We are the poorest in per capita income.  I did not make a political football out of it.  I am not trying to make a political football out of it now because decisions are taken and you cannot go back to a time where your road branches and when you get up one branch it is very difficult to say that was a mistake, we will go up the other one.  I am not trying to make a political football out of the next bit but it is fair to say and I hope people will agree with me that we joined the Community with expectations which have either not been fulfilled or have only partially been fulfilled.  We have recently&mdash;by recently I mean within hours almost&mdash;had some move on a regional policy but that was late and on a scale that cannot make us too happy, to say the least of it. We had some move on social policy but not on a scale we would desire.  We have seen a commitment written into the Treaty of Rome to raising the standard of all the citizens of all member States but we have not seen that carried into effect.  We had great agricultural expectations but we are not just an agricultural country with the biggest agricultural sector of any of the Nine but we are also a livestock country.  And what happened to the price of cattle has hit not just farming but our whole economy and specifically people buying footwear.  The effect of cattle prices was greater in our country.</P>
    <P>We have pointed out the scale and the significance of the footwear sector in our economy where expressed as a percentage of the whole number employed in industry in our country it is <Col N="968" /> very large.  We have pointed out that traditionally it was a protected industry and that if it was to come through by rationalisation and modernisation to the excellence that could mean real penetration to a market of 250 million or 300 million, it had to have time, and that time was assumed in the adjustments that were negotiated at the time of accession but that we did not foresee, when that Accession Treaty was being negotiated, that there would be a recession of the kind that has happened and that has cut home and export demand.  We have had a telescoping of these difficulties.</P>
    <P>We made the point that while we were concerned about the loss of jobs, we were concerned with more than that because when you get a penetration from overseas footwear getting over 60 per cent of the market, as has happened here this year, you are not talking only about the loss of jobs but the loss of a whole sector of your economy so that when the upturn comes, as I think collectively, we believe it will come, that sector will not exist to take advantage of the upturn.</P>
    <P>I listened with some interest to what Deputy Faulkner said earlier because he was saying many of those things also; they are things anybody would say but it is useful to have them on the record now from both sides.</P>
    <P>We pointed out that since our economy is so tiny and our industry so fragmented that at times when say the Italians can push stuff into Britain, the British can use the offseason lines; they can use the last little bit of production which technically, is not dumping to push it into us, since our industry is so little and our home market so small that we can be smashed up in time of economic downturn by increasing competition in a way that the great industries of France or Britain or Italy cannot be.  I should say in fairness to the Commissioners and others to whom we spoke in Brussels that while they did not give us answers then&mdash;we have not been getting results, for example, about Korea as quickly as we would like&mdash;I got the impression that they knew what we <Col N="969" /> are saying was serious and that we were making a serious case and I think the setting up of a task force&mdash; not an unknown procedure but not a normal one&mdash;was an index to the fact that at least we were being listened to with a willingness to have the situation investigated.</P>
    <P>I want to refer to the meeting I had with both sides of the industry on, I think, 15th March, because some of the proposals they made are practical and are being acted on.  They know that on some of them which are being acted on, I am not free to comment.  Some of them without breaking our treaty agreement cannot be acted on unless we get agreement from the Commission which then recommends it to all the other countries. But a ban or a limitation on imports from non-EEC countries is not possible without Commission approval and recommendation, without breaking the Treaty.  The same applies to any 5 per cent import deposit and to any departure from the rate of liberalisation of trade.  The questions that they raised about VAT are being investigated but that is not in my Department.</P>
    <P>Deputy Faulkner also referred to control of margins and this has been explored vigorously but the difficulty there is the difficulty of implementation which is a real one.  It is a matter of finding ways to make it more effective and that is being vigorously pursued.</P>
    <P>Deputy Faulkner made me cross at the beginning for reasons I have tried to indicate.  I deny that I do not appreciate the difficulties; I believe I do. I deny that I have done nothing.  I deny most firmly that my actions are nothing short of criminal.  I deny that it is a fair characterisation to describe as masterly inactivity the sort of thing I have been saying here.  We are faced with a decision which Deputy Faulkner to some extent began to face.  Either we make the Community institutions work for us which we were and are doing as vigorously as we can or else we look at the matter of breaking our agreement.  I have not been saying that we are doing this or that in the Community because I do not like raising <Col N="970" /> hopes in regard to the actions of other people whom I cannot control but when Deputy Faulkner says that I, as Minister for Industry and Commerce, must make a decision about low cost imports, a decision of the immediate type for which he calls is not my decision. The legal position, as I have tried to put it on record indicates that is the situation.  If it is a matter of breaking our obligation under the Act of Accession that is not a matter for me, as the Deputy knows; it is a matter for the Government and a rather serious one. Many of the things he said I must do as Minister for Industry and Commerce I would love to do and my failure to do them arises not from indifference, ignorance, or lack of desire but because it is not legally possible under the Act of Accession.  I regret it. Therefore, to belabour me for failing to take decisions that I cannot legally take is, it seems, unjust.</P>
    <P>Deputy Faulkner said that he would not normally advocate the breaking of rules but all the different countries at different times&mdash;I think he said&mdash;had broken the rules, not always about footwear but in one way or another.  Italy got itself into and is in a desperate crisis.  It took a unilateral action which was subsequently validated by the European institutions but at a terrible cost to Italy&mdash;at the cost of international agencies forcing on Italy a series of actions which produced the resignation of the Government and a tremendous political crisis.  If that was the sequence of events Deputy Faulkner wanted, I could understand it but it would not be the best way to solve the problem.</P>

      <P>Anything could happen anywhere.  If we are to break treaty obligations, important as one sector may be it involves the whole of our economic position and it is not lightly done.  It is only done after all the legal channels have been exhausted.  We are following those legal channels with all the vigour available to us.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have not time to refer to points raised by Deputy Faulkner about An Coimisiún Dumpála.  Perhaps I may <Col N="971" /> have a word with him privately or I can get other speakers on this side to refer to them.  There was another matter on which I found myself in complete agreement with the Deputy. There is a tradition of cynicism about &ldquo;Buy Irish&rdquo; campaign but if ever there was a time for such a campaign this is one.  We have been thinking about the matter to try to get participation from outside by social groups not merely be exhortation.  The planning is reasonably well advanced and on next Wednesday morning we will be able to launch formally something that is reasonably well planned, which is realistic and involves wide sectors on the question of &ldquo;Buy Irish&rdquo;.  I agree with the Deputy that we would be utterly wrong to be cynical about the matter because it has an important contribution to make.</P>
    <P>I realise I have not answered all the matters raised.  I will try to see that other speakers on this side do so before the debate ends.</P>

      <P>I come from an area that is deeply concerned with the shoe industry.  I do not intend to attack the Minister; I only want something positive done to help a serious situation that is affecting every shoe factory. I am alarmed at the imports from Korea, Hong Kong and areas outside the EEC.  Some of the shoes are coming in at a cost of 80p and some traders are stamping them made in Ireland.  This is a serious matter and one about which I feel very strongly.  What is happening is that new padding is put on the shoes and they are re-labelled &ldquo;Made in Ireland&rdquo;. I do not know how we can compete against these people but we will have to do something about the matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister referred to the legal position that exists as far as our membership of the EEC is concerned.  I realise this but how many other countries have broken the rules when it suited them?  The Minister may say we cannot do that but if something is not done for a number of factories closure is inevitable.  A factory cannot remain open for two or three days <Col N="972" /> per week and pay its overheads.  It is not on, as any businessman will tell the Minister.</P>
    <P>We should consider the broader issues of the footwear industry.  There is a necessity for a comprehensive policy with regard to this industry. Millions of pounds worth of cattle are exported on the hoof each year. This includes the raw hides that are tanned and processed in the United Kingdom and imported by the shoe manufacturers.  There are three tanneries that could be developed and expanded to use this obvious natural resource.  An injection of capital into the tanning and processing industries would be a development in this direction. This is something the Ministers for Industry and Commerce and Agriculture and Fisheries should examine.  It may be a long-term solution and it may take time but now we have a situation that requires immediate action.</P>
    <P>The Minister stated that a kind of task force is being set up.  These groups are very slow and they go into many details.  We will have men from Luxembourg and other places inspecting the various factories and eventually making a report.  All of this will take considerable time.</P>
    <P>We are importing more than five million pairs of shoes.  Some traders have not been supporting the factories here as they should.  They have tried to re-label the shoes and have only been concerned with making profit at our expense.  I want to tell the people that although they may be buying cheap shoes, in the long run they are sacrificing the workers and their families.  A year ago there were 6,000 people employed in the shoe industry but now there are only 5,000 people employed in it, and there will be further redundancies.  Possibly rationalisation will have to take place within the factories too.</P>
    <P>There is a lot of ballyhoo talked about design.  It is said that we are not able to design shoes here.  I am glad to say that the Minister made a presentation to an employee from my area whose design was top class. I would not like anyone here or anywhere else to think we are unable <Col N="973" /> to design the type of shoe that is required here.  It amazes me that people go into shops and pay £16 for Italian shoes.  They think that because they come from Italy they are better than Irish shoes.  That is not true.  We produce a top quality shoe here and we have a wide range.</P>
    <P>Italy imposed a 25 per cent tariff. The Minister said it brought the Italian Government to their knees. Everyone knows governments in Italy were always on their knees with elections every three months or so.  The Minister will have to do something about the shoes that are coming in from Hong Kong, Korea and Singapore. Those places are outside the EEC.  They may say they buy certain commodities from us but I believe we should protect a major industry in this country.  If we are caught by legalities in the EEC we are not caught outside the EEC.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GerardCConnelly" hpid="Mr. Connolly Mr. Connolly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Connolly</NameTxt>
      <P>We remember when we had the Anglo-Irish Free Trade Area Agreement.  The UK came along and put a 10 per cent levy on our exports.  We objected but they did it. They imposed an export deposit too and they got away with it.  We tried to negotiate with them but they said: &ldquo;We have the heavy hand, you will pay and that is it.&rdquo;  They took it off when it suited them to take it off.  The UK is now about to negotiate new terms with the EEC.  If it suits her to break anything she will break it.  Let there be no doubt about that.  I believe we should impose an import deposit of about 25 per cent.  Imports from inside the EEC should be limited to an amount equal to the exports from Ireland in the preceding year. That view was put forward by the union.  It was not a bad one.  In the year 1967 our imports of shoes were worth under £500,000.  Now that figure has gone up to just over £5 million.  This is a massive increase and if it is allowed to continue it will lead to the closure of some of our factories.  In the last few years something like 20 of our factories have closed.  The way things are going it <Col N="974" /> looks as if the workers will be marching again.  We had over 3,000 of them here a week ago and they were pretty angry because they saw the loss of their jobs.  Some of them have been 30 years in the business.  When one is 30 years in a business one is not able to adapt to any other type of work in spite of the efforts of AnCO to retrain people.  When the workers marched they must have considered the situation very serious.</P>
      <P>I was very disappointed that the Minister came up with nothing constructive. All he had to offer was that he was getting the commissioners over.  That is little consolation to the worker.  If he hears that he will know that will take months.  They will look at this brief, that brief and every sort of brief but the workers will eventually find themselves not on a two-day week or a three-day week but some weekend there will be the announcement of the closure of another factory. I thought the Minister would have something constructive to offer to protect the workers and the shoe trade.  If something is not done immediately there will be many shoe workers lining up at employment exchanges.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. R. Ryan)</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputies will be aware from the Government's recently-published White Paper of the profound effect on the Irish economy and balance of payments of the enormous increases in the prices charged by oil-producing countries over the last 12 months. This year alone, the increase in our imported oil bill will be about £130 million.  Next year, as the full effect of this year's price increases works through, the extra cost could be even higher.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is no likelihood that oil prices will fall, over any period that one can prudently foresee, by anything like the rise of the last 12 months.  There is a tendency in the public mind to associate current high oil prices with the oil boycott used during the Middle East war of October, 1973.  That would be a <Col N="975" /> mistake.  That war may have occasioned the rise in prices&mdash;and it certainly caused a scarcity of supplies for some time&mdash;but the basic reason for current oil prices is that for more than a generation, world demand for energy has been rising much faster than its supply and oil has been by far the major source used for the new energy required. Certainly, the recent rise has been both sudden and steep and this has created many economic difficulties throughout the world; but the blunt fact must be faced that oil is at present an essential and in the long run an exhaustible source of energy and its price in future is bound to reflect these facts.  The sooner our patterns of energy use reflect this knowledge the easier it will be to cope with the many economic difficulties that lie ahead.  The days of cheap energy are gone; we must adapt our life-styles in recognition of this fact.</P>
    <P>The present cost of oil to our balance of payments is not a temporary difficulty that can be coped with merely by financial arrangements; expensive oil is a permanent fact of life to which we must accommodate ourselves.</P>
    <P>The Government have already recognised this by associating themselves with the steps taken internationally to cope with the changed energy situation. As far as security of oil supplies is concerned, we have become members of the International Energy Agency and have acceded to the agency's emergency oil-sharing programme.  While this will give us limited protection, we will remain vulnerable in the event of another oil cut-off, since all our oil has to be imported.  As regards a European Community energy policy, we have been participating in the discussions on its formulation in Brussels and have subscribed to the Council resolution of September last which called for a reduction in the rate of growth of consumption by means of a rational use of energy that would not jeopardise social and economic growth objectives.</P>
    <P>It has become essential, therefore, to make the most efficient use of our existing supplies, to conserve energy&mdash; and particularly oil&mdash;as far as practicable <Col N="976" /> and above all to alter the wasteful patterns of use which became the norm in an era of cheap oil.  This will be an immense task and will ramify throughout the whole of our society. The recent White Paper has already set out several measures taken by the Government to help reduce energy consumption.  These have all, so far, been of a non-fiscal character.  The Government consider the time has come to use fiscal measures as a further step towards saving energy. Normally, this would be done at the time of the annual budget, but the need to curb oil imports has become too urgent to be bound by an annual timetable.  The use of fiscal measures would, moreover, be in accordance with the advice given explicitly in the recent report on the economy published by the National Economic and Social Council and implicitly in the October economic commentary of the Economic and Social Research Institute.</P>
    <P>Some 50 per cent of our total oil imports consists of crude oil for the Whitegate refinery.  Another 30 per cent is accounted for by heavy fuel oil used by the ESB and major industrial users.  Nearly 6 per cent represents other fuels used for public and commercial transport and in industry. It would be extremely difficult to achieve major economies in these products without causing widespread economic disruption and unemployment. The next major oil product we import is petrol, representing nearly 10 per cent of our total oil imports. This has a number of distinct characteristics which need emphasis.</P>
    <P>In the first place, it is the product with the largest discretionary element: I am not saying it is a luxury, but it is largely used for private and to some extent non-essential purposes and curtailment of its use would not have anything like the economically disruptive effects that a cut-back of other fuels would.</P>
    <P>Secondly, petrol imports have been growing steadily, both in absolute terms and as a proportion of total oil products imported.  For several years past, grwoth in consumption has averaged some 7½ per cent a year as a proportion of our imports, petrol rose <Col N="977" /> from less than 2 per cent in 1969 to nearly 9 per cent in 1973.  If account is taken of the petrol output of the Whitegate refinery, which imports crude oil, petrol represents about 15 per cent of our total consumption of oil products.</P>
    <P>Thirdly, the price rises of the last year have hit petrol relatively less than any other oil product.  This is because the duty element in the price of petrol forms a sizeable fraction of its retail price.  As a result, although the price of, say, heating oil has risen by well over 100 per cent during the past 12 months, the price of petrol to the motorist has risen by less than half.  Moreover, as I have told the House previously, we now have the cheapest petrol in western Europe.  In Italy, petrol costs nearly 88p a gallon, in France over 74p, in Austria, Belgium, Denmark, the Netherlands and Germany the price ranges from 69p to 74p a gallon. Even in oil-rich Norway it is 76p.  In Northern Ireland and Britain the price of premium petrol is 63½p per gallon.  The existence of such a large difference as nearly 13p on a gallon of petrol between the Republic and the North has obvious disadvantages for our economy.  It would stimulate considerable petrol purchases in the Republic by motorists from the North.  This &ldquo;leakage&rdquo; across the Border would result in a worsening of our balance of payments as additional oil was imported to supply the cross-Border demand.</P>
    <P>In these circumstances, it would be unrealistic to expect to maintain our petrol price at just over 50p.  Every gallon we use has to be imported and relative cheapness merely encourages waste.  I emphasise that it is relative prices here that matter&mdash; if petrol prices are held steady while inflation causes the prices of other goods to rise by 15-20 per cent a year, then petrol becomes relatively cheaper and wasteful use quickly reasserts itself.</P>
    <P>This has, in fact, been happening. Consumption of petrol, after falling by about 5 per cent in the first quarter of this year, was actually slightly greater in the second and third quarters than in the corresponding <Col N="978" /> periods of 1973, despite a price increase of almost 50 per cent.  It is significant that the percentage of larger cars with heavy petrol consumption in the total of new registrations has doubled between 1967 and 1973.  These trends are evidence of unrealistic attitudes towards the cost of oil which has to be imported.</P>
    <P>The Government have, therefore, decided that it is essential to bring about great economy in the use of petrol.  We have considered whether this could be achieved by the imposition of some form of rationing, but we have rejected this approach in present circumstances.  While rationing may have advantages in achieving a fair distribution of a limited supply, it is an extremely cumbersome method of reducing consumption, it poses a large number of administrative problems for suppliers and distributors, it is economically inefficient and is open to widespread abuse.  The Government have, therefore, decided that a more efficient incentive to economy and to the elimination of waste is to raise the price of petrol by increasing the customs and excise duty by an amount which, allowing for the effects of VAT, will raise the retail price of premium grade petrol to 65p a gallon.  The tax increase is approximately equivalent to a VAT tax on petrol of 36.75 per cent.  I propose to insert a provision in the 1975 Finance Bill to convert this additional customs and excise tax on petrol into VAT.  I am proceeding at the moment by way of customs and excise duties because it will take some time to integrate the increased duties into the VAT structure.</P>
    <P>While the rise in petrol prices is substantial, I must point out that it will still leave our prices among the lowest in Europe.  The Government are taking no action at present on other oil products, such as diesel fuel used in road vehicles, in order to safeguard the position of industrial and commercial users as much as possible in these difficult economic times.  CIE passenger services will not be affected by this increase; this should encourage the use of public transport which would itself make a useful contribution to overall economy in the use of fuel.  I would stress that <Col N="979" /> there is just as great a need for economy in all oil products and everybody has an obligation to contribute to the national aim in this regard.  Any relief to our present oil position that may arise from access to our own sources of oil or gas is both too uncertain in size to rely on and is, in any event, too far away in point of time to save us from the necessity for immediate action.</P>
    <P>The increase in price will take effect from midnight to-night in so far as it concerns withdrawals of petrol from bond.  My colleague, the Minister for Industry and Commerce, will be making the appropriate orders as regards retail prices.  Dealers who have stocks bought at the former price should, however, continue to retail them at that level until stocks are exhausted.</P>
    <P>This increase in taxation is not designed primarily to raise revenue for the Exchequer, but to curb consumption and to alter existing patterns of use.  There is no precedent for this measure, so its ultimate effect is hard to gauge.  I expect, however, that compared with the annual growth of over 7 per cent hitherto, it should produce a fall of 10 per cent or so over the next year in petrol consumption.  As regards the balance of payments, the improvement will be modest, but it is an improvement that is within our own power to achieve and one which will, I hope, set a headline for users of oil products generally.  If this measure does not, however, achieve the results sought, it will be necessary to look at the matter again.  On the assumption that consumption does fall by 10 per cent or so, the Exchequer should benefit by about £27½ million in a full year.</P>
    <P>I would point out that this is the first increase in petrol prices since 1969 to result from taxation measures. Every other increase since that date has resulted from other factors &mdash; the principal beneficiaries have been foreign oil producers and not any Irish interests &mdash; and I have no hesitation in saying that the additional funds accruing to the Exchequer will be welcome at a time when demands on the State <Col N="980" /> coffers are far outstripping resources. On this occasion, Irish motorists can take comfort from the fact that their additional taxes will accrue to the benefit of the Irish people, whether by financing expenditure that could not otherwise be undertaken or by avoiding taxation that would otherwise be necessary.  The position as regards taxation generally will, of course, be made clear in the budget, which will be presented on 15th January next.</P>
    <P>In conclusion, I would remind the House that this measure represents but one element in a cohesive and comprehensive set of policies that will be appropriate to the new energy situation.  The measure I have announced today is specific in its application and is meant to produce early results.  It should not, however, be seen in isolation.  A number of other specific measures already taken were indicated in the Government's recent White Paper.  Other complementary measures like the expanded IIRS advisory information and technical consultancy services have brought about substantial energy savings in industry. Consideration of other conservation steps is proceeding at various levels and in differing agencies.  Because of their far-reaching nature it will take some time for the full benefit of these conservation measures to materialise.</P>
    <P>In two areas, however, early action is being taken.  The Minister for Local Government will make an order fixing a maximum speed limit of 50 mph and the Garda Síochána are being asked to ensure that the limit is respected.  It is estimated that the abolition of winter time would effect a worthwhile saving in fuel consumption. The Government will consult the interests concerned as regards the feasibility of maintaining standard time throughout the year.  The Minister for Transport and Power will shortly undertake a comprehensive promotional campaign to persuade domestic users to reduce consumption by wiser use and this campaign will convey practical advice on how to save money on fuel costs.</P>
    <P>Apart from direct Government action, however, there is considerable scope for effecting reductions in <Col N="981" /> petrol consumption by measures which can be taken by the public themselves at relatively little inconvenience, such as the greater use of public transport, slackening speed, pooling cars, the use of smaller cars and so on.  The overriding necessity is that future use of energy, in particular of oil, should be based firmly on a consciousness of its true economic cost &mdash; and value.</P>

      <P>This party are opposed to this increase although, because of the procedure by which it is being affected, we have not got an opportunity to record our opposition by voting.  I want to make it quite clear and unequivocal that we are totally opposed to the increase in the price of petrol which the Minister has just announced.  We are opposed to it because it must be evident to everybody that such a steep increase in the price of petrol will inevitably bring about further increases in the cost of living for practically every man, woman and child in the country.</P>
      <P>It will, of course, affect every day directly all of those people who travel to and from their work on motor cycles or in cars.  It will also affect people every day indirectly as the cost of this increase works itself through either in the factory process or in the cost of transporting of goods, or both. It will affect everybody as it works its way through.  It will, of course, be a particular hardship on those people&mdash; and there are many of them &mdash; whose work compels them and obliges them to use cars and consume petrol.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I notice that the Minister said that the primary purpose of this was not to raise revenue but, mind you, £27½ <Col N="982" /> million in a full year, which is probably a conservative estimate, is no mere bagatelle and especially it is no bagatelle to a Minister whose budget is not working out at all as he told us it would last April.</P>
    <P>Although the Minister refers to the leakage across the Border he proposes to increase the price above that obtaining in Northern Ireland.  The Minister did not tell us why he was doing that although, no doubt, he will eventually. As regards his claim of a leakage across the Border if one analyses this one will find that already, and without this savage increase, the bulk of the price of petrol goes in duty and tax and that is even more true as a consequence of what the Minister has just announced. For this reason the sales across the Border would, if one viewed that aspect of it, simply mean that revenue would accrue to our Exchequer but there is a balance of payments element involved.  The Minister did not quantify it for us but I would suspect it is not a major amount.</P>
    <P>In so far as it does effect our balance of payments we are entitled to ask whether it was not possible to devise some administrative method whereby this leakage across the Border could be controlled if it was going to have any substantial effect in regard to our balance of payments.  One thing which is quite clear is that whatever amount is involved for our balance of payments in this regard a very much greater amount could be saved for our balance of payments if the Government embarked on a proper all-out campaign of information and exhortation on fuel saving generally.  I understand that early this year a group of very highly qualified people offered their services to the Government free to assist in this matter.</P>
    <P>We have heard the Minister make a few references to things that are suppose to have been done.  Some similar references were made in the recent nonevent White Paper but what is the reality of the situation?  We have all known that this problem was in existence from the beginning of this year at the latest and, effectively, the Government have done nothing so far.  I cannot understand, despite my low <Col N="983" /> opinion of the members of the present Government, this extraordinary dilatoriness in the face of what is undoubtedly a major problem, the major problem of the increase in oil prices. The most obvious, logical step for the Government to take is to embark on an all-out campaign to induce people to save fuel.  They are tinkering with the problem here.  The fuel saving is minimal and the Minister has admitted that.  What are the consequences of what he is doing?  He is increasing the cost of living again when people are at the end of their tether trying to subsist with the cost of living as it is.</P>
    <P>This Government, in their early days, apparently did not understand the enormous importance for a Government at a time of raging inflation of avoiding any steps under their control which would increase the cost of living.  I am not trying to depart from the subject under discussion but I say that because of the various and substantial tax increases that were applied across the board by the Government.  The Government were not aware of the importance of what was happening.  I suspect that now they should be aware of what is happening but what frightens me is that they have given up the ghost because recently, in the areas under the Government's control and these are the important ones, they seem to have forgotten that if one is ever to have any hope in the battle against inflation every little increase which can be stopped must be stopped.  The Government can control us a great deal.</P>
    <P>Tonight we have an announcement from the Minister for Finance of a savage, unprecedented increase in the price of petrol which will directly, and indirectly, shove up the cost of living.  This has come at a time when we all know that even a small increase in the cost of living is likely to throw people out of their jobs. That being the situation I suggest that there was an obligation on the Government, if they felt it was necessary to conserve petrol, and it was necessary to do so, to devise any other method than one which would increase <Col N="984" /> the cost of living and throw people out of employment.</P>
    <P>It seems, apart from the attitude of the Government in their earlier days when they did not understand the effect of what they were doing, that now things which are directly under the Government's control such as TV licences, postal charges and now petrol, are being increased on a massive scale.  These enormous and massive increases have been directly produced by the Government.  The effect of these increases is that not alone should the Government be opposed to what they are doing now because of its direct effect on the cost of living and employment, but, more important, because of the evidence it gives of this psychological surrender by the Government in the battle against inflation.</P>

      <P>I should like to ask a question, I am not endeavouring to make a contribution.  This single increase in the price of petrol superseded the increase in several budgets in overall taxation.  On these occasions we were given an opportunity as an Opposition, to express our views on it but will the Minister put this proposal to a vote of the House or how otherwise does he propose to implement the increase?</P>

I am asking that the House be allowed to determine whether or not £27½ million of extra taxation next year, plus £2½ million this year, is going to be added in the manner proposed without a word being enabled to be said until next January. This is not in the orders and never was.</P>

      <P>The Department sanctioned, in February last, a special transport service to the national schools in Buttevant from the Grange and Buttevant areas to the south-west of the town.  CIE have, however, not been able to secure a contractor to operate the service, but as soon as they succeed in doing so, the service will be introduced.</P>
