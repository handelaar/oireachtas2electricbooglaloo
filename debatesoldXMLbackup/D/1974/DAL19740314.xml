    <Speaker pid="JohnCallanan" hpid="Mr. Callanan Mr. Callanan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Callanan</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not like the title of the Bill, Anti-Discrimination (Pay) Bill, but I am in favour of the Bill in principle.  My reason for disliking the title is because we may be discriminating <Col N="230" /> in an indirect way against female employees.  The Members of this House can do something about directing the State to employ women but we cannot tell any hard-headed businessmen who they should employ.  We cannot tell them how they should run their business and, consequently, we cannot tell them when they should employ female labour.  If an employer feels that it would be better for him to employ male labour there is nothing we can do.</P>
      <P>Whether we like it or not we have discriminated against females over the years.  For example, we have not appointed any females to the judiciary. There are quite a number of senior posts in the Civil Service which should be filled by females.  These posts should be filled by females who should be paid on the same basis as males.  The State should set an example in this regard.</P>
      <P>While I agree with the Bill in principle in my view it is somewhat premature and it will cost a lot of money to implement it in the public sector due to the fact that there is such a difference in the salaries paid to the males and females.  Are we not moving a little too fast in this regard? I am not against women's rights but we should consider the younger generation of females.  Will there be sufficient jobs for them?  It is the younger generation who may think that we are discriminating against them.</P>
      <P>The Minister should be careful.  I doubt if he can implement the terms of this Bill in the two years.  Having voiced my reservations I believe that it would be wrong for anybody to object to the principle of the Bill. What worries me is the definition &ldquo;equal pay for equal work&rdquo;.  It will be very hard to define that because employers may claim that males are more productive than females.  In my view we cannot compel a private individual to employ any particular type of labour.  He is free to employ whomever he wishes.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Labour (Mr. M. O'Leary)</NameTxt>
      <P>The debate on this Bill has been marked by a great interest on the <Col N="231" /> part of Deputies on the Government side and in Opposition.  There has been a great interest in the content of the Bill and general support for the principles of it.  A number of Deputies, Deputies Dowling, Colley and Moore, felt the Bill was not sufficiently comprehensive. Deputy Dowling asked why I did not deal with all aspects of discrimination against female employees in this Bill.</P>
      <P>As I pointed out in my opening statement, this Bill only deals with the aspect of pay.  Other aspects of discrimination against women in employment will be dealt with in further Bills to be brought before this House as soon as possible.  This Bill has been brought about by reason of the interim report of the Commission on the Status of Women which was published as far back as 1971.  Most of those proposals foreshadowed many of the major proposals which were later given substantively in the final report.  I decided that it was opportune in this Bill to proceed with legislation in this area.  Deputies Cunningham, Andrews, Dowling and Colley expressed some anxiety regarding the use of the term &ldquo;anti-discrimination&rdquo; in the Bill.  The Bill sets out to deal with discrimination in the area of wages and salaries of women workers.  Therefore the title reflects accurately the Bill's purpose.</P>
      <P>I think it was Deputy Esmonde who suggested that the definition of &ldquo;employed&rdquo; in section 1 did not provide for persons employed under a contract for services.  The Deputy made the point that the definition might provide a loophole for unscrupulous employers.  The definition covers all people employed under contract of service&mdash;that is, all employees&mdash;and is in line with the British and Northern Ireland Acts which define a person employed under contract for services as being a contractor and who to that extent sets his or her own charge for services. It would not be appropriate to cover such persons in the Bill.  However, although on first examination there would not seem to be any need for a change, I shall look at it again.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="232" /> Deputies Moore, Cunningham and Briscoe commented on subsection (2) of section 2.  That is the provision that:</P>
    <P>Nothing in this Act shall prevent an employer from paying to his employees who are employed on like work in the same place of employment different rates of remuneration on grounds other than sex.</P>
    <P>The intention of that subsection is to allow for the payment of different rates in certain circumstances&mdash;for example, in respect of long service. It is important that provision be made whereby one worker could be on a rate of pay different from another.  These differences would not be discriminatory but would be based on seniority and service.  It would not be the function of this Bill to attempt to alter that situation.</P>
    <P>Deputy Colley regarded section 2 as being limited because it referred to equal pay for men and women in the same employment and in the same place.  Of course in the area of men's employment there are different rates of pay, according to region.  I do not see how the Deputy's point can be sustained.</P>
    <P>Deputies Lemass and Dowling were concerned about the possible difficulty of recruiting sufficient technical staff for the posts of equal pay officers.  On entry to these posts high technical qualifications would not be needed although persons recruited would need to understand the techniques of job evaluation.  During a period of time they would build up a sufficient amount of experience.  I would emphasise that the appointments would be made in the ordinary way through the Civil Service Commission. Obviously therefore there would be no ministerial control regarding the type of people to be appointed.</P>
    <P>Some Deputies expressed the view that there may possibly be adverse effects for women as a result of this legislation.  What they mean is that it is never possible to improve anybody's lot without endangering the present status of the people whose lot one wishes to improve.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="233" /> Deputy Dowling, too, referred to the long lapse between the enactment and the implementation of this legislation and suggested that employers might downgrade women's employment in the interim period.  In this context he referred to the experience in the EEC countries.  It is intended to introduce legislation later dealing with broader aspects of discrimination but in the interim period there is provision in this present legislation covering dismissals resulting from applications for equal pay.  The trade union movement is well aware of these provisions.  However the full implementation of this proposed legislation is envisaged by December of 1975.  Therefore there is a relatively short period between the time of the introduction of this Bill and its full scale implementation.</P>
    <P>There was reference to the reinstatement of women after childbirth. This brings up the whole question of married women in employment and of the possibility of their employment being endangered because of the responsibilities of motherhood. That is a real problem.  It is not one that is being dealt with in this Bill but is a matter that will be appropriate for some of the measures to be proposed later.</P>
    <P>Deputy Mrs. Desmond raised the question of the reinstatement of a dismissed woman employee.  The Bill provides for payments of any arrears due to a person who has been dismissed on the grounds of having sought equal pay and provides also for the imposition of penalties on employers who are guilty of such action.  The question of reinstatement is not covered in this measure on the grounds of the possibility of any former employee not wishing to return to the employment from which she had been dismissed.  However this question will be treated more extensively in an unfair dismissals Bill which I hope to introduce later in this year and in which it is intended to include a provision to prohibit the dismissal of any employee because of his or her marital status.</P>
    <P>The question of who decides on claims for equal pay was raised by <Col N="234" /> Deputy Lemass.  The Deputy seemed to think that I was the one to make the decision in this area.  This is not so.  In the first instance the equal pay officer makes a recommendation.  If that recommendation is appealed to the Labour Court they make a determination and there is provision for appeal to the High Court on a point of law.  Regarding hearings in the Labour Court there was a suggestion that these be held in private.  I undertake to consider this suggestion.  At first glance I expect that the parties involved would prefer the hearings to be in private, but I assure Deputies that I will look into the question of permitting also that there should be public hearings if the parties should so wish.</P>
    <P>There was reference to the legal costs of pursuing equal pay claims. It should be made clear that a woman would normally not have to incur any legal expenses and that there will be easy access to the equal pay officers and to the Labour Court. If the employer does not comply with a determination of the Labour Court he will be guilty of an offence, and prosecutions in the case of such offences will be on my instructions. It is only in the case of appeals on a point of law to the High Court that a woman or her union representative will be liable for legal costs.  I would say that would be a rather rare occasion.  However I will have the matter examined and if it is seen to be a sufficiently realistic problem we will have it covered in this legislation.</P>
    <P>Deputy Cunningham raised the question of equal pay and women's employment generally.  He asked whether this piece of legislation would affect adversely the employment opportunities of women.  Paragraph 164 of the report of the Commission on the Status of Women raises this very point:</P>
    <P>A rise in women's pay would not bring about a substantial reduction in the level of female employment in industry.</P>
    <P>That is my opinion, too.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMoore" hpid="Mr. Moore Mr. Moore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moore</NameTxt>
      <P>There are cases already in which there has been an <Col N="235" /> adverse effect on the recruitment of women.  I think it is bound to happen.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>All the statistics suggest the contrary.  This is also the experience of our fellow EEC countries. All the statistics suggest we will have more women in our work force.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanMoore" hpid="Mr. Moore Mr. Moore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moore</NameTxt>
      <P>That may be possible but I think the proportion of extra men employed in the future will be greater than women.</P>

      <P>As I said at the outset, this legislation sets out to deal with a limited but important area of discrimination: that area of employment in which women are discriminated against in their salaries and wages. This legislation sets out to right that injustice.  This is part of a series of legislative measures in which I will set out to protect the contract of employment of individuals with their employers and to defend the individual worker against injustices in that contract of employment.  These legislative measures are necessary if we are to bring about fair conditions of work for Irish men and women.  This first legislative step simply sets out to deal with <Col N="236" /> the area of women's pay.  During the Committee Stage I will be glad to listen to any useful amendments the Opposition may have.</P>

      <P>The number of notified industrial accidents in 1973 was 3,286 as compared with 2,872 in 1972.  The increase in the number of accidents coincided with the increase in industrial production, the accident rate remaining the same as in the previous year.</P>

      <P>As I understand the law about industrial accidents, an industrial accident is defined as being something which either has fatal results or for at least three days keeps an employee out of the work he was doing before the accident.  I have a long table, which I am sure the Minister would make available to the Deputy, in respect of a large range of types of employment, giving the accidents in 1972 and those in 1973.  I also have information about fatalities in each of these years.</P>

      <P>As the Minister informed the Deputy on the 19th February, 1974, in reply to a question by him, he is having regulations drafted in consultation with the Minister for Health to deal with excessively high noise levels.</P>
      <P>The provisions of section 58 of the Factories Act, 1955, are specifically aimed at protecting workers from injurious, offensive or excessive dust, fumes or other impurities.</P>
      <P>The protection of workers from radiation hazards is governed by two regulations made in 1972 in respect of both sealed and unsealed sources of radiation.</P>
      <P>The protection of workers from hazards associated with toxic chemicals is dealt with in a series of regulations. The Minister is examining a number of these at present with a view to updating them where necessary.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Calleary</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Parliamentary Secretary not aware that there is a proposal to move a course from the Ballina centre to the Sligo centre, and would he not agree that, in view of the proposed industrial expansion in the Ballina-Killala region, this is a retrograde step?  Would he not also agree that it is not in line with the five-year training expansion programme which has been launched by AnCO, a statement in connection with which is contained in AnCO News of February, No. 4, 1974:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>At the same time AnCO will pay <Col N="242" /> particular regard in its planning to likely employment prospects, using its own manpower intelligence resources, and continuing close liaison with the National Manpower Service, IDA and other agencies.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not aware of a transfer of any of the functions of the Ballina unit to anywhere else. What has happened is that responsibility for managerial control of the Ballina course has been transferred from the permanent centre in Galway to the permanent centre recently opened in Sligo.  This, the Minister says, is not a downgrading but a matter of managerial convenience.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanCalleary" hpid="Mr. Calleary Mr. Calleary">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Calleary</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Parliamentary Secretary not accept that there is a downgrading in that certain courses are being transferred from Ballina to Sligo, and would he have the Minister investigate this and would he also get in touch with AnCO in Sligo?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMKelly" hpid="Mr. Kelly Mr. Kelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister does not accept that any question of downgrading arises.  So far as managerial responsibility for the unit is concerned, it is being switched to Sligo for reasons of pure administrative convenience.  I may also tell the Deputy that because of the placement difficulties with the trainees, the courses at Ballina will be changed to meet the anticipated needs of new industrial development and partly to improve the placement rate of trainees.  However, I do assure the Deputy that the Minister's view is that no question of downgrading arises.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnMKelly" hpid="Mr. Kelly Mr. Kelly">

      <P>I have not got a lot of information here but the information I have indicates that the solicitors for the owners were requested to lodge title documents in October, 1970.  Six reminders have issued.  In their replies solicitors for the owners state that they have difficulty collecting particulars of title but that as soon as they get enough information together they will furnish title.  That would seem to indicate that there is a problem regarding title and that it is a matter for the solicitor for the owners to clear up the matter of title.</P>

      <P>In the period from 1st January, 1969, to 31st December, 1973, the Land Commission purchased by agreement in counties Galway and Roscommon a total of 99 and 79 properties, respectively. Final payment of the purchase money has been made in all cases with the exception of five in County Galway and three in County Roscommon. Where the purchase money was payable in cash it was paid on the day the Land Commission obtained possession and where it was payable in land bonds the length of time between the taking of possession and payment varied from three months to 30 months.  The five longest such periods were 31 months, 27 months, 25 months, 20 months and 19 months.</P>

      <P>The operations of the Land Commission in County Galway are heavily concentrated and involve numerous small estates and holdings as well as remnants of congested districts board estates, lands surrendered in exchange and small residues of partly allotted properties. The Deputy will appreciate that the extraction of the information he has asked for would entail a disproportionate expenditure of time and work which would not be justified.  Moreover, at this time of the year, when allotment activity reaches its peak the position in regard to lands on hands is subject to constant fluctuation depending on progress in intake and allotment and the information sought would be out of date within a short time.</P>
      <P>As regards allotment it is not feasible to indicate when all the individual properties on hands in County Galway will be allocated but it may be taken that in all cases the necessary inquiries on the ground preliminary to allotment are being pushed forward as rapidly as circumstances permit.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Lands whether arrangements involving family settlements and succession from father to son will come within the ambit of the new retirement scheme for farmers under EEC Directive 160; and if he will indicate the number of farmers likely to avail of this scheme during the coming year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasGODonnell" hpid="Mr. O'Donnell Mr. O'Donnell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donnell</NameTxt>
      <P>The answer to the first part of the question is &ldquo;No&rdquo;. Lands released under the new retirement scheme, which I will be introducing shortly, must be allocated for structural reform&mdash;in the main to farmers with approved development plans which provide for the acquisition of additional land, or for afforestation, recreational activities, public health or other public purposes.  The only instance where a transaction involving the transfer of lands from father to son would come under the scheme is where the son was a farmer in his own right and had adopted a development plan which, for its successful implementation, needed the provision of additional land and the father's lands would be suitable for this purpose. There is no provision within the framework of EEC Directive 160 for the granting of benefits to farmers merely to facilitate family settlements or to ease succession difficulties.</P>
      <P>As to the second part of the question, it is not feasible just now to forecast the number of farmers likely to avail of the scheme.  I should say, though, that I expect a substantial response; the incentives being made available are very generous, and will provide a unique opportunity for farmers who may wish for one reason or another to get out of farming to retire in dignity and financial security.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When the scheme is operational I shall ensure that it is brought to the <Col N="261" /> attention of all farmers, especially those who are elderly and living on non-viable holdings.  I will be relying on the farming organisations to help me in publicising it and in fostering applications from eligible farmers. Rural Deputies, too, can play a vital role in this work and I look forward to their co-operation.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donnell</NameTxt>
      <P>Dwelling houses erected by or with the aid of grants from the Land Commission qualify for a graduated rates remission over a period of nine years, provided they have been completed after 31st March, 1969, and comply with the floor area requirements set out in the Housing Act, 1970.  Most Land Commission houses comply with these floor area requirements.  In cases where they do not comply and the house was completed before 31st March, 1972, the Local Government (Temporary Reduction of Valuation) Act, 1970, provides for a two-thirds remission of rates.  These latter remissions are however being phased out and will have ceased as from 31st March, 1976.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Minister for Foreign Affairs (Dr. FitzGerald) Garret FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Foreign Affairs (Dr. FitzGerald)</NameTxt>
      <P>No &ldquo;motion&rdquo; confirming the right of the Puerto Rican people to self determination and independence was voted on in the United Nations General Assembly last year.  However the Deputy may be referring to Resolution 3163 (XXVIII) on the implementation of the Declaration on the granting of independence to colonial countries and peoples.  Ireland abstained on the vote on this resolution because, <i>inter alia</i>, it contained paragraphs which approved of the use of violence and of forceful means in violation of the principles and purposes of the UN Charter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This resolution approved the Report of the Special Committee on Decolonisation which itself contains specific recommendations in regard to Puerto Rico&mdash;operative paragraph 2 of this resolution adopted by the Special Committee on 30th August, 1973, reaffirmed &ldquo;the right of the people of Puerto Rico to self determination and independence&rdquo; in accordance with the General Assembly Resolution 1514 (XV) of 14th December, 1960&mdash;a resolution in favour of which Ireland voted.  However I should perhaps add that in Resolution 748 (VIII) of 27th November, 1953, the United Nations recognised &ldquo;that when choosing their constitutional and international status, the people of the commonwealth of <Col N="268" /> Puerto Rico have effectively exercised their right to self determination&rdquo;, thus fulfilling the provisions of the Resolution 1514 (XV).  It was for this reason that the United Nations has refused on two separate occasions to place on the agenda of the United Nations an item on Puerto Rico.</P>
    <P>The decision of the people of Puerto Rico referred to in Resolution 748 (VIII) was taken on 3rd March, 1952, when by plebiscite they adopted a constitution which established the commonwealth of Puerto Rico as a political entity freely associated with the United States.  The constitutional provisions enable the people of Puerto Rico freely to amend their constitution if they wish to see changes in their status <i>vis-à-vis</i> the United States; if they so wish they may integrate as a full state of the United States or become a sovereign state independent of the United States.</P>
    <P>In a later referendum on July 23rd, 1967, 99.4 per cent of the voters stated their desire to maintain their association with the United States in one form or another.</P>

      <P>As Deputies are aware, the Council of Ministers is considering proposals from the Commission of the European Communities on Community regional policy.  Until agreement is reached on these proposals, it is not possible to state how Community regional policy will benefit this country.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Dr. FitzGerald Dr. FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>Some 20 British soldiers crossed the Border on the main Dundalk/Newry road at approximately 4 p.m. on 5th March, 1974.  Gardaí went to investigate and encountered them at a point north of the Carrickarnon customs post, between the post and the Border.  The Garda officers saw three men being held down on the ground by British soldiers.  Also at the scene were four vehicles including two British Army vehicles.  The Garda sergeant present informed the British soldiers that they were in the Republic of Ireland and that they had no authority to be there or to take prisoners.  After some heated argument the three men in the possession of the soldiers were handed over to the gardaí.  The British soldiers then withdrew back across the Border in their vehicles.</P>
      <P>On arrival at the scene, the gardaí had been informed by the British soldiers that they had been under fire from a sniper nearby and it was noted that some of the soldiers were in firing positions.  The British authorities have confirmed that firing was directed from that location at a suspected sniper but they have said that the officer in charge was not aware at that time that he was south of the Border.  When approached by the Garda sergeant this officer drew attention to two bombs which he said had been removed from a car which was at the location, facing south.  He also drew attention to a large coal lorry just north of the Border which he said had been hijacked and contained explosives.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>According to the British authorities, the patrol which crossed the Border had been on duty at a vehicle control point one-and-a-half miles north of the Border, when the hijacking incident occurred near the old Killeen customs post on the northern side. The patrol reported that the Border crossing occurred when they were in pursuit of the car containing the suspected hijackers who were stopped some 250 metres on the southern side. <Col N="274" /> The stretch of road they were patrolling on the northern side is notorious for the placing of vehicle road blocks containing explosives, and five such incidents since 1st October, 1973, on this road alone are reported.</P>
    <P>Strong representations have been made to the British Government about this incident.  At my meeting with the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland, Mr. Merlyn Rees, on 7th March, I raised this matter and, apart from an apology, I requested action to ensure that there would be no repetition of the unauthorised actions or of the unacceptable behaviour towards the gardaí who were engaged in the exercise of their official duties.  The British authorities have apologised for the incursion and have expressed regret if the attitude of the soldiers was misunderstood and caused offence.</P>

Is the Minister not aware that in regard to the statement by the officer in charge as to his ignorance of where the Border was, in this case on the Carrickarnon Road between the two posts it just is not possible for a man to make such a mistake and the excuse given was a very thin excuse?

On the second point, while I agree that on that road it would appear impossible that the military would be unaware of their having crossed the Border between the two customs posts, we have to have regard to the fact that what occurred was a hot pursuit of a vehicle, which was then rammed, and following that the British soldiers seemed to have thought they were under fire and it is possible they may not have had much time to consider precisely where they were in the heat of the moment.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Foreign Affairs if the attitude adopted by the Irish Government at the recent Washington meeting represents any change in Ireland's position on European defence and foreign policy generally.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Dr. FitzGerald Dr. FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>With the permission of the Ceann Comhairle, I propose taking Questions Nos. 79 and 80 together.</P>
      <P>The principal decision adopted at the Washington conference was to establish a co-ordinating group of senior officials to direct and co-ordinate the development of actions to deal with the energy crisis.  The main function of this co-ordinating group is to prepare for a conference of consumer and producer countries which will be held at the earliest possible opportunity.  Provision was made for the co-ordinating group to invite as appropriate other countries to join with them in their efforts.  In addition it was agreed that the preparation for the conference of consumer and producer countries should involve consultations with developing countries and other consumer and producer countries.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="276" /> There is, therefore, no question of a bloc in this context; once the conference of consumer and producer countries has been held the <i>raison d'être</i> of the co-ordinating group will no longer exist.  Any <i>ad hoc</i> groups established by the co-ordinating group should also &ldquo;die&rdquo; once they have completed the specific assignments given them.</P>
    <P>Ireland's interventions at the conference were directed particularly towards maintaining the cohesion of the member states of the European Community. This attitude was entirely in keeping with our European policy in particular and with our foreign policy generally.  Defence questions did not, and could not, arise in any shape or form.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister satisfied that the American initiative in this matter was not, in fact, prompted by defence questions or considerations of American influence in Europe?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Dr. FitzGerald Dr. FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think I could comment on the intentions of other governments.  It is not within my competence to know what their intentions are, but there is nothing in what happened at the conference to indicate it had any defence implications.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>Is it not rather strange that the conference was in fact confined to the European Community countries and the United States?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Dr. FitzGerald Dr. FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>No.  The position was that the conference consisted of members of the OECD Energy Committee, including five members of the European Community, as it happens, plus other countries like Norway, Japan and Canada.  In view of the particular interest of the European Community the other four European Community countries, not members of that committee, were also at a certain point invited to attend.  We were among the other four and we attended.  It was not, in fact, a conference of the United States and the European Community.  It was a conference of the Energy Committee of <Col N="277" /> the OECD with the other members of the European Community, who are not members of that committee, also present.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>Can the Minister assure the House that this country's traditional neutrality will not in any way be compromised by any associations with or any consequences that may follow from such <i>ad hoc</i> conferences as the Minister has suggested?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Dr. FitzGerald Dr. FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>Not in the least.  I think the Deputy is barking up a wrong tree here.  Japan, which is a member of NATO, was there also, for example.  There is no question of defence coming in in any shape or form at this conference.  I can assure the Deputy of that; there are no defence implications whatever in this.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister satisfied that there was no question of American influence and involvement in Europe?  There was no question either of America's projection of its position in European politics?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Dr. FitzGerald Dr. FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>The question of America's relationship with Europe was involved.  Indeed, that became evident from the divergence of opinion between European Community countries as to the appropriate response.  What I am saying is that the defence side had nothing whatever to do with it.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Dr. FitzGerald Dr. FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>The Government are fully conscious of the need for effective harmonisation and co-ordination at both global and regional level of measures to safeguard and enhance the environment.  They aim to contribute as far as possible to the work of drawing up and implementing appropriate international conventions and relevant environmental programmes.  As an example, I would refer the Deputy to a conference at Paris, which concluded on 21st February last, where Ireland played an active part in drawing up a convention on the prevention of marine pollution from land-based sources.  The convention will soon be considered by the Government with a view to signature on their behalf and subsequent ratification.</P>

These are the United Nations Emergency Force (UNEF) located in the Middle East and the United Nations Force in Cyprus (UNFICYP).  272 soldiers are serving with UNEF, comprised mainly of the 25th Infantry Group.  This contingent is located at Rabah in Sinai.  Three members of the Permanent Defence Forces are serving at UNFICYP Headquarters in Nicosia.</P>

This framework will be reviewed at the General Assembly session due in the autumn of 1976.  Ireland will support any measures to improve the existing arrangements which may prove desirable.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Dr. FitzGerald Dr. FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I have not made any such representations.  I am satisfied that the Government's position on this question is well-known to all interested parties, including sports participants <Col N="280" /> and organisations.  However, I welcome this further opportunity to emphasise once again that the Government are strongly opposed to the philosophy and practices of the evil system of apartheid. This opposition to apartheid has been made clear on every suitable occasion, in this House, at the United Nations, in other international organisations and elsewhere.</P>
      <P>The United Nations General Assembly has declared its unqualified support of the Olympic principle that no discrimination should be allowed in sports events on grounds of race, religion or political affiliation and it is the Government's policy to support that principle.  The Government believes that selection for representative teams, should be made on the basis of merit and achievement alone. Accordingly, the Government can only view with regret any participation by Irish sportsmen or women in sports events organised in violation of this principle.  However, sports organisations in this country are private bodies and their members must freely determine their attitude to the Olympic principle of non-discrimination on grounds of race in sport.</P>
      <P>In saying this, I wish to emphasise also that it is not the Government's desire to interfere with the normal freedom of citizens to travel abroad.</P>

    <P>Arrangements to provide a telephone kiosk to serve the combined area of Limekiln Farm and Greenpark <Col N="281" /> are well advanced and it is hoped that the kiosk will be in service in about three months.</P>

I should say, however, that the site for a kiosk to serve both these areas has already been selected near the shopping centre in St. James's Road and local authority approval of this site was sought on 15th January.

On the basis of latest information from the contractor, this equipment is expected to be in service in <Col N="282" /> July next.  Earlier completion is, I am advised, unlikely but every effort will be made towards this end.  The slippage on the previous forecast referred to by the Deputy was due to late completion of other works necessary before the installation work could be undertaken.</P>

      <P>I will have to answer the Deputy by reference to the year of application.  Some of these applications have been outstanding for some very considerable time.  Of these 2,000 applications 53 were made in 1971; 355 in 1972; 1,200 in 1973 and 237 in 1974.  The applicants are spread fairly evenly over the four exchanges.

It is expected that the 1971 <Col N="286" /> and 1972 applications will be serviced by the end of 1974 and the bulk of the remaining orders now on hand will be serviced by the end of 1975.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>I am disappointed at the Minister's answer.  He and I both represent this area.  I thought he would be more forthcoming.  Is the Minister aware that there was a post office in this area and another at the top of Philipsburgh Avenue.  Neither of these offices now exists.  Consequently the people of this area are very seriously inconvenienced by the lack of these facilities which were formerly provided for them.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Cruise-O'Brien</NameTxt>
      <P>As Deputy Haughey says, we both have the honour of representing this area.  I would certainly like, as he would, to facilitate the residents there.  As Minister for Posts and Telegraphs I think I could be faulted if I were to discriminate in favour of an area which I represent as a TD.  I am conscious of the demand in the area.  It is true, as the Deputy says, that until May last there was an office in Philipsburgh Avenue which was more convenient for some Calderwood residents.  That post office had to be closed on 31st May last on the resignation of the former sub-postmaster.  No candidate with suitably located premises could be found to fill the vacancy.  It is not so easy now, as urban Deputies will be aware, to find sub-postmasters in urban areas.  This often accounts for the placing of the premises concerned. It has not been possible since then to obtain a candidate for the vacancy with suitably located premises.</P>

    <P>The question of introducing a scheme for the deaf similar to that applicable to certain pensioners would be a matter for the Minister for Social Welfare.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs if he has received communications from the Ballyfermot Community Association Dublin, and from a firm of specialists in television systems (name supplied); and if he will make a general state ment on the matter.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ConorCruiseOBrien" hpid="Dr. Cruise-O'Brien Dr. Cruise-O'Brien">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Cruise-O'Brien</NameTxt>
      <P>I assume the Deputy has in mind communications about a recent application for a licence for a micro-wave link to bring television signals into the Ballyfermot area for the purpose of a cable tele vision system.  Some complex issues are involved which will have to be considered carefully in detail.  It will therefore, necessarily be some time before any decision is reached on the application.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="295" /> I might add that no decision has yet been made regarding the firm or firms which will be given a licence to provide a cable system in Ballyfermot.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NoelTLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware that the groups representing tenants in this area have considered this matter in great detail?  They have also considered the Minister's statements and legislation in relation to this matter and have come to the conclusion that this particular system is the one most suitable for the Ballyfermot area.  Can he explain why he has an objection to it now when apparently he has not the statutory authority to enforce it?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ConorCruiseOBrien" hpid="Dr. Cruise-O'Brien Dr. Cruise-O'Brien">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Cruise-O'Brien</NameTxt>
      <P>As I indicated to the House, the situation is complex and has been considerably oversimplified by the Deputy.  Two cable operators have applied for licences for cable systems in this area.  This is one of a number of areas where there is a conflict of interests between cable operators and, I may say, a certain amount of lobbying on their behalf. The question of holding a competition for an exclusive licence to provide a cable system in Ballyfermot and other areas concerned will arise if negotiations between cable operators and the Department fail to resolve these conflicts.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is a limitation on spectrum space.  In order to conserve scarce frequency resources the use of micro-wavelengths for point to point communication has not been permitted except in exceptional circumstances&mdash; for example, for the television transmitter network and the ESB private communication network.  Relay of television signals to cable systems by micro-wavelengths would absorb a disproportionate amount of spectrum space.  For example, a channel which would provide many hundreds of telephone circuits would cater for the relay of only a single television programme and five or more television programmes are relayed on each individual cable system at present.  There are a number of other factors involved. The House will understand that it is very necessary for my <Col N="296" /> Department to carry out a detailed examination of all the implications involved.</P>

As a result of this advice the community representatives have come down emphatically in favour of the name supplied to the company.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ConorCruiseOBrien" hpid="Dr. Cruise-O'Brien Dr. Cruise-O'Brien">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Cruise-O'Brien</NameTxt>
      <P>As I indicated to Deputy Colley already, at column 1347 of the Official Report of 21st February, 1974, the Government Information Services record certain programmes including news bulletins on a daily basis.  These records are kept <Col N="297" /> for a very short time only.  The tapes are then wiped for use again.  The tapes of 11th January were, under this system, wiped shortly afterwards. The information which the Deputy seeks is not, therefore, available.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sure the Minister will agree that it was an unfortunate coincidence that these tapes were wiped thereby depriving him of the official record of what happened.  Is the Minister aware that on the date in question RTE television news at 10 o'clock, while referring to many items, did not refer in any way to the many increases in the price of bread, butter, sugar and various other commodities sanctioned by the Minister for Industry and Commerce? If he is so aware, does he view that kind of evaluation of news as an example of the kind of open Government about which he and his colleagues have been talking?</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Cruise-O'Brien</NameTxt>
      <P>As I indicated to the Deputy, for reasons which are quite clear the Government Information Services have no record of the broadcast in question.  This is a practice which has been standard for quite a long time.  It is not a new practice at all.  I have no personal recollection of the broadcast in question and I cannot therefore comment on it from memory.  I have no powers in relation to the day to day programming of RTE.

I am kept informed on this subject through regular meetings with the heads of the oil companies, and officers of my Department are also in daily contact with the companies.  In addition, I am kept informed of the oil situation both in European and other countries through regular attendance by officers of my Department at European Economic Community and Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development meetings.

      <P>asked the Minister for Transport and Power if the CIE cruising boats on Lough Derg at Killaloe, County Clare have been sold; if so, the reason for the sale; and if it is intended to replace them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Dr. FitzGerald Dr. FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I have been in formed by CIE that by notice in the Press on 22nd January, 1974, tenders were invited by the board for the sale of the two boats used for Shannon cruises.  Tenders have been received by the board and are at present being examined.  It is not intended to replace the boats.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As indicated in my replies to previous questions on the subject on 8th May, and 26th June, 1973, CIE consider that the purpose of their initial involvement in cruises on the Shannon, which was to engender an interest in the Shannon waterway as a sailing and cruising attraction, has been achieved and that there is now <Col N="307" /> no reason for them to continue to provide this service which for the board is a loss-making one.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NoelTLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister has stated that CIE generated interest in Shannon cruising but why did CIE stop their participation because they are the most capable people of generating all-round tours including boating and trains?  Why did CIE stop now when the tourist industry is at risk?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Dr. FitzGerald Dr. FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>CIE's view is that they have done their job of generating interest in the Shannon.  Any of us who have been along the Shannon in recent years know how much more active the boating business is than it was 18 or 19 years ago when CIE started this service.  CIE feel they have done their priming job and that it is now something which should be carried along by private enterprise.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Dr. FitzGerald Dr. FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>The question of whether somebody carries it on or not depends on whether they are confident of making a profit.  That is something which is, as yet, uncertain. At the time the cruises were undertaken originally, and the boats were provided, there was no boating on the Shannon.  The activities of CIE have got interest going and many people who travelled on these cruisers are now using their own smaller boats. The main objective has been achieved.</P>

      <P>Would the Minister agree that the provision of an internal air service, particularly along the west coast, serving Farranfore in Kerry, Shannon, Oranmore in Galway, Castlebar and some place in Donegal would be a very important contribution to the ideal of decentralisation&mdash;an ideal to which each party in this House are committed?  An airport would be needed in Donegal to complete a chain of airports along the west coast.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Dr. FitzGerald Dr. FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I would agree with the desirability of internal air services where their operations would shorten significantly the time spent in travel.  However experience has shown that such services over a range such as would be the case in this country would not pay.  That raises the question of the merits of subsidisation bearing in mind the relative convenience of, say, rail travel and the fact that we would be subsidising one body to compete with another which itself often has to be subsidised.  The whole question would have to be examined carefully.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>I am aware that the question is one which requires careful examination but perhaps the Minister would give a commitment in principle to the desirability of such an internal air service particularly along the west coast.  Of course it would have to be subsidised.  Would the Minister agree in principle that such an internal air service would represent a useful contribution to the development of the west and therefore would be well worth subsidising if such were necessary?</P>

      <P>We must distinguish here between this question of internal air services in the west, which is a particular problem, and internal air services generally.  The Minister for the Gaeltacht has been developing proposals for air services in the western Gaeltacht areas and for that purpose Gaeltarra Éireann are taking a shareholding in Aer Aran, but the question put to me related to the <Col N="311" /> general question of internal air services. On the suggestion of an airport in Donegal, the brief does not guide me on this point but my understanding is that such an airport is being developed at Gweedore.  However, I do not wish that to be taken as authentic information.  It is heresay on my part.</P>

      <P>A certain amount of anxiety has been expressed in many countries, developed and underdeveloped, about the phenomenon of the multi-national corporation.  International organisations of which this country is a member, including the EEC and OECD, are considering a number of measures designed primarily to keep this matter under review in the interests of workers, shareholders and consumers and also to ensure that more useful comparative statistics will be available in future.  This country will be taking an active interest in these proposals.</P>

      <P>The information I have here indicates that, in answer to a question from a British Member of the European Parliament as to how much of industry in the EEC is held by American-based multi-national companies, the following reply was issued and I quote:</P>
      <P>(1)  At the present time, no provision in the EEC Treaty or in Community legislation authorises the Commission to ascertain the nationality of persons controlling undertakings established in the whole of the Community.  Thus, the statistical facilities required to supply the information requested by the honourable member are lacking</P>
      <P>(2)  The Commission has made no forecasts and, moreover, forecasts would be extremely unreliable, particularly because of changes in the exchange rates of the dollar and the uncertainty surrounding the flow of investments on both sides of the Atlantic.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ConorCruiseOBrien" hpid="Dr. Cruise-O'Brien Dr. Cruise-O'Brien">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Cruise-O'Brien</NameTxt>
      <P>With the permission of the Ceann Comhairle, I propose to take questions Nos. 151 and 152 together.</P>
      <P>I am not aware that there was any loss of jobs in the car assembly industry in 1973 though, before the end of the year, one firm went on short-time.  More recently two other assembly firms have also gone on short-time, due largely to a decline in sales as a result of the energy situation.</P>
      <P>I am, of course, aware that there has been some disquiet in regard to the long-term prospects for motor assembly and the possibility of consequential job disturbance in the industry.</P>
      <P>Over the last year, however, a number of the larger assemblers accounting for a substantial part of the industry's total output, have publicly stated their intention of remaining in motor vehicle assembly on a long-term basis.  Nevertheless it would be unrealistic to expect that all assembly firms can continue in assembly up to and beyond the year 1985 when the special import arrangements for the motor industry will cease to operate.  This, indeed, was recognised when the specially long transitional period for the industry was negotiated with the EEC.  That extended period was designed to allow ample time for individual assemblers to prepare for eventual full free trade conditions within the Community and so maintain the employment afforded by motor assembly either in the industry itself or in alternative industrial activity.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I will welcome and give my full co-operation to proposals for setting up manufacturing operations which will provide alternative employment for workers engaged in assembly firms.  I should stress, however, that <Col N="315" /> if any firm embarking on such a programme is to continue to enjoy facilities for the importation of fully built-up vehicles.  I would first have to be satisfied as to certain conditions. Chief among these would be that the alternative project would have long-term viability and would offer comparable employment to all those in the assembly plant willing and able to take up employment in the new undertaking.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LorcanAllen" hpid="Mr. Allen Mr. Allen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Allen</NameTxt>
      <P>I gather from the Minister's reply that he admits there is difficulty in so far as the future of the car assembly industry is concerned, particularly when he talks about alternative employment in that industry.  Would he have a special look at the Wexford town area where we have a car assembly industry and where we already have a fine wool fabrics industry in very severe difficulty?  Would he have an honest appraisal of Wexford town in view of the unemployment situation facing that town in particular?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ConorCruiseOBrien" hpid="Dr. Cruise-O'Brien Dr. Cruise-O'Brien">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Cruise-O'Brien</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister for Industry and Commerce, for whom I am answering today, is concerned with the situation in Wexford town particularly arising out of the problem in relation to another factory on which the Deputy is aware there is another question down.  I know it is giving the Minister concern and that he is trying to meet that situation.</P>

    <Speaker pid="NoelTLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware that a number of people in the south Dublin area have been served with redundancy notices to take effect from the start of the financial year? While one motor car assembler has undertaken to establish a new industry to absorb the disemployed workers other assembly industries have not done the same.  Can the Minister explain why these particular companies should go out of the business when at least two people assembling in my constituency can find it profitable to continue doing so and, indeed, to expand?</P>

    <Speaker pid="ConorCruiseOBrien" hpid="Dr. Cruise-O'Brien Dr. Cruise-O'Brien">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Cruise-O'Brien</NameTxt>
      <P>The Community programme for the harmonisation of national laws on motor vehicles envisages that proposals for directives <Col N="318" /> will be put forward by the Commission before 1st January, 1976, for adoption by the Council by 1st January, 1977.  A proposal to have right-hand drive introduced in all the member states of the Community has not been made by the Commission.</P>
      <P>The Commission's proposals relate to such matters as the harmonisation of safety requirements, and pollution and environmental protection which are not my responsibility.  So far as the motor vehicle assembly industry is concerned, the assemblers here are mainly engaged in the assembly for the home market of aggregates of parts imported from other member states, and the programme should not cause them any real problem.</P>

The final directive for motor vehicles is to be submitted by the Commission before 1st January, 1976, for adoption before January, 1977.  The programme does not include proposals for right-hand drive to be adopted throughout the Community, and indeed it seems unlikely that such a proposal will emerge in the near future if one is to judge from questions recently answered by the Commission which recognise the tremendous problems which such a course would pose for member countries who would have to make a changeover from left-hand drive.</P>

      <P>With the permission of the Ceann Comhairle, I propose to take Questions Nos. 156, 157, 158 and 159 together.</P>
      <P>I am aware of the difficulties obtaining in the motor insurance market at present with regard to the inability of certain categories of driver to get insurance cover, the high premiums being charged those who do succeed in getting cover, and the inequality in rates of premium quoted due to the variety in the range and levels of loadings.</P>
      <P>I believe these difficulties stem primarily from the unsatisfactory premium structure which has developed in motor insurance over the past few years, and last October I established the Motor Premiums Advisory Committee to look into the matter in detail and advise me on premium rates and loadings.  I expect to have their first report about the end of this month and I intend then, after consultation with the National Prices Commission, to take early action in the matter.</P>
      <P>The Interim Report of the Insurance Industry Committee contained certain longer-term recommendations in regard to motor insurance, and these are being examined by my Department in consultation with other Departments concerned.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ConorCruiseOBrien" hpid="Dr. Cruise-O'Brien Dr. Cruise-O'Brien">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Cruise-O'Brien</NameTxt>
      <P>With the permission of the Ceann Comhairle, I propose to take Questions Nos. 166 and 167 together.</P>
      <P>Arising from the appointment with effect from 28th January, 1974, of a receiver to the firm, I arranged that financial assistance, limited as to extent and duration, would be made available to the receiver to assist him in his efforts to control the position of the firm and to make a full assessment of the situation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In providing such temporary financial assistance, I was concerned primarily with the avoidance of hardship that would otherwise arise for the workers concerned through an immediate closure of the mill.  The receiver's examination disclosed a very serious <Col N="328" /> loss-making situation.  The financial support which is being made available is for a period of 16 weeks from the date of appointment of the receiver. This provides a reasonable time to enable the possibilities of take-over of the firm as a going concern to be explored.  It is a difficult and costly operation to maintain the firm in business for this length of time and I cannot give any assurance that the time can be extended.</P>
    <P>Meanwhile everything possible is being done by the Industrial Development Authority to attract new industrial projects to the Wexford area, including the building of a large advance factory.  The IDA are in contact with a number of promoters who are interested in locating at Wexford. They have already succeeded in securing one new industry for the town.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Allen</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister was specifically asked in one of those questions about an extension of the length of time.  Both management and staff of Fine Wool Fabrics are very anxious that the time should be extended in order to try to negotiate with interested parties to take over this very important industry in Wexford town.  As I am sure the Minister is aware, there are in the region of 300 people and their families involved. What are the possibilities of this industry being taken over lock, stock and barrel?  I am sure the Minister is aware that this is quite a modern factory with a first-class working force and they have worldwide markets for their products. Something concrete will have to be done.  I might add that this is the first time in my 12 years in Dáil Éireann that there has been an industrial problem in Wexford town and Fianna Fáil Deputies have not been asked because it has been made a political scapegoat by the Minister's own party in Wexford town&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I do not consider it desirable that the conditions attached to IDA grants should require firms to recruit through the National Manpower Service as I believe this would introduce an undesirable element of compulsion into what should be a good working relationship between firms and the service.</P>

      <P>With the permission of the Ceann Comhairle, I propose to take Questions Nos. 173, 174 and 175 together.</P>
      <P>I have been informed that the Industrial Development Authority expect that firms already in production in Waterford city will generate 254 new jobs in the present year and that projects already announced but not yet in production will provide another 216 new jobs.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A new major enterprise for the <Col N="332" /> manufacture of aluminium pistons for the diesel engine industry is being announced this evening.  This will employ 250 in the first full year of production rising to 1,000 after five years; 80 per cent of these jobs will be for men.  Furthermore, it is hoped in the near future to announce details of an additional project with employment potential for over 300 men.</P>
    <P>The IDA are also endeavouring to attract new industry to the county area, as distinct from Waterford city, and they have set a manufacturing job target of 250 for the area in the regional industrial plans 1973-77.  They are confident that this target will be attained.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Cruise-O'Brien</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware that under the proposed system of taxation the type of projects in question brought here by the IDA could become liable to capital gains tax and in so far as individuals hold equity in the limited companies concerned&mdash;if they are limited companies&mdash;they become liable to the proposed wealth tax?  Further, is the Minister aware that on this basis in a number of cases such firms could find themselves paying considerably more than they would pay if they were liable for income tax on the profits derived from exports?  In these circumstances how does the Minister justify the statement that no such instruction or no instructions of any kind are called for?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ConorCruiseOBrien" hpid="Dr. Cruise-O'Brien Dr. Cruise-O'Brien">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Cruise-O'Brien</NameTxt>
      <P>I understand that the IDA were consulted informally about the possible effects on industrial development of these taxation proposals and there seems to be no reason to suppose that the Government's White Paper would have the effect which the Deputy fears&mdash;I presume &ldquo;fears&rdquo; is the right word. As the House knows, of the seven continental EEC members all operate a death duty, all operate a capital gains tax, six operate a gifts tax and four operate an annual wealth tax. Of 12 non-EEC countries all operate a death duty and a gift tax, ten operate a capital gains tax and six an annual wealth tax.  It is against this background that it was not felt that instructions of the kind referred to in the question were called for.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>I assume that because the Minister answering is not the Minister for Industry and Commerce he has just said what he did say.  He will appreciate that we, through the IDA, are selling Ireland and that our main weapon is the export tax relief <Col N="334" /> and therefore what is happening in other EEC countries without this benefit is totally irrelevant.  But arising out of the reply he made earlier could I be clear on this: is the Minister saying that the views of the IDA were sought in relation to the proposed taxation outlined in the White Paper on capital taxation and that the IDA expressed the view that these proposals would not interfere in any way with their ability to carry out their statutory functions of attracting industrial development to this country?  Is that what the Minister said?</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Cruise-O'Brien</NameTxt>
      <P>If the Deputy wants further information on that subject I think he had better put down a separate question.  This is a separate question he has asked.  In his original question he asked whether the Minister had given the IDA certain instructions and I informed him that no such instructions were felt to be called for.  If the Deputy wishes to put down a separate question, he may do so.</P>

I am asking him if he is saying that is what the IDA advised because that is what I thought he implied.  Is he saying that is so or that it is not so?</P>

      <P>I do not wish to reveal just yet any details of the Bill to control mergers, take-overs and monopolies which I propose to introduce soon but I may say that I am satisfied that the lower limit of size which I am proposing in relation to the definition of monopolies for the purposes of the Bill will be a realistic one, and will in many cases include concerns which would be below the size limits fixed by the EEC regulations to which the association appears to refer.  It would not be realistic to classify as a monopoly a company which produced as little as 5 per cent of the country's output of a product as the association propose.</P>

      <P>Our native coal reserves consist of anthracite in the Leinster and Slieveardagh coalfields and semi-bituminous coal in the Argina area of County Roscommon.</P>
      <P>Our anthracite coal industry has been experiencing difficulties for some years past resulting in the closure of two main mines at Rossmore, County Carlow and Ballingarry, County Tipperary. Legal formalities in connection with the sale of Rossmore collieries are now nearing completion and it is hoped that the mine will be reopened shortly.  The receiver appointed for Ballingarry collieries is still negotiating with interested parties with a view to the disposal of the mine.</P>
      <P>Our semi-bituminous coal is used mainly for the purpose of generating electricity.  Deputies will be aware that the Minister for Transport and Power indicated recently in the House that the ESB are re-examining the possibilities of utilising the &ldquo;crow&rdquo; coal deposits at Arigna for that purpose and will submit their recommendation to him in due course.</P>

      <P>The recent price increases for Polish coal to which, on the advice of the National Prices Commission, I raised no objection were solely attributable to a price increase for coal already imposed by the Polish authorities and to increases in freight rates.

      <P>I am not sure that I understand the Deputy's question but, speaking generally, I would say that the question whether a sale has taken place is decided in the circumstances of each particular case by the provisions of the Sale of Goods Act, 1893, and that my Department have no further function in the matter.</P>

      <P>The purpose of my question is because of concern expressed to me by a constituent last Sunday week.  He wishes to know if the Department of Industry and Commerce might have inspectors to verify whether or not the sale is bringing about a genuine reduction in retail prices.  His allegation was that during the sale certain items he had been waiting to buy increased in <Col N="347" /> price during the sale period.  Can the Department take any effective steps to prevent this type of misrepresentation?</P>

      <P>There seems to be a genuine misunderstanding here, for which I apologise to the Deputy.  The Department seem to have understood the word &ldquo;sale&rdquo; as a sale in the sense of a sale of an object, in law&mdash;I think that is understandable&mdash;whereas he meant those sales which are held by department stores, and so on, and as my answer relates to the legal concept and is no help to the Deputy perhaps he would rephrase the question for another occasion.</P>

      <P>With the permission of the Ceann Comhairle, I propose to take Questions Nos. 192 and 193 together.</P>
      <P>The law relating to the contents of accounts, and also the practice of most companies which voluntarily go beyond the actual requirements of the law in their degree of disclosure, are based primarily on the classic view that the purpose of the accounts was to provide information for shareholders and creditors.  Modern thinking would recognise that employees and the community have legitimate interests in disclosure also.  This will have to be carefully looked at when we come to amend the law relating to accounts in accord with forthcoming EEC requirements.  It is not my intention however to propose detailed changes at least until the EEC Fourth Directive on Company law, which deals with company accounts, reaches a more advanced stage of preparation.</P>
      <P>The question of obliging company directors and executives to disclose their associations with companies outside the State raises certain issues on which I have not yet formed a final opinion but which I shall consider when our Companies Act is being reviewed.</P>

    <P>Responsibility for the preparation of short-term plans for effecting improvement of facilities at the College of Commerce, Rathmines, Dublin, and for providing for additional places, if necessary, for intending students of business studies at the college, rests with the City of Dublin <Col N="356" /> Vocational Education Committee in the first instance.</P>
    <P>Any proposals from the committee in this regard will receive the careful attention of my Department.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister agree that this passing of the &ldquo;buck&rdquo; becomes more skilful with every answer?  Is the Minister aware that the students specifically stated that their recent protests were aimed not at the Vocational Education Committee but at the Department of Education who have it in their power to supply the necessary funds?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ConorCruiseOBrien" hpid="Dr. Cruise-O'Brien Dr. Cruise-O'Brien">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Cruise-O'Brien</NameTxt>
      <P>It is very easy for Deputies to make reference to passing the &ldquo;buck&rdquo;.  The Deputy is well aware of the complexities of the situation.  He is better aware of them than I am.  I think the Deputy understands why the answer to the question is phrased in that manner.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>Am I to take it from the Minister's reply that no request came from the Dublin City Vocational Education Committee for extra money for improved facilities in Rathmines?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ConorCruiseOBrien" hpid="Dr. Cruise-O'Brien Dr. Cruise-O'Brien">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Cruise-O'Brien</NameTxt>
      <P>There is a rather long history of this matter here.  In my reading I do not see any reference to such a request.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoelDavern" hpid="Mr. Davern Mr. Davern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Davern</NameTxt>
      <P>In view of the unsatisfactory answers in this House would the the Chair consider allowing these questions to be repeated?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DenisJones" hpid="An Leas-Cheann Comhairle Denis Francis Jones">
      <NameTxt>An Leas-Cheann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>If Deputies feel they want to put down questions again they may do so.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>It would be six months before they were answered.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ConorCruiseOBrien" hpid="Dr. Cruise-O'Brien Dr. Cruise-O'Brien">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Cruise-O'Brien</NameTxt>
      <P>Some Deputies chose to have their questions postponed. Those who chose to have them answered have no adequate grounds for complaint.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>I stayed on working here today precisely because these questions were down.  If I thought I <Col N="357" /> would have got an adequate answer I would have postponed them.  There are a number of people who are interested in this.  It is a serious problem. Consequently I will consider raising the matter on the Adjournment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DenisJones" hpid="An Leas-Cheann Comhairle Denis Francis Jones">
      <NameTxt>An Leas-Cheann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>It is too late at this stage.  The Deputy will have to mention it again on another occasion.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoelDavern" hpid="Mr. Davern Mr. Davern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Davern</NameTxt>
      <P>I presume the Chair has to follow certain procedures in this House.  I understand the right of the Opposition to ask supplementary questions here.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DenisJones" hpid="An Leas-Cheann Comhairle Denis Francis Jones">
      <NameTxt>An Leas-Cheann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>I have just informed the Deputy that if he intended to raise this matter on the Adjournment he was late today, but he could raise it next week on the Adjournment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoelDavern" hpid="Mr. Davern Mr. Davern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Davern</NameTxt>
      <P>If we were to raise all the questions on the Adjournment the Dáil would be sitting until July.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>214.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Education when the NCEA will lay down criteria for a degree course in business studies in the College of Commerce, Rathmines, Dublin.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ConorCruiseOBrien" hpid="Dr. Cruise-O'Brien Dr. Cruise-O'Brien">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Cruise-O'Brien</NameTxt>
      <P>The basic policy of the NCEA in relation to awards is set out at pages 10 and 11 of the Council's first annual report, a copy of which, I understand, was circulated to Deputies last December. Applications for the approval of courses received from individual educational institutions are evaluated with the assistance of experts in all relevant branches of learning and technology.  It is open to the College of Commerce, Rathmines to submit an application accordingly to the NCEA.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>Do I take it that no application has come to the NCEA as yet from any higher college for recognition of a degree course in business studies?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ConorCruiseOBrien" hpid="Dr. Cruise-O'Brien Dr. Cruise-O'Brien">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Cruise-O'Brien</NameTxt>
      <P>The NCEA have not received any application <Col N="358" /> from the College of Commerce at Rathmines for the approval of a degree course in business studies.  The council's basic policy on rewards is set out on the pages of the council's annual report to which I have referred. That is the only information relevant to this question.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>I asked did the NCEA receive a request from any higher college for recognition of a course of business studies?  If it happens in one case that can act as a precedent.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ConorCruiseOBrien" hpid="Dr. Cruise-O'Brien Dr. Cruise-O'Brien">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Cruise-O'Brien</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy will understand that in these conditions I can only give him the information which is in my brief.  My brief was necessarily prepared in relation to the specific question which relates to the College of Commerce at Rathmines, Dublin.  I have given the Deputy all the information in my possession on that matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>215.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Education the plans he has for a new third-level business college in the Rathmines area, Dublin.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ConorCruiseOBrien" hpid="Dr. Cruise-O'Brien Dr. Cruise-O'Brien">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Cruise-O'Brien</NameTxt>
      <P>The proposal from the City of Dublin Vocational Education Committee in relation to the third-level business studies courses at Rathmines College of Commerce is to the effect that the appropriate provision should be made in connection with a new third-level commercial/technological institute to be built at Ballymun.  This proposal is being considered in the context of an examination of the requirements for third-level non-university education in Dublin and for third-level education generally.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister think it wise to place the business college in the southern part of the city because most of the commercial enterprises, such as business offices, are located in that area and this would enable students to reach the college easily from their places of work rather than to have to go out to Ballymun?  Secondly, does the Minister think that the proposition to have the whole complex at Ballymun is one that is likely to meet with <Col N="359" /> the favour of the Minister, who has promised this report in the near future?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ConorCruiseOBrien" hpid="Dr. Cruise-O'Brien Dr. Cruise-O'Brien">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Cruise-O'Brien</NameTxt>
      <P>As I have indicated in relation to other questions, when answering for other Ministers I will try to give Deputies such factual information as I have available.  I do not think it is reasonable to expect a Minister sitting in for more than one Minister to answer questions about general policy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister for Education should have stayed here.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ConorCruiseOBrien" hpid="Dr. Cruise-O'Brien Dr. Cruise-O'Brien">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Cruise-O'Brien</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy should be well aware of the reason for the Minister's absence.  I am surprised at that comment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to repeat that I think the Minister for Education should be hear to answer his questions.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Cruise-O'Brien</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="StephenCoughlan" hpid="Mr. Coughlan Mr. Coughlan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Coughlan</NameTxt>
      <P>Let me object. When Fianna Fáil were on this side of the House there were more absentees than now.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoelTLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>Just because the Deputy had a bad book today he should not come in in this manner.</P>

      <P>Statistics relating to income tax are not compiled in such a manner as would enable the information sought by the Deputy to be given.</P>
      <P>The only information available regarding the distribution of taxpayers over ranges of income relates to income for sur-tax purposes.  Tables relating to these ranges of income are contained in pages 162-173 of the annual report of the Revenue Commissioners for the year ended March 31, 1973, copies of which are available in the Library.</P>
