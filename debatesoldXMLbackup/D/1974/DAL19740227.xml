      <NameTxt>Mr. Cunningham</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Industry and Commerce if he will indicate the action, if any, his Department have taken in relation to the problem of coal prices in County Donegal.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JustinKeating" hpid="Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. Keating) Justin Keating">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. Keating)</NameTxt>
      <P>Recent complaints of alleged overcharging for Polish coal in County Donegal were investigated by an inspector of my Department.  Up to the beginning of this year coal merchants in County Donegal were selling coal, which they had imported from Poland, at a retail tax-inclusive price of £20 per ton.  Stocks of this coal became exhausted in January and the principal Donegal merchants were obliged to obtain their requirements from one merchant, who had imported a small cargo of Polish coal at an increased landed cost of £22.50 per ton.  This coal was retailed at a tax-inclusive price of £26 per ton, which could not be considered unreasonable, especially when account is taken of slack loss.  At that time, I received complaints of a retail price of £32 per ton for coal being charged by a Donegal merchant and following investigation of the complaints it was established that the merchant concerned had been over-charging. The merchant has undertaken to refund the overcharge to the customers concerned.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1608" /> Since then, there has been a further increase in the landed cost of Polish coal.  On 14th February, 1974, on the advice of the National Prices Commission, I indicated that I would raise no objection to an increase in price in County Donegal to compensate merchants there for this further increase in the CIF cost.  This has resulted in a revised tax-inclusive retail price of £32.83 per ton.</P>
    <P>Because of the substantial increase in retail coal prices in recent weeks I feel there is a need for an inquiry into coal prices generally and into the different elements in the build-up of retail prices.  As already announced, I have decided to establish a Prices Advisory Body to conduct a public inquiry into coal prices.  I have also decided to make an order fixing the maximum retail price which may be charged for pre-packaged coal which is of special importance to the poorer section of the community.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LiamCunningham" hpid="Mr. Cunningham Mr. Cunningham">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cunningham</NameTxt>
      <P>Arising from the Minister's reply, is he aware that at present retail prices of coal in Donegal range from £32 to £40 per ton?  Will the Minister state whether the Donegal merchants applied for an increase or was the figure of £32 per ton based on a directive issued by the Minister which was not in response to an application for an increase?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JustinKeating" hpid="Mr. Keating Mr. Keating">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>There are two questions there.  I am asked whether I am aware that coal is being sold in Donegal at a price up to £40 per ton and certainly in excess of £32.83.  I am not so aware, apart from the information the Deputy has just given the House.  As the Deputy can see from the reply, we took action in regard to a particular case of over-charging and secured an agreement to refund.  If people bring forward details in respect of particular merchants and particular actions I will be happy to have them investigated and to endeavour to secure redress similar to that secured in the case to which I have referred.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I was asked whether there was a general increase given or whether the increase was as a result of a specific request from the Donegal merchants. <Col N="1609" /> On January 16th of this year there was an application on behalf of the Donegal merchants by one merchant.  The application was on behalf of all of them.  I understand that the increase was in response to that.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RaymondMacSharry" hpid="Mr. MacSharry Mr. MacSharry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacSharry</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister satisfied that the Prices Commission were justified in granting a 50 per cent increase in the price of coal and, if so, why does he now want an inquiry into the matter?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JustinKeating" hpid="Mr. Keating Mr. Keating">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>The National Prices Commission act according to fairly well-defined guidelines.  They are not totally inflexible, but they are clearly laid down.  Where there is a demonstration of an increase in the price of imported material people are entitled to pass it on.  It is easy for a coal merchant so to demonstrate because the increase is worldwide.  It is common knowledge that there was an explosive increase in the price of Polish coal and, indeed, all coal as well as in freight rates in December and January when the energy crisis was at its sharpest.</P>
      <P>In that sense I am satisfied that according to the information given to them the National Prices Commission acted correctly in granting the increases which they granted; but I am not entirely satisfied, and the public are not satisfied, that there was no hoarding and no profiteering in regard to coal.  It is therefore desirable to have a public inquiry and have the facts brought out.  If the coal merchants are being wrongly accused, let the false accusations be seen.  If some of them are incorrectly accused let that be seen also and let the public draw the conclusions and take the necessary action.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LiamCunningham" hpid="Mr. Cunningham Mr. Cunningham">

      <P>The Deputy asked a number of supplementaries.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LiamCunningham" hpid="Mr. Cunningham Mr. Cunningham">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cunningham</NameTxt>
      <P>I asked a supplementary once which happened to be two questions.  Would the Minister say what is the justification for a retail price in Dublin, which is a port, of £28 or less and a retail price in Donegal where coal is also landed at a seaport of £32.83 per ton?  Is there a clear justification for this large difference in price?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JustinKeating" hpid="Mr. Keating Mr. Keating">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not guarantee that there is a justification.  It is to find out for certain whether there is or not that we are having a public inquiry. The Deputy will be aware that some merchants have stocks at a given moment.  The difficulty is that some do not.  It is desirable that those with the older stocks purchased at the lower price should pass them on to the public at the lower price.  If there is a difference in the quantity of stock held by different merchants at a time of rapid price increase there will be price differences at any given moment.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JosephBrennan" hpid="Mr. Brennan Mr. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Industry and Commerce if he will state, in reference to the reason given for the recent increase in the price of Polish coal, whether he anticipates that freight charges will re-adjust downward when the present temporary abnormal demand for bulk carriers subsides to normality.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JustinKeating" hpid="Mr. Keating Mr. Keating">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not in a position to forecast the future trends in freight charges.  Variations in these charges will be taken into account in any consideration of coal prices.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JosephBrennan" hpid="Mr. Brennan Mr. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Industry and Commerce if he examined the possible effects of rationalised shipping and/or combined purchasing before he sanctioned the recent increase in the price of Polish coal.</P>

    <Speaker pid="NoelTLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Industry and Commerce why the cost of Polish coal has risen so enormously.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JustinKeating" hpid="Mr. Keating Mr. Keating">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>With your permission, a Cheann Comhairle, I propose to take Questions Nos. 3 and 4 together.</P>
      <P>The recent price increases for Polish coal to which, on the advice of the National Prices Commission, I raised no objection, were attributable to a price increase for coal already imposed by the Polish authorities and to an increase in freight rates.  As the Minister for Transport and Power has overall responsibility for shipping and the supply and distribution of fuel, the question of rationalised shipping and/or combined purchasing would appear to be matters more appropriate for examination by him in the first instance.  However, I understand that Irish coal importers do in fact act in co-operation in negotiating prices and supplies with the Polish authorities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JosephBrennan" hpid="Mr. Brennan Mr. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister not agree that anything that contributes to increased pricing would be of interest to him even though it is the Minister for Transport and Power who deals with it?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JustinKeating" hpid="Mr. Keating Mr. Keating">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, the price aspect is certainly of interest to me.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>5.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BenBriscoe" hpid="Mr. Briscoe Mr. Briscoe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Briscoe</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Industry and Commerce if he is satisfied that the recent increases in the price of coal have not been levied on stocks existing at the time of sanction of the increases; and if an examination of the books of coal importers has been carried out by his Department to ensure that this has not occurred and, if not, why.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JustinKeating" hpid="Mr. Keating Mr. Keating">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>It appears from information furnished to the National Prices Commission by their consultant, who visited coal importers in Dublin, Galway and Sligo in connection with the proposals for the recent increases in prices, that these increased prices were not levied on stocks of coal imported before the increases came into effect.  However, <Col N="1612" /> as I pointed out in reply to an earlier question, I have decided to set up a Prices Advisory Body to conduct a public inquiry into coal prices generally and I have also decided to make an order fixing the maximum retail price which may be charged for prepackaged coal.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesCTunney" hpid="Mr. Tunney Mr. Tunney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tunney</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Industry and Commerce if he has examined the position arising from the merger of leading fuel distributors in Dublin; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JustinKeating" hpid="Mr. Keating Mr. Keating">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>I have received complaints which attributed delays in the delivery of coal in the Dublin area to a lack of competition among coal merchants following on the merger of a number of the firms concerned. The Examiner of Restrictive Practices is at present inquiring into this matter at my request.  As I have already indicated, I am arranging for a public inquiry into the price of coal.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesCTunney" hpid="Mr. Tunney Mr. Tunney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tunney</NameTxt>
      <P>From his experience to date could the Minister establish the principle that, generally speaking, mergers do not operate to the benefit of the consumer?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JustinKeating" hpid="Mr. Keating Mr. Keating">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>I think there is serious disquiet in regard to this merger and it is for that reason that I asked the Examiner of Restrictive Practices to look at it.  If the Deputy would consider how very general his observation is he would see there are instances where mergers can be protective and helpful.  I would not be against all of them.  I think there is a real doubt in this case and we are investigating it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickPower" hpid="Mr. Power Mr. Power">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Power</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware that this monopoly has led to much less favourable terms being offered to provincial merchants than heretofore? Is he also aware that they are being asked to accept unworkable quotas on a daily rather than on a weekly basis and that these are very restrictive also?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JustinKeating" hpid="Mr. Keating Mr. Keating">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>I have had a number of such representations.  The Deputy will be aware that at a time of very <Col N="1613" /> sharp worldwide increases, and of some shortages, it is possible for exaggeration to take place.  It is precisely because there is public disquiet on this matter that we are having it looked into by the Examiner of Restrictive Practices.  If I get a clear indication from him I will respond readily.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoelDavern" hpid="Mr. Davern Mr. Davern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Davern</NameTxt>
      <P>Has the Minister considered that the quotas now being imposed on suppliers, that is in the retail trade, are based on 1972 figures when there was no oil crisis and no shortage of oil and that this is unrealistic in today's situation?  Will he have the matter re-examined urgently?  Secondly, do the Government intend to re-open native mines which they closed earlier this year to supplement coal supplies?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JustinKeating" hpid="Mr. Keating Mr. Keating">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>The whole matter of coal supplies and prices is being now investigated as a matter of urgency, in one instance by public inquiry.  I think there is real cause for concern. In regard to native coal I have been in touch with both the IDA and other bodies which are potentially interested in the new energy situation and which, with coal much dearer, have been reexamining the question of the viability of one mine which was closed&mdash; and there is mining continuing&mdash;to see if we can establish a healthier coalmining industry.  This is my wish just as much as the Deputy's.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Davern</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Industry and Commerce if his attention has been drawn to a claim by the milk bottlers' association that there will be a shortage of milk in 1974 because of his refusal to grant them a price increase; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JustinKeating" hpid="Mr. Keating Mr. Keating">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>Any shortage of milk for liquid consumption would presumably arise from the producers' dissatisfaction with the price payable by the distributors for such milk.  The question of what the producers' price for milk should be is primarily a matter for the Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries.</P>
      <P>An increase in the producers' price for milk would be grounds for an application by the distributors for a consequential increase in the retail price of milk.  An increase in the retail price could not, however, be agreed in anticipation of an increase in the producers' price.</P>

      <P>At a meeting on 3rd January last between representatives of the Pasteurised Milk Bottlers' Association and officials of my Department the reasons were explained in detail.  The principal reasons were that the present retail prices fixed for milk provide reasonable compensation for distributors for cost increases incurred by them, and that from a sample of financial accounts submitted by distributors to my Department, it appeared that profit rates of the firms involved were adequate.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>The Irish Shipping Operators' Association recently submitted a comprehensive proposal on behalf of their members for increases in charges in connection with customs clearance.  Having consulted the National Prices Commission I raised no objection to the association's proposals for increased charges, which included the introduction of a fee of 50p for transfer of documents and a fee of £1.50 for servicing entries of importers or agents.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Gibbons</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Industry and Commerce the increase in the prices of tractors and farm machinery since 14th March, 1973.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JustinKeating" hpid="Mr. Keating Mr. Keating">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>Since 14th March, 1973, the retail prices of the more prominently used makes of tractors have increased by amounts ranging between £19 on a make costing £1,292, or 1.5 per cent, and £696 on a make then costing £1,805, or 38.5 per cent.  The majority of increases, however, were under 20 per cent.</P>
      <P>Because of the wide variety of equipment covered by the description &ldquo;farm machinery&rdquo;, it is difficult to provide precise information on price changes.  It would appear that the price increases in the period, calculated on a simple average basis, were about 25 per cent for imported machinery. The Deputy will appreciate however that the use of a simple average may be misleading and it is not possible to calculate a weighted average from the information available.  I raised no objection to a proposal by one Irish manufacturer of farm machinery to increase prices by 20 per cent in October, 1973.</P>

    <P>I decided on 20th December, 1973, to exclude the animal feedingstuffs industry from formal price control on the recommendation of the National Prices Commission and following consultations with the Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries and also with the various farmers' representative organisations.  These organisations had <Col N="1620" /> pressed strongly for the removal of price control from animal feedingstuffs and generally they welcomed the proposal.  A system of monitoring price changes and profit margins in the industry is now being put into operation.  I have also asked the Examiner of Restrictive Practices to keep the industry under review to help ensure that no practices aimed at restraining competition in the industry develop.</P>
    <P>The recommendations of the National Prices Commission were made on the basis that the keener competition which would result should prove more effective than formal price control in containing price increases and promoting much needed improvement in efficiency in the industry. These arrangements will be reviewed by the Commission after 12 months and it would be premature at this stage to make any judgment on their effectiveness.</P>
    <P>I have no evidence of excessive profits being made on the manufacture of animal feedingstuffs.  The new monitoring system will enable the manufacturers' profit margins to be kept under close scrutiny and will help to ensure that unwarranted increases in prices are not applied.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Gibbons</NameTxt>
      <P>It is most unsatisfactory to deal with all these important questions in a lump.  The result is that individual questions are not dealt with at all.  One of my questions has not been dealt with and for that reason I will put the question again to the Minister.  I should like to ask the Minister if a profit of £20 odd per ton to grain merchants is not excessive occurring between the period of last year's harvest and the 1st of this month?  I am talking about the prices paid for barley at the harvest, £42 to £43 per ton&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Gibbons</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not understand what the Minister means but I would like a reply to the question I have just put to him.  If the farmer got £43 for the grain at the time of the harvest and the merchant is now selling it back to the farmer at £65 per ton and upwards, does he consider that no more than a fair profit?  If the Minister does not consider it so what is he doing about it?  I believe it is excessive and the result is that people are being forced out of the pig industry.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickPower" hpid="Mr. Power Mr. Power">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Power</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister be in a position to state whether millers enjoy more favourable grants in terms of provision of storage space for barley and the subsequent manufacture of feeding stuffs than farmers enjoy?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JustinKeating" hpid="Mr. Keating Mr. Keating">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>On the last point, the matter of grants, the Deputy should put that question to the Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries who is responsible for farm grants.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickPower" hpid="Mr. Power Mr. Power">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Power</NameTxt>
      <P>Has the Minister for Industry and Commerce responsibility for grants to millers?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JustinKeating" hpid="Mr. Keating Mr. Keating">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>I have responsibility for some of them but without warning I cannot give an answer to that question. However, I would be happy that between the two of us the answer should be elicited.  Deputy Gibbons's Question No. 11, as verbalised by him, is very different from what appears on the Order Paper.  The fact that he did not get an answer to his Question No. 11, as he verbalised it here, was because it was quite different to what is on the Order Paper.  I accept that a lot of questions were joined together and this was done because they were closely related.  In a long answer we endeavoured to give a large amount of information in a complicated area.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Gibbons has asked me if I believe there has been profiteering in grain&mdash;he quoted a figure of £20 per ton&mdash;and if I condone it.  If there has been profiteering I condemn it as wholeheartedly as anyone in this House but the Deputy knows enough from his own experience both privately <Col N="1622" /> and in Government to know that the question of grain stocks is a complicated one.  In examining applications for price increases such as those which took place before 20th December the stocks were monitored to know if the increases could be deferred until grain purchased at the original price was used up.  At a time when prices are rising rapidly&mdash; I say this in relation to animal feedingstuffs and coal, to the whole population&mdash;and when different people have a different quantity of stocks there will be different prices.  Some people had no stock and had to buy at the new price with the result that the customers had to pay this increased price.  Some people had a lot of stock and in many cases they passed on that stock at the lower prices.  Prices have certainly been out of step at certain times.</P>
    <P>The National Prices Commission went into this carefully and the examiner of restrictive practices is looking at the industry to see if there has been profiteering.  If the Deputy has heard information that this is taking place as distinct from the rumours which he and I have heard I would be happy to receive it.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JustinKeating" hpid="Mr. Keating Mr. Keating">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>I have already answered that question but I am happy to reiterate the answer.  That action was taken in the light of unanimous advice and I believe, and notwithstanding the price rises which I deplore as sincerely as any Deputy, that it was correct in the circumstances and I do not propose to reintroduce controls.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JustinKeating" hpid="Mr. Keating Mr. Keating">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>The evidence is that there is increasing competition in the area of animal feedingstuffs and this is having some small benefit for the purchaser.  It is a time of rapidly rising prices and that is not evident.  I still believe that if there is a fixed price for animal feedingstuffs it tends to become the standard price.  This is an area where competition is important and in my view in the coming months it will bring some benefit to the consumers.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Gibbons</NameTxt>
      <P>Surely the Minister is aware, although he evidently does not know because he asked me for this information, that the standard price during the last harvest for barley of between 15 and 20 per cent moisture leaving the harvest field was about £42 to £43 per ton.  I know those prices are correct because that is the price for which I sold barley.  However, if I want a ton of my own barley back with the same moisture content I have to pay a lot more for it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>Under the existing price control arrangements for petroleum products, the prices which may be charged by Irish oil companies are linked to those charged by their parent or associated companies in the outer zone of the United Kingdom.  Since the UK companies charge different prices for their products in that zone, this has meant that the Irish companies may charge different prices for their products, including gas oil for central heating, provided those prices do not exceed the level of their parent or associated companies' prices in the UK outer zone.</P>
      <P>I should add, that since 21st February, 1974, the company referred to are charging 1.25p per gallon less than one Irish company and 0.25p more than the others, so that the differential mentioned by the Deputy has been virtually eliminated.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>The increases in the prices of home manufactured fertilisers in the period 14th March, 1973, to 3rd January, 1974, are available from the published monthly reports of the National Prices Commission which are in the Oireachtas Library and which are also circulated to each Deputy.  In addition to the price increases published to date in the commission's reports, Nitrigin Éireann Teo. increased their <Col N="1626" /> prices by amounts ranging from 26.6 per cent to 33.3 per cent with effect from 25th January, 1974, Goulding Chemicals Limited increased their prices on 1st February, 1974, by 35.3 per cent on average while Albatros Fertilisers implemented an average increase of 36.2 per cent on 4th February, 1974.  These increases are in accordance with the recommendation of the National Prices Commission as set out at paragraph 93 of their monthly report for November, 1973.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMGibbons" hpid="Mr. J. Gibbons Mr. J. Gibbons">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Gibbons</NameTxt>
      <P>Did I understand the Minister to say that certain increases took place up to 3rd January of this year and thereafter there were increases on those increased prices of 35.5 per cent, and so on, or is the Minister now talking about the total increases from 14th March last year to the latest available date?  Is he combining the two?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JustinKeating" hpid="Mr. Keating Mr. Keating">

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Gibbons</NameTxt>
      <P>Can the Minister give me any idea of the total percentage increase?  The percentages the Minister has given us refer only to the period from 3rd January last.  Before that there was a substantial increase also.  What is the combined increase? That is the answer sought in the question.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JustinKeating" hpid="Mr. Keating Mr. Keating">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>I may not have all the details the Deputy wants.  In April, 1973, there was an increase of 3 per cent for all three firms.  In May, 1973, there was an increase in the price of fertilisers containing potassium of 10p for each 1 per cent of potassium content. In July, 1973, there was an increase of 10 per cent for all three firms for concentrates and 6 per cent for the nitrogenous fertiliser manufactured by NET.  It is a matter for the Deputy to put those together because each of those was an increase on the preexisting price.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Gibbons</NameTxt>
      <P>It would be very difficult for an individual Deputy to make a synthesis of this kind without the facilities of the Department of Industry and Commerce at his back. <Col N="1627" /> The question I put down to the Minister sought that information, the synthesised information of all the increases together.  The Minister is now trying to minimise the increases by treating the increases from 3rd January last.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Crinion</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Industry and Commerce if he will take steps to keep pig meal prices uniform throughout the country as at present there is a variation of up to £14 per ton between the lowest and highest price.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Col N="1629" />
    <Speaker pid="JustinKeating" hpid="Mr. Keating Mr. Keating">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>I understand that the present variation in pig meal prices to which the Deputy refers may be due mainly to the fact that, while most manufacturers increased their prices by £13 per tonne in December last, some of them did not find it necessary to do so as they had in stock large supplies of grain purchased earlier in the year at much lower prices.  This price variation is likely, therefore, to disappear as these old stocks of grain run out.</P>
      <P>I do not propose to take any action to secure uniformity in the prices of pig meal.  I am satisfied that it is better to encourage competition by removing price control.  Under the new monitoring system which I have set up, these prices and the manufacturers' profit margins will be kept under the closest scrutiny.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>I am so aware.  It is like the point I made earlier in regard to coal and animal feedingstuffs.  At a time of rapid price changes, people who have old stocks at the old price, if they are decent, as some of them are, pass them on at the old price, whereas people who have to buy new stocks at the new price have to pass on the new price.  Some people are profiteering and some are not.  An inquiry will find out which is which and we will get the facts out to the public.</P>

      <P>Surely before allowing an increase in price, the Minister would satisfy himself as to how that increase would relate to stocks already in the country?

      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>This is a fairly important issue and a pretty serious allegation.  The Department of Transport and Power have information about the amount of stocks on 1st January.  The major increase in the oil supply to the distributors took place on 31st December.  A calculation was made of the number of days the stock existing at 1st January would last before new oil that had to be paid for at the higher price would come to the pumps.  In fact, the increase in the retail price in this country did not take place until a week after that stock had run out, and also until a week after a comparable price rise in the United Kingdom.</P>

      <P>The question of profits for the major oil companies are partly notional because they control all stages of the process, from the hole in the ground to the petrol pump, and they can take their profit at different parts in the chain.

      <P>Before the debate on this section was adjourned last week, there was a discussion as to whether there is a better way of dealing with the register of electors than that in operation since the late 1940s and I undertook to see if an improvement could be made.  I have examined the matter and I have found that the arrangements which are there at present are apparently the only reasonable method of dealing with this matter. I, therefore, do not think there is any need for change.  I am sure Deputy Molloy has also looked into the matter in the meantime and that he will agree with me.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Mr. Molloy Mr. Molloy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister undertook to examine this matter in relation to the publication and the continuance of supply of the register. There was discussion on the question of wastage of public money and the Minister was to see if the regulations or the law governing this matter were adequate or if the anomaly which we suggested could occur.  He has now merely informed the House he is satisfied that the law governing this matter at the moment is adequate.  I should like to ask him to explain if this wastage of public money will take place or whether the Minister considers there is a wastage of public money.  I am wondering if the Minister might elaborate on his very brief statement.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickPower" hpid="Mr. Power Mr. Power">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Power</NameTxt>
      <P>During his statement on this section, the Minister referred continually to what has happened before, to what was done by previous Ministers.  Even if some of these Ministers were Fianna Fáil Ministers, that does not necessarily mean they were always correct any more than it means that the present Minister is correct.  The practice of looking back and giving past practice as the reason for doing something is not the best <Col N="1639" /> way.  The fact that Mr. Boland or Deputy Blaney did something in this regard does not make it correct.</P>
      <P>Am I right in saying that when the register is being compiled it is a matter for the county council and that naturally every county council will deal with the county as defined by the county boundary and that it is necessary to keep a current register available in case of a by-election?  Take my county with which the Minister is well acquainted.  Although Kildare County Council would deal with the compiling of the register for the whole county, they would also deal with the portion of the county that is in the constituency of Meath.  At the moment they would have County Kildare and parts of the constituency of Meath.  They are still awaiting news of future new electoral areas.</P>
    </Speaker>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Power</NameTxt>
      <P>We were not given it at our meeting on Monday.  It would be essential to know about these new electoral areas when compiling the register.  The present system as it operates is possibly the best one.  It would not be a matter of compiling a new register.  In some cases it might mean separating different sections of it but it would be merely a matter of printing over &ldquo;Meath&rdquo; with &ldquo;Kildare&rdquo; or <i>vice versa</i>, as the case may be.  I think the present system is the best.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Power has put it better than I could.  The situation is simply that I agreed to have another look at this to see if it could be improved. Having done so, I am satisfied that the arrangements made in 1947, long before the time of Deputy Blaney or Mr. Boland, are the best. This matter was discussed time and again and it was apparently agreed this was the proper way to do it.  I do not believe in change for change sake.  If somebody wants an example, I can mention that of Crossakiel, in the county electoral area of Ceanannus Mór.  It was in the constituency of Cavan from 1969.  This will be printed again in this way but it will be overprinted with &ldquo;Constituency Meath, <Col N="1640" /> 1974&rdquo;.  There will be no extra printing. It is the cheapest way that it can be done and if Deputies can think of a cheaper way I should be pleased to get their suggestions.  It is also the most efficient way.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>What is the reason for the difference in terminology in subsections (1) and (2)?  Subsection (1) refers to where a polling district or part of a polling district is situate in what amounts to a new constituency.</P>
      <P>the Minister may by direction provide for the entry of the name of that constituency in respect of the polling district or part of the polling district....</P>
      <P>Subsection (2) states:</P>
      <P>Where a constituency specified in the Schedule to this Act is identical in area with none of the constituencies existing at the passing of this Act, a postal voters list or lists shall be prepared in respect of it by the registration authority or registration authorities concerned as soon as may be after such passing.</P>
      <P>It seems strange to me that there is a specific obligation on the registration authority to prepare a new postal voters list immediately after the passing of this Act, and it is given no discretion about this but, on the other hand, a matter that surely is at least as important, the preparation of new registers for new constituencies, is subject to the discretion of the Minister who, in the words of subsection (1), may by direction provide for the entry of the name, and so on.  It seems to me very strange that a registration authority should be compelled by this section to draw up immediately a new list of postal voters but that the Minister is given discretion as to whether or not he will give directions about the naming or the drawing up of a register for a new constituency that is created under this Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are situations which are much more complex than the sort of example the Minister was giving in <Col N="1641" /> reply to Deputy Power because at the moment there are polling stations and, accordingly, issues of the register in respect of which two or three partial polling districts have to vote at a particular polling station.  The register is drawn on the basis that all the people of a particular issue of it vote at one place but I know of numerous examples in County Limerick at least&mdash; and I am sure the same applies elsewhere&mdash;where part of three different district electoral divisions vote together at one polling station.  They are not the whole of these three electoral divisions and they are not the whole of any one of them but they are part of each of three of them.</P>
    <P>It does not arise in County Limerick that under this Bill any change is made as between the two Dáil constituencies there but inevitably it arises in a great many other constituencies and you will have situations therefore, where part of an electoral division which is in one constituency at the moment with parts of other electoral divisions is being removed, with the remainder of the first electoral division, into another constituency and it is therefore, impossible for the registration authority simply to print the new name of the constituency on top of the register because part of what is in that particular register&mdash; and when I talk about register here now I mean the three or four or five sheets that relate to one particular polling place&mdash;part of that will be in one constituency and part of it will be in another and it is not simply a question of overprinting it.  That cannot be done.</P>
    <P>A whole new register would have to be prepared if part of an existing one is in one constituency and part of it is in another one.  What I do not like is that an obligation is imposed by this section on the registration authority, which is the local authority, to prepare immediately new lists of postal voters but discretion is given to the Minister about whether or not new issues of the register for a new constituency that might arise if and when this Bill is passed, will be printed.  This, of course, makes the position impossible for Deputies or <Col N="1642" /> prospective Deputies or councillors or prospective councillors because they do not know where they stand.  One can assume that this Bill will not be law before 15th April next.  The registration authorities have an obligation to provide a full register in relation to the existing constituencies and to publish it on the 15th April or shortly before the 15th April, 1974.  If this Bill were to be passed after the 15th April, 1974, unless it is written into this section that a new register would be provided then, there will in effect be no register from then until the 15th April, 1975, in constituencies which are changed, if a general election were to be called between 15th April, 1974 and 15th April, 1975.  The duties of the local registration authority should, therefore, be spelt out in subsection (1).  It should not be left to the discretion of the Minister, as is proposed here, so that we would not have the sort of situation that I am talking about and that will undoubtedly arise in many different constituencies.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>It is rather extraordinary to hear Deputy O'Malley making comments like these because, as I said previously, it is not unusual to find people who have come into this House for the first time, who are not aware of how things are done, making mistakes.  Deputy O'Malley must know that what he has said is not correct.  For instance, as far as the question of the phraseology is concerned, it is for some peculiar reason &mdash;I do not pretend to understand all the reasons&mdash;that the parliamentary draftsmen use certain phrases.  They believe that it is the correct phrase which is used in subsection (1) of section 6 and they have been using it right down through the years and it has worked admirably.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As far as subsection (2) is concerned, again I think Deputy O'Malley should know with regard to postal voters, it simply means in most cases not more than about 100 names. It is quite a simple matter immediately to arrange for a list of 100 names, or whatever number it may be.  That is quite a simple job.  It is a different <Col N="1643" /> thing altogether where there are 60,000 names which have to be done if it were to be done immediately with regard to the other one.  As I have said, the register is drawn up and the new constituency is marked on the portions of it where it must be marked and if a polling area is broken into one or two or three or more, as it may be, then there are separate pages of sections in the booklet and they are specially marked and this is being done.  If Deputy O'Malley cares to go to some of his colleagues who are in one of the constituencies where this is happening at present, he can be shown a copy of the existing register where this situation arises.  It is quite a simple matter.  In the case of the one I have in my hand here, Crossakiel, part of the county electoral area of Ceannanus Mór, in fact, part of this is in Cavan and part is in County Meath.  We did not find any difficulty at all.  If it had been over a few miles, part of it would be Cavan, part Meath and part Monaghan, which happened the last time, and, in effect, the one register would work in that way.  It is quite a simple process and I assure the House that it is the easiest way of dealing with this matter and there is no question of anybody trying to pull a fast one or no question of things being done incorrectly.  This is and has been proved to be the simplest way of doing it and the most effective way of doing it.  That being so, there does not seem to be any reason why we should have to do anything with it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Mr. Molloy Mr. Molloy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not know whether the Minister feels that he has, in fact, replied to the point made by Deputy O'Malley.  The only information that I could glean from the reply was that this was the way the parliamentary draftsmen had decided that it should be worded and that he should not be asked to explain why the parliamentary draftsmen had decided to word it in such a way.  It is obvious that there are two different methods being employed, one for the ordinary register and the other for the list of postal voters.  I would like to remind the Minister that when we were discussing <Col N="1644" /> this on the 20th February he stated that the Minister's direction would be given at the dissolution of the Dáil but in this case it states that in relation to postal voters it can be prepared immediately after the passing of this Bill.  I do not think it is good enough of the Minister just to state that this is the way the parliamentary draftsmen had decided to word it.  There is an obvious difference in the mechanics being suggested in the Bill as to how these registers should be drawn up and the Minister should give a clear explanation of it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not propose to proceed to answer the same question again and again in the House nor should I be asked to do it.  Deputy Molloy has got the answer and he has got it as clearly as it could be given. He was told the last night when we were discussing this matter that even though the direction is not given until the Dáil is dissolved, the authorities who are drawing up the registers do make the necessary preparations immediately and, therefore, have the registers ready waiting for the direction to be given so that they can be distributed.  That is No. 1. No. 2, in regard to the question of the postal vote, they do it in the very same way. They prepare them immediately and there is no reason why they should not do so when the number is so small. There is nothing further that I can explain.  As far as I am concerned, I have explained it fully and I think everybody who wants to understand can do so.  I asked if anybody had any suggestions.  Can anybody in the House suggest a better way of doing it?  I cannot, but if somebody can show me a better way of doing it, most certainly I shall have another look at it.  So far, this has not happened. Even from the time when the Bill was first published in October until now nobody has suggested a different way of doing it.  I am satisfied this is the proper way and unless the Opposition can produce some better proposal I think we should get on with the business.</P>

I do not claim to understand every one of the reasons why they do this but they have done it over the years in this type of Bill and it has been accepted by the House and has worked properly.  In regard to subsection (2) I made it very clear that the reason why it was done in this way was that the people who were preparing the register of postal voters can do so immediately because the number is very small, about 100 as against 60,000 in the other case.  It is as simple as that.  I do not think anybody should be surprised or could not understand what it means.</P>

He may do these things &ldquo;before the dissolution of Dáil Éireann which next occurs after the passing of this Act...&rdquo; In other words, the subsection which the Minister is purporting to elucidate to us now provides specifically for the direct opposite of what the Minister has stated and reiterated in a reply to me now about which I did not misquote him.  The only time that the Minister under the subsection could give this direction is before the dissolution of Dáil Éireann which next occurs after the passing of this Act.

      <P>The Minister said the Bill had been circulated since October and that so far no amendments have been tabled to this section. From recollection, in the case of the previous Bill brought in by the Fianna Fáil Government no amendments of any kind were tabled on Committee Stage.  It was only on Report Stage that the important schedule amendment was tabled.  This is my recollection and I may be wrong.  We have plenty of time yet to put down amendments to this section.  What we are trying to do is to get a clarification of section 6 and the procedure under which the Minister will operate.  If this is clarified to our satisfaction and we know what is intended, very well, but there is an opportunity for us to put down amendments if we are not happy with the Minister's explanation. And I do not think we are.</P>

      <P>We are endeavouring to elucidate a difficult section.  I asked a net, precise question of the Minister.  He refuses to reply, first, on the grounds that everyone understands it and, secondly, on the grounds that he already replied to it&mdash;which he did not&mdash;and now he sits silent for a long period.  Then in order to get out of his embarrassment he invites Deputy Joe Dowling to contribute on the section. We now have the situation that one asks in good faith a precise, net question of the Minister to which, presumably, there must be some answer in the light of the Minister's earlier statement but because he is caught and his back is to the wall and because he has contradicted himself he does not want to give an answer and he endeavours to get the discussion on to some other point.  It is no harm to draw the attention of the House to this fact.  When the Minister is in error he tries to bluff his way out of it and tries to invite <Col N="1648" /> other Deputies to speak on the point so that his confusion will be covered up.  Do we take it that there is still no answer from the Minister?</P>

They were prepared to accept them when they were in office as being in order. They obviously intend keeping up this charade.  They either understand or they do not.  I have given my answer and I do not propose to make little of Members of this House by listening to the rather foolish points made by Deputy O'Malley, Deputy Molloy, Deputy Cunningham or anybody else. If they continue to make the same points over and over again, so long as you, Sir, allow them to do it, they are entitled to do so, but I do not intend to waste the time of the House by continually answering the same question. This was done on section 2 for almost five and a half hours when, they spoke in favour of 148 Members and then voted against it.  If they want to do this again they can do so.</P>

I have heard the question, I have heard the answers but I am not clear on the Minister's reply.  I cannot understand how it relates to Deputy O'Malley's question.  It is necessary for us on this side of the House to be clear what the Minister has in mind in order to frame, if necessary, an amendment to this section.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>As the Minister is unwilling to debate the merits or demerits of this section, except to make personally abusive observations on the <i>bona fides</i> of any Deputy who dares to question any word in this Bill, I will return to my original point.</P>
      <P>There is a strange and significant difference in terminology between subsections (1) and (2).  Subsection (1) states that the Minister may by direction provide for certain things as if it were optional.  He may not give that direction at all.  The register may never be corrected between the passage of this Act and the holding of the next general election.  Whether it is corrected will lie within the discretion of the Minister.  On the other hand, subsection (2) states that</P>
      <P>a postal voters list or lists shall be prepared in respect of it by the registration authority or registration authorities concerned as soon as may be after such passing.</P>
      <P>It is very significant that there is an obligation on the registration authority under subsection (2) but there is no obligation on anyone under subsection (1) and it may never be done.  The Minister has asked for suggestions as to how the section may be improved. Why could subsection (1) not be amended to read on the same lines as subsection (2)?  Instead of using the words &ldquo;the Minister may by direction provide&rdquo; he could use &ldquo;the registration authorities shall prepare a list of XYZ&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister has made a point that it is easy to prepare a list of postal voters because they run to only 100 or so and changes in the register as a result of this Bill may run into tens of thousands.  I accept that a registration authority could not print and publish <Col N="1651" /> a new register for a whole constituency within a very short time if major changes were made by this Bill.  They need not be obliged under subsection (1) to do it within a very short time. Words could be added like &ldquo;as soon as conveniently possible&rdquo; or &ldquo;as soon as is feasible&rdquo; or some words like that which would leave them a reasonable period of time in which to draw up a new register.  The words used in subsection (2) are &ldquo;as soon as may be after such passing&rdquo;.  That is a vague phrase which I imagine means &ldquo;as soon as they can possibly do it&rdquo;.  We must make allowance for the fact that the reprinting of an entire register is a complicated matter and a phrase as suggested could be inserted in subsection (1).</P>
    <P>We might consider putting down an amendment to make these matters clearer either on the Committee Stage of this section, assuming that this section will continue until 10.30 tonight and progress is reported on it or, alternatively, if the discussion on this section were to finish before 10.30 tonight, we would consider putting down an amendment for Report Stage on the lines I have suggested.  If the Minister were to explain to me why such an amendment should not be put down or why it would not improve the situation as it is ambiguously expressed in this section, I would consider not putting down such an amendment.  Why is the wording in subsection (1) better than my suggestion?</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy O'Malley is being reasonable.  As a layman I consider his suggestion is a reasonable one, but my officials inform me that the section as worded is the correct phraseology.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>They consider that this wording has stood the test of time.  If I was drafting the Bill originally and there was no Bill there which had this phraseology in it I would be inclined to say exactly as Deputy O'Malley has said.  However, if the wording in the Bill is the wording which has been in operation for nearly 30 years it is a <Col N="1652" /> different matter.  We do not know everything, and the officials who are the experts in this matter tell me that the wording in it is more correct than the wording which is proposed by Deputy O'Malley.</P>
      <P>I have not a closed mind on these things and if wording comes which appears better I have no objection to making a change either in this House or when the Bill goes before the Seanad, but if the existing wording is better I do not want to change it.  It is as simple as that.</P>

      <P>I am delighted to see that the Minister and this side of the House are on better terms after our little tiff earlier on the subsection. The Minister is honest enough to agree that the wording I have suggested to him now is superior, in his view as a layman, to the wording that appears in subsection (1).  I should like to draw the attention of the House to what I regard as an ominous development in this Legislature.  The Minister, having agreed with me that my wording seemed to him as a Member of the House to be superior, went on to say that he could not accept it because his two officials did not agree with it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>I am repeating what the Minister said in relation to my proposed new wording for part of this subsection.  He said that his officials advised against it, that they thought the wording used in the section was more satisfactory than the alternative <Col N="1653" /> wording which I suggested and which the Minister seemed to think was clearer and more suitable.  In my view it is carrying bureaucracy too far if we have in this House a Minister who agrees with several members of the Opposition that an alternative wording to a section suggested by the Opposition is clearer and is preferable, but because of advice received he feels he cannot accept that wording.  Presumably if it was put to a vote of this House this House would, on the strength of that advice, have to vote against something which both sides of this House feel is superior to what is in the Bill.  It is a sign of our times that this should be the position but this, unfortunately, is the position.</P>
      <P>We understand by deduction, if not specifically, that the reason given to the Minister for the alleged superiority of the phraseology in the subsection is the fact that it stood the test of time or that it was used in previous Bills.  Those of us who watch what happens in the courts see that quite frequently nowadays Bills and wording in Bills and Acts which were regarded by everybody in this House when they were being passed as satisfactory and suitable were found to be defective in some way or other.  Some of them were so defective that they were found to be contrary to the Constitution although some years ago a lot of people would not have believed that such could be the case.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Therefore, there is a duty on all of us, not least on the Opposition, to seek to improve the wording of sections which are obscure.  We have the unique position here that I, having made some suggestions, have obtained the agreement, fairly given, of the Minister that my suggestions are good ones, that the wording I suggested is, in his view as a Minister, superior to the existing terminology but, nonetheless, this House, the elected representatives of the people, are to be precluded now from making a change that all of us on both sides of the House feel to be desirable.  Is this bureaucracy gone mad?  Is this the truth of the allegation that is made from time to time in this country that the real seat of power is <Col N="1654" /> not this House or the Cabinet room in Government Buildings?</P>
    <P>This problem goes deeper and is of much greater significance than simply the wording or the alternative wording of subsection (1) of section 6 of the Electoral (Amendment) (No. 2) Bill, 1973.</P>

      <P>Not this Bill, but every other Bill.  I want to point out to Deputy Molloy and to Deputy O'Malley who have held ministerial office that if they think they will cod the House or the country by saying that they drafted the Bills which came before the House in their time they are incorrect.  These Bills are drafted by the parliamentary draftsmen.  I want the country to know this because Deputy O'Malley and Deputy Molloy want to give the impression that they were the people who drafted these Bills.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I want to make it very clear to Deputy O'Malley and Deputy Molloy that the parliamentary draftsmen, in their wisdom, have drafted the ideas which we had in a certain way and those ideas are here.  I did not decide on the drafting of this Bill; I did not decide that this phraseology should be used.  They are the words which were used before a lot of us came into this House and before a lot of us were born.  That being so, it is rather ridiculous that someone from the Fianna <Col N="1655" /> Fáil benches, after being satisfied for so long that the draftsmen were doing a good job, should object to the drafting of the Bill and state that there is a drafting error.</P>
    <P>My comment was that as a layman I thought that the phraseology used by Deputy O'Malley would be preferable to the words used in the drafting of the Bill.  If Deputy O'Malley wants to put down an amendment to it I would be prepared to look at it.  I have not a closed mind.  The advice came from the experts, and every one of us in Government, and those who have been in any Government at any time, must depend to an extent in dealing with matters of this kind on the expert advice given.  Although some people like to claim they are experts on everything I do not so claim and I take advice on matters like this from people who know more about it than I.  There is no point in having a long drawn-out discussion on this.  If the Deputies wish to have the matter amended they know the procedure for doing so.  There is nothing to stop them putting down an amendment on Report Stage or in the Seanad or, if this goes on long enough, they might be able to do it the next time this comes before the House.  I am prepared to look at it.  As it is, I am assured that the wording is correct and does, and has done, and has been proved to do, what was intended when the Bill was first written many years ago.</P>

      <P>Subsection (2) of section 6 speaks of postal voters.  This being an Electoral (Amendment) Bill the Minister and the Government should have taken this opportunity to amend what has been proved through years of experience to be a completely inadequate postal voting system.  They should have made arrangements to give postal votes to commercial travellers, to senior citizens, to hospital patients, and to many other people.  In England, where there is a general election in progress at the moment, we see that postal voting is quite common.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cunningham</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister said that the ordinary list of voters was so large that he had to adopt the procedure in an early part of the section, that is, that it will be dealt with after the dissolution of the Dáil, but that the numbers of postal voters were so small that they could be compiled by the registration authorities earlier.  In reply to Deputy Burke he said he was having a look at legislation which may be introduced to extend the list of postal voters.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Indeed it could be a pretty hefty <Col N="1660" /> extension of the list of voters, with the result that before the next election this legislation could be introduced and passed by this House extending the postal vote to a substantial section of the community, but he is differentiating here between the ordinary method of voting and the register and the postal register and before the election legislation which may increase the number of postal voters to equal the number of registered voters who can vote only personally at polling booths, so, therefore, the logic of his argument for subsection (2) is not clear to me.  Why not provide for this and if he does provide for an enlarged postal register, the argument he has used for the wording here disappears?</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidAndrews" hpid="Mr. Andrews Mr. Andrews">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Andrews</NameTxt>
      <P>The point made by Deputy Burke was extremely valid. That is the first point.  The second point is made by Deputy O'Malley that it is not being properly dealt with here by the Minister.  The Minister said that the wording proposed by Deputy O'Malley was superior to the wording in the Bill.  It is very fair of the Minister to admit that.  We accept it entirely, but the principle involved here is a very serious principle and it was enunciated very well by Deputy O'Malley when he asked if the will of this Parliament is superior to the will of the bureaucracy.  Let me make it very clear that when I had the opportunity on the Estimate for the Department of Justice I said that at no stage would I engage in the cowardly practice of attacking public servants. It is not my practice, or the practice of this side of the House, to engage in that form of attack so that when I speak of the superiority of the legislature <Col N="1661" /> as against that of the bureaucracy, I do so in the best possible way. Is the will of the elected representatives&mdash;and this is the principle which we must have clarified by the Minister &mdash;superior to that of the bureaucracy?</P>
      <P>The Minister says that as a layman he would accept the proposal put forward by Deputy O'Malley as an absolutely acceptable proposal.  He admits that the wording of the Bill is inferior to the wording proposed by Deputy O'Malley and you, Sir, as Leas-Cheann Comhairle and as an elected Member of the House, must appreciate that it has been suggested here and almost supported by the Minister that in some way he as Minister rates second to the bureaucrats. This is a very serious admission by the Minister, who goes on in his usual offensive fashion to suggest that this proposal was made when Fianna Fáil were in Government and that the will of the bureaucrats ruled rather than that of the then Government and to suggest that the Cabinet now are in charge of everything is very doubtful and I do not accept for one moment that what the Minister has enunciated here is acceptable and we must challenge him to be articulate and to be quite clear as to which is superior, the elected representative of the people, elected to represent the bureaucrat and everybody else, or some other non-elected persons.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That is the reason Deputy O'Malley quite properly brought up the question of the Minister's suggestion that what Deputy O'Malley was putting forward was superior to what the Minister has on offer in the Bill.  If the Minister accepts that what Deputy O'Malley proposes is superior to what he has in the Bill, surely he must agree without equivocation that what Deputy O'Malley has said is superior must be accepted by him.  To come in here with the suggestion that because a particular wording has been there for aeons, it should continue to be used as a good precedent is shallow thinking, loose thinking.  If the Minister accepts that the wording proposed by Deputy O'Malley is better, he must enshrine what Deputy <Col N="1662" /> O'Malley has said in the Bill.  The Minister has been fair when he says that if Deputy O'Malley puts forward an amendment he will have a look at it.  I hope the Minister will do that when the Deputy brings in the amendment.</P>
    <P>What is involved here is the principle of the predominance of the Dáil as the legislative assembly of this country.  If Deputy O'Malley does not put forward an amendment, in view of what the Minister has said regarding the wording proposed by the Deputy and its superiority to that proposed in this section, he has a bounden obligation to bring in his own amendment.  By doing this he will prove he is in charge of his Department. I do not want to vilify the Minister; he was correct in what he said.  He adopted an honest approach but that honesty must continue to a logical conclusion, namely, the acceptance of the wording proposed by Deputy O'Malley as better.  If he does not accept the Deputy's wording, he has an obligation to put in his own wording.  At least this would show the Minister is in charge of his Department.</P>
    <P>I am sure my colleagues on this side of the House will pursue this point.  If the Minister is not prepared to stand up for the predominant legislative functions of the House, so far as legislation is concerned Fianna Fáil have an obligation with regard to the predominant position of the Dáil.  The elected representatives are the only people entitled to make legislation here.  If laws are found to be defective they can be tested in the courts; in fact, from time to time laws have been found to be unconstitutional. However, as long as laws remain unchallenged they remain the laws of the country and the elected representatives are responsible for them.</P>
    <P>That was the important principle expressed by Deputy O'Malley but it was brushed over by the Minister for Local Government.  I know the Minister is impatient, he has all the failings of man&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="DavidAndrews" hpid="Mr. Andrews Mr. Andrews">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Andrews</NameTxt>
      <P>We appreciate the Minister wants a quick passage of the Bill but we cannot let a principle which involves the predominant position of this House regarding legislation go by default.  Fianna Fáil cannot understand why the Minister does not accept the wording put forward by Deputy O'Malley, particularly as he has admitted it is better than that contained in the Bill.  It is difficult to understand his thinking on this matter. The fact that the wording used has been in existence during the years does not make it better than what Deputy O'Malley suggested.  If he does not accept the wording suggested by Deputy O'Malley, the Minister has an obligation to bring in his own amendment in place of what he considers to be the inferior wording of the Bill.</P>
      <P>I would ask the Chair to bear with me for a moment while I deal with subsection (2) of section 6.  I should like to put this subsection on the record of the House.  It states:</P>
      <P>Where a constituency specified in the Schedule to this Act&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      <P>the Schedule is a long one and I shall not attempt to set it out in my contribution.</P>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;is identical in area with none of the constituencies existing at the passing of this Act, a postal voters list or lists shall be prepared in respect of it by the registration authority or registration authorities concerned as soon as may be after such passing.</P>

The Minister said he hoped&mdash;we hope it is not a pious hope&mdash;at some time to introduce a Bill to include other categories such as commercial travellers, old age pensioners and so on.

      <P>I might, perhaps, help in this matter.  I said I hoped to be in a position to bring in legislation for the purpose of extending the postal vote. The reason why I could not include it in this Bill, even if I had wanted to, is that the necessary work had not been done to find out who could or should be included.  This work was started by me only a few months ago. It has reached a fairly advanced stage but not enough to be able to put it into the form of legislation.  For that reason I felt the thing to do would be to introduce a short Bill later which I am quite sure will be accepted by <Col N="1665" /> everyone in the House.  I suggest that the Deputy would leave it at that.</P>

In regard to the point which the Chair was trying to make, the classes of voters involved in the voters list, to which Deputy Andrews is now referring and on which Deputy Burke had a ruling from the Chair, was set out in the 1963 Act.  That is what is in this Bill and that is what we are concerned with at the moment.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Andrews</NameTxt>
      <P>There is just one matter that should be referred to.  It is the question of the draft register.  This is referred to in subsection (1) of section 6.  Up to recent times my experience has been that the draft register has been haphazardly compiled. This has been cured in the last three or four years.  Let us be fair to the Minister and to his predecessor.  We received forms to ensure that persons who had been excluded through no <Col N="1670" /> fault of their own from the draft register would be included.  The forms were sent to us by the Minister.  This was a helpful exercise and a democratic action on the part of the Minister, for which he is to be thanked.  It was a reminder to bring the draft register up to date.  I would like to pay tribute to the Minister on that account.  It is important from the democratic point of view that everybody eligible should be included on the draft register.  It is most unfortunate that the Minister precludes the old age pensioner, the commercial traveller&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I do not wish to be clever or smart at your expense, quite the contrary, but I would point out that the Minister did send us a reminder to include in the draft register persons whom we knew to be excluded for some reason or another. They might be in a new district. Why then does the Minister not at this late stage accept the proposal put forward by this side of the House for the inclusion of the categories at present disfranchised for no reason other than that the House will not get wise to themselves and see to it that there is an additional subsection to section 6 or an addition to the Schedule?</P>

    <P>That in section 6 subsection (1), <Col N="1671" /> page 3, line 1, to delete the words &ldquo;Minister may by direction provide for the entry of&rdquo; and substitute therefor the words &ldquo;registration authority or registration authorities concerned shall as soon as may be after the passing of this Act enter&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>I should like to ask the House if it would agree to accept that amendment from the Opposition.  It is being done in all good faith.  The arguments in its favour have been ably elucidated by Members on this side.  There is an obvious anomaly in the construction of subsections (1) and (2) of section 6.

      <P>We accept that the Minister would require some time to read the amendment but we point out that this debate will be adjourned at 6 o'clock to allow other business to go on between then and 7.30.  As the change proposed by us merely corrects an anomaly in the wording of those two subsections an hour-and-a-half would be sufficient time for the Minister to consider fully whether he should accept the amendment.  All we are asking now is that the House should accept the amendment for debate; we are not asking the Minister to commit himself to accepting it as an amendment to the Bill.</P>

Afterwards, I have four deputations to meet before 7.30.  Deputy Molloy might find his way of doing it very convenient but it cannot be dealt with in that way.  I said that as a layman I could see nothing wrong with Deputy O'Malley's proposal but my Departmental experts&mdash;and they are experts&mdash;suggest that the existing wording is better.  I should like to have this fully discussed with them and also with the Government.  The Bill has been approved by the Government and I shall have to discuss it with my colleagues before agreeing to change it. If Fianna Fáil are so anxious to have the Bill changed, they should put down the amendment for the next Stage.  Originally, this section was drafted by the Fianna Fáil Party and has stood the test of time.</P>

      <P>I disagree with the wording of subsection (1) and in particular with the words &ldquo;the Minister may by direction...&rdquo;.  I believe it is the duty of the Opposition to try to perfect legislation.

This is a very important <Col N="1674" /> phrase in the subsection, &ldquo;the Minister may by direction...&rdquo;.  Quite substantial time and effort have gone into the study of the Bill by many Members of the House, particularly on this side.  The Minister knows from the amendments submitted that considerable time and effort went into trying to perfect this legislation in accordance with the duty of elected representatives.</P>
      <P>I distrust the Minister and do not like to see power in his hands.  The somersaults turned before may be turned again if we give the Minister this power.

      <P>Commonsense will dictate that more suitable wording of the subsection will be accepted.  The Minister has already indicated that as a layman he considers that there is a more superior wording.  It is peculiar to hear him say that when he is not prepared to back his own judgement. Surely that is what legislation is all about.  A Minister may accept and has accepted the views of representatives in this House particularly when he considers them to be superior to those embodied in a Bill.  The Minister will have legislation forced through this House which is not as effective as it should be because he has the necessary jackboots to boot it through the <Col N="1677" /> division lobby.  Therefore, &ldquo;the Minister by direction&rdquo; must be eliminated before we will be satisfied.</P>
      <P>We will have another opportunity of presenting amendments.  I fail to see why the Minister does not agree to a reasonable amendment which would make this legislation superior to what it is at the moment.  The Minister hides behind the term &ldquo;layman&rdquo;. He should come clean and say that Deputy O'Malley's suggestion is reasonable and superior to that embodied in the Bill.</P>
      <P>The Minister does not seem to be concerned about the voice of elected representatives.  He will not accept suggestions or amendments from other Deputies because they are not his amendments.  The Minister should give a clear indication that he will amend this subsection as already indicated by Deputy O'Malley, Deputy Molloy and Deputy Andrews.  I hope he will be reasonable and will change his attitude.</P>
      <P>There should be a common format for the printing of registers of electors. There is a great deal of confusion from one area to another, one constituency to another, or one county to another.  The Dublin register is very cumbersome, although it is easy to understand.  Nevertheless, some of the other registers are difficult to follow.  Therefore the Minister should suggest a uniform layout for these registers.  He has an opportunity now to correct past defects and ensure that we will have legislation which is superior because of suggestions by other Members.</P>

    <P>The following motion was moved by Deputy Blaney on 26th February, 1974:</P>
    <P>That Dáil Éireann reaffirms the following resolution, unanimously passed on the 10th May, 1949, protesting against British legislation endorsing Partition:</P>
    <P>Dáil Éireann,</P>
    <P>Solemnly reasserting the indefeasible right of the Irish nation to the unity and integrity of the national territory,</P>
    <P>Reaffirming the sovereign right of the people of Ireland to choose its own form of Government and, through its democratic institutions, to decide all questions of national policy, free from outside interference,</P>
    <P>Repudiating the claim of the British Parliament to enact legislation affecting Ireland's territorial integrity in violation of those rights, and</P>
    <P>Pledging the determination of the Irish people to continue the struggle against the unjust and unnatural partition of our country until it is brought to a successful conclusion;</P>
    <P>Places on record its indignant protest against the introduction in the British Parliament of legislation purporting to endorse and continue the existing partition of Ireland, and</P>

    <P>&mdash;recalls the efforts of successive Governments over the past 25 years to bring about a spirit of harmony, understanding and co-operation between these different elements in the interest of the common welfare,</P>

    <P Just="Right">&mdash;(An Taoiseach.)</P>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="Mr. J. Lynch Mr. J. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>Yesterday I was dealing with aspects of the Sunningdale Agreement on which we had some reservations, the principal one of which was paragraph five.  The Taoiseach in his speech has done nothing to remove these reservations. It may be, notwithstanding the decision of the Supreme Court, the judgment it has given to the effect that the Government have not acted unconstitutionally in signing the Sunningdale communiqué which contained paragraph five, that the Taoiseach has not seen fit at this stage to give any explanation or any clarification of it.  He may have other reasons but I do not think the one he advanced yesterday, that he must await the handing down of the Supreme Court judgment, is a sufficient reason for that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I make no attempt to anticipate the reasons that the Supreme Court will give for its unanimous decision but the fact is that at the moment the President is regarded as the custodian of our Constitution.  In the ultimate, the Supreme Court will decide <Col N="1680" /> whether or not any Act, legislative or otherwise, is constitutional.  I say &ldquo;otherwise&rdquo; designedly because the Supreme Court has said that only when a matter decided by the Government is incorporated into legislation has it seisin of this particular aspect of Government administration. There are acts which the Government may do, acts any citizen or any group of citizens may do, which can be called into question as being in contravention of the Constitution.  For example, we know that trade unions have taken certain actions which have been declared to be unconstitutional by the Supreme Court.</P>
    <P>Be that as it may, only the people themselves can ultimately change the Constitution in any respect. It must be recognised that if the Sunningdale Agreement is implemented to the point of setting up the Council of Ireland there will have to be constitutional changes, changes in many areas which, perhaps, will not cause any degree of concern to the people generally.  However, if paragraph 5 infringes in any way the Constitution, and indications are that it does not, but if it does only the people ultimately can decide whether article 2 of the Constitution which is the sovereignty Article in the Constitution may be changed.</P>
    <P>What disturbs people is that Northern participants at Sunningdale have frequently and persistently given their interpretation of paragraph 5 which would seem to conflict with Article 2 of the Constitution.  At the same time no interpretation or clarification is forthcoming from our representatives at Sunningdale.  The attitude is that we must take Sunningdale as it is or leave it.  In the circumstances it is not unreasonable for us to request clarification.  I want to repeat that there are many parts of the Sunningdale communiqué with which we are in agreement and which we support; but, in supporting it, it is not unreasonable for us to question parts of it which are not readily understood or to criticise parts of it with which we do not readily agree.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1681" /> The Taoiseach, in the course of his speech yesterday, mentioned on a number of occasions the need for accommodation by the different traditions of the views of each other.  A reasonable sequiter of that admonition is that the Government might accommodate the views represented and expressed by our party instead of adopting the &ldquo;take it or leave it&rdquo; attitude.  The Executive in the North is now working and as far as can be seen is working well and diligently and addressing itself to the social and economic needs of the people of the North.  This is in itself a tremendous achievement; the representatives of both communities are working in harmony for the greater good of the entire community in Northern Ireland, notwithstanding that their efforts are being thwarted and frustrated by extremists on both sides who for their own reasons are trying to deny the kind of progress in extending brotherhood and in making economic and social progress in the North.</P>
    <P>While the representatives of each tradition in that Executive make no attempt, and I believe have expressed themselves so, to dominate the other, who would have thought 25 years ago, 20 years ago or even five years ago that this would have been possible? As in the Executive so I anticipate it will be in the Council of Ireland.  Five years ago when I was urging a change in the institutions of Northern Ireland and urging new methods of co-operation between North and South, I said that our aim was not to extend the domination of Dublin. That statement still holds good as far as my party and I are concerned in relation to the Council of Ireland. Even if there was a desire on the part of one side to dominate the other then the proposed structure and composition of the Council of Ireland as indicated in the Sunningdale communiqué would, I believe, make that impossible. Therefore, if the Executive in the North can work for the greater good of the people within the jurisdiction, how much more good could a Council of Ireland, power sharing or whatever one likes to call it, do for the people of the entire country?</P>
    <P>In the minute or two remaining to <Col N="1682" /> me I should like to return to the amendment itself.  If the Taoiseach's amendment is carried it would mean that we in this House would deliberately rescind and delete the terms of the 1949 Resolution, the unanimous resolution passed in this House. We recognise that times have changed but I charge the Members of the Government who will speak after me with telling us and spelling out, paragraph by paragraph, in what respects the 1949 resolution is not acceptable and is not relevant.</P>
    <P>Our amendment would retain the 1949 Resolution.  It would retain the terms of it, the spirit of it and the purpose of it.  It would also retain three of the paragraphs of the Taoiseach's amendment but at the same time it would express, we believe, in more realistic and practical terms, the fourth paragraph of the Government amendment.  I conclude by again asking whatever speakers remain on the Government side to tell us exactly, to convince us, and to convince many of their own Deputies, why, in current circumstances, the resolution of 1949 is not acceptable and why in that event our amendment should not be passed and the Government amendment should, in fact, either be defeated or not put.  There is that onus on them.  That is as far as I can go. My time is up.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Posts and Telegraphs (Dr. Cruise-O'Brien)</NameTxt>
      <P>The motion before the House in the name of Deputy Blaney is an act of recapitulation.  It reaffirms the wording of a resolution passed by this House in May, 1949. That resolution was passed in particular circumstances, in a particular state of opinion and feeling, following a particular piece of legislation in Britain, a piece of legislation, in fact, intended to shore up something which no longer exists, the old Stormont based on Protestant supremacy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In circumstances which have changed radically, after nearly 1,000 deaths, after major changes in Northern Ireland, after entirely new legislation in Britain, and after an international agreement of major importance, Sunningdale, we are asked by Deputy Blaney simply to reaffirm <Col N="1683" /> that identical wording of 25 years ago.  To do this would, in our view, be to declare that we have not been able to learn anything from the progress of events, that we are incapable not merely of new thinking but even of testing, qualifying or modifying our earlier thinking.  However, Deputy Blaney's position has at least the merit of consistency.  Indeed, I think, that is its sole merit.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach's amendment proposes the deletion of all the substantive part of Deputy Blaney's motion. With respect to Deputy Lynch I would say that is not equivalent, as he has just said, to deleting and rescinding the resolution of 1949.  That stands on the record of this House as a resolution of 1949.  We are not deleting it.  We are not rescinding it.  We are simply refusing, and rightly refusing, to reaffirm it at a time when its reaffirmation would be prejudicial to the national interest.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach's amendment proposes the deletion of all the substantive part of Deputy Blaney's motion and the substitution of the wording which is before the House in the Taoiseach's name.  The wording of the Taoiseach's amendment and the Taoiseach's speech refer not to the circumstances of 1949 but to the circumstances of our own time.  They have a purpose in the present. That purpose is to promote peace and reconciliation in this island now by helping&mdash;and I mean actually helping, not just approving&mdash;all those who support power sharing in Northern Ireland, and by helping an effective and constructive Council of Ireland to emerge and, again, helping it to emerge and not just saying it would be a nice thing.  The Taoiseach has said what needs to be said about the significance of this amendment in his name and it is not necessary for me to try to add to that.</P>
    <P>I would, however, like to say something about the amendment in the name of Deputy Jack Lynch who has just concluded, and about the peculiar symbiosis which exists between that amendment and the motion in the name of Deputy Blaney.  In so far as Deputy Blaney's motion has a purpose in the present time when it is before us I believe, frankly, that that purpose <Col N="1684" /> is to sabotage Sunningdale.  As against this, the Taoiseach's amendment has the straightforward and avowed purpose of upholding Sunningdale against all the various kinds of attacks on it. So, Deputy Blaney's position is straightforward and the Taoiseach's position is straightforward.</P>
    <P>Deputy Lynch's amendment contrives to take the entire text of the anti-Sunningdale motion and add to it most of the wording of the pro-Sunningdale amendment.  That is what it does.  There is some added wording of his own.  Some of it is repetitive of Deputy Blaney.  Thus, if the motion were passed&mdash;they cannot have read the drafting very carefully&mdash;with Deputy Lynch's amendment, as I trust it will not be, it would both reassert&mdash; and I quote from Deputy Blaney's part&mdash;&ldquo;the indefeasible right of the Irish nation to the unity and integrity of the national territory&rdquo; and go on&mdash; if &ldquo;go on&rdquo; are the right words&mdash;to reaffirm the inalienable right of the people of Ireland to a united Ireland. Many will find this depressingly like the noise of a needle stuck in a groove of a cracked gramophone record.</P>
    <P>Does anyone really think we are helping to resolve our differences in this island by consistently and constantly reaffirming what we think are indivisible and inalienable rights?  I believe most people, North and South, see far more hope and far more reason in what we might call the Sunningdale approach: the willingness of Irishmen with quite different aspirations and quite different views of political legitimacy and right to sit down together nonetheless and work out ways of living together with justice and consideration for one another in the here and now.  The various &ldquo;no surrender&rdquo; banners and the old shibboleths whether green or orange do nothing to help in this process.  Indeed, in the past in some of his speeches Deputy Lynch contributed substantially to a forward movement&mdash;in some of them, not all.  He insisted on that.  He turned away, or appeared to turn away, from past gods or gods of the past, I forget what you call them.  He seems now, I am afraid, to be turning back a little that way.</P>
    <P>In reality the amendment in the <Col N="1685" /> name of Deputy Lynch is not intended either to help or hinder developments in Northern Ireland.  I think it is intended to cover over the cracks in the Fianna Fáil Party.  It has been said that this debate has placed a strain upon what is called the bi-partisan policy towards Northern Ireland.  I believe the Sunningdale agreement is so widely welcomed by the people in the country that there is every ground for a belief in the continuance of a substantial measure of agreement involving, among others, the three parties here.  I think that emerges also from parts of Deputy Lynch's statement and earlier statements he made.</P>
    <P>We are bound to note that if such a debate as this does impose a certain strain on this consensus, as I suppose it does, the responsibility for that rests squarely with the Fianna Fáil Party who provided a seconder for Deputy Blaney's motion.  That was a surprising transaction.  At the beginning of his speech Deputy Lynch said that they were not aware, until Deputy Blaney announced it while he was speaking, that he did not have, nor had he sought, a seconder for his motion and that they arranged deliberately to have his motion seconded for a number of reasons. Deputy Lynch may not have been aware of that&mdash;and we must take his word for it&mdash;but many people on this side were aware that Deputy Blaney did not have a seconder.  It was rather widely known.  I did not have the impression that it took the gentlemen opposite by surprise.  I do not think Deputy O'Kennedy was surprised to find himself seconding the motion.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Cruise-O'Brien</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like at this point to refer to a few of the things Deputy Lynch said.  He has made a great point about the desire of the Fianna Fáil Party to get clarification from the Taoiseach on paragraph 5, and so on.  I am not quite sure what all this is about because the original doubt which was supposed to be racking the gentlemen opposite was whether paragraph 5 was in some way unconstitutional. Surely they have got clarification on that by a decision of the High Court, upheld by the Supreme Court.  What more clarification can anybody have about constitutionality?</P>
      <P>Deputy Lynch made the point that the matter was no longer <i>sub judice</i> since there has, in fact, been a judgment of the Supreme Court.  Technically that is quite a good debating point.  It is not <i>sub judice</i> in the sense that there has been a decision but surely Deputy Lynch will agree that it is wise for the head of the Government of this State to await and to read the judgement of the Supreme Court before making any further statement.  It is not technically required by <i>sub judice</i> rules but it-seems to be the sensible thing to do.</P>
      <P>Deputy Lynch in the course of his remarks concerning the 1949 resolution says that this motion still fundamentally represents the views and aspirations of the Irish people in relation to Partition.  It was a resolution passed by a Dáil elected by the people of 26 counties.  It certainly does not represent the views and aspirations of the majority in Northern Ireland.  Do they belong to the Irish people?  Have they a right to have their views and aspirations in any way represented or in any way reflected?  I think they have, and Deputy Lynch, I think, in other remarks elsewhere&mdash;not all his remarks are internally consistent&mdash;has agreed that they do have that right.</P>
      <P>Finally in relation to his speech, he says it was a pity that the delegation to Sunningdale did not include the elected representatives of the biggest number of people on the island of Ireland, the Fianna Fáil Party.</P>

      <P>I will try to, as far as I can, but we are all fallible human beings, I quote from the official record:</P>
      <P>An tUachtarán explained that it was difficult to have a policy for Ulster when they could not get in contact.</P>
      <P>The date is 22nd August, 1921 and it is from the official record which was in minute form.  It goes on:</P>
      <P>Their present aim was to get in touch with them.  They had not the power and some of them had not the inclination to use force with Ulster.  He did not think that policy would be successful.  They would be making the same mistake with that section as England had made with Ireland.  He would not be responsible for such a policy.</P>
      <P>He went on to say:</P>
      <P>For his part, if the Republic were recognised, he would be in favour of giving each county power to vote itself out of the Republic, if it so wished.  Otherwise they would be compelled to use force.</P>
      <P>&mdash;a policy which he specifically rejected.  That is a very interesting statement.  This was the opinion of the founder of the Fianna Fáil Party before the Treaty, before the split in Sinn Féin and the Civil War, and of course long before the foundation of Fianna Fáil.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>After all those events, he said many other things, many of them under the pressure of internal disputes in the Twenty-six Counties. Part of what he said in August, 1921, unaffected by any internal disputes among those elected to the Dáil deserve to be considered carefully today.  Whatever about the formulations involved, I think the spirit behind the language used by Mr. de Valera on that occasion was one of far-sighted wisdom and entirely <Col N="1690" /> compatible with the spirit of Sunningdale and the Taoiseach's amendment now before the Dáil.  I would like to suggest to Deputies opposite that if they want to go back into history, they should go back rather farther than they have done and try to recapture the generosity and statesmanship of mind reflected in those utterances of their founder in the days before the Civil War.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>We have just listened, in the context of a bipartisan policy in relation to the problems in Northern Ireland, to what can charitably be described as a most unhelpful speech. That however, I think, should not surprise many people who are aware of the views of the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs, expressed over a long period of time in relation to this matter, and I grant to him what he granted to Deputy Blaney, that he is reasonably consistent in the views he has expressed over the years and still expresses.  However, his efforts to utilise the situation in Northern Ireland and the situation arising out of the meeting at Sunningdale, followed by the agreed communiqué, in order to divide the people of this State are reprehensible.  We have had some indication of that effort here this evening and we recall that in the Adjournment Debate, in which the Sunningdale communiqué was one of the matters being discussed, it was the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs who tried to threaten a general election if we did not all come to heel with his view in regard to Sunningdale. I think the pattern is very clear and the pattern is that as far as the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs is concerned, a bipartisan policy in relation to the North is not one he wants, unless, perhaps, he might be satisfied if we all went along with his views.  I suppose even he knows that is unlikely.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I shall come later to some of the statements made by the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs.  I should like to deal with what was said by the Taoiseach yesterday evening when he told us he could not comment on paragraph 5 of the Sunningdale communiqué because he had not available the <Col N="1691" /> written judgment of the Supreme Court in the recent action concerning this matter.  With due respect to the Taoiseach and his office, I can only say that the explanation is ludicrous and the fact that the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs tried to justify it does not make it less ludicrous.</P>
    <P>First, as has been pointed out and conceded, the matter is not now <i>sub judice</i>.  Secondly, and more important, the matter involved primarily is political, not legal.  For the information of the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs I would inform him that the High Court at least, and I suspect the Supreme Court, have not decided whether an agreement entered into on the lines of the Sunningdale communiqué would or would not be repugnant to the Constitution.  The Government in their own pleadings in that case made the point that it was not competent for a court to rule on what is now available&mdash;a communiqué.  That was the decision in the High Court. The Minister for Posts and Telegraphs need not come here and try to insult the intelligence of the House and the people by pretending otherwise.</P>
    <P>The fact is this is primarily a political matter.  The people of the State and of the country have regard to the fact that the Taoiseach was present at Sunningdale, he negotiated whatever has emerged from that, he knows what happened.  We want to know&mdash; we believe we are entitled to know&mdash; from his knowledge of the negotiations what does he understand paragraph 5 of the communiqué to mean? What does he believe the other parties in the negotiations understand it to mean?</P>
    <P>It has been stated in the communiqué that it is proposed to enter into an agreement, an agreement that would incorporate paragraph 5.  An agreement of this kind means one sets down in writing what one has agreed on.  We want to know what the parties at Sunningdale agreed on.  If the Taoiseach did not know when it was drafted he certainly knows now that paragraph 5 is open to a number of interpretations.  What is of primary importance is what did the Government <Col N="1692" /> of Ireland, which negotiated at Sunningdale, understand they agreed to in paragraph 5.  The Taoiseach has been asked on a number of occasions to spell this out but he has refrained from doing so.  He had an opportunity again to do so yesterday but he produced the ludicrous reason that he did not have the judgment of the Supreme Court in writing.</P>
    <P>I suspect there are other possible reasons.  One of the reasons the Taoiseach may not have elaborated on paragraph 5 could be that he feared the effect of his doing so at this time in relation to the situation in the North with the election quite soon, even possibly the effect it might have on lives in the North.  This could have been the reason but if that is the case why on earth did the Taoiseach not come in here and say so rather than give us this trumped up excuse about not having the judgment of the Supreme Court in writing?  If the Taoiseach had come in here and made that case, I believe we on this side of the House would have found great difficulty in opposing a proposal by him not to discuss the motion this week.  One contrasts that with the fact that not many weeks ago the Taoiseach and all the Deputies behind him came into the House on two days in succession and voted down Private Members' time for petty political reasons.  The contrast is revealing.</P>
    <P>Deputy Lynch said the 1949 Resolution of this House, which Deputy Blaney's motion asks us to reaffirm, represented the spirit and the philosophy of the great majority of the Irish people.  I have not the record of the Deputy's speech before me but that was the substance.  I believe the statement made by Deputy Lynch to be true, that it was true in 1949 and it is true today.  I will readily concede that if it were being drafted today for the first time the wording might be somewhat different but the basic philosophy and spirit behind it would not be different.</P>
    <P>If the Taoiseach felt the wording of the 1949 Resolution&mdash;I am speaking of the wording as distinct from its basic concept and philosophy&mdash;was unsuitable to 1974 it was open to him <Col N="1693" /> to bring in an amendment which would mock the 1949 Resolution and to substitute for it wording he considered more appropriate to 1974.  If that was what he wanted to do&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="ConorCruiseOBrien" hpid="Dr. Cruise-O'Brien Dr. Cruise-O'Brien">

    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>If he wants to claim that is what he did, as I think the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs is interjecting, let me put this to the House.  I shall read the Taoiseach's amendment.</P>
      <P>To delete all words after &ldquo;Dáil Éireann&rdquo; where that phrase first occurs, and to insert the following:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;&mdash;recognises that the Irish people comprise different elements all of which contribute to Irish life and culture, and each of which has the right to pursue its legitimate aspirations,</P>
      <P>&mdash;recalls the efforts of successive Governments over the past 25 years to bring about a spirit of harmony, understanding and co-operation between these different elements in the interest of the common welfare,</P>
      <P>&mdash;declares that the use or advocacy of violence to secure unity is abhorrent to it, and</P>
      <P>&mdash;affirms that the aspiration towards a united Ireland can be achieved only by peaceful means and with the consent of a majority of the people of Northern Ireland.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>My question to the Taoiseach and to the House is: where in that amendment which he proposes to substitute for the 1949 resolution is there any statement of the right of the Irish people to a united Ireland?  That statement is contained in the 1949 resolution but it is not contained in the Taoiseach's amendment which he wants us to accept in substitution for the 1949 resolution.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That, in my view, is the most significant aspect of this matter and it requires an explanation from the Government side, because whatever about the wording of the 1949 resolution, this is a basic factor, the question of whether we claim the right <Col N="1694" /> for the Irish people to have a united Ireland or whether we do not claim it and are not prepared to claim it.  This is a fundamental matter on which we must stand.  Deputies on every side of the House have to take a stand on this.</P>
    <P>We are entitled to an explanation as to why the Government, in the Taoiseach's amendment, proposed to omit that claim.  I believe that if this matter were in the hands of the vast majority of the Deputies supporting the Government, the Taoiseach's resolution would not be one which omitted a statement to that effect because it is my belief that the 1949 resolution, not only in its wording but in its basic philosophy and spirit, is one which certain members of this Government simply cannot stomach. That is the reason it is not in.</P>

They do not do that and we are entitled to ask why.  I should like to point out to the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs that he said a little while ago he believed Sunningdale had been widely welcomed. I believe it has but I also believe, and he should know if he wants to be in any way acute in his activities in the political scene, that what is widely welcomed in Sunningdale is the power sharing, which was part of the Sunningdale package, and the Council of Ireland, both of which were fought for by Fianna Fáil.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>I see.  The point the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs ought to consider very carefully is that wide as is the welcome for power sharing and the Council of Ireland, the welcome for paragraph 5 is a great deal narrower than that.  If he does not know it I think he will find out to his cost that that is so.  This brings me to the question of a bi-partisan policy in relation to the North.  I want to make it quite clear that as far as I am personally concerned, and I believe as far as all the members of my party are concerned, we regard the maintenance of a bi-partisan policy in relation to the North as a matter of very great importance. Too often in the past at critical times in our history, Irishmen have been so divided that nothing was achieved and tragedy ensued.  For that reason we have been prepared to go a very long distance to maintain a bi-partisan policy and we believed that this would be possible.</P>
      <P>I still believe it is possible but whether it is depends not on us but on the Government.  We made it quite clear after the change of Government that if this Government pursued the same kind of policy in regard to the North as we had pursued they would have our full and unswerving support. They got that.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>We also said, and I said it in the House and I am on record, that if this Government in relation to the North swallowed the kind of policy being adumbrated before the election by the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs and Foreign Affairs, we would not go along with it.  We made that perfectly clear.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I want to say in all fairness to the Taoiseach and, indeed, I think, to most of the Deputies who support him, that until very recently nothing that he said in Opposition or in Government was such as to give any room for doubt as far as we were concerned that he was following the same policy based on the same philosophy and was therefore entitled to full support <Col N="1696" /> from us.  As I have said, he got it. But we made it absolutely clear that the policies being adumbrated by the two Ministers I have mentioned before the election were policies which were unacceptable to us, and any attempt by the Government to depart from what they know to be an acceptable policy on both sides of the House and to go from that to the kind of policies being adumbrated before the election by those two Ministers is a decision to depart from a bipartisan policy.</P>
    <P>I have made it quite clear that I do not want to see any departure from a bipartisan policy.  I do not believe it is necessary, but I do say that the onus is on the Government to explain why, in their approach to this matter, they have apparently set aside what is a fundamental belief not just of Deputies but of most of the Deputies on that side and of the great majority of the Irish people&mdash;and I am speaking of the whole Irish people, no matter what the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs may have had to say in that regard.  We are entitled to get that explanation and unless the Government can explain that they do not propose to depart from that and that their actions in this regard were misguided, that they are not departing from that or, alternatively, that they are departing from that policy but that they can justify it, then it is the Government who are departing from fundamental national policy.  If that happened it is the Government who are responsible for any breakdown of a bipartisan policy.</P>
    <P>Heretofore there has been no difference of opinion on either side of the House on fundamental national policies.  The Government's approach to this matter in terms of the Government's amendment to this motion raises serious doubts in the minds of many people as to whether the Government now propose to depart from that aspect of fundamental national policy which I have spelled out.  I do not want to believe that the Government are doing that and I hope the Government can convince us and the people that they are not doing it. Make no mistake about it, if they do <Col N="1697" /> not convince us and the people of that, it is the Government who are deciding on a departure which can only result in a breakdown of the bi-partisan policy.</P>

      <P>There is another matter that I want to refer to.  It certainly has a relevance to Sunningdale.  It is a matter that I approach with some delicacy but I think it must be said. The Taoiseach stated yesterday&mdash;and again I am not purporting to quote him exactly but I think I have the sense of his words correctly&mdash;that violence in any part of this island for the achievement of political purposes would have to be stamped out.  We on this side of the House agree with him fully in that statement.  But, it is also true, I think it is fair enough to say, that while we have questioned the competence of the Government's performance in certain aspects of security and, indeed, we are unconvinced of their competence in certain aspects of security, we certainly accept that the Government's wish and desire is to combat violence for political purposes and in that context I feel that statements which have been coming with increasing frequency from politicians in Northern Ireland, politicians who are in the main opposed to Sunningdale, not all of them opposed to Sunningdale, but trying to impose conditions that there would be no Council of Ireland unless a stop is put to violence emanating from this side of the Border, these statements I feel, Sir, are dishonest and they are particularly hypocritical when one considers <Col N="1698" /> the outbreak of sectarian violence in the North and when few of those men who make these statements have said anything about that.  How many of them have been known to demand that these things be dealt with effectively by the various security forces in the North?  This matter is one that, as I say, is delicate but it has got to be said that these kinds of protestations from these people are hypocritical. They do not impress people down here. I doubt if they impress too many people in the North or, indeed, in Britain.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We, Sir, have tried in our amendment and in what we have said on its behalf to make clear our stance in relation to this whole problem.  I believe that the amendment in the name of Deputy Lynch spells out very clearly what exactly our position is. We do not, we never have and never will, acknowledge the right, the <i>de jure</i> right, of any other country to legislate for any part of Ireland unless the Irish people as a whole agree to it. That is the fundamental problem with which we are faced with regard to the North and although the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs has left, perhaps I could put it on the record that I would like to remind him in relation to the quotations he made from statements by Mr. de Valera in 1921 that those quotations were referring to a hypothetical situation but the real situation that we are faced with in the North is that Britain claims and exercises sovereignty over the North. This is not a theoretical case of people wanting to opt out.  They have not been given that option.  That is a fundamental aspect of our whole problem in relation to the North.  But, we have recognised since the foundation of this party that the unity of this country can be achieved effectively only by agreement between the people north and south and we have striven to bring about institutions which would enable that to happen and we can fairly say that in so far as those institutions are in being or coming into being they result to a large extent and in great measure form the efforts of Fianna Fáil but no effort that we make to reach agreement or <Col N="1699" /> accommodation with the people of Northern Ireland can be taken to be a <i>de jure</i> granting by the Irish people of the right of the people of Northern Ireland to opt out.  After all, if one were faced with the practical situation of a complete withdrawal of Britain and possibly a UDI set-up, it would not be the Six Counties as we know it today that would be involved.</P>

I repeat, Sir, that our amendment which incorporates the resolution of 1949 and adds what is shown in the amendment sets out our position in this matter, I think with clarity and lucidity.  It is a position on which we stand.

      <P>The 1949 resolution which Deputy Blaney has resurrected in this House yesterday and today was adopted in very different circumstances from today.  It was introduced and passed in the Dáil as a reply to a Bill in the Pritish Parliament. <Col N="1700" /> How was that Bill seen in this country?  It was seen in the words of Éamon de Valera in the following terms:</P>
      <P>We have got the suggestion through this Bill that it is a British interest to keep our country cut in two; ... that Britain wants still to help this minority to maintain their position of ascendancy and privilege against the expressed will of the majority of the Irish people.</P>
      <P>How different are the circumstances today in which we are asked to reiterate this now irrelevant resolution.  The British Government policy today&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I am going ahead. The Deputy can go on shouting if he wants to, like the last time.  The British Government policy is not to maintain a situation of ascendancy and privilege today.  On the contrary, it is precisely the opposite.  It is to change that situation and encourage power sharing in Northern Ireland, the power sharing against which Deputy Blaney rose to protest in this House. The British Government today are not trying to keep this country cut in two; they have, in fact, put their name to a declaration in the Sunningdale Agreement that they will support the unification of Ireland when the two parts of Ireland agree upon it.  There is no British obstacle to reunification of Ireland today and the whole of this resolution, directed against British action in an understandable way at that time, is completely irrelevant in a situation where British policy on this issue has been reversed.  To resurrect an irrelevant resolution of this kind, to have it seconded so that it can be discussed and to support it with some bits and pieces of additions, in themselves internally contradictory, is not to do a service to the House and to the country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The new situation before us today is not one of struggle against Britain. The Leader of the Opposition referring to the word &ldquo;struggle&rdquo;, said it can have no sinister meaning in the context of the times that were in it. In 1949 there was no armed struggle but there is today an armed struggle and if we adopt resolutions calling for the continuance of a struggle, is it likely that will get through the columns of the <i>Belfast Newsletter</i> in a manner that will make it clear to every loyalist in Northern Ireland that what is being spoken about is a political struggle against an Act of 1949 which is no longer on the Statute Book in Britain?  Of course not; it will be used there unscrupulously by propagandists to do harm, to arouse tension and violence.  That is why this resolution is not one that we can reiterate today without danger of misunderstanding.  We cannot do so to any useful purpose; we can do so only in a manner that will damage <Col N="1702" /> the interests of this country and of our people North and South.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Dr. FitzGerald Dr. FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I think this needs to be said because the debate has been led by Deputy Colley into all kinds of word splitting corners and abstractions of various kinds and it moved away further from reality the longer he spoke.  We must get it back to reality. The situation today is very different. I want to turn to the wording of the Fianna Fáil amendment.  It contains a number of different statements the first of which is taken from the Taoiseach's amendment and it says that the Dáil:</P>
      <P>Recongnises that the Irish people comprise different elements all of which contribute to Irish life and culture, and each of which has the right to pursue its legitimate aspirations.</P>
      <P>Note the plural form&mdash;&ldquo;aspirations&rdquo;. The ante-penultimate and penultimate parts of the Fianna Fáil amendment are that the Dáil</P>
      <P>Reaffirms the inalienable right of the people of Ireland to a united Ireland, Reaffirms their aspirations&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      <P>that is the people of Ireland</P>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;to achieve this by peaceful means.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>So, side by side, we have the old theory that there is only one united Irish people with one aspiration which is being prevented from being fulfilled by Britain and by British policy and at the same time the acceptance by Fianna Fáil and their recognition of the true position which is that there are in this country different elements with different aspirations that are legitimate&mdash;and they admit they are legitimate&mdash;and one of these elements is the Protestant people of Northern Ireland who do not have as an aspiration the achievement of the unity of Ireland by peaceful or any other means.  They are accepted in the first sentence of the Fianna Fáil amendment but in the penultimate sentence they are ignored again; they disappear; their existence and their aspirations are ignored and we come back to the single aspiration of that part of the Irish people who live in the <Col N="1703" /> Republic and who, in accordance with this terminology, would ignore the views and wishes of people in Northern Ireland.</P>
    <P>There is an internal inconsistency here which betrays more than loose drafting; it betrays the schizophrenia of a party who have had to change their policy but have not been able to do so in a clean-cut way because they are still living too much in the past, a party who, had they remained in office, might perhaps, not have been able to negotiate the Sunningdale Agreement for this reason&mdash;because of their inhibitions derived from their past.  It is, perhaps, for that reason fortunate that there was a change of Government. Deputy Colley's definition of a bipartisan policy amused me.  He said that if the Government policy was the policy dictated by the Opposition, that was bipartisanship.  I do not think so: bipartisanship means give and take, that both sides have to come together and find a common way.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>We have done so.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Dr. FitzGerald Dr. FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>It means that irrelevancies from past traditions have to be dropped if they stand in the way of the interests of the Irish people and if there are no principles at stake. Unless both parties are willing to do that, then bipartisanship becomes difficult and the support given to the motion of Deputy Blaney by its seconding and by the reiteration of its terms before adding on some other words is not helping bipartisanship or the solution of the problem of Northern Ireland.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Blaney referred to the Sunningda'e solution as &ldquo;British-imposed&rdquo;. What does he mean by that?  He did not have the privilege of being at Sunningdale.  Had he been there as a member of a Government&mdash;it certainly would have produced no solution whatever.  But had he been there he would have found very little British imposition.  At Sunningdale different groups in Ireland came together to discuss how they might have a common solution to their problems.  At no point in those discussions <Col N="1704" /> did Britain seek to impose anything on the Irish parties.  It sought to conciliate differences&mdash;at least the British Prime Minister did&mdash;where there were differences to be conciliated but at no stage was anything imposed by Britain.  We among ourselves, Irish people, for the first time sat down to find a common solution. To call it &ldquo;British-imposed&rdquo; is a travesty of the facts.</P>
    <P>He goes on to refer to power sharing &ldquo;by a select middle class, sectional grouping selected by the British Government&rdquo;.  Let us consider the representation of the minority in Northern Ireland in the Assembly in Northern Ireland and at Sunningdale. At Sunningdale there were three parties present including the SDLP and the Alliance Party.  As far as I am aware no one was elected by the votes of any significant number of the minority who is not a member of these two parties.  The people of Northern Ireland selected them as their sole representatives, the SDLP primarily with, I think, some members of the minority voting also for the Alliance Party.  It was not the British Government who selected these representatives of the Northern Ireland minority; they were selected by the minority in the election and came to Sunningdale because they wished as representatives of the minority&mdash; and in the case of the Alliance Party, of the majority also&mdash;to join with the Unionists, representing the majority, to form a power sharing Executive. But for Deputy Blaney they were selected by the British Government.  I should be glad if he would tell us the methods by which the British Government selected for the people of Northern Ireland those representatives whom they elected in a democratic election last June.</P>
    <P>He refers to them as &ldquo;a selected, middle class grouping&rdquo;.  I am not an expert on classes but there are many people in urban Belfast who would find it amusing to have Deputy Blaney, a man of some little prosperity, I think, referring to people like Paddy Devlin and Gerry Fitt as middle class.  I do not think he is in a position to use this epithet of <Col N="1705" /> opprobium in this way, certainly not against representatives of the working class of the minority in Northern Ireland.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>He goes on to refer to Sunningdale as another attempt by Britain to impose a partition settlement which does not have the full support of the people of the Six Counties.  It is true that it has not their full support.  There are dissentient voices in significant numbers on the majority side.  It will take time to bring them with us.  But on the minority side every elected representative of the minority supports the Sunningdale Agreement.  Deputy Blaney has no use for these elected representatives because they were chosen by the minority in Northern Ireland and not selected by him and his pals as representatives.  He will not accept them, therefore, as having any right to speak or act on behalf of the minority in Northern Ireland.</P>
      <P>It is sad that we should have this debate in this form and sad that Deputy Lynch and Fianna Fáil should join with Deputy Blaney to rake over the ashes of history stirring the flames of North-South bitterness into life again, by trying to reiterate resolutions with terms like &ldquo;struggle&rdquo; in them and resolutions that see only one national aspiration, that of the people of the Republic.  I think Deputy Blaney has done no service to this House in raising the matter in this way and that Fianna Fáil have done no service by joining with him, reaffirming rights and reasserting claims is the way to raise hackles, not the way to conciliate differences and secure friendly co-operation between Irishmen.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Colley seems to see it somewhat differently.  He is concerned about the right of the Irish people to a united Ireland.  Perhaps, some time, he would explain to us what he means by the word &ldquo;right&rdquo; in this context. It is a very curious word.  There are all kinds of right and it has, of course, the ambiguous other sense of something being right, a quite different <Col N="1706" /> sense.  When we talk of rights we must consider if it is wise, if we wish to achieve some objective, to assert them.  Deputy Colley has a perfect right at election time when addressing a meeting of the electorate in his constituency to tell them he thinks they are a poor looking crowd of people and he does not like the look of their faces.  That is not libellous.  He is entitled to do it.  He has a right to do it.  It is not a right I would advise him to insist upon should he wish to gain their support for his election.</P>
    <P>If Deputy Colley thinks that by asserting the right of the Irish people to a united Ireland in a debate in which we are discussing a resolution which recognises that the Irish people comprise different elements, all of which contribute to Irish life and culture and each of which has the right to pursue its legitimate aspirations, if he thinks that asserting rights of this kind helps, then his insight into the situation in the North is poor and inadequate and he is doing no service to the cause which I know he sincerely wishes to serve&mdash;the cause of a united Ireland.</P>
    <P>Once we accept&mdash;and for the purpose of this discussion I will use the terms of the Fianna Fáil amendment &mdash;that, &ldquo;for practical purposes this involves the agreement of the people of Northern Ireland,&rdquo; then there is only one purpose to be served by our actions in this House and that is to do everything that will bring the agreement nearer and do nothing that will push it further away.  That is the only criterion by which our actions should be judged.  If the assertion of an abstract right of some kind, felt by Deputy Colley to exist, incorporated in the form of a constitutional claim, will make that agreement more difficult to achieve, then anybody who asserts that right is not serving the interest of re-unification or the interests of this country.  The trouble is that Fianna Fáil have not been able to accept this.  Fianna Fáil have in the last four years&mdash;as we all have&mdash;learned much from the situation in Northern Ireland.  Five years ago no party in this House had a full understanding.  All parties in their <Col N="1707" /> policies and attitudes had elements which were not conducive to seeking agreement or to achieving unity by consent.  We have all had to learn, but in the case of Fianna Fáil that learning process has not been accompanied, it appears to me from this debate, by the amount of unlearning necessary.  We have all had to unlearn, not just Fianna Fáil.  Statements made by leaders on both sides of the House over the past 50 years which were not helping the re-unification of Ireland had to be unlearned. We all made mistakes.  We must decide what policy we are pursuing.  There are different policies.  One can pursue the IRA policy of conquest, if one thinks it will succeed and one has a moral right to do it, as we do not. Another route is to try to get Britain to force Northern Ireland into the Republic against its will.  This is a possible route but not one which any decent Irishman concerned with the dignity and peace of his country would wish to pursue.  Once one rejects those policies&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>&mdash;&mdash;the only solution is to proceed by seeking the agreement and consent of the majority in Northern Ireland.  We then have no alternative but to drop talk of rights, claims and abstractions and show the people of Northern Ireland, first, that we care for them&mdash;for both sections of the community there&mdash;and, secondly, that we regard the past as irrelevant, and past claims as irrelevant, and are only concerned with finding ways of working with them so that we may seek a united Ireland peacefully and by consent.</P>

      <P>Having listened to the last speaker and observed the discourtesy he afforded the House and myself by refusing to honour the traditional practice of quoting his reference in a manner which could be heard or understood, I mark it up and ask the House to take note of it.  This is our Minister for Foreign Affairs.  I will deal with him very briefly, because <Col N="1708" /> that is the way he deserves to be dealt with.  He says there is no British obstacle to the unity of this country. There are at least 20,000 British soldiers, each one of them, in my estimation, a definite obstacle.  Until they go there can never be an opportunity of any kind for those in the North holding different views to get together and to settle their differences in their own way, within their own land and without any outside interference.</P>
      <P>The resolution was described by the last speaker as irrelevant.  Is it irrelevant because it would appear on any sane reading to be a complete contradiction of what is contained in the Sunningdale communiqué?  Are we being refused any interpretation by the Government since the 13th of last December when we asked in this House repeatedly for an interpretation of paragraph 5?  Can we not even now, at the end of February, condemn the Government and the Leader who has so far failed, despite those repeated requests, to give an interpretation? Can we not again tonight take it that the interpretation is such that it is contrary to this motion, which is reaffirming what this House totally and without dissent agreed on in 1949? Are we not left with that clear indication by the continued absence of any interpretation?  Can we not also take into account that the waffling about the court judgment not yet having been delivered is not a relevant matter at this stage?  As Deputy Colley said, surely the men, and particularly the leader of the delegation who went to Sunningdale representing this Government, must be fully aware of what was intended and what he agreed to in so far as other people were concerned. Surely this is only to be expected from any worthwhile delegation.  Any delegation with any sense of sanity must know what it agreed to in that communiqué, in that discussion, in that proposed agreement.  Yet, three months later, we still have not got the slightest indication from the Taoiseach, no more than we had in December, as to what it is all about.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This motion is a sore point because, in my estimation, it contradicts Sunningdale.  The last speaker said <Col N="1709" /> that if we pass the motion it will do damage.  How can we do damage if what is in the resolution is not objectionable? Are the members of the Labour and Fine Gael Parties, individually and collectively, of the view that what was contained in that resolution in 1949 and now before us in this motion is objectionable and damaging and should not be passed but deleted? It is all very well for speakers to say that merely by deleting that does not mean it no longer remains on the record&mdash;of course, it does.</P>
    <P>What will the same speakers, or spokesmen for the same parties and Government be saying tomorrow and the day after: that it has been deleted by the Government amendment and no longer counts; that this House has, in effect, removed it even though it remains on the record?  Is this the sort of double-talk we are to expect from the Government on a matter as important as Sunningdale?  Are we to take into account&mdash;those of us who went to the trouble of going to the Supreme Court to hear the arguments for and against&mdash;that the State, as represented, made no case and that their lordships used these words &ldquo;casual&rdquo; or &ldquo;cunning&rdquo; in paragraph 5&mdash;not &ldquo;casual&rdquo; I would suggest in the sense that it was done casually in Sunningdale, therefore leaving me with the clear impression that the judgment to come from these learned people on the bench in the Supreme Court will shake the assurance given by the Taoiseach to Mr. Faulkner?  This cannot be said and should not be said until after tomorrow's election.</P>
    <P>I should like to get away from all of that and to put on record the collective thought I have as a result of last night's discussion, which was much more informative and at a much better level than tonight's.  The terms of the amendment which the Government have put down to this motion and the arguments which the Taoiseach advanced in its support last evening provide me with a tragic commentary on the gulf which Dáil Éireann has to bridge before we can get anywhere near to understanding the problem of partition and shows <Col N="1710" /> how we must move towards a peaceful and lasting solution of that problem which, I repeat and underline again, cannot even begin to be solved until Britain has declared her intention of getting out and leaving us with the opportunity that those who do not hold with us in the Six Counties will then be prepared and be in a position to sit down and talk out and discuss the future of all of us in this island without British interference.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach is, in my estimation, without any doubt sincere in his desire to help achieve a peaceful solution, but I believe it is naive for anybody who has a close understanding of the threads of that problem to pin all his hopes on the package that is Sunningdale, which is already well on its way to extinction as another futile attempt.  Sunningdale has not ended and will not end the violence in Ireland.  I say this not as a threat but as an observation all too tragically true and already showing itself to be true in the months since Sunningdale.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach rightly has said that there is a realisation in the Six Counties, particularly on the part of the majority, that they can no longer go back to the former position of sectarian domination over the minority, but he is in grave error when he tries to claim that Sunningdale represented a coming together of the two traditions in this country. Those who took part in Sunningdale, from the Six Counties at least, represent only those sections from both communities who always have been prepared to trim their sails to accommodate each other in the peculiar circumstances of the Six Counties.</P>
    <P>Those with convictions from both communities were excluded from Sunningdale. The Taoiseach said that one section, the Loyalists as they are now called, were excluded because they refused to accept power sharing.  They replied, and I accept their <i>bona fides</i>, that they refused to accept a solution foisted on them by the British Parliament. So do I, and so also should the Taoiseach and every other Irishman and woman in this country.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach also says of Sunningdale <Col N="1711" /> that it must be taken as a whole, that no party or interest, he claims, can select part of the package and say that it is acceptable but the remainder is not.  He must be deaf these days if he has not heard the nightly election assurances from the Faulkner Unionist Sunningdale candidates that they will have nothing to do with it or the Council of Ireland unless and until the Government in Dublin starts a war with the IRA and hands over all Republicans to them.  The Taoiseach certainly makes me wonder about his attitude to this question of violence.  He makes the point that two out of every three of the 155 persons who have been dealt with by the Special Criminal Court here are Northerners but it does not occur to him as ironic that all are Republicans. No UDR, UDA.  Ulster Freedom Fighters or British Army secret squads SAS or SIB, have been convicted by that same court, though the trail of unexplained bombings stretches from Liberty Hall to my own constituency of Donegal.  Does the Taoiseach not honestly accept that the total of his Government's efforts is directed towards collaboration with and appeasement of the British and Unionist pressure for putting down and silencing all legitimate Republican opinion in the Twenty-six Counties?</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach's own Minister for Justice, Deputy Cooney, is now seeing IRA under the bed by labelling everyone&mdash;those who uphold the genuine republican tradition and even civil rights, and those who would help the suffering dependants of the internees in Long Kesh and elsewhere&mdash;as subversives. What really saddens and worries me as an Ulsterman is the Taoiseach's statement last night when he said:</P>
    <P>The violence is not of our making. It originates in the North and spills over into our territory.</P>
    <P>How much further could we be removed from the thought of this island as a whole, its people as a whole, as a nation, as one, when we talk like that and when we have the Taoiseach and leader of the Irish people talking in <Col N="1712" /> this manner as if it were in Timbuctoo. That statement, in my estimation, is the key to the whole problem we in Dáil Éireann face in coming to grips in a realistic manner with the conflict of our divided country.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>That statement is a ritual washing of hands by the man who is currently the leader of the Irish people.  If I were not aware of the Taoiseach's background and environment I would classify it as a blatant betrayal of the half million people in the Six Counties who have never abandoned the claim their fathers established, as did our fathers, in the 1918 General Election to be part of a free and independent Ireland.</P>
      <P>I realise that the Taoiseach means well, and I say that sincerely, but he is not conscious of the fact that he stands in the gap of history, and that he has a duty to speak for all in this country and not just for those lucky enough to live on this side of the Border.  The terms of the 1949 motion which I now ask the Dáil to reaffirm are clear and explicit.  They assert the inalienable right of the Irish people to the unity of their country.  They represent the basic philosophy to which the Fianna Fáil, Fine Gael and Irish Labour Parties have subscribed and still profess to subscribe.</P>
      <P>I cannot see how anything that has happened since 1949 can change the philosophy expressed in that motion.  I cannot see how the Taoiseach considers that expression of basic philosophy to which his party subscribes to be &ldquo;no longer relevant&rdquo;, as he says.  I cannot understand how the Members of the Labour Party in this House can in conscience abandon that expressed philosophy tonight by accepting the Taoiseach's version of well-meaning phrases which is but a clever way of abandoning the basic claim to national self-determination.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Each Deputy has to decide in his conscience whether this expression of the national claim, basic and fundamental, which this House accepted <Col N="1713" /> without question in 1949 is to be written again into the records of the House as the attitude of the Dáil towards this matter in 1974, or whether the House is to accept an abandonment of that claim as expressed in the Taoiseach's amendment, an amendment which is obviously framed to meet a situation in which the Taoiseach finds himself trapped by Sunningdale.</P>
    <P>Sunningdale hangs over this House. Sunningdale&mdash;a poor thing that is already beginning to crack and fall apart.  I am certain, however, that the people of the Six Counties will give us a clear answer to Sunningdale by <Col N="1714" /> flatly rejecting it this week.  I have no doubt about how this House should vote tonight.  I have no doubt about how the House would vote if each Deputy were free to follow his conscience. In fact there would not be a vote and this motion would be passed by acclamation as it was in 1949.  I commend this motion to the House.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Minister for Local Government (Mr. Tully) James Tully">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Local Government (Mr. Tully)</NameTxt>
      <P>The only comment I can make on the last remark of the Deputy is that that would be a matter for the courts to decide.  I cannot understand why it should be suggested that there is a danger of some such thing happening.  Let me repeat that we are simply asking that what has been tried and proved to be effective should be continued.  I am advised that the effect of the amendment suggested by Deputy Molloy before 6 p.m. would be that every local authority responsible for drawing up a register would have to immediately draw such a register whether it was needed or not and continue to spend money drawing one up annually until the Dáil was dissolved.  That is the reason for the peculiar wording which Deputy O'Malley objected to earlier. I said at the time I could not understand the reason for it but that I was sure it was the correct wording.  I should like to make one comment on what Deputy Dowling said.  He spoke for ten minutes and he seemed to misunderstand completely what the whole thing is about.  I admit that most of the people speaking on the far side have been attempting to keep to the section but I think it is a little much when somebody objects to the wording:</P>
      <P>the Minister may by direction provide for the entry of the name of that constituency in respect of the polling district or part of the polling district...</P>
      <P>He claimed that this meant that major powers were being given to a Minister with which a Minister could not be trusted.  I will leave it at that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Mr. Molloy Mr. Molloy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister defeated his criticism of Deputy Dowling's contribution when he said that if the direction which the Minister is authorised to give under subsection (1) is not effective the only recourse is to the courts.  The argument we have been making is, therefore, quite valid. Deputy Dowling made the point that this discretion of the Minister is a major one, not as minor as the Minister has tried to convey to the House. If it is only the court which can <Col N="1722" /> decide whether an election is valid because the Minister does not perform his functions under this section, then his argument against Deputy Dowling&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think we should waste the time of the House on what Deputy Dowling suggested.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Mr. Molloy Mr. Molloy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>My point in raising this was to extract from the Minister some positive information as to the legislative machinery which would come into operation in circumstances in which the Minister did not exercise his powers.  I am aware that in section 7 if the directions are not complied with it does not invalidate any subsequent election and that provision was made for that in the 1963 Act.  I was wondering if the Minister could confirm whether a similar provision was made in any Electoral Act providing that an election held after the non-issue of a direction from the Minister could still be deemed to be valid without having to contest it in the courts.  It seems strange that in section 7 of the Bill there is a guarantee that a subsequent election is still valid even though the provisions of subsection (1) have not been complied with but we have no such assurance in regard to section 6.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>I understand that the possibility of something like this happening appears to be extremely unlikely and since it has never happened we do not consider it is necessary to provide for it now.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>If the Deputy considers that it is untidy I would suggest that he would let us have the benefit of his wisdom in an amendment on Report Stage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Mr. Molloy Mr. Molloy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister's smile water down the term &ldquo;wisdom&rdquo; as applied to me?  One finds it difficult to interpret the Minister's smile from time to time. There are different purposes for which he can use it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should like to inquire from the Minister whether or not it is a fact that following the passing of this <Col N="1723" /> legislation the registers with which we are dealing under section 6 and which will be used for the purposes of general elections are the same registers which will be used for local elections. There are not two separate registers compiled and where there are persons not qualified to vote in a general election the fact that they can vote only in a local election is indicated.  This would apply in the case of persons who are not citizens.  This is marked specially in the register.  It is the one register that is used for local and for general elections.  There is an obvious necessity for this section arising from the possible passage of this Bill which makes provision for temporary arrangements regarding registers where constituencies are being changed.  We know from the Minister's recent activities that electoral areas for local election are also in process of being changed, that some local authorities have already been informed by the Minister of the new electoral areas for the local elections next June.  As far as I know, quite a number of local authorities had not been informed up to Monday of this week.  So, if there are to be substantial changes in electoral areas for local elections could the Minister tell the House what provision he is making to meet that change in relation to the compilation of voters' registers.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Molloy has said that it is necessary to notify the local authorities.  They asked to be notified as early as possible.  Some suggested that they would like to know by mid-March. I have arranged that the decision in every case should be taken before the end of this month.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Mr. Molloy Mr. Molloy">

      <P>Tomorrow.  All of them have already been notified and they have been registered in this House, as required.  Deputy Molloy will find that by tomorrow every local authority will be aware of what exactly is being done.  In most cases, as the Deputy knows, I asked the local authority to let me know what they thought should be done and where it seemed to be reasonable there was <Col N="1724" /> no change made or where they suggested something as reasonable, no matter who it was, if I felt the change should be made, I have made changes in some of them.  They were aware, when I sent out notification, that I had the right to do it and would do it.  This is beside the point.  It has nothing to do with this Bill.  It has been done and most local authorities will realise that what has been done was giving fair representation to everybody. Who gets elected after that is a matter for the electorate.</P>

      <P>The point I was making is that a special section was deemed necessary in this Bill to facilitate the registration authorities in drawing up registers which would apply to changed constituencies.  My question to the Minister was: is there any provision which will enable the registering authority to change the electoral areas for local elections?</P>

      <P>Even though he is slightly off beam, I would like to tell Deputy Molloy that there is no necessity to introduce a separate section in the case of local elections.  The new register comes into operation immediately, whereas in the case of Dáil elections it does not come into operation until the Dáil is dissolved. There is no complication at all.  As soon as the arrangements are made the new register will apply to the election which we know will occur in June, after the date when the new registers will be out.</P>

      <P>The draft register for 1974-75 has been prepared.  The time for claims has closed.  Adjudications are going on at the moment and in many counties may well have finished.  Therefore, the final register for 1974-75 is now probably with the printers in the case of the great <Col N="1725" /> majority of local authorities, on the basis that they will be printed during the month of March and that they will be available and published early in April.</P>
      <P>The draft register and the corrected register as corrected by the county registrar at the various hearings held in every county contains not alone the designation as set out in the section of the constituency that is involved but in the case of each individual register it also states the county or county borough electoral area the 400 or 500 persons or whatever number it is that are on that particular register are in.  The Minister tells us he has made a lot of orders in the last few days changing a lot of county electoral areas.  He has made one as far as County Limerick is concerned which is a disgrace.

      <P>&mdash;&mdash;and to invite your attention to the second paragraph of circular F. 9/1973 of 3rd August, 1973, which indicated that the Minister does not propose to alter total membership of councils in the present review.  In making this decision the Minister had regard, among other things, to the fact that the statutory procedure for alteration of membership of councils is complicated and time consuming.  In the case of county councils it involves representation to the Minister, the holding of a local enquiry and, if appropriate, the making of an order by the Minister.  Apart, therefore, from questions related to the optimum size of councils, it is likely that the procedure for alteration of the membership of councils and the necessary consequential arrangements could not be completed in time for the local elections in June, 1974.  In the circumstances the Minister regrets that he is unable to accede to the council's request.</P>
      <P>The position in regard to representation in County Limerick is as follows:</P>

    <P>The deviation from the average population&mdash;councillor ratio for the county which ranges from&mdash;18 per cent in the Castleconnell electoral area to +30 per cent in the Bruff electoral area must be regarded as excessive.  As indicated in circular F. 9/1973 it is the Minister's intention that the more serious anomalies in local representation should be dealt with before the next local elections.  He proposes, therefore, to revise the electoral areas in County Limerick by the transfer of the district electoral divisions of Ballybricken, Cahercorney, Caherelly, Fedamore, Hospital, Kilteely and Knockeiney from Bruff to Castleconnell electoral area and by the transfer of the district electoral division of Uregare from Bruff to Kilmallock electoral area.</P>
    <P>Before making an order on this basis the Minister is prepared to consider any observations which your council may wish to offer in the matter provided such observations are submitted before the end of January.</P>
    <P Just="Right">Mise, le meas,</P>
    <P Just="Right">T. Ó Leannáin.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>We had a statement by the Minister on what he had done in relation to local electoral areas.  I was endeavouring to make the point that the Limerick County Council have now printed or are in the processing of having printed a final print of their register for 1974-75.  That would set out, as well as setting out the two different constituencies in Limerick, on each individual register Bruff electoral area or Kilmallock area or Castleconnell electoral area, as the case may be. Major changes have been made by the Minister as between the local electoral areas of Bruff and Castleconnell in County Limerick comprising parts of the constituencies of East and West Limerick.  If the register is printed on the lines that the draft register was prepared and printed, that will mean that there will be an enormous number of mistakes in the headings in the registers in both East and West Limerick constituencies because of the fact that seven or eight divisions in the East Limerick constituency have been changed by order of the Minister.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not deny that the Minister has the power to do this.  I may quibble with the manner in which he exercises that power.  It has to be done from time to time.  This is probably as good a time as any considering that there is an election coming up.  Because of the situation which will exist under this proposed section 6, the registers in respect of the eight electoral divisions in County Limerick, which I referred to when I quoted from the letter from the Department to the Limerick County Council, will necessarily be defective.  That will lead to considerable confusion, apart from the other consequential confusion which will arise in regard to the changes in polling places within these various electoral divisions when some people who are being moved into Castleconnell electoral area will find themselves in the position, unless some different scheme can be worked out between now and June, of having to vote in <Col N="1729" /> Bruff electoral area.  People in East Limerick constituency will have to vote in the West Limerick constituency.</P>
    <P>The point which Deputy Molloy made&mdash;that the local electoral register is the same as the national register except for the addition of certain names of non-nationals and some limited category of other people with &ldquo;L&rdquo; after their names&mdash;inevitably will lead to difficulty if there is no revision of these registers.  I cannot understand the insistence of the Minister on the word &ldquo;may&rdquo; in the first line of page 3.  It is possible that some Minister for Local Government was so deliberately perverse that he refused to make an order or to give a direction under this section or, alternatively, the Minister of the day and his officials forgot to make this direction.  It could be that such a direction would not have been given. Deputy Molloy posed a pertinent question when he asked what the consequences will be.  The whole problem could be got over by using the word &ldquo;shall&rdquo; or using the words which Deputy Molloy and I suggested in our amendment which is not before the House but which we will put before the House on the Report Stage.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sure that Deputy O'Malley is aware that there is a general presumption that an election is valid unless it is challenged in the court.  This applies to numerous things that could happen.  There is a case at present about a Mayo constituency. I am sure Deputy O'Malley is aware of it.</P>

      <P>I am sorry if Deputy Molloy did not hear what I said.  I said there is an issue in regard to an election in one of the Mayo constituencies being challenged.  It happens from time to time.  The only reason the draft electoral registers are sent out and election courts held is not to decide where anybody votes but to decide whether a person is entitled to vote.  Deputy O'Malley has completely missed this point.  A person is entitled to a vote if his name in supposed to <Col N="1730" /> be on the draft register or on the amended register.</P>
      <P>As far as the drawing-up of the register is concerned, the local authorities are perfectly satisfied that they will have ample time to draw up and have printed the register for the new areas if they are informed this week. They will be able to do it in order to have it out long before the 14th of April.  That is why this particular date was selected.  With regard to the letter which Deputy O'Malley read out and which he said was scandalous&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>If Deputy O'Malley dislikes party politics he should not be in this House.  There are people who like to use politics when it suits them and they like to twist around and say there is something wrong with them when it does not suit them.  The facts are that Limerick County Council adopted by resolution the proposal which was made and considered it perfectly fair, as indeed it is.  Deputy O'Malley asked why we should put in &ldquo;shall&rdquo; instead of &ldquo;may&rdquo;.  I told him that my advice is that this would simply complicate matters.  If &ldquo;shall&rdquo; was put in it would insist that each year it would have to be done in a certain way.  As it is it need not be issued until such time as a general election is declared.</P>
      <P>This is the simple fact of it.  If Deputy O'Malley and Deputy Molloy do not like it I invite them to put their ideas down before the next Stage.  In the meantime I assure them I will have a very close look at it and if necessary put down an amendment. As of now I do not think such an amendment is necessary.</P>

I am not a bit surprised he is getting confused when I say categorically that I said to Deputy O'Malley that as a layman I considered the suggestions he made as being more reasonable but that the expert advice I got was that the way in which it was in the Bill&mdash;and as it had been done for many years&mdash;was the correct way.

      <P>I do not want to go into all of this because I am quite sure we will have another day at it.  In every case where it appears reasonable that the tolerance was not overdone I accepted it but where the tolerance was completely overdone I did not and informed the local authorities why.  That is perfectly fair.  I do not want to widen this section in order to start talking about things which have no relevance to it.</P>

      <P>I am happy the Minister has interpreted that references to what is happening in respect of the compilation of registers in respect of local election has a very definite bearing on the section under discussion.  I suppose the Minister is not surprised at people on this side of the House taking issue with him over statements he makes.  I am a member of the reformed Dublin local authority.  At the request of the Minister we spent some time answering his invitation to prepare, as best we could, recommendations.  These were agreed by all the members of the council.  I understand an order was made by him today.  I have no word of this nor have the council been invited to pass any judgment on it.  The Minister has decided to change the recommendation made by the elected members.  He has used the word &ldquo;reasonable&rdquo; and he suggests that what he has now done on the direction of his civil servants is superior to that suggested by the elected representatives.  He said earlier, in respect of changes which were made, that these were made without any consultation with any political parties. I am sure the Minister wants to retain <Col N="1734" /> his reputation as an honest man.  I suggest that what he has said in respect of the changes made regarding Dublin is not as he has indicated and that he had consultations&mdash;I do not know whether they were official and above board&mdash;with members of a certain political party.  If he assures me later on that what I am saying is not in accordance with fact then I shall be happy to accept his word.</P>
      <P>The 45 elected members of Dublin Corporation were restored to office by the present Minister.  In so far as he recognised the advisability of having local representatives restored to Dublin city I commend him.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesCTunney" hpid="Mr. Tunney Mr. Tunney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tunney</NameTxt>
      <P>I am developing the point made as to the connection between the register for the local constituency and that for the parliamentary constituency, and I was about to indicate that the changes which the Minister has imposed or would seek to impose on the Dublin Corporation in respect of local elections will lead to quite an amount of confusion.  I have not got the wards of the Dáilcheantair at my disposal, but looking at what is proposed for the local authority area which I represent, I can see it being almost identical with the Dáilcheantair with two or three exceptions.  I suggest that will lead to much more confusion in the mind of the elector and will also lead to certain difficulties in the matter of the compilation of the respective registers in regard to directing people as to the booth in which they will cast their vote.  In replying to Deputy O'Malley about the changes made in the Limerick local authority <Col N="1735" /> area, the Minister consolidated his point by saying the local representatives had agreed to it.  I would ask him to comment on the positions that would arise in respect of Dublin Corporation if at our next meeting we refuse to accept the recommendation he has made to us and what effect that will have on the compilation of the respective registers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>As far as the areas are concerned, Deputy Tunney is being slightly unfair, in that I went out of my way to try to ensure that the electoral areas and the Dáil constituencies would be as close as possible.  It was not possible to fit them in exactly. Deputy Tunney's own constituency does fit in reasonably well, and it means that the people whom Deputy Tunney will represent in the Dáil will also, I expect, be represented by him in Dublin Corporation, and in very many more cases this will be the position. Dublin Corporation did suggest a different way, 10 fours and a five.  It is not as fair or as easily recognised, as far as the ordinary person is concerned, as making them, the way I did, as close as possible to the Dáil constituency.  Deputy Tunney poses the question to me: what happens if the Dublin commissioners refuse?  They do not refuse.  I did not make a recommendation. I made an order, as I am entitled to do.  I might not have consulted them at all.  In fact, there was a precedent where another Minister, a good many years ago, made an order without even asking the local authorities what they wanted.  I asked them all and gave them since last August to decide what they wanted.  I have authority to make the order and I made an order to which no reasonable man could object.</P>

When I was on the far side of the House&mdash;and I challenge anybody to deny this&mdash;I found on many occasions that I was in complete <Col N="1736" /> agreement with what the Minister was doing, no matter who he was, and with Deputy Lemass who is here tonight.  I am quite sure he remembers that on more than one occasion I complimented him on things which he did because I thought they were right.  I would suggest to the Fianna Fáil Opposition that a little bit of that would not do any harm at all, because they were not perfect.  Maybe we are not perfect, but we are doing many things with which they must agree if they are fair at all.  All I am saying to them is: do not knock everything because you are weakening your own case when you do this.</P>

They made a unanimous decision recommending a certain line of action.  The Minister has rejected what was suggested and made his own order.  I do not deny that he has power as Minister to do this but it appears to be in conflict with the stated aims of the Minister and the Government, aims which were stated in the recent White Paper on the restructuring of local government.

      <P>It is in that context that I was quoting the Minister's statements and his desire for local government.  The majority of people in Dublin are represented by the 45 members of the Dublin Corporation.  These members were reinstated by a decision of the Minister.  They came to a decision which would affect the register.  The Minister, in direct contradiction of the stated aims of giving local say and local power, made the order from the Custom House declaring that Dublin will be divided in this way and no other way.

      <P>I submit that this is relevant in the context of the suggestions being made to the city of Dublin by the Minister.

      <P>The Chair is always reasonable and I am grateful for that.  Certain electoral areas will be altered and certain electoral divisions will be moved from one electoral area to another.  This involves a change in the format of the register which will be used for local and general elections.</P>
      <P>Earlier the Minister agreed with the proposed amendments to section 6 by Deputy O'Malley and Deputy Molloy.  As a layman he saw merit in those amendments.  He changed his mind on the recommendation of his officials.  I should like to ask him to reconsider and stay with his original view.  Their amendments tightened section 6 as it stands.  The Minister sees that section 6, subsection (1) is very loose in its present form.  It is the aim and the duty of an Opposition to assist the Minister and the Government in any way they can in getting legislation passed through the House.  We feel, and the Minister has agreed, that the wording of this subsection is very loose in its present form.  The Minister has made the point that the present form is the same as it was in previous Bills but this does not make it any more correct.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. R.P. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister was on this side of the House at the time of the passing of the last Electoral Bill and if he was not conscientous enough at that time to contest these things he should not criticise us for doing so now.  We are, as any Opposition should be, teasing such things out and putting forward our suggestions.  We are trying to see that legislation as it goes through this House is straightforward and without ambiguities.  In that regard we will assist the Government so far as possible in the tidying up of any legislation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister has stated that he can see certain merit on the points being made on this side of the House.  Realising that, I feel the Minister should <Col N="1745" /> instruct his advisers to tighten up this subsection.  He has already told us, and I accept, that his advisers are reasonable and astute men.  The Minister in considering subsection (2) as it stands should consider the suggestion made that a further subsection should be added to section 6 to include an extension of the postal voting.  It is obvious to all of us involved in political life that the postal voting register as it is compiled needs to be altered to include very necessary facilities for senior citizens, people in hospitals at the time of an election, commercial travellers and those unable to return to their homes to cast their votes.  The case of the lighthouse keepers should also be considered.</P>
    <P>The Minister has stated that he has considered this matter and that he had made a certain amount of progress in this regard but he has the opportunity now to add a further subsection to change the position in relation to postal voting.  The Minister recognises that this is necessary but I feel it should be rectified before the next election so that those people will get the right they are entitled to.  I hope the Minister will grasp the opportunity granted to him now and make these changes when it comes to Report Stage.</P>
    <P>The Members of this House who were involved in the Monaghan by-election last year are conscious of the great need for the extension of the postal voting register.  Voting in that by-election took place in appalling weather and old people had to be taken from hospitals and driven to all corners of the county to cast their votes.  Surely such a system is unjust.</P>

In Ballybay unfortunate old people were disturbed from the centrally heated atmosphere they were living in and brought in wheel chairs to the polling booth.  Such a spectacle should be enough to encourage the Minister to amend this system.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is obvious that in England postal <Col N="1746" /> voting is far more extensive than I have suggested.  People who are not necessarily travellers or confined to hospital are in a position to obtain postal votes.</P>

      <P>I merely want to show what is happening in other countries.  This is particularly relevant now in the context of Europe because a big number of our people spend a lot of their time in Brussels on business. They are entitled to consideration and are entitled to express their views on any issue coming before the electorate.  I would ask the Minister to bring in a further subsection to amend the list of postal voters to include the type of people I have mentioned. I know he has received representations from the Commercial Travellers Association asking him to do what I am now asking him to do. I know that he and his officials are working on it.  He should make the change now because the local elections are coming up and people will be denied their right to vote because they are out of the country on business.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister indicated earlier that he hoped to bring in such a Bill.  He did not make a firm commitment.  It would not take too much time to devise such a subsection.  He need not specify all the various categories.  The wording could be: an election having been called, be it a local election, a general election, or a referendum, any voter anxious to claim a postal vote <Col N="1747" /> can do so within five or ten days. This would remove the difficulty which the Minister apparently sees at the moment.  It would be up to the individual voter to decide whether he wished to claim a postal vote.</P>
    <P>In the past, four or five votes decided the representation from a particular constituency.  There was the famous north-east case a couple of years ago, and there were others.  In theory a postal vote could alter a decision of the electorate.  The Minister said he is conscious of the need to give justice to the people who cannot vote at the moment.  Another category that comes to mind is people who are confined to their homes because of illness.  We have also seen pictures of couples who were married on the day of election going to the polling booth to vote but, in many cases, couples getting married and people attending such social functions do not bother to vote.  If they could claim a postal vote I have no doubt that they would do so and this could affect the election of a Government. I know that it is not beyond the powers of the Minister's officials to devise such a subsection.  They are men of high ability.</P>

      <P>I was complimenting the officials.  I was not trying to be sarcastic.  The Minister could instruct his officials to devise such a subsection.  Subsection (1) deals with the register.  It is absolutely essential that the Minister should realise the problems created by the orders he is making.  I referred earlier to the order in the city of Dublin.  The same situation arises in the county and in every county in the country.</P>

      <P>I was saying how subsection (1) is being complicated in County Dublin by decisions made by <Col N="1748" /> the Minister.  This is a Dublin County Council (Amendment) Order of 1974. The Minister changed the county electoral areas and the numbers of representatives.  He changed the Ballybrack and Dundrum electoral areas.  Originally Ballybrack elected four councillors and Dundrum five. The Minister changed that to Ballybrack five, and Dundrum four.  As we use the same register for local elections and general elections, with the exception of certain voters who are noted as being entitled to vote only in local elections and not in general elections, it is basically the same register. The decision of the Minister in relation to County Dublin complicates the situation to the extent that under section 6 (1), the county electoral area, as it will be shown on the register, is being changed considerably and his decision is also going to create problems with regard to the Dáil constituencies because complications are being created for the electors by the decisions being made by the Minister, which I may say were made by order and not with the agreement of Dublin County Council.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. R.P. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>That is what I am concerned about, in that the Minister's orders are liable to confuse the electorate under section 6 (1).  Deputies O'Malley and Molloy made a suggestion to the Minister for a tightening of the wording of subsection (1) which the Minister admitted was very loose and could be tightened up considerably.  The Minister said he had used this subsection because it was used in previous Bills but this is no justification for his using again the exact wording of subsection (1) and subsection (2).</P>

    <Speaker pid="RayBurke" hpid="Mr. R.P. Burke Mr. R.P. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R.P. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister will have his opportunity to reply.  He admitted that there was a lot of merit in the suggestion made by these Deputies <Col N="1749" /> in relation to a tightening of the wording of this subsection.  He admitted that there was a certain amount of ambiguity in it and I feel he should take the opportunity between now and Report Stage to reconsider his decision in the light of the problems he sees arising from it. The fact that it was in previous legislation is irrelevant to the situation in which we now find ourselves.  This is a new piece of legislation, and the fact that no problems arose in the past in the operation of previous legislation is no justification for restating it in its present form when we have shown the Minister that problems could arise.  It is our duty to try to refine legislation to such an extent as will make it as clear-cut as possible, and not only that but that it will be seen to be clear-cut.  It is our duty to make legislation passing through this House as clear-cut and unambiguous as possible, so that it can be clearly understood, not only by lawyers but by the general public.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Bill before us is an electoral Bill involving the electorate and it is essential that we ensure that it is worded in such a fashion that there can be no ambiguity and that the general public, the electorate, will be able to understand it clearly and understand what is contained in it. In its present form, section 6 (1) is ambiguous.  The Minister sees the problems.  The fact that no cases were ever contested in the courts in relation to this subsection as in other Bills does not mean that we should not do everything in our power to ensure that this legislation is clear-cut, and in the light of that consideration the Minister should have another look at this subsection, with a view to tightening it up in such a way that he can stand over it and will not be of the opinion, as he is now, that it is loose in its wording.  He should use his powers as Minister to instruct his officials to tighten up its wording in the light of the debate here, and in the light of the Minister's recognition that complications could arise and that it has been a matter of chance that no court action ever took place in regard to it and the validity of no election was ever contested because of <Col N="1750" /> this wording.  He should take this opportunity to have another look at it in view of the appeals made to him, being the reasonable man I know him to be, and in view of the fact that it could conceiveably create complications, as it will particularly in view of some of the recent orders made by the Minister with regard to local electoral areas.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. R.P. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>It is the register of electors I am speaking about because the register for local elections is the same as that for a general election and recent ministerial orders have altered this situation.  In the Dublin city area, we have had a new order by the Minister instructing Dublin Corporation to divide the city, in a certain way despite the instructions and advice given by the 45 duly elected members.  They said the areas should be divided in a certain way but the Minister has now issued an order dividing it in another way.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RayBurke" hpid="Mr. R.P. Burke Mr. R.P. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R.P. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>And the register of electors is the same for a local election as for a general election.  The point we are trying to make is that we want this legislation to be clear-cut so that it can be understood without causing complications for electors.  We want this legislation to be as clear-cut and as uncomplicated as possible.  I ask the Minister to look again at subsection (1) of section 6 because the wording needs considerable revision.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>The Chair has been very tolerant and has allowed the debate to extend fairly widely over a number of matters that might, or might not, be relevant to the section being discussed. I do not propose to make a Second Reading speech because this is not the Second Reading of the Bill, although some people apparently are not aware of this.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Burke in his comments <Col N="1751" /> seemed to miss out on a number of points and it is only fair to refer briefly to them.  He spent a long time referring to the fact that he considered now was the appropriate time to amend section 2 in order to enlarge the list of people who would have a postal vote.  That is not relevant to the Bill; it is not contained in the text of the Bill and, therefore, new matter cannot be introduced on Committee Stage.</P>
    <P>I said earlier and I wish to repeat that I have a committee who are going into the question of those who should be entitled to postal votes.  In 1959 a committee of the House brought in a report saying that although only Army personnel were entitled at that time to a postal vote they recommended gardaí should be included also but that nobody else should be included.  This was done in 1960.  On three or four occasions since the matter was brought to the attention of the Fianna Fáil Government but on each occasion they accepted the recommendation of the committee and decided not to increase the number.</P>
    <P>That being so, it is a little bit much to see the pressure now being put by members of Fianna Fáil.  That party had many years to do this but they did not think it worth their while.  I agree entirely with Deputy Burke on one point; it is time we had a look at the matter.  I would not be prepared to recommend what he suggested, namely, to follow what is done in Northern Ireland.  There anyone who is on the register can apply for a postal vote and cast it in that way but I do not think that is how it should be done.  My personal view is that the categories should be widened considerably. However, there must be a good reason why this was not done because the committee who considered the matter in 1959 recommended against it and the Government on at least three or four occasions decided not to make the change.  Despite all that I am looking at the problem and I hope to be able to introduce a short Bill.  When I do I hope I shall have the same enthusiasm for the change from the members of Fianna Fáil.</P>

      <P>If the Deputy would go along and get bags of guns for somebody&mdash;he is only a nuisance here. Somebody will lead him out of the House in a few minutes.  It has been said that there will be confusion because the electoral areas in Dublin in particular will be crossing the areas for the new constituencies.  At the present time the electoral areas in many cases cross the borders of the existing constituencies.  This has happened again and again.  Even if Deputy Molloy were on this side of the House introducing his Bill, or even in the amendments now before the House, there would be crossing of the electoral areas and the Dáil constituencies.</P>
      <P>There is nothing new in what is proposed.  Nothing is being done that is any more unfair than what would be done by anybody else.  I believe what is being done is in the best interests of the people concerned. Deputy Dowling was objecting to this but he knows as well as I do that the simplest way to represent an area is if the Dáil and the corporation areas run fairly closely together.  In this way one is dealing to a great extent with the same people.</P>

      <P>The two subsections of section 6 are perfectly reasonable and were accepted as such by the Fianna Fáil Minister who introduced them, by successive Ministers and by this House.  The reason this is being debated is not because there was anything wrong but because Fianna Fáil decided to hold up this Bill for as long as they could.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy should not be making a fool of himself.  The position is that this section, containing two subsections, is a reasonable way of doing things.  I said on the last occasion it came up here that I would have another look at it.  Even this evening before 6 o'clock I said that if Fianna Fáil wanted to put an amendment I would have a look at it and consider it.  I have got further advice since which has made it very clear to me that the section as it stands is the best way of doing the job.  It has been proved over the years; there has been no objection by anybody.  The suggestion that there might be a court case in some peculiar circumstance is too ridiculous to try to argue against.  Section 6 with its two subsections will stay in the Bill.</P>
      <P>Deputy Andrews made a plea before he went away, which was followed at length by Deputy Burke, in regard to postal voting.  Deputy Andrews was not here when I commented on this a few moments ago, so I repeat the hope I expressed then to widen considerably the number of categories included in postal voting.  I cannot do it in this Bill because it was not included in the original Bill and it would mean a complete change of the contents of the Bill.  As such it would be ruled out.  I hope to bring in a short Bill to have this done at a later stage.  That is the proper way to do it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Calleary</NameTxt>
      <P>I am looking for some clarification from the Minister. The section is described as making temporary arrangements with respect to the register of electors.  I am putting the hypothetical case of the Minister for Local Government being ill and not being able to, as this section provides, give a direction.  The section says that the Minister may by direction provide for the entry of the name of that constituency, and so on. What would be the position in those circumstances?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="SeanCalleary" hpid="Mr. Calleary Mr. Calleary">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Calleary</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">

      <P>In a situation where a person whose name is included in the register of electors, the subject we are discussing under section 6, finds himself employed in a polling booth on the day of a Presidential election in an area in which his name is not in the register, what facilities are being made to enable that person to vote?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>Under Fianna Fáil, none.  We are prepared to ensure that before the next Presidential election such provisions will have been made.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Mr. Molloy Mr. Molloy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister not have thought that this Bill would have been a suitable opportunity through which to correct that situation? Though the Constitution provides for Presidential elections once every seven years, a situation could arise where, God forbid, it could happen within the seven year period&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>There is nothing wrong with Erskine, our President.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Mr. Molloy Mr. Molloy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>I am posing a hypothetical situation in which the President might decide to resign for some personal reason.  Such persons working in polling booths do not have a vote. Regulations to be made by the Minister for Local Government can facilitate such polling booth officials to vote in both local and Dáil elections.  I think the same applies to referenda.  However, persons so employed on the day of a Presidential election are not entitled to vote.  We all became very well aware of that fact in the recent Presidential election.  This is an Electoral (Amendment) Bill and it is a suitable opportunity to have this anomoly rectified.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>The position about it is quite simple.  In the years that the other <Col N="1757" /> Government were in power there were four Presidential elections and on each of the four occasions people working in booths did not have this facility. Last year, because we had only recently taken over office, we got caught with that situation and I proposed to bring in an amending Bill which would include provision to allow voters who are working in booths to vote in these booths.  It could be made quite a simple matter.  Deputy Molloy suggested this was the Bill in which to bring in such an amendment.  Of course it is not.  It was not included in the original Bill. It will be necessary to bring in legislation to deal with other matters and we will include all matters like this which need to be tightened up.  There is no secret about this&mdash;it will be introduced when we are considering the next legislation to cover such matters.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Mr. Molloy Mr. Molloy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>I suppose we can be grateful for the amount of useful information we have been able to extract from the Minister.  We seem to be able to extract fairly firm promises of future legislation.  We are very grateful to the Minister for clarifying things in this matter and for informing the House about them.  However, I again submit that the long title to this Bill is:</P>
      <P>An Act to provide for the number of Members of Dáil Éireann and for the revision of constituencies and to amend the law relating to the election of such Members.</P>
      <P>Surely the granting of votes to persons who find themselves in the situation we have just been discussing&mdash;working in an election in an area outside where they are registered&mdash;comes under the terms of such a title.  The law uses the same register of electors for Presidential elections as for local and Dáil elections and for referenda.  This is common through most of the electoral law.</P>

      <P>Yes but the Minister mentioned that effectively quite a number of the electoral areas outlined in this Bill will be applicable not only to Dáil elections but to local elections and it is fair to ask the Minister why he is adding a seat to the Ballybrack electoral area and taking a seat away from the Dundrum electoral area.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Andrews</NameTxt>
      <P>The proposal by Deputy O'Malley in the context of what he said and in which he was supported by Deputy Molloy was extremely reasonable.

      <P>The Minister indicated earlier that the Opposition could put down an amendment prior to 6 p.m. and indicated that he would be prepared to have a look at it.  At a later stage he stated that the section is the best there is and that it is going to stay that way in the Bill.  Is it reasonable to suggest: &ldquo;Put down an amendment and we will shoot it down&rdquo;?  Surely there is an onus on the Minister to listen to the views of the Opposition.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JosephDowling" hpid="Mr. Dowling Mr. Dowling">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dowling</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister does not appear to know what is in section 1.  I was concerned with the deletion of the words &ldquo;the Minister may by direction...&rdquo;  The Minister wanted to know what this is all about.  We should tell him what it is all about. Deputies O'Malley and Molloy have tried to explain the problem in relation to this particular section.  It is undesirable that subsection (1) should remain in its present form for some of the reasons given by the representatives here in relation to the gerrymander of local authorities.  This is a jackboot Bill.  It is important that the Minister should not have the power indicated in this section notwithstanding the fact that he indicated that he thought as a layman Deputy O'Malley's wording was superior to that of the parliamentary draftsman. The Minister is the person who would or could accept an amendment of a superior type.  Surely it is not unreasonable to ask him to accept superior wording to what is in the Bill. It is our function to ensure that the legislation which passes through this House is superior.</P>
      <P>This particular deletion or the amendment earlier proposed which the Minister believed was the best wording but refused to accept&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>The better wording.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JosephDowling" hpid="Mr. Dowling Mr. Dowling">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dowling</NameTxt>
      <P>Whatever type of phraseology the Minister wishes to use.  The better wording of Deputy O'Malley's amendment is what should be included.  I hope the Minister would show reason on this score and accept the better wording.  It is highly unreasonable that he should suggest that the time of this House would be wasted in putting down an amendment <Col N="1766" /> and in the same breath say that the section, as it stands, is the best possible and will stay in the Bill.  This is an unreasonable approach.</P>
      <P>I hope that the Minister will see the sense of the suggestion made earlier by Deputies O'Malley and Molloy. There has been quite a lot of discussion about the ministerial direction proposed.  I would hope that the Minister would not have this power. I do not trust this Minister because recently he gave the public representatives an opportunity to discuss a situation in relation to areas where elections will take place&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>This is the type of direction which the Minister has been making in recent times.  He leaves the way open for further gerrymandering. It is not desirable that this power should be left to an irresponsible Minister.  Anything the Minister can do by regulation will be done behind closed doors and not in Dáil Éireann, or in the Custom House but where pressure groups can get at him.  This is what has been happening.  The Minister says one thing one day and then changes his mind.</P>

How could it be identical with none of the constituencies?  The Minister's advisers have advised him that this is the best wording.

I am sure this refers to all the constituencies.  What are we to compare them with?  The Minister may have some explanation for this type of wording.  If he has not I am sure he will get it from his advisers in the same manner as he got the information about the section of this Bill which is to stay, notwithstanding the fact that he considers the suggestion of Deputy Molloy and Deputy O'Malley to be superior to what is in the Bill.

      <P>Where a constituency specified in the Schedule to this Act is identical in area with none of the constituencies existing at the passing of this Act...</P>
      <P>My suggestion to the House, to the Minister and to his advisers is that you could say the same thing in a clearer, more positive fashion by saying:</P>
      <P>Where an existing constituency corresponds with any one of the constituencies set out in the Schedule to this Act...</P>
      <P>I submit that means the same thing as this rather obscure wording to which Deputy Dowling drew the attention of the House.  Unfortunately it is expressed here in this Bill in a way which would make this House look ridiculous if we were to pass this section in this form.  The subsection states:</P>
      <P>Where a constituency specified in the Schedule to this Act is identical in area with none of the constituencies existing at the passing of this Act, a postal voters list or lists shall be prepared...</P>

      <P>Once again I should like to ask the Minister to agree to the submission Deputy Molloy and I put forward earlier today.  In case Deputies who have not had an opportunity of reading it might have forgotten the details that proposed amendment reads:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In section 6, subsection (1), page 3, line 1, to delete the words &ldquo;Minister may by direction provide for the entry of&rdquo; and to substitute therefor the words &ldquo;registration authority or registration authorities concerned shall as soon <Col N="1771" /> as may be at the passing of this Act enter&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>As we know already the Minister agreed that the suggestion which Deputy Molloy and I made seemed to him to be a correct one.  We then had a break in the debate on this section for Private Members' Business when the Minister's advisers had an opportunity to examine in some detail the proposal which we put forward and which the Minister found acceptable and a better draft, in his view, than what was in the section.  At the end of Private Members' Business and the Divisions on it about 8 o'clock the Minister was again asked by Deputy Molloy if he would accept the amendment which he and his advisers had had about two hours to consider and which before the interval he said was superior to the wording in the Bill.  The Minister told Deputy Molloy and the House that he did not propose to accept it although he would look sympathetically at it if it was put forward on Report Stage.</P>

      <P>Deputy James Leonard gave me notice that he wished to raise on the Adjournment the subject matter of Question No. 13 which appeared on today's Order Paper.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesLeonard" hpid="Mr. Leonard Mr. Leonard">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Leonard</NameTxt>
      <P>I asked the Minister for Industry and Commerce today if he was satisfied that the removal of animal feedingstuffs from price control was justified.  In his reply he gave as his reasons the recommendations of the Prices Commission in consultation with the Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries and the various farmers representative organisations. The Minister's attitude seemed to be: &ldquo;They told me to do it&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should like to impress on the Minister the seriousness of that action, particularly in the county I represent, <Col N="1772" /> an area of small farms, an area where small farmers are depending for their income on farmyard projects and intensive feeding of pigs and dairy stock.  In that area there are 7,600-odd holdings, and the average farm size is 33 acres.  Thirteen per cent of the farms have ten to 15 acres; 39 per cent have 15 to 30 acres, and 27 per cent have 30 to 50 acres. Therefore, 79 per cent of the farmers in my county have 50 acres of land or less.  In that area pigs are a very important farmyard project; 40 per cent of the farmers in Monaghan keep pigs.  It must also be taken into consideration that a large number of the 7,600-odd people are on off-farm employment and they are not included in the number of farmers who keep pigs, and a large number of them would have pigs of one grade or other, be it rearing, or fattening, on their farms.  When it is considered that 70 per cent of the cost of producing pigs goes into feedingstuffs the serious effect a large increase has on the income of those farmers will be realised. There is also a large number of dairy cattle and on a small acreage the feeding must be supplemented with bought-in feeds.  In that respect it is very important, too, that a very close watch should be kept on prices so that the farmers would have some hope of making an income off those small farms.</P>
    <P>The Minister said it was on the recommendation of farmers that this decision was made.  If he had gone down to Monaghan to a meeting last week and asked those people what they thought of his action in removing price control, I know what they would have told him.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JustinKeating" hpid="Mr. Keating Mr. Keating">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Deputy tell me what they would have told me? Would he put it on the record?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesLeonard" hpid="Mr. Leonard Mr. Leonard">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Leonard</NameTxt>
      <P>I leave to the Minister's imagination what they would have told him when they find their livelihood being taken from them by those massive increases which have been occurring all year, with the largest increase of all coming immediately after the removal of price control.  As I said, it is essential that we would <Col N="1773" /> have farmyard enterprise if the small farmer is to survive.  The poultry enterprise went out of the hands of the farmer into the larger combines, and the only farmyard enterprise left was the pig industry.  Under EEC Directive No. 159 relating to farm modernisation, it is far more important that we would have those farmyard enterprises to make those small farms viable at all. Even in the pig industry it is a very big problem to achieve the targets which they would want to achieve under the EEC directives, and, with present difficulties, it would be absolutely impossible for many of those people to become development farmers.</P>
      <P>A lot of employment was given in a number of compounders and a number of bacon factories.  Only last week the local paper headlined the loss of 23 jobs in one bacon factory. Another heading referred to the IFA protest and when this particular meeting of the Pigs and Bacon Commission was being picketed, the county chairman said that this could be looked upon as drastic action but not so when one considered that the cost of pig rations had increased by £33 over the past year while the price of pigs had increased by £4.50. The cost of producing the pig had gone up by £12 over the past year and during the last six months the sow population had fallen by 50 per cent in County Monaghan.  At present dealers are purchasing sows and killing the piglets so as to sell them as dry sows to the factory at a handsome profit.</P>
      <P>Side by side with that there was another heading: &ldquo;Pig industry crisis.&rdquo; It referred to sows and bonhams being killed off, and to 23 men losing their jobs in an area where jobs are very scarce at any time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Last July I asked the Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries if he would provide a fund to cushion producers against those fluctuations in prices. He said it would be a desirable thing and that he had actually mentioned it to the Pig Board.  We also have the statistics from food and farm research to prove that the margin for pigs in March, 1973, was £3.74 whereas the margin for pigs in September, 1973, was £2.37.  If you add to that the <Col N="1774" /> increase of 65p per cwt. which was the amount that was put on immediately after the de-controlling of animal feed prices, the total is £3.90, which would mean a loss on pig production.</P>
    <P>The Minister said today that he had consultations with the farmers representative organisations and that generally they welcomed the proposal. If the farming organisations were seeking an increase in the price of milk or beet, would he accept their recommendations?  Is that the way he will be guided?  I think a Minister should be his own boss, make his own decisions and should not require to be guided.  As the Government has to rule, the Minister should rule his Department and should not be guided by any outside body.</P>
    <P>By that removal I think he opens the flood gates to the profiteers and that is evidenced by the price being charged at present for feeding barley. Last harvest the farmers got £40 to £50 per ton for barley.  Last week the Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries admitted, in reply to questions, that barley was making from £65 to £75 per ton.  I said then that even at £65 per ton there was excessive profit.  I was disappointed with the Minister today but the most disturbing part of it was that there were some points of which he did not seem to be aware. I thought he was top class as regards agriculture.</P>

      <P>I am talking about barley.  The Minister seemed very vague regarding the amount of profit now obtainable on barley purchased last harvest.  This was my impression and it disturbed me.  When I watched the Minister on television, with a simple stick, he seemed to be very good at the profit margins and food conversion.  I would think that in talking about profit per pig and a livelihood for the small producer that you could base it all on food conversion profit margin.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Leonard</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister can read between the lines of the case I am making.  The Minister is aware that there was a very substantial increase being sought when, as my friend here mentioned, we came to the Monaghan by election&mdash;I have a cutting from a <Col N="1776" /> newspaper here&mdash;and we were castigated for mentioning increases coming up in the price of feedingstuffs. That was denied at those election meetings.  At that time the Minister met members of the farming organisations in Monaghan.  He knew then of this increase and I think he was running away from his responsibilities in that he should have dealt with that application when it was put on his desk for an increase in the price of animal feed instead of taking the easy way, withdrawing the price control and allowing the merchants to set the price.  One of the arguments was that it would create competition which would result in a drop in price. One must realise that most compounders are working to capacity and even if some compounder by more efficient operation or by paying less wages could reduce the price, he could not still provide enough for the needs of the other people.  Competition would not be created that way.  Even if the co-ops&mdash;and, as I said, there are 46 per cent of the compounders in the hands of the co-ops&mdash;were to reduce prices they still could not compound sufficient to cover users' requirements.  From that point of view I think the Minister ran away from his responsibility when the price rise was applied for by giving a free-for-all.</P>

      <P>In the few minutes left I want to endorse what my colleague has said.  In his answer to five questions put down in relation to pigs the Minister's first point was the increase in feedingstuffs.  The questions were put down on Wednesday, 13th February, by Deputy Cunningham, Deputy James Gibbons, Deputy Leonard, Deputy Callanan, Deputy Meaney and Deputy G. Collins.  The Minister took them all together and the first reason he gave for the selling off of sows was the increased price of feedingstuffs.  This was the Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries.  I have great respect for the Minister for Industry and Commerce and, as my colleague said, I also admired him when he was on television but I cannot agree that he should use as an excuse the advice he took from anybody. <Col N="1777" /> When I do business I look for advice from everybody but when it comes to making a decision that I have to stand over I make it and stand over it myself.  The Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries said in answering the questions that he got advice from this one and that one&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>The question now arises: was that action right or wrong? I propose in validation of it to quote <Col N="1779" /> from an article written in <i>The Irish Times</i> of 12th February, 1974, by a Mr. Denis Coghlan.  It is headed: &ldquo;Removal of Controls on Animal Feedstuffs has Lowered Prices.&rdquo;  I want to insert a number of quotations from that article into the record. Firstly it says:</P>
      <P>At the time the recommendations were made, the manufacturers were claiming increases of up to £13 a ton, but yesterday spokesmen for the ICMSA and the IFA reported that in certain instances price increases had ranged from as little as £3 to £5 a ton.</P>
      <P>Further it states:</P>
      <P>Competition between the private manufacturers for sections of the market, allied to strong bargaining by groups of farmers and the presence of the co-operative compounders, led, however, to a gradual reduction in prices.  A spokesman for the ICMSA in Limerick said yesterday that in many instances the increases imposed by the private manufacturing sector had been reduced to as little as £5 a ton.  The IFA spokesman mentioned that, following the increases, some manufacturers were selling compounds at £82 a ton, but because of competition and tough bargaining he knew of people who had been receiving feedstuffs at £72-£73 a ton up to the end of January.</P>

      <P>The ICMSA and the IFA are quoted here.  My Department has been in touch with the IAOS on this subject and I quote from the note of information which they wrote me in connection with the meeting I had a few days ago:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1780" /> The Irish Agricultural Organisation Society...have confirmed that many Co-operatives have not increased the prices of feedstuffs since price control was removed.  This was partly due to the fact that some Co-operatives had stocks of cheaper barley but also in the long term interests of the Co-operative movement they felt bound to allow for the difficult situation facing pig breeders at the present time.</P>
    <P>This is a serious point.  Deputy Leonard is as concerned with the plight of pig and other livestock producers as I am. We are both equally disturbed and distressed at the threat to various sectors of our livestock industry by very large rises in the price of grains and feedingstuffs.  Deputy G. Collins on 6th February in the Official Report, volume 270, column 117, when discussing the current high prices of animal feedingstuffs said:</P>
    <P>...with soya beans now costing £115 per ton and maize £70 per ton and feeding barley and other grains having increased by 50 per cent to 60 per cent in the past couple of months.</P>
    <P>Those are the prices of raw material on world markets which go into these concentrates.  It is a very serious problem for all animal feeders.  I am as seriously concerned about this as the Deputy.  His question to me, and I am endeavouring to reply to it in the minutes remaining, is what is the best thing to do.  The advice of the consultants, of the farmers' organisations, and of the Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries&mdash;I am not contemptuous of people's advice; I will listen to it and make up my mind then &mdash;the unanimous advice I received, including that of consultants, experts employed to advise me, was to remove the control which I did.  It has produced the results testified to by the IFA, the ICMSA, the IAOS and in an article by a journalist whom I do not know and whom I take to be a reasonably reputable journalist.  It makes the point, which is a general argument, that rapidly rising prices for grains and for raw materials of the feedingstuffs are a worldwide phenomenon.</P>

If we have price control, then the maximum price is the price and there is no competition.  If we abolish price control and have competition, some will go to the maximum price and some will not and they will compete as has been instanced in the period since abolition in the articles from the IFA, the ICMSA, the IAOS and the <Col N="1782" /> article I have quoted.  There is evidence from all over the country that that is happening.  The farmers are benefiting by this difference, in this instance between £13 a ton and £2 or £3 a ton.  If Deputies want price control at a time when the increases in raw materials are rapid, then what they are doing is taking from the farmers this difference.  He is advocating an irresponsible and ill-considered course of action which will damage farmers' interests.  If Deputy Leonard, whom I take to be more serious in this regard, acquainted himself with the contents of occasional paper No. 11 of the National Prices Commission, he will see the reason for the abolition.  If he contacted the IFA, the ICMSA, the IAOS and asked what happened, he would satisfy himself that the result was as we wished and to the benefit of the farmers.  The decision, which he had not the courage to say was either right or wrong, was a correct decision which helped agriculture.</P>
