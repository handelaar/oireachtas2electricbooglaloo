      <P>When the debate adjourned, I was referring to the choices&mdash;notionally, at least&mdash;open to the Government as a result of the Supreme Court decision.  I want now to refer to the general running through the judgments of the Supreme Court. The position emerges quite clearly from those judgments and this position is equally clearly not understood, even by some of those who would oppose this Bill for the wrong reasons. I shall quote now from the judgement of Mr. Justice Walsh; it is as yet an unreported judgement, but it is a vital statement of the law.</P>
      <P>There is no law in force in the State which prohibits the use of contraceptives either in or outside of marriage&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      <P>&mdash;that does not surprise any of us since there could never be such a law&mdash;</P>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;or the manufacture or distribution of contraceptives within the State.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="892" /> That was the position prior to the Supreme Court judgement and it is the position at present.  It is important that Deputies, who would oppose this Bill for the wrong reasons, and the public, who may be misinformed, should recognise that there is now no law in this State prohibiting the manufacture of contraceptives within the State or, for that matter, prohibiting in any way the distribution of contraceptives within this State.  I would like all Deputies who may, for some reason, think this Bill&mdash;this has sometimes been represented to us&mdash;is aimed at liberalising contraceptives to take that into account.</P>
    <P>As a result of the McGee decision, not only is there no law affecting the restriction of manufacture or distribution of contraceptives but there is now no law regulating or restricting the importation of contraceptives.  Frankly, I agree with the Government that they were right in not leaving the position as it is at present and I strongly disagree with those who oppose this Bill simply because they think that, by doing nothing, we retain whatever it is they believe we have up to the moment, though their belief is, in fact, mistaken.</P>
    <P>I would say to Deputies who will speak later and possibly suggest that, for conscientious reasons, they are opposing this Bill, to consider what I have said as a factual statement and not just an opinion, which some people seem to imagine was what the Supreme Court gave in the McGee case.  When the Supreme Court make a statement on the law that is, in fact, the law.  They are not giving statements as individuals but as the chief element in the Judiciary, the Supreme Court, which has an important function in our whole democratic structure, as important a function as we have in this Legislature.  They decide whether or not the laws that we pass are in conformity with the Constitution.</P>
    <P>I want to refer now to the Act itself.  Section 17 (3) of the Criminal Law Amendment Act, 1935, was found unconstitutional.  Here I want to refer to a common theme running <Col N="893" /> through the judgment of the Supreme Court.  The Long Title of the Act is: &ldquo;An Act to make further and better provision for the protection of young girls and the supression of brothels and prostitution and for those and other purposes to amend the law relating to sexual offences&rdquo;.  The Supreme Court quite rightly pointed out that the Act was intended at the time to deal with what was regarded as sexual vice or promiscuity, that and no more.  There is no evidence that that Act was in any way intended to be an Act which would regulate population or be an instrument of population control.  The evidence is, in fact, all to the contrary.</P>
    <P>When dealing with section 17 (3) Judge Henchy had this to say:</P>
    <P>It is significant that this section, which deals with the prohibition of sale and importation of contraceptives comes between sections 16 and 18.</P>
    <P>Section 16 deals with the supression of prostitution:</P>
    <P>Every common prostitute who is found loitering in any street, thoroughfare, or other place and importuning or soliciting passers-by for purposes of prostitution or being otherwise offensive to passers-by shall be guilty of an offence under this section and shall on summary conviction thereof be liable, in the case of a first such offence, to a fine not exceeding two pounds or, in the case of a second or any subsequent such offence, to imprisonment for any term not exceeding six months.</P>
    <P>That section is exclusively concerned with prostitution.</P>
    <P>Section 18, which follows naturally section 17, portion of which was held to be unconstitutional by the Supreme Court deals with public indecency. It provides:</P>
    <P>Every person who shall commit, at or near and in sight of any place along which the public habitually pass as of right or by permission, any act in such a way as to <Col N="894" /> offend modesty or cause scandal or injure the morals of the community shall be guilty of an offence under this section and shall on summary conviction thereof be liable to a fine not exceeding two pounds or, at the discretion of the court, to imprisonment for any term not exceeding one month.</P>
    <P>It is relevant to point out here that section 17, which deals with the prohibition of sale and importation of contraceptives, comes between these two sections which are obviously exclusively concerned with what one might describe as public vice or indecency and have little or nothing to do with private behaviour and less to do with anything in the nature of the rights of married couples to behave as they wish in the privacy of their own homes and their right to decide what they should do in the matter of family planning.</P>
    <P>As Judge Walsh said, and very few of us can disagree with this, it is a matter exclusively for husband and wife to decide how many children they wish to have.  Of course, they are not the final judges of how many children they will have.  It is outside the competence of the State to decide for them.  None of us as legislators, Executive or otherwise, can attempt to decide for the public at large how many children they should have or what restrictions there should be on them in their decision as to how many children they wish to have. The judge went on to say that the individual has natural and human rights over which the State has no authority and the family is the natural primary and fundamental unit group of society as established in our Constitution and has rights which the State cannot control.  And I would add, rights with which the State has no right to interfere.  Indeed, if it had such a right would have no competence to do so.</P>
    <P>It is clearly established that the State must decide what it can do and has a right to do before introducing legislation in this area.  It is significant that the judges say there is nothing in the law or in their judgments <Col N="895" /> which should be taken as an indication that the control, of the importation of contraceptives, or the sale of contraceptives is <i>per se</i> unconstitutional. They made no judgment on the control and regulation of either the sale or importation of contraceptives.  It is important to note that neither did any of the judges indicate that they were offering any view as to the constitutionality or otherwise of the availability or unavailability of contraceptives for unmarried people.</P>
    <P>Judge Walsh said also that he had given no consideration whatsoever to the question of the constitutionality or otherwise of laws which would withhold or restrict the availability of contraceptives for use outside of marriage and &ldquo;nothing in his judgment is intended to offer any opinions on that matter&rdquo;.  Therefore, I am sure everybody will agree that a change in the law is necessary.</P>
    <P>Before I come to what we think are the desirable ways of effecting that change in accordance with what we recognise to be the right standards in society, while protecting the rights of the individual as enshrined in our Constitution to freedom of conscience and private behaviour, might I correct a misinterpretation which appeared on page 1 of <i>The Irish Times</i> in a Dáil sketch of the debate on 4th July, 1974?  I am represented in that sketch as saying&mdash;I cannot think of the exact words&mdash;something along these lines: &ldquo;Thanks be to God there will be chemists in this country who will have nothing to do with this illicit or offensive trade.&rdquo;  A further interpretation is put on that: &ldquo;That's a nice message for the filthy Prods in Northern Ireland.&rdquo;  I find this personally very hurtful but that does not matter.  I agree that it would be hurtful to the Protestants in Northern Ireland or anywhere for that matter. That is the most important aspect.  If it were to appear that any spokesman for any party in this House expressed a view of that nature it could have serious consequences.  As it happens, that was not my view.  Nothing I said could have justified that.  As I said, I have been embarrassed by this <Col N="896" /> but that does not matter.  I was referring to the possible reactions of some people and I was not expressing my own view.  As reported at column 374, Volume 274 of the Official Report of 4th July, 1974, I said:</P>
    <P>It is good to have chemists who will not be used by any liberals to supply contraceptives to those who wish to have them.  Does the Minister think that that reaction is possible in rural Ireland?</P>
    <P>I was simply presenting a reaction that would be possible in rural Ireland and not my own personal impression, and would be quite inconsistent with anything I said on that day, to-day or any other occasion. Unfortunately what I said is not on the record in inverted commas; it never is.  Maybe I did not have the right cadence in my voice to indicate this but I said:</P>
    <P>It is good to have chemists who will not be used by any liberals to supply contraceptives to those who wish to have them.</P>
    <P>I went on to say, and this is the important part:</P>
    <P>Does the Minister think that that reaction is possible in rural Ireland?</P>
    <P>Perhaps there could be some doubt but I want to make it clear now that I was referring to a reaction I thought might be possible in rural Ireland or any other part of the country.  I was not presenting that as being my own view. I do not feel qualified to offer a moral judgment on anyone who decides to take any course of action in this case. If I were to offer a judgement, it would not be on the basis of that misrepresentation of my intention.</P>
    <P>There will be many towns in Ireland where no chemist will apply for a licence to sell contraceptives.  Without making very many inquiries I know of some cases.  They may decide not to apply for a licence, not for any principles of morality but for reasons of good, sound, commercial practice. A chemist engaged in the lucrative business of cosmetics or photography may have to decide when going into another area of business if it will increase or interfere in any way with <Col N="897" /> his existing trade.  It is his right to decide whether the sale of contraceptives would benefit or lead to the detriment of his business.  Of course there may be some chemists who do not apply for a licence for reasons of morality.  If that is so, the Minister will recognise the imbalance in the law.</P>
    <P>In some areas there will be a freer availability than in others.  As I mentioned on the last occasion, if one chemist in a small town applies for a licence and others do not, does the Minister not think it is possible this may give rise to a reaction within the community, unjustified and unwarranted though it may be?  There may be the attitude: &ldquo;So-and-so handles the quare things but the others who are nice, decent people will not&rdquo;.  I am not trying to justify this attitude; I am simply asking the Minister does he think it desirable that this possibility exists as a result of this Bill.</P>
    <P>What about the situation where there is no chemist, where it will be left to traders?  It is my opinion that if a trader applies for a licence it will cause certain reactions, perhaps undesirable reactions and ones we could not and do not commend.  Do we think that where the State has a responsibility this can be discharged in such a haphazard arrangement, where certain individuals in small towns and villages may decide to apply for licences?  Are we going to depend on that possibility to discharge our duties?  In doing so, are we satisfied if these reactions develop?</P>
    <P>I do not think we can do this. I do not think it is right for us to do it and, while I recognise that what the Parliamentary Secretary to the Taoiseach said on the last occasion, that the law is simply an attempt by us to frame the conditions for society and there will always be loopholes we cannot foresee&mdash;he mentioned the loopholes in the Intoxicating Liquor Act&mdash; may be true, I do not think we can contemplate supporting any Bill in the knowledge of all the gaps that exist, even before practice will prove that many others exist also.  We could not justify supporting a Bill of this nature in the light of the strong opinions and impressions we have of its unworkability.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="898" /> Section 5 states:</P>
    <P>(1)  A person who is unmarried and who is not the holder of a licence granted under section 2 shall not purchase a contraceptive.</P>
    <P>(2)  A person who contravenes subsection (1) shall be guilty of an offence and shall be liable on summary conviction to a fine not exceeding £100.</P>
    <P>How does the Minister think such an offence can be proved?  Through what channels does he think it can be prosecuted?  Who will supply the evidence to the Director of Public Prosecutions or whoever will have the responsibility of bringing such a charge, and on what basis?  If it is an offence for the would-be purchaser who may be a young person under 21 years to purchase contraceptives and be liable to a fine, can the Minister explain why it is not an offence for the licensed seller who knowingly sells a contraceptive to such a person? I am merely posing the question. I am not suggesting it should be an offence.  If it is an offence for the purchaser, should it not be an offence for the person who knowingly sells the contraceptive?  Should we set up in this, or in any other legislation, inconsistencies of this nature?  Should we introduce offences that we know before we start cannot and should not be offences in any event in that sense? If so, can we be blamed on this side of the House for saying we find this Bill inoperable and one we cannot support?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>I shall refer to our proposals if the Minister wishes to accept them.  I have said today that it is our responsibility to deal with this matter.  We cannot leave it to licensed chemists or traders to take that responsibility.  In so far as it is the responsibility of the State to deal with the matter, we consider it can best be discharged through the State agencies established by this Legislature and the Executive.  In this instance the most obvious ones are the health <Col N="899" /> boards.  I know there will be practical difficulties but I shall express some view on it and point out how we envisage the health boards would operate in this area.</P>
      <P>First, we must recognise that the Supreme Court has clearly said it is the right of married couples to be allowed to import and to use contraceptives. Therefore, if we want to act in accordance with that and in accordance with the principles of private behaviour, we should recognise that a married couple have the right to use contraceptives in the course of their private behaviour for family planning.  They do not have to justify to anyone outside their own home why they want to use contraceptives. On the last occasion the Parliamentary Secretary to the Taoiseach spoke about people using contraceptives for selfish or unselfish reasons.  Who is to judge whether a married couple will use contraceptives for selfish or unselfish reasons?  In our proposals or suggestions to the Government&mdash;it is they who will have to decide whether our suggestions&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Cruise-O'Brien</NameTxt>
      <P>If you have proposals you should be prepared to allow the Bill to survive to Committee Stage and then amend it.  If you have suggestions and then defeat the Second Reading there would be no chance to do that.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister is entitled to his interpretation as to the consequences of making &ldquo;proposals&rdquo; and &ldquo;suggestions&rdquo;.  I thought I had given fairly clear, consistent <Col N="900" /> and cogent reasons why this Bill as presented is unacceptable to us.  It is a Bill we find that simply does not act in accordance with our obligations or one that we can support.  For that reason I suggest to the Government that they withdraw it and consider instead &ldquo;suggestions&rdquo; or &ldquo;proposals&rdquo;&mdash;whichever the Minister wants&mdash; which would, first of all, use the agencies of the State I have mentioned&mdash;the health boards&mdash;and, in doing so, would ensure simply that these agencies would be channels of distribution to married couples who would apply for contraceptives; that nobody there would have the right to decide&mdash;there would be no question of medical prescriptions or otherwise &mdash;nobody in these health boards would have the right to accept or reject application from married couples whether or not a married couple who wished to have these for their own private use, in their own homes, for their own purposes&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMarkCooney" hpid="Mr. Cooney Mr. Cooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cooney</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Deputy mean the health boards should set up family planning clinics?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes.  I am suggesting this to the Minister.  I can appreciate that there may be some matters to be worked out in detail but this is what I am suggesting to the Minister. I am suggesting that, from the point of view of availability, it may mean what the Minister says but it means more.  It means simply that they would be a channel of distribution for those who would apply for them, those need not seek advice from the health boards.  But, in conjunction with that, you must take our other suggestion which Deputy O'Malley indicated here.  In conformity, and consistent with the judgement of the Supreme Court, we think also there should be the right to import, subject to regulation, that the individual would have the right to import contraceptives, subject to restrictions and regulations which would confine them broadly for personal use and, not for commercial purposes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I appreciate that there may be areas here which will require a lot of study <Col N="901" /> in order to introduce practical regulations in that connection.  Nonetheless, if you take those two aspects of it together&mdash;the right of the individual to import for his own personal use and distribution through the health boards&mdash;on balance at least it would seem to be approaching it in a more orderly, responsible and, in my view, more satisfactory manner than the manner in which it is presented in the Bill.</P>
    <P>There may be people who, listening to the debate, may express some frustration that we have not taken certain things into account so far; that we have not considered medical, or socio-medical aspects of the question. Of course, they are probably right. Certainly, I do not profess to be qualified any more than any other adult in this country to offer views in any informed way on what will be the social or medical consequences of this Bill or of our proposals.  I do it merely as an ordinary citizen going on the impressions I get of the people with whom I come into contact and doing the best I can to implement their wishes in the interests of the orderly regulation of society.  At the same time&mdash;as I said today and indeed on the last time we debated this matter&mdash;I recognise that our Constitution specifically, first of all, recognises the right to freedom to practise religion, and, in my view, inherent in that is the right to abide by the doctrines and tenets of each denomination.  We have to recognise that there are denominations here who do not have the same view of this as others.  The majority denomination, the Roman Catholic Church, may have a very clear view on it.</P>
    <P>Finally, may I say that I have simply offered my view as a legislator for the time being.  I happen to be a Roman Catholic and my view on this matter as to whether or not I would use contraceptives is in no way relevant. Those of us who are concerned for our religion, or the doctrines of any religion in this case, can prove that concern only by adhering in our normal lives to the tenets of that doctrine.  We do not prove it by coming here to impose the principles of <Col N="902" /> that religion on another denomination or on other codes that may find those principles unacceptable.  I would hope that people would recognise that the legislation that must now be introduced will not in any way change their right to behave as they always have done and will not in any way change the environment in which they want to live or the traditions which they may respect.  It may go a long way in enriching them and acknowledging that there are others who feel that, in their private behaviour and private lives, they are entitled to act in accordance with their consciences and that nothing in the attitudes of a majority should prevent them from so doing.  That is simply what we are intending to do here; what any individual amongst us may do subsequently is of no consequence.  But I think it vitally important that we have no responsibility; it is not our function here to give effect to the teachings of any Church.  It is our function to look at the standard of society and to ensure that the rights of the individual, as enshrined in our Constitution, will not only be protected but promoted. The Bill may intend to do that.  I think it fails to do so.  It is for that reason that we are opposing it. But, if the Minister would indicate that he would be concerned to give effect to our alternatives, then I think he would find that, from this side of the House, we are not merely going to oppose it for the sake of so doing. If he wants to give effect to what we are suggesting I think he would find that all of us could work together to do so.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Posts and Telegraphs (Dr. Cruise-O'Brien)</NameTxt>
      <P>I have listened to the whole of this debate so far. I have heard the contributions of the Opposition speakers with some depression, some confusion, with occasional rays of hope.  There were rays of hope this morning in the earlier part of what Deputy O'Kennedy said.  Many of the expressions he used were liberal and generous.  I know from my knowledge of the Deputy that he is sincere when he uses them and that there are a number of people over there who are also sincere in that direction.  But <Col N="903" /> I heard with sadness the concluding part of Deputy O'Kennedy's statement in which he announced that, nonetheless, he was going to oppose this Bill, allegedly, on the ground that it was unworkable, and so on.  I say &ldquo;allegedly&rdquo; because I think he is bound; his party appear to have taken a position as a bloc on this and I do not think they have taken it because they think that health clinics are preferable to chemist shops and so on.</P>
      <P>I am afraid I do not believe that of them, as a party, and I can appreciate that people who are quite sincere in their own professions&mdash;in what they want to say on this&mdash;have, at times, to be controlled by a collective decision. How binding that collective decision is I do not know.  I would think that, if their objections are what they say they are, they can let this Bill survive into Committee and they can there seek to amend it.  It does not look as if they are going to do that, but I might be wrong.  I am sometimes wrong about the gentlemen opposite. They may be preparing to let it through.  I hope so.  At the moment their position is that they are not offering to amend.  They speak as if they intend to vote against the Bill on the Second Reading and perhaps to defeat it.</P>
      <P>Their alternative suggestion is that the Government should withdraw their own Bill, the Bill which the Minister for Justice on behalf of the Government came here to put in, and put in later another Bill which would be based not on proposals which they have made from over there&mdash;though Deputy O'Kennedy inadvertently, hopefully, used that phrase&mdash;but on very vague suggestions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>All right, suppose we were to withdraw this Bill and then come back and say, &ldquo;Here is our new Bill based on your suggestions&rdquo;; and suppose then &mdash;these are very vague suggestions&mdash; we were to be told, &ldquo;No, it does not meet our suggestions, it is not really workable and we will not have it&rdquo;, we could become involved in a process which would mean no legislation at all.  That is what I might describe as <Col N="904" /> the majority of the Opposition view. They say that legislation is needed when in fact they do not want it.  They say they agree there is a need for legislation but they flatly oppose the only legislation that is before the House and they offer no real alternative to it.  I do not count these different tentative, half-hearted throw-away suggestions they have made which are not proposals at all.</P>
    <P>The objections they have formulated to the Bill are all of a kind which could be covered by amendments on Committee Stage.  The obvious policy for a party who see the need for legislation is to criticise the Bill on Second Reading, to vote for or at least not to vote against the Second Reading of the Bill and then seek to remedy its deficiencies by amendments in Committee.</P>
    <P>If they reject this course, if they vote as a body against the Second Reading, surely it will be obvious that their objection to the Bill as a party is not based on the objections they have formulated here, since they are in a strong position to correct any of the deficiencies they have referred to by amendments which many of us on this side would be prepared to consider sympathetically.</P>
    <P>For example, Opposition speakers have indicated that they consider the section confining the sale of contraceptives to married people to be impracticable or unworkable.  Are they prepared to put down an amendment for the deletion of that section and would they be prepared to vote for the Bill so amended?  If the answer to both these questions should be &ldquo;yes&rdquo;&mdash; I do not think it is&mdash;then some support, including mine, would be forthcoming from this side for such an amendment.  They may ask, and it would be a reasonable question, why we&mdash;I refer to the few of us: I am not speaking for everybody over here &mdash;who agree with their criticism&mdash;the Deputy laughs; I do not think this is funny; I think it is anything but funny; I do not think that the situation we are dealing with here or our attitude to it is funny&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Kitt Mr. Kitt">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kitt</NameTxt>
      <P>I was not laughing at <Col N="905" /> the situation.  I was laughing at the impression&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="ConorCruiseOBrien" hpid="Dr. Cruise-O'Brien Dr. Cruise-O'Brien">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Cruise-O'Brien</NameTxt>
      <P>All right.  They may ask why we who agree with their criticisms to a considerable extent do not ourselves put down an amendment.  The answer is simple: if such an amendment were put down and if it were carried, with the Opposition abstaining, as they might abstain &mdash;I do not know whether they would or not&mdash;and if the Opposition then voted against the Bill as a whole, the Bill as a whole would be defeated since there are a number of Deputies who will support the Bill as it stands but could not support a Bill so amended.</P>
      <P>I regard the Bill as it stands, with all its defects&mdash;it has a good many defects&mdash;as preferable to no legislation at all but I think it could be greatly improved in Committee if the Opposition are prepared to discharge their responsibilities as Members of the Oireachtas in trying to see to it that the legislation that we pass is the best that can be achieved in the interests of the people.  If Fianna Fáil vote against the Second Reading of this Bill in sufficient strength to defeat it, then I think it will be clear what they as a party are up to&mdash;against the inclinations, I know, of some of their number.  Despite their formal acknowledgement of the major social and national issues involved, it will be clear that as a party what they are doing is using the issue purely for what they hope to be political gain for their party.  They have very much in mind the statement of the Catholic Hierarchy on this subject, although they did not make much reference to that in the debate, certainly not as much reference as the bulk it occupies in relation to this debate.</P>

    <P>I think their organisers, their master minds, believe they may be able to drum up support, particularly among the older voters in the more thinly populated areas, by opposing this Bill. But they are in a political difficulty. They do not want to alienate support among the younger voters and in the more densely populated areas by opposing the Bill on principle and saying flatly in this House that contraception <Col N="906" /> is wrong and should be prohibited by law.  None of their speakers in this debate has said that.</P>

      <P>All right, I think the Deputy is honest in that. Their leading speakers, and if I may say so without offence to the Deputy, their front bench speakers, have not said that.  They have adopted the strategy, if it is a strategy, of giving formal reasons rather than reasons of principle for opposing the Bill.  This procedure gives their Deputies in different parts of the country the opportunity of interpreting their party's position in different ways.  In the thinly populated areas they will be likely to emphasise the mere fact of their having opposed the Bill and allow it to be understood that they did so on moral and religious grounds and in deference to the position of the Catholic Hierarchy.  In the cities, on the other hand, they can allow it to be understood that they are not against legislation on contraception but simply against the Government's allegedly unworkable Bill which they can even suggest was unduly restrictive.  Their speakers who take that line will certainly be able to quote Deputy O'Kennedy's speech today.</P>
      <P>This is an extremely convenient position electorally, but hardly an admirable one.  Let us be clear about this.  We are not pleading with the Opposition to help us out of some kind of difficulty.  As far as we are concerned this is a free vote.  If the Opposition wish to vote as a bloc in order to defeat any legislation on this subject while claiming to regard legislation as necessary, that is the Opposition's responsibility.  I make no plea to them on behalf of the Government.  It is not the Government who need their help.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>However, I do ask them, particularly those of them whom I know to be personally concerned about the serious issues involved&mdash;I would certainly include the last speaker and Deputy Brugha&mdash;to think about their own responsibility to the people which requires of them that <Col N="907" /> they take a hand in helping to provide legislation which they themselves recognise to be necessary.  I put it to them that it is their duty to do so.  That is not an appeal on behalf of the Government.</P>
    <P>I should now like to turn to the fundamental issues involved and I should like to begin by explaining why I consider this Bill to be inadequate; to go on to explain why, nevertheless, I intend to vote for it and to conclude by discussing some of the objections raised against it.</P>
    <P>The main defect of this Bill is that it does not provide family planning advice and assistance in accordance with the conscience of the mother which would be regarded as an essential part of preventive medicine in the same way as protection against smallpox and TB is now so regarded. It does, however, make possible the beginning of progress in that direction. The suggestions made by Deputy O'Malley and by the last speaker about the use of health clinics might perhaps be taken as pointing in this desirable direction.  If these gentlemen later put down amendments which satisfy me that this is the direction in which they are intended to work I will be prepared to support such amendments.</P>
    <P>Perhaps this Bill will reach Committee Stage.  Perhaps it will.  I am almost beginning to believe it will, and if it does we will then see how much substance there was in these suggestions which are not quite proposals. If we look at the analysis of the fertility of marriage contained in the 1961 census we find, taking marriages of 20-24 years duration where the wife was aged 20-24 at marriage, very interesting and striking social contrast. Wives married to unskilled manual workers have: 11 per cent more children than the wives of semi-skilled manual workers; 16 per cent more children than the wives of skilled manual workers; 35 per cent more children than the wives of intermediate non-manual workers; 44 per cent more children than the wives of salaried employees and 58 per cent <Col N="908" /> more children than the wives of employers and managers.</P>
    <P>These figures tell a painful story. This very strict class hierarchy shows clearly that the burden is being borne by those least able to bear it.  It is this stark fact which points up most clearly the inadequacy of our response to this problem.  I am speaking here of the whole Oireachtas, when I say &ldquo;our&rdquo;.  But there are other costs of our inaction which have also borne most heavily on the poorest of our society.  The methods of population control which Irish society has used since the last century have been late marriages, permanent bachelorhood and emigration.</P>

      <P>I agree that the list could be extended.  These methods&mdash;or most of them&mdash;are happily coming to an end, and part of our present problem is that we refuse to recognise the extent to which they have already been replaced by other methods.  We are all aware of the evils of emigration and of the toll which it took.  What has not been chronicled so fully, except perhaps in a light-hearted way, is the serious burden which permanent bachelorhood has been, and the extent to which this burden has been most unevenly shared between the various classes of society.</P>
      <P>If we take the percentage of males aged 45-54 who were recorded as single in the 1961 census in the different social groups, we get the following results:</P>

    <P>Again the same story.  I can sum up the class aspect of family planning by quoting from Paper No. 42 of the Economic and Social Research Institute &ldquo;Some Irish Population Problems Re-considered&rdquo; where the author, Mr. Brendan Walsh, says on page 13:</P>
    <P>The burdens of large family size <Col N="909" /> and permanent celibacy appear to fall most heavily on those who are least adequately equipped to deal with the resultant economic and psychological stresses.</P>
    <P>The word &ldquo;psychological&rdquo; is important. There is no point bemoaning our internationally high levels of mental illness unless we are prepared to tackle the problems of harassed mothers and those caused by indefinitely postponed marriages.  These two problems are related.</P>
    <P>That is why I regard the Bill as inadequate. There are those in the family planning movement and, for all I know, on the benches opposite, who agree with this view and who say that therefore this Bill should be opposed because it is even more restrictive than the existing legislation as amended by the recent Supreme Court decision.</P>
    <P>I am supporting the Bill because it represents a general consensus of the parties making up the National Coalition, because I believe it to be right and timely that the Oireachtas should legislate in this area, and because the Bill does take the important and necessary step of legalising the sale of contraceptives in the Republic.</P>
    <P>The country is, as is well known, sharply divided on this issue with a clear majority of the electorate, according to all public opinion surveys, in favour of the legislation of contraception with suitable safeguards.</P>
    <P>This division is not along party lines and I expect to find this reflected in the voting in this House.  The division is a much more serious one in our society and this is why I value consensus. It is more than anything a division between generations.  This can be illustrated by the results of an opinion poll conducted by Irish Marketing Surveys Ltd., in February of this year, the results of which were published in <i>Hibernia Review</i> of April 12th.</P>
    <P>The question put was as follows:</P>
    <P>People have different views on the use of contraceptives.  Irrespective of your opinion on the use of contraceptives, <Col N="910" /> I would like you to give me your opinion on the sale of contraceptives in Ireland.  Would you tell me which of these statements comes closest to your view?</P>
    <P>The two alternatives were:</P>
    <P>(a)  The sale of contraceptives should be permitted by law through chemists.</P>
    <P>&mdash;&mdash;that is basically what the present Bill intends to do and&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <P>(b)  The sale of contraceptives should be forbidden by law.</P>
    <P>&mdash;&mdash;which reflects the previous position, which was ruled out by the Supreme Court.</P>
    <P>The split in the generations is illustrated by the following analysis of the percentage of each age group who wished to permit the sale of contraceptives, that is to say, broadly those who would favour this Bill:</P>

    <P>In regard to the distinction in relation to age, the point is most poignantly made when we compare the views of married women of childbearing age with those of older married women:</P>

    </table>
    <P>&mdash;&mdash;making a grand total of 51% of married women who would favour this Bill.</P>
    <P>I feel there is a heavy responsibility on all Deputies, since we tend to be elected for our seniority and experience, to bear in mind the views of the younger married couples who are most directly affected by this legislation and who are about 70 per cent in favour of this.</P>
    <P>This may also well be a question of electoral prudence, since many of us <Col N="911" /> tend to take political soundings within our own age group.  This could lead many Deputies astray on a question like this, where age as we see from that survey is a vital factor.</P>
    <P>I have said that it is important to seek consensus in this matter, but I feel it is very important also to enact into legislation the consensus of 1974 rather than to leave the consensus of 1935 to be gradually and ignominiously shot to pieces by the Supreme Court.  Many things have changed since 1935 and it is the duty of the Legislature to take these changes into account.</P>
    <P>I am sorry to inflict more statistics on Deputies but the statistics in this area are of extreme interest.  In the second volume of the 1971 census we see how many more married people we have in 1971 compared with the number of married people in 1936, particularly in the younger, fertile, age groups.</P>
    <P>Between 1936 and 1971 the number of married women rose by: 128 per cent in the 15-19 age group; 102 per cent in the 20-25 age group; 55 per cent in the 25-29 age group; 23 per cent in the 30-35 age group; It decreased by 2 per cent in the 35-39 age group for some reason and rose by 18 per cent in the 40-44 age group.</P>
    <P>Altogether there has been an increase of 26 per cent in the number of married women aged under 44 since the time the Dáil last legislated on this issue.  During the same time our total population rose by a mere 0.3 per cent.  This change is a welcome one and shows that we live in very different times from the times in which our present law was enacted. However, since it shows that we have abandoned late marriages and the emigration of our young people as checks on population, we must recognise that other methods have been adopted already, whether we like it or not.</P>
    <P>Unless we register our present consensus now as a Legislature in terms that are relevant to the present situation, we are merely running away from the problem.  While this might <Col N="912" /> result in a superficially more liberal legal position, because of the Supreme Court judgment, it would serve to bring this House into disrepute.  Those who criticise the Bill as unworkable or as not going far enough have a clear remedy.  They cannot avoid this and I offer no apology for repeating this point.  It is essential to bring it home.  They can bring in amendments and, in the free vote situation, on this side, such amendments have a fair chance of being incorporated into the law.</P>
    <P>I would like to turn now to some of the objections which have been raised against this Bill, the more general objections.  It has been said, for instance, that this question is of no relevance to the situation in Northern Ireland because Protestants are not really in favour of contraception. We shall see how much truth there is in that.</P>
    <P>It is, of course, true that the passage of this Bill will not alter the very deep-rooted opposition of Northern Unionists to a united Ireland.  Indeed, its terms will no doubt be castigated as excessively restrictive.  However, nothing is more certain than that a failure to have the courage to tackle this question in any way will show clearly that we have no intention of ever creating the pluralist society, without which the oft-repeated aspiration to unity is a hollow sham.</P>
    <P>To emphasise this point, I would like to place on the record of this House the most authoritative collective views of the main Protestant Churches on this issue.</P>
    <P>The General Synod of the Church of Ireland passed a resolution in 1971 and I quote:</P>
    <P>welcoming the efforts being made to amend the legislation concerning contraception in the Republic.</P>
    <P>The Presbyterian Church in Ireland has a Synod of Dublin, representative of their members living in the Republic, which passed a resolution in June, 1961 &mdash; a long time ago &mdash; and I quote:</P>
    <P>The Synod of Dublin calls upon the Government of the Republic of <Col N="913" /> Ireland to amend the law with regard to the importation and sale of contraceptives, and the law which forbids advocating their use.</P>
    <P>The Methodist Church, in the June, 1971, report of their Council on Social Welfare said:</P>
    <P>It is our judgement that prevention of conception is necessary in most normal families.  Every marriage should if possible be fruitful. This does not mean, however, that there should be an unlimited amount of children.</P>
    <P>On 15th February of this year, I received a letter saying that&mdash;and I quote:</P>
    <P>The Religious Society of Friends (Quakers) in Dublin welcomes the decision of the Government to introduce a Family Planning Bill in the current session of the Dáil.</P>
    <P>I think that these quotations show that there can be little doubt about the position of the Protestant Churches in this matter and anyone who suggests there is a doubt merely reveals that he is not listening to what they are saying.  It is said that the Catholic Church has the right also to offer its advice on this matter.  That is quite true.  But there is an important difference.  Whether this Bill is passed or not, those who wish to follow the teaching of the Hierarchy on this matter remain perfectly free to do so.  On the other hand, if the existing legislation stands, Protestants who follow the dictates of their conscience on this matter, with the approval and sanction of their Church, are branded as criminals.</P>
    <P>It would be wrong of course to overemphasise the difference between the Churches.</P>
    <P>Pope Paul in his encyclical letter <i>Humanae Vitae</i> said clearly and I quote:</P>
    <P>Married love, therefore, requires of husband and wife the full awareness of their obligations in the matter of responsible parenthood, which today rightly enough is much insisted on, but which, at the same time should be rightly understood.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="914" /> He went on to explain that:</P>
    <P>The Church nevertheless, in urging men to the observance of the precepts of the natural law, which it interprets by its constant doctrine, teaches as absolutely required that in any use whatever of marriage there must be no impairment of its natural capacity to produce life.</P>
    <P>That quotation is from the Catholic Truth Society edition, pages 12-13.</P>
    <P>Thus it is clear that we are not faced with any religious disagreement about the need for family planning as such. The disagreement comes when the theological acceptability of various methods is considered.  Fortunately we, as a House, are not called upon to go into these theological questions.</P>
    <P>The Irish Hierarchy said in their statement of the 26th November and I quote:</P>
    <P>There are many things which the Catholic Church holds to be morally wrong and no one has ever suggested, least of all the Church herself, that they should be prohibited by the State.</P>
    <P>The Hierarchy went on to question the effect that the increased availability of contraceptives might have on the quality of life in the Republic of Ireland.  Their analysis was entirely devoted to the effect of family planning as such, while ignoring the fact that the Catholic Church regards some methods as licit and other methods as illicit, from a theological point of view.</P>
    <P>Secondly, in their discussion of the quality of life, they do not recognise explicitly the very considerable positive contribution which family planning in accordance with the parents' conscience can make to the quality of life and particularly, as we have seen, among the poorer and least protected classes.  Thirdly, by implying that the legislative position should be left as it is, they may have encouraged those who indulge in a self-deception which is damaging to the quality of public life in this State.</P>
    <P>We all know that some 40,000 women are at present using the anovulant pill as a contraceptive.  That <Col N="915" /> is against the law as it stands, but we pretend to believe or are asked to pretend to believe that these pills are being sold for other purposes.  This self-deception imposed an unfair risk on those women for whom the pill was contraindicated but for whom it was the only legal contraceptive.  Now, following the Supreme Court's decision we have the additional self-deception that what is all right for mail order is wrong when purchased through an Irish chemist.</P>
    <P>This atmosphere of self-deceit, and unfortunately it is very real, saps the respect for law and the rule of law in our community.  To diminish this respect for the rule of law is to threaten not only the quality of life, but a considerable number of actual lives, in present circumstances.  In any event, the case which the Hierarchy sought to make for a positive correlation between such things as the illegitimate birth rate and the availability of contraceptives does not seem to be well-founded.</P>
    <P>In conclusion of this part I would like to refer to a report of the Fianna Fáil Ard-Fheis, 1969, where <i>The Irish Times</i> of the 30th January, 1969, reported Deputy Lynch as saying, on the subject of contraception:</P>
    <P>This was a matter of conscience, and a matter in which the State had no right to intervene.</P>

      <P>I would agree with the Deputy, but the State intervened, in 1935, and it appears must continue to intervene.  This Bill does, however, give married people back their consciences and I should have thought that in the light of what Deputy Lynch said that we would have a right to his help in changing the law in that direction.</P>
      <P>Deputies opposite have attacked me for not being prepared to say that I was working for unity in present circumstances. Those who reproached me for that are now themselves actively working against unity, if they bring about the defeat of this Bill.</P>

      <P>Perhaps the Deputy would have the courtesy to listen to my argument in support of that statement.  This is my argument: by doing so they will, among other things, be treating with contempt the pleas for freedom of conscience from the Protestant denominations, thus offering a deliberate and calculated affront to those without whose free consent the unity of the people of this island will never be attainable. If Deputy Moore thinks that is rubbish, I would ask him to show that by reasoned argument in his contribution in this debate instead of answering it by interruption.</P>

      <P>I know at least that nothing I have said has been of a nature to damage relations between Irish people of different persuasions in this island.  I would even claim that the things I have said have had a small but not quite insignificant effect in improving those relations.  Whether that is so or not, that is certainly what I have been working for and what I regard as of the greatest importance at the present time and what I have been prepared to run some political risks for over the years.  Consider what the effect of a defeat of this Bill would be on those relations between Catholics and Protestants, and on any prospects of achieving that unity which we are all agreed&mdash;whether we may think it near or remote&mdash;can only be attained by the consent of those who now strongly reject it, and who would see in the defeat of this Bill the plainest and most obvious justification of that rejection.  If there is an answer to that argument I would like to hear it in the course of this debate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It may be true that if this Bill is passed that event will be little noted in Northern Ireland and have little impact on the situation there.  I am not quite sure even about that, that it should have little impact.  The subject is a highly emotionally charged one, with very important social and demographic connotations and it <Col N="917" /> bulks large among the motives given in the North for aversion from the Republic.  The fact that we shall have proved, after all, to be able to legislate this matter and to legalise contraception, even in the rather restricted manner which this Bill proposes, would tend, in a significant degree, to have a benign effect on the psychological climate of the North. Even for those who may regard the idea of such a benign effect with scepticism, surely the malign effects of a defeat of the Bill must be absolutely clear to all who have seriously thought about this matter at all.  If this Bill is defeated I fear the repercussions in the North will be serious.</P>

      <P>I think that is so.  It will be claimed that the Catholic Hierarchy, guided by a Papal encyclical&mdash;I am now referring to a claim that will be made&mdash;instructed the Dáil to pass no such legislation and that the Dáil carried out this instruction, ignoring and over-riding the claims for freedom of conscience in this area made on behalf of all the Protestant Churches in the Republic and also ignoring and over-riding the ascertained wishes of the majority of the citizens.  That is how it will be interpreted there.  They will not say: &ldquo;Oh, the Opposition thought it was unworkable and that health clinics were better than chemists and that is why they voted against the Second Reading and did not give themselves the opportunity to amend the Bill in the sense they said they wanted to.&rdquo; There must be many people on the opposite benches who in their hearts do not want such a message as that to go out or even appear to go out from this Dáil.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would appeal to those who feel like that&mdash;I do not know if any of them are listening to me now&mdash; to support the Second Reading of this Bill or, at the very least, not to oppose it by their votes.  If the real objection of Deputies opposite to this Bill is that parts of it are impractical they have their remedy for that, as I have said, <Col N="918" /> on Committee Stage.  If they prevent it reaching Committee Stage&mdash;and I hope they will not&mdash;it will then be terribly clear that the real objection is something other than what they declare it to be.</P>

      <P>When I was elected to this House in 1948 I did not think I would ever see the day when the House would discuss a contraception Bill.  The last speaker spoke about the quality of life.  I abhor this Bill because in my opinion it would ruin the quality of life in this country.</P>

      <P>I have one supporter over there, thanks be to God.  I never thought I would see the day when such legislation would be brought into the House.  This National Coalition have no mandate.  They put up 14 points.  They came together.  We had two scourges of Coalition before but we have a right curse of one now. The last two got in without any mandate.  They came together after the election.  This time they came <Col N="919" /> together before the election and produced 14 points.  We thought they would stick to those 14 points.  This is only a red herring brought in now to cloud the issue because they know the farmers are suffering, that the people in the towns are suffering. If the Government took off their coats and pulled up their socks and stuck to their 14 points there would be some respect for them.  Here they are bringing in a contraception Bill that will ruin the quality of life to which the Irish people were used throughout the centuries and for which generations fought and died and there was no talk of contraception.</P>
      <P>I voted for the new Constitution in 1937.  There were two issues before the people on the same day.  There was a general election and there was a referendum on the new Constitution. In the controversy that went on before that Constitution was introduced there was no talk about contraception being introduced.</P>
      <P>Even the learned Supreme Court judges were not unanimous.  There were five different opinions.  If there were five more to decide the issue tomorrow there could be another five different opinions.</P>
      <P>If anybody is to change the law on contraception it should be the people who brought in the new Constitution. Why are the Government afraid of a referendum on this subject?  I am not afraid of one because I know the answer the people will give.  That is why the Government are afraid to go back to the people and put the question before them.  If the people agree to do what this Bill is trying to do, namely, change the quality of life and introduce a change from the old, traditional way of life, I will agree with that decision but not until I see it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I know perfectly well in my conscience that this is morally wrong. We all know that murder is morally wrong.  How can you make that legally right?  If you bring in a Bill to make murder legal you will not get Deputy Kitt to vote for it.  You will get no vote on any side of the <Col N="920" /> House.  If you bring in another Bill to make a thing that is morally wrong legally right I do not see how anybody on either side of the House could pass it.</P>
    <P>Then we have the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs who, if we want to have our language or our culture, calls us bogmen, or whatever he called us down in Waterford; the Minister for Education who wants us to forget Irish history was ever written and the Minister for Justice bringing in his contraception Bill. This is an attempt to drag a red herring across the trail.  For the previous speaker to say that it is going to ruin the unity of Ireland if we do not give contraceptives is only the thin end of the wedge.  We had a Minister saying on the last day this Bill was discussed that not alone would he like to provide these for married people but he would like to provide them for everybody.  As soon as we have contraception in there will be abortion, divorce, euthanasia, all the other evils of venereal disease and everything that will follow when this legislation is passed.</P>

      <P>It is most regrettable that a very important and serious Bill of this kind should be treated with interruptions from one side or the other.  It is equally important and regrettable that there is clear and ample evidence that there are Deputies in this House who are not taking their responsibilities seriously. I do not know whether they are being carried away by the political waverings of their own party affiliations but this is a most serious piece of legislation.  Yesterday I remarked that I am one of the longest serving Members in this House having served for 32 years.  In those 32 years I read, studied and contributed to most of the Bills presented by various Governments.  In that period I have not had the experience of reading or studying a Bill with such serious consequences for the present generation and for generations to come.</P>
      <P>It is true to say that we are living in very strange times, times which are rapidly changing.  People throughout the world are becoming more materialistic and are being wound up in materialism but many seem to forget the real purpose of life.  In this country there was never more need for a sound public opinion, one based on Christian conscience, one based on truth.  In recent years the climate of change has been advocated by journalists and people on television and radio.  We seldom see the headlines advocating any good news but if the journalistic world can rake up any piece of filth or dirt that will disturb the true sincere Christian conscience they seem to flourish on it.  If an attack can be made with inch-and-a half headlines in black type against the teaching of truth and justice it will be done.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Whether we like it or not we are now living in a society in which there seems to be a growing anti-church climate.  There are established pressure groups, sponsored by the journalists of a miscellaneous type, whose educational qualifications are <Col N="923" /> questionable and whose backgrounds are likewise questionable.  These people have set themselves up as the champions of small pressure groups established for the purpose of infiltrating the moral standards of decent people in this country.  The pressure groups which are backed up by very substantial sums of money from abroad get little support or sympathy except from those who do not understand. There is little of it coming from the sincerity which prevails today and always prevailed in rural Ireland.  However, the pressure groups, backed by radio, television and Press, are anxious to attack everything for which the Church stands, are anxious to remove, if possible, the name and the expression of the Almighty Creator and to have it blacked and blotted out from everything which past generations of the Irish people have cherished.</P>
    <P>All this is being sponsored by intellectuals, intellectuals who find themselves in high places unexpectedly and who feel that they can push over their false, unchristian, anti-Godly and disastrous self-made theology.  I have often thought, and I have often heard old country people say, that there is nothing more dangerous than a little education and those self-syled theologians, who profess to know all about all things and who then find themselves steeped in their own ignorance, very often can lead a community unconsciously to disaster.</P>
    <P>I have heard the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs speak on this.  I appreciate his views.  I have little doubt that he is speaking what he firmly believes. It is most regrettable that a man of his talents did not secure a sound Christian education because if he had I believe he would have a lot to contribute in this country.  I listened to the speech of the Minister for Industry and Commerce last week.  He is a man of exceptionally high qualities, extraordinary talents, outstanding personality, friendly, charitable, understanding and let no man say that he is not extremely well educated but he seemed to display an unforgiveable ignorance of the real essentials of life.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="924" /> We have intellectuals who have qualified in various fields of technology and science, who can plan for the future, for a generation or two to come.  What a terrible misplacement of the talents and the gifts that God gave them and blessed them with.  The first education that is necessary and essential is the purpose of life and the purpose for which God created us and the main essential is to understand that we are in this world for a very short time and that we have a duty to contribute, with the best of our talents, bearing in mind that we are created not to end in the grave but for eternity.  How many men in public life, with their responsibilities, close their eyes to the fact that one day they will not be Members of this House?  I have seen men come and go here.  I have had the experience of seeing the intellectuals of the forties and fifties, those who were going to transform Irish society, None of them is here today.  And so it is with those who, by this Bill, are now sowing the seeds of poison for the real Christian way of life.  How regrettable it is, whether it is a part of God's plan or not&mdash;we accept that it is&mdash;that those brillant people could not apply their talents to the application of true Christian principles of life.</P>
    <P>We in this country have not escaped the changes that have taken place throughout the world.  Whether we like it or not we must admit, no matter which side of the House we are on, that today, no matter who has been responsible or who has not been responsible, we live in a very sick Irish society.  When we know we are living in a sick Irish society the responsibility is greater on us as legislators than it is on the citizen outside this House because the citizen outside has not been entrusted with the responsibility that we as legislators have been entrusted with.  Therefore, our measure of responsibility is far greater.  We are expected to be leaders of the community. We are expected to preach truth.  We are expected to safeguard the moral standards of society.  We are expected to give a lead.  We can lead forward or lead backward but the worst of all would be to do nothing. <Col N="925" /> We must bear in mind that the sickness of our Irish society has been brought upon us by the failure of people in high places, both in Church and State, to speak up and act.  The pressure groups have been sponsored by materialistic and atheistic modern journalism, which has given importance and prominence to those small evilly-disposed pressure groups.  Because of this we find Irish society in the deplorable position in which it is today.</P>
    <P>We have one of the highest records for admissions to mental hospitals in the whole world in relation to our population.  Is that something of which Irish society can be proud?  Is it not extraordinary that in comparison with every country in the world we in the Republic have the highest record of admissions to mental hospitals? We have an all-time record of alcoholics&mdash;nothing to be proud of but plenty to be ashamed of.  We have an increasing drug problem on a par with the United States in comparison with our population.  Very few people speak of legislation to outlaw drugs and provide suitable premises to save our young people, our students, our teenagers from the horrid social cancer which many in this State are closing their eyes to, deliberately or otherwise, I am sorry to say both in the Church and otherwise. The serious drug problem, coupled with a record number of alcoholics and the world's greatest number of admissions to mental hospitals is menacing the main arteries of our society.</P>
    <P>We have an increasing number of deserted wives and deserted husbands, broken up families and the consequent heartbreak of the little children God blessed them with.  Nobody realised until the deserted wives' allowance was given that there were so many broken up homes in Ireland. Did anybody realise that every Deputy in this House has a constant flow of correspondence relating to broken up homes, broken up families, deserted wives and deserted husbands?  Is that a credit to Irish society?  Is it a credit to Irish society that permissiveness <Col N="926" /> has grown to such an extent that in every part of Ireland there is the growing practice of wife swopping? It is not the very poor who participate. Is this something to be proud of?  Should we be proud of seeing so many of our little children finding themselves in the appalling position of being neglected by their parents because of the growing permissiveness in our society?</P>
    <P>Is it not true to say that in addition to all this we have lost respect for human life in this country and by acts of revenge, jealousy, greed and power human life is thought very little of? That is a very sad commentary on the society in which we live but it is very true.  Coupled with all this is the fact that our jails are full to the very doors and there is hardly a vacant cell in any of them.  All these evils bring serious consequences which must fall back on families.</P>
    <P>The family as a unit has never been in greater danger of being demolished completely to its very foundations because in any society the family is the central unit on which society is built.  If the family is attacked, if there is disunity, disrespect and breaking-up of family life that is the end of society. Society is only as good as the family life and the home permit. Many people scoff at the family as a unit but we hear people from the intelligentsia who speak of the community without finding out where the community commences.  It springs from the marriage, from the home and from the children who bless that marriage. That is the family as a unit which is the principal hub on which community and society are built.</P>
    <P>This Bill is an attack on the family. It is an attack on society.  It means to smash the family to its very foundation. It is an evilly-disposed Bill.  It is a Bill in my opinion that no matter how politically motivated people can be they really cannot speak of conscience in relation to it.  We hear talk about freedom of conscience.  It is now becoming a common expression but how free can our conscience be?  Is it not true to say, as has been laid down in Vatican II, that the <Col N="927" /> conscience must be a well-informed one and that we must seek the truth. If we do not, we are blinding ourselves and deceiving ourselves and we are not using our conscience.  We cannot have freedom of conscience unless we seek the truth.</P>
    <P>It is the same as a computer.  If the computer is not fed with true facts it cannot reveal truth at the end.  So it is with all those people who speak of freedom of conscience.  In order to satisfy their conscience they say what readily comes into their mouths and try to convince themselves that what they are saying is true.  There are many Deputies who will be voting for this Bill, who know, as sure as I do, that it is wrong.  Pride will make them walk into the division lobbies.  Pride gave the responsibility to Michael to drive Satan from his high place.  Pride and power and greed will drive many Deputies into supporting what they know is morally wrong in relation to this Bill.  What about their conscience?</P>
    <P>Have they sought the truth?  Is it not true to say that contraception is unnatural?  It is wrong morally.  It is contrary to God's law and yet many men in public life under the guise of freedom of conscience will deliberately walk into the division lobbies.  They may be in this House for five, ten or 20 years more but, believe me, it is only on the approach of the midnight of life that one realises how one has abused one's responsibilities.  As sure as every one of us is elected to this House, our responsibility is greater than the responsibility of those outside it.  We cannot abuse it in the face of God.  We will answer to Him because He is just in His judgments. We will answer for our deeds and our actions as Members of Parliament as surely as we have taken our seats here.</P>
    <P>I have referred to the family as a unit.  The family is in grave danger. This Bill is an attack on the family under the guise of rights of citizens, civil rights, constitutional requirements. It is an attack on the family which will reflect seriously on the future of our Irish society.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="928" /> Having dealt with the society in which we live, there is something else which we must face.  We must bear in mind that, if this Bill is passed, there will be an addition to those evils.  We have more teenage drinking than is good for our society.  With teenage drinking and contraceptives available the situation will get worse.  The Minister for Industry and Commerce said that, if he had his way, contraceptives would be available for all single people.  How sad to hear an expression of that nature from a man God blessed with such great talents.</P>

      <P>I was referring to the fact that, coupled with the chaotic teenage drinking in the singing bars, the lounge bars, and side shows and the all night shows, the availability of contraceptives will have serious consequences.  You do not quench a fire by sprinkling it with petrol, and that is what this Bill is doing.  The teenage drinking and the all-night carousing we have in every part of Ireland today will have serious repercussions on the homes of Ireland in the future on which the families must be established and built. If the Irish families are to be built on the foundation of the teenage drinking we have in Ireland today, God help the establishment of the homes for which they will be responsible.</P>
      <P>Added to that in our Irish society is the extraordinary evil of the alarming increase in the incidence of VD. We cannot close our eyes to the fact that, no matter what reports are published, there is a steady increase in the incidence of that disease.  Will the making available of contraceptives improve that position or will it bring it to the stage it has reached in European countries where there are statistics to prove what the situation is? Those are not records of which we can boast but we cannot close our eyes to them.  They are here in our midst and they have resulted in a grave lack of respect for authority whether it be State, parental or church.  Authority is being challenged from every quarter.  Respect for authority is gone whether it is the State, the Parliament, the Church, the teacher, the guardian or the parent.  Something must be wrong because there is this inclination to rebel against authority.  Such a record is not a sign of a good, healthy Irish society.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Despite all that, we have in our midst some very excellent young people on whom the future of this country depends.  They are standing up well to everything which surrounds <Col N="930" /> them in Irish society.  They are standing up well to the Godless and false propaganda.  They are standing up well to the example of their parents and those who went before them. These are young people who in many parts of Ireland have banded themselves together to help others in the community and who have endeavoured to influence their colleagues by their example.  Many excellent young people are finding it extremely difficult to be good in the surroundings I have outlined and with temptation as never before falling in on them from four corners.  Will this Bill help to reinforce them or will it help to undermine them?  This legislation is an intrusion on their goodness and their modesty.  It is a temptation which will be very difficult for them to resist.  It is unwanted and disastrous. Further and greater temptations will not influence these people in the right direction.</P>
    <P>This Bill will provide contraceptive devices for all married couples whether they want them or not.  What justification is there for that?  It will not improve the quality of life in this country.  This will lead to abuses.  It is unworkable.  This Bill has lost the race before it starts to implement the intention of the Minister.  The serious part of this Bill is that the people need not prove that they are married. I want to salute the integrity and the foresight of the medical profession and the chemists in Ireland who have blankly refused to work this Bill.  I have received letters from doctors and chemists from all over Ireland, every one of them in the same strain, deploring legislation of this kind.  From their medical experience they have outlined the serious consequences.  Thank God that the majority of our chemists have pledged themselves to refuse to handle or to sell these devices.  The vast majority of the conscientious medical men in Ireland today have also refused to co-operate with the Minister for Justice or any other Minister in this matter.  They have pointed out the growing incidence of VD and all the other serious consequences that will flow from what will be the free availability <Col N="931" /> of contraceptives to all, we may say, because the married people who are seeking them are under no obligation to prove they are married.</P>
    <P>I cannot understand the mentality of the Government who bring in a Bill of this kind.  I do not know what kind of conscience there is within that Government.  Maybe my conscience has not been informed to the same degree as theirs, but knowing the temptations of the society in which we live and the responsibility we all have to protect moral standards, I am bewildered at the Government introducing this legislation.  Perhaps I am old fashioned but, having regard to the record in Italy, France and Britain which is there for us to read and study, I cannot understand the conscience of the Government who impose such a Bill on the people.  I know most of these men&mdash;not all of them&mdash;intimately for many long years and I am still bewildered at their action.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Justice goes on to tell the House that the Government believe there is a great flow of contraceptives into this country at present. Is it not true to say that that was always the case?  We always had the smuggler and he will be everywhere to the end of time.  But this is to legalise the smuggler.  I do not believe for one minute that the Minister for Justice can produce evidence here to convince the House that there is wholesale blackmarketing going on with regard to contraceptives.  That is being used as a sop to try to salve the consciences of those who have doubts about this Bill but I, for one, do not accept it.  No evidence has been produced that there is this wholesale blackmarket.</P>
    <P>There is something very wrong in a Bill designed to permit the use of contraceptives by married women without regard to some kind of medical evidence or some form of medical certificate.  Because a certain decision was given, based on medical evidence, in Mrs. McGee's case every other married woman is to have made readily available to her contraceptive devices without any medical evidence at all, such as had to be presented in order to get a decision for Mrs. McGee. <Col N="932" /> Does any Deputy think that is either right or fair?  If there were special circumstances and a special case to be made in regard to the health of the person who brought the action and there was medical evidence to support that case, evidence which convinced a majority of laymen with no medical qualifications or medical experience of any kind, does that justify our bringing in legislation here to make contraceptives available to every married woman in the country, and single women, should they so wish, without any stipulation in regard to a medical prescription?</P>
    <P>I deplore this Bill.  It is morally wrong.  As I said, the cure will be worse than the disease.  If contraceptives are made readily available, people who would never have thought of using them may be tempted into doing so.  This Bill is a violation of the laws of God and His Church.  That may cause some to be amused, but there are still some of us who retain some kind of conscience and there are many of us who still believe that that which was taught 2,000 years ago is still right.  An evil tree cannot bring forth good fruit.  That is as true to-day as it was when it was first spoken 2,000 years ago.</P>
    <P>This is an evil Bill and it cannot bring forth good results.  I believe it will be unworkable.  The power given to the Minister for Justice under the Bill is unreal because he will have power to grant licences for the sale of contraceptives and that is a dangerous power to vest in any Minister for Justice.  The present Minister is a young man with a very high standard of integrity.  But a future Minister for Justice could be someone like Deputy Keating, the Minister for Industry and Commerce, who wants contraceptives made available for single people. Is that the kind of man we want in charge of Justice?  Is it to that kind of man those of you who are parents with teenage children want to give this power?  We have no guarantee that the next Minister for Justice will have the same high standards of integrity as the present Minister has, with due regard for the public and common good.  That is why <Col N="933" /> I say I fear the provisions in this Bill because giving a Minister for Justice the right, the power and the authority to give a licence to someone to deal in or manufacture contraceptives is the most dangerous responsibility that could be vested in any Minister of State.  If this should be abused and, having heard the speeches already made we have no guarantee that it will not be abused, our whole social fabric could collapse around us like a pack of cards.  This is a dangerous power to give to any Minister.</P>
    <P>I am bewildered and I am puzzled as to why the Government should bring in a Bill to give such authority to any Minister for Justice.  Even more serious still, if chemists decline to handle contraceptives the Minister will have power to nominate anyone he likes to sell contraceptives.  I will not degrade country shopkeepers in the same way as they were degraded by an earlier speaker.  Country shopkeepers do the best they can to make a living in difficult and competitive times.  What better way could they have of improving their incomes than to solicit the support of Deputies in order to obtain from the Minister for Justice, whoever he may be, a licence to sell contraceptives?  Remember, the law will not compel such a person to sell these to married people only.  He must supply them on request.  There is no need for a certificate or a prescription.  The dealer who gets a licence must sell contraceptives.  What will happen in the case of a dealer who becomes a sex speculator as a result of this section of the Bill?  We have already heard of the amount of money coming here to keep sex propaganda alive and before the public mind.</P>
    <P>The dealer who gets his licence to deal in contraceptives must, and will, be politically inspired.  The granting of a licence to a dealer will provide an added income to the successful applicant, irrespective of the type of small country business he runs.  There is nothing in the Bill to say who must get a licence, a retail grocer, a supermarket or a hardware merchant.  As a matter of fact, he need not be in any kind of trade.  A private citizen can be licensed under this Bill to sell <Col N="934" /> contraceptives.  Whoever thought that out, whether it was the legal experts who recommended this section to the Minister, should have their credentials examined.  To me, a layman with extremely limited intelligence and no legal training, that is daft.</P>
    <P>The addition of this trade to a man's business will yield a very fruitful income.  As I said this Bill will add to the number of sex speculators here. Vast sums of money come from abroad to keep this business going. Let us look at the Fertility Guidance Company.  I am sure every Deputy has heard of that firm because I know that no Deputy will vote for this Bill without first having all his facts.  This company in the year 1970 received £2,000 and in 1971 £3,000 from International Planned Parenthood.  In both years the auditors, Craig, Gardner &amp; Company, the most reputable company in Ireland today, were unable to guarantee the income of the company as correct due to internal control over income received.  This is a most serious situation.  Vast sums of money from abroad are keeping this company going.  In addition, the company applied for non-payment of tax to the Revenue Commissioners.  Up to the end of 1971 not one penny was paid in tax.  This is just one group of sex speculators of which we know.</P>
    <P>I understood the Minister for Industry and Commerce to say that he would be most flaithiúlach in issuing these licences if he were Minister for Justice.  That is a dangerous power to invest in any Minister.  It is a power which this House should be slow to give, that is, if we have sufficient Deputies left to value moral standards.  That authority is bad, it is evil and it is wrong.  This Bill is the result of a decision of the Supreme Court.  That decision was prompted by an action taken by a pressure group.  This Bill is a yielding to a pressure group and a sacrifice of everything decent, right, proper and natural.</P>

      <P>This was a pressure group who wanted free availability of contraceptives and, as a result of their pressure they have got to the top.  Some legislators are yielding to the pressure groups but not all.  I put it to the Chair that if the new entrant into Irish society, the streaker, decides he has a constitutional right to appear <Col N="936" /> naked in public, if he brings his case before the Supreme Court and if he points out that in Africa and in many uncivilised countries it is right and proper to appear naked&mdash;&mdash;</P>

For example, there are those who want to legalise brothels in this country and they may consider they have a constitutional right to do this. Will this House pass a Bill to legalise the activity carried out by the person the Chair does not want mentioned, or to legalise any other aim of a pressure group&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O.J. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think I have departed very much from the Bill.  However, I shall return to it, distasteful though it may be.  The Chair knows from his contacts in his own constituency that this is a Bill that stinks in the nostrils of every decent person in the country.  The free availability of contraceptives will be <Col N="937" /> detrimental to the common good.  It will play a major part in destroying our sense of Christian values.  In making reference to our Christian values, I do so as a Catholic.  The Catholic faith commands the obedience of the vast majority of the people of Ireland.  The Catholic Church has clearly spoken on the evil character of contraception.  One of the main reasons the Church in this country has done so is that Ireland is still one of the most underpopulated countries in Europe.</P>
      <P>We know that where the course of nature is interfered with there will be a reaction that will cause considerable damage to life.  The whole balance of nature will be completely upset.  The Minister for Justice does not have evidence in regard to the side effects of the use of contraceptives both from the physical and mental point of view. This has been referred to in very clear terms by the Church to which the vast majority of the people have obedience.</P>
      <P>Anything that is unnatural damages our society.  The Church has the wisdom of ages as well as the authority of God behind all its teachings but what have the other side to show?  They have nothing to show only the evil and disastrous consequences that follow from the wrecking of family life and the complete disorganisation of the family as a unit. Any law that threatens family life&mdash; it is already under tremendous pressures from many sides&mdash;is a betrayal of the trust the people have reposed in the Government.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One of the arguments made in favour of the availability of contraceptives is that they are available in all the European countries.  Would we not be described as good Europeans if contraceptives were not freely available here?  Are we to change our Christian way of life, our confidence, belief, trust and faith in the family as a unit, simply because a few crackpots want us to get the title of good Europeans?  Why should we have to change our laws, to adopt laws that have proved disastrous in other countries in regard to this matter?  This is a question of public morality and, because it is a question of public <Col N="938" /> morality, not private morality, many people in this House have strong religious convictions about it.</P>
    <P>I want to express my appreciation of the Fine Gael Party for their wisdom in having a free vote on this issue.  It enables us freely to speak and vote on the Bill in accordance with our religious beliefs and our Christian teaching.  It would be quite wrong to whip Deputies into a division lobby against their religious beliefs.  For that reason, I think the party have adopted the proper procedure because our consciences must be our guide.  For that reason also legislators have a very grave responsibility.</P>
    <P>Reference was made here this morning to the Bill in relation to the unity of Ireland.  Does anybody mean to tell me for one moment that the making available of contraceptive devices in the Republic is going to have the slightest bearing on whether or not the Loyalists of the North want to consider seriously the question of a united Ireland?  I speak from my own experience: there are fine Protestant and Catholic people in Northern Ireland who resent being linked with the question of contraception in the South.  In my opinion it is an insult to the Protestant people in the North of Ireland to link them, as a part of barter for a united Ireland, with the making available of contraceptives in the Republic.  I never read that Doctor Paisley ever advocated that.  I never read that William Craig ever wanted it.  I never read that Mr. Faulkner ever sought it.  This is a concoction by the intellectual politicians of the South to try to hoodwink certain people&mdash; that all the Protestants in the North of Ireland wanted us to be buying and selling contraceptives and, when we would do that, they would say we were great people and that they wanted a united Ireland.  There may be people in this House who would fall for that kind of claptrap but there are very few intelligent people in the country who would fall for it because all of us know that what these intellectual politicians mean is a gesture to the North, that we should all be using contraceptives because they can use them, that we should all be buying <Col N="939" /> and selling contraceptives because they are on the market in the North of Ireland.</P>
    <P>The removal of Article 44 of the Constitution was a gesture and did not improve the situation very much so far as North-South relations were concerned. There have been numerous other gestures.  What I cannot understand is the intelligent politician, interested in Irish unity, who uses the stupid argument that changing our laws on contraception is going to change the opinion, or help to change the opinion, of the vast majority of our countrymen in the North into saying: &ldquo;That is exactly what we wanted, now we are with you one hundred per cent&rdquo;.  I feel this is an insult to the many thousand good Catholic and Protestant people of Northern Ireland. In my opinion, it is offensive and the less it is repeated the better because I give the Northern Protestant and Catholic people credit for more common sense and intelligence than that they would be swayed by the availability of contraceptives in the South as a step towards a united Ireland.</P>
    <P>Perhaps the Minister for Justice could explain to us, in his reply, why there was not an explanatory memorandum issued with this Bill.  This is one of the first Bills I have noticed with which there was not issued some form of explanatory memorandum.  The position is probably that there was no explanation to give and that the terms of the Bill were so unworkable they could not be explained.  There may have been many good reasons for not wishing to spell out clearly to people the full provisions of the Bill.  We have no guarantee that if this Bill is passed there will not be widespread and reckless abuse of its provisions.  This is an occasion on which many of us because of our religious convictions&mdash;however distasteful it may be&mdash;must stand up and be counted.  I remember having to make a big decision in this House in 1944 on the Transport Bill&mdash;I was an Independent at the time&mdash;as to whether or not I would vote for the Bill.  I voted against it in the knowledge that I was doing what was correct despite the fact that the vote I cast on that occasion was the means of defeating <Col N="940" /> the Government.  I always believed in doing what I felt was right.  For that reason, I would be prepared to sacrifice my entire political life in an effort to beat this Bill.  The argument cannot be used that I am voting with Fianna Fáil.  I am voting against the Bill.  It is bad, wrong and dangerous.  There may be a number of Deputies here who may yet today have the courage to stand up and be counted because this is a Bill which must strike at their consciences. It is going through this House in the disguise of civil rights.</P>
    <P>If there is to be a referendum on this issue, I have little doubt that the people will give a loud and clear rejection of its provisions.  Every legislator who values the true Christian way of life has a major part to play here and because of our Irish heritage must make an effort to put this Bill where it deserves to be, on the shelves in the lumber rooms of history.  I can see no reason whatever to justify this. The Minister for Justice may argue in regard to the Constitution.  This is being freely done throughout the country.  It is said action must be taken because of the Supreme Court decision.  I have pointed out that the Constitution does not in any way mention contraceptives.  Therefore, how does one interpret the Constitution as saying that a certain law violates a citizen's constitutional rights?  Article 40 states:</P>
    <P>The State guarantees in its laws to respect, and, as far as practicable, by its laws to defend and vindicate the personal rights of the citizen.</P>
    <P>The Supreme Court accepted that the rights claimed by Mrs. McGee would fall under Article 41, the article in regard to family rights.  These points were accepted by the judges in the majority as the basis for their decision.</P>
    <P>There is a point I want to raise particularly in this regard because if the Supreme Court is to rule on personal rights in so far as the Constitution is concerned, we as legislators for the common good of the majority of our citizens must remember that the Constitution has not listed personal rights beyond, in Article 40, the rights <Col N="941" /> to life, personal good name and property rights.  There was the 1965 case on fluoridation when the court held that the guaranteed personal rights extended beyond those mentioned in Article 40 and that it is for the courts to discover and to determine what these rights are in any case.</P>
    <P>Now, I want to ask if the Minister for Justice has in relation to this Bill examined the rights conferred by Article 40&mdash;life, good name and the rights to property&mdash;and whether he has decided if this Bill will deprive the right to life.  There is ample evidence that the majority of contraceptive devices, not all of them, are also abortion&mdash;they are responsible for abortion&mdash;and Deputies who try to divorce abortion from contraception cannot do so because it is backed up by the best medical opinion that certain contraceptive devices are and have been responsible for the taking as well as the prevention of human life.</P>
    <P>If we are to enact legislation which will deprive life, a guaranteed right under article 20 of the Constitution, where do we stand?  The purpose of contraception is to deny life, to deprive life, to take life.  Where is our guaranteed right to life?  To me it does not make sense but, perhaps, I am not reading the Constitution as a person would having a legally trained mind.</P>
    <P>As I pointed out, if this Bill is passed it will deny life which is guaranteed under the Constitution.  Is there, therefore, not a conflict?  The Minister for Justice pointed out that he had to bring in some form of legislation because of the Supreme Court ruling and in this respect I want to direct attention to and to place on record the views of Mr. John M. Kelly in his document <i>Fundamental Rights in the Irish Law and the Constitution,</i> second edition.  He referred to documents examined by him and stated that in 1937 Mr. de Valera, then Taoiseach, had misgivings about entrusting the task of constitutional interpretation to the courts but that he had to confess he could find no better medium than the Supreme <Col N="942" /> Court.  It was the Legislature that Mr. de Valera saw as the judge of the common good&mdash;this House.  I agree that it is this House which should be the judge of the common good.  Interpretation of the law is the duty of the Supreme Court.  It was believed and intended that the Legislature should be able by its own judgment to decide &mdash;not the courts.  The courts are there to interpret the laws but have not the responsibility this House carries.  The Legislature have the responsibility of working in the public interest and of seeing in the fashioning of laws that the rights of the individual, as an individual, and the rights of the community do not conflict and are properly co-ordinated.  That is the legal position.</P>
    <P>At no time did this House ever hand over to the Supreme Court the right to legislate.  It was clearly the intention of the then Taoiseach in 1937 that such power and authority could never and would never be vested in the Supreme Court.  It is, therefore, the duty of the Legislature to legislate.  We do not want to see the Legislature so restricted that it will be unable to function properly. That is exactly the position.  We cannot function properly as a Parliament because there is a conflict seemingly on this issue of the common good and the individual's rights.  We legislate for the common good and that is our duty and we do not want to see the Legislature in any way restricted in that regard.</P>
    <P>I cherish the right of Parliament to rule but I deplore a gun being put to my head by anybody from outside as to the type of laws that should be passed in this Parliament.  That is what is happening here.  To interpret the law is one thing but to tell us what to do is another.  That is exactly what Mr. de Valera had misgivings about in 1937.  It was never intended and is not now intended, and it never happened in the years since then, that the rights of Parliament were in any way challenged in regard to legislation.</P>
    <P>As regards the Supreme Court, it could be that the honourable men who sat on the bench might not, under other <Col N="943" /> circumstances, have given the same decision.  It is no harm to mention that the American Supreme Court have also unwrapped the box of privacy in regard to the rights of citizens.  This has not come overnight.  They found that within it was the right of contraception for the unmarried, the right of pornography and also the right of abortion.  These were all approved by the US Supreme Court.  If the right of abortion and pornography is given by any three or four men by means of interpreting the law, does it mean that in 12 months' time we come here again and legalise pornography and abortion as we are being driven to do in the case of contraception?  We have yet to find out what the Supreme Court may rule in regard to abortion, pornography and other features objectionable to the common good of the majority of our people.</P>
    <P>I put it to the Minister that if a case comes to the Supreme Court that a citizen has the right to have an abortion as a private right, does this mean the Minister will come here and legalise abortion?  That is what he is doing as a result of the opinion of men outside this House on the interpretation of the law, contrary to what was intended in 1937.  The same applies to numerous other rights to which citizens may think themselves entitled.  It is farcical; if this procedure is to be adopted we may well have a position here where the citizen may feel that as in Britain, the North and elsewhere he is entitled to have all the legal requirements tied up so that he may be free to have abortion.  If the Supreme Court so rules must this House act, knowing that it is contrary to God's law, contrary to the Catholic faith professed by the majority of citizens and contrary to the natural law?  Assuming a citizen claims the right to set up a brothel and have it legalised and if the Supreme Court rules that that is a right to which the citizen is entitled, do we come in with a Bill to legalise brothels?  This, in my opinion, is the principle that is at stake at present in regard to the issue being debated here.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Humanae Vitae</i> is a document that is more spoken of than read and it is <Col N="944" /> amazing to note the number of Deputies in this House who, without ever having read that encyclical, make scant reference to it.  Therefore, I consider it incumbent on me to place on record some excerpts from <i>Humanae Vitae</i>.  For example, it contains a passage that is directed to rulers of nations and in which they are told that to them is committed the responsibility of safeguarding the common good.  The Holy Father reminds them that they can contribute much to the preservation of morals and he begs them never to allow the morals of young people to be undermined.  He reminds them, too, that the family is the primary unit in the State and that they should not tolerate any legislation which would introduce into the family those practices which are opposed to the law of God because, as the Holy Father says, there are other ways by which a Government can and should solve the population problem and he tells them they can do this by enacting laws which will assist families and by educating people wisely so that the moral law and the freedom of citizens are both safeguarded.</P>
    <P>I wonder whether <i>Humanae Vitae</i> was examined by the Government when this Bill was being drafted.  I know that there are some members of the Government who would be only too eager to examine the encyclical carefully but that there are other members who would merely throw it out the window and describe it as tommy-rot and nonsense.  This encyclical was issued by the Holy Father as the Supreme Head of the Catholic Church, that Church in which the majority of our people profess to believe. The Holy Father goes on to refer to the grave responsibility of the Legislature.  Are we standing by that responsibility?  Are we not reneging on it and running away from it?</P>
    <P>Will this Bill not be the means of withdrawing forever any contribution we might make to the preservation of morals in our society?  The majority of our young people are doing their best in so far as moral standards are concerned but there are great temptations <Col N="945" /> in their paths.  By this Bill we are allowing the moral standards of our people to be undermined.  Does this outstanding, intellectual and common sense pronouncement by the Head of the Catholic Church mean anything to Catholic legislators in Ireland today?  Is the Holy Father's encyclical to be ignored as if he had not been addressing the rulers of the world which, of course, included the rulers of this country?  This Bill is an attack on the family as a unit.  It is evil in its conception and design and is an attempt to wreck the family at its foundations.</P>
    <P>In that part of the encyclical addressed to rulers of nations the Holy Father advised them not to tolerate any legislation which would introduce into the family these practices which are opposed to the law of God.  Are we not doing that?  Are we not ignoring the advice of the Head of that Church to which belong the vast majority of the people of the Republic?</P>
    <P>It is well for our Catholic legislators to realise that they are kicking in the teeth the teaching of their own Church.  It has been stated that the citizen has a right to control his family or to have no family if he so wishes and in this context we hear much of bad housing conditions but the Holy Father has reminded Governments that there are other means of dealing with the population problem. We all know that there are families living in accommodation that is not adequate for their needs but we must help to house these people in suitable accommodation.  <i>Humanae Vitae</i> does not give us the right to take a short cut to the solution of our population problem by accepting what is unnatural and wrong.</P>
    <P>Should this Bill be passed it will be responsible for undue interference with the natural law and with the high moral standard that should prevail in the interest of the common good.</P>
    <P>There is a vast difference between private and public morality.  This House deals with public morality. Legislators have the responsibility of dealing with the population problem <Col N="946" /> but we have no such problem in this country because ours is one of the most under-populated countries in Europe.  What laws have we passed in accordance with the wishes of the Church with a view to educating the people wisely and to ensure that the freedom of citizens and the moral law are both safeguarded?  We have not done that.  One would imagine that <i>Humanae Vitae</i> would have been the Christian charter which would be a guide to legislators in matters of this kind.</P>
    <P>It is right and proper that the quotation which I have given should be on the record because of its truth, its wisdom and its value to legislators. There are none so blind as those who do not want to see.  I have often wondered why so many references have been made to <i>Humanae Vitae</i>, why it has been spoken of so freely, discussed so much but read and studied so little. This morning the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs made reference to the views and opinions of a variety of Churches which he quoted from in relation to this Bill.  He made very little reference to the statement issued by the Irish Hierarchy last November. Why, I do not know.  We can all use our own judgment as to why that statement did not get as much prominence from the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs as the other documents from which he quoted.</P>
    <P>I want to tell the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs and every other Minister that the Irish Hierarchy are all busy men who do not dabble in politics.  In the numbers of years that I have been a Member of this House I have had no knowledge of the Irish Hierarchy ever telling legislators what should be done or what should not be done.  Occasionally they issue statements as to what the true moral law is in relation to certain aspects of legislation. So it was in November when the statement was issued on behalf of the Irish hierarchy by Dr. McCormack, Bishop of Meath.  I quote from the statement:</P>
    <P>The question at issue is whether artificial contraception is morally right or wrong.  The clear teaching <Col N="947" /> of the Catholic Church is that it is morally wrong.  No change in the State law can make the use of contraceptives morally right since what is wrong in itself remains wrong regardless of what the State law says.</P>
    <P>Could the bishops put the facts any clearer before legislators in this regard?  I quote again from the statement:</P>
    <P>The real question facing the legislators is what effect would the increased availability of contraceptives have on the quality of life in the Republic.</P>
    <P>That is exactly what we are being asked.  Some Deputies say none and they are quite satisfied if their conscience tells them so after full examination of all the facts but in other countries the position has not been satisfactory in so far as public morality is concerned.  What effect would the increased availability of contraceptives have on the quality of life in the Republic of Ireland?  Some say none.  I say disastrous.  That is the question that every Member of this House must ask himself when making up his mind to vote on this Bill.  That is a question of public, not private morality.  What the legislators have to decide is whether a change in the law would on balance do more harm than good by damaging the character of the society for which we are responsible. I readily answer that question by saying that in my opinion this Bill will do far more harm than good and will immensely damage the character of the society for which we are responsible.</P>
    <P>There is one other section of their lordships' statement which is very relevant but which Members of this House may not want to hear.  It is this:</P>
    <P>The link between legislation on contraception and abortion is also significant.  Increasingly abortion is being seen as the ultimate method of birth control.  There seems to be a chain reaction on these matters by which the first piece of legislation tends to set in motion a process of change which no one can control.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="948" /> There is the advice of the Catholic Hierarchy in this country, given freely, independently, as a guide to legislators. I have seen it mocked and scoffed and laughed at by Catholic Members of the Dáil, endeavouring to belittle truth coming from men who are charged with the responsibility before God of speaking the truth by word and expressed opinion.  I want to warn this House finally that if this Bill is passed it is the thin end of the wedge to complete moral disaster in so far as Irish society is concerned. The Irish Hierarchy are quite right because no matter what the Minister for Justice, or any other Minister, may say one cannot divorce contraception from abortion.  The link is there.  Medical science has proven that the link is there.  It is readily and freely admitted that that link exists. There is ample and clear evidence that increasingly abortion is seen as the ultimate method of birth control.</P>
    <P>The bishops are quite correct and any of us who have studied the problem seriously know that that is and has been the position in every country which started off with the free availability of contraceptives. That is the thin end of the wedge and as sure as this Bill becomes law what has been forecast by the Irish bishops will most certainly materialise in the not too distant future.  For example, in Britain they had the contraceptives first, followed by the free availability of contraceptives which was followed by the provision of contraceptives under the health services.  They now have abortion.  The position has become so appalling there that there is a vast lobby in the House of Commons of members of all parties in an effort to change the law in relation to abortion.  This lobby built up after these members saw so many dead bodies of children being dumped out in dustbins on corporation dumps every day of the week.</P>
    <P>Any member of the British House of Commons will clearly explain the reports being made to him.  We have seen photographs and pictures of certain dustbins in Birmingham which contained the tiny bodies of the baby <Col N="949" /> that Almighty God gave life to but which the law of the land took away. These bodies were destined, not for a proper Christian burial, but to take their place with the scrap out of dustbins on the corporation dump.  That is a most terrible and horrifying thought for Christian, not alone Catholic, legislators to be paving the way and planning for in our own country. There is no point in thinking it will not come because five years ago who could see this Bill coming before Parliament.  Three years ago, or even 12 months ago, no one could see such a Bill being presented to this House.</P>
    <P>As sure as this Bill goes on the Statute Books it will be the raising of the latch of the sluice gates of every kind of immorality with the ultimate result of abortion and everything that abortion stands for.  Therefore, what the bishops have advised in relation to this matter is worthy of serious thought and expression of opinion. The last paragraph of the statement issued by the Irish Hierarchy last November contains a warning to Members of this Parliament:</P>
    <P>The issue before legislators and the people is therefore a grave one. People must try to weigh up all the issues fairly in their own minds, asking themselves what kind of society do they want for themselves and their children.</P>
    <P>That final paragraph of the document issued by the bishops is addressed to the Members of this House and to the people who sent us here.</P>
    <P>I should like to ask the Members of this House if, when they were seeking votes at the last election, they stood outside the church gates and told the people that if they were elected they would make contraceptives available for all married people, or did they re-echo the sentiment of the Minister for Industry and Commerce, Deputy Keating, when he said that he would like to see contraceptives made available to all single people.  Was that clearly put before the people for a verdict at the last general election.</P>
    <P>I respectfully agree with those people who have clearly indicated that the Supreme Court ruling is being <Col N="950" /> used to drive this legislation through. I have already referred to the right to life under section 40 of the Constitution and this is a serious and grave matter in so far as Members of this Parliament are concerned.  Because it is so grave Members should pause and ponder before they vote when the Irish bishops have clearly indicated the link between contraception and abortion and, particularly, the fact that the ultimate development of birth control will be abortion.</P>
    <P>I hope the Members of this House will weigh this Bill up seriously.  It is not a matter of the individual.  We are not passing the Bill to provide Mrs. McGee with contraceptives.  We are passing the Bill to provide everybody else with them even those who do not want them.  We are dealing with public morality, not private morality, and when we are dealing with public morality it is a serious problem on which will rest the responsibility of legislators in this regard.</P>
    <P>I accept <i>Humanae Vitae</i> in all its form, because I accept the advice so readily and freely given by the Holy Father, in relation to the granting and giving of God's greatest gift, the gift of life.  Legislators so eagerly anxious to prevent the creation of life should bear in mind that after all had our parents used contraceptives none of us would be here today.  Life comes from God and God alone.  He has the right to create and since He has that right anything which is morally wrong cannot become right by the passage of a Bill through this House. I am voting against this Bill.  I would vote against this Bill in any circumstances. I must ask myself whether it is for the good of the majority and I must immediately conscientiously answer that it is not in the interests of the good of the majority of the people in the country.  Because I have made such a thorough study of the whole situation I am satisfied that this Bill is the first step towards disaster so far as Irish society is concerned.  I hope there will be enough Members of the Dáil to reject this Bill.  I think it is bad, immoral, evilly-designed, evilly-disposed, with intent to corrupt the innocent who do not yet <Col N="951" /> realise what the provisions of the Bill mean.  Even those who are as yet unborn will fall victims of the legislation which is at present before the House.</P>
    <P>Many of us in this country have fought seriously and energetically to keep the country clean.  We have had to fight to keep this country clean against the advocacy of every kind of filth published in Irish and imported journals and by the Press, radio and television.  It may be modern, it may be what the man of today wants, it may be in the disguise of civil rights but one thing is certain, every Member of this Parliament has a duty, a bounden duty, to protect the morals of the community and the public in general.  What is private morality is none of our business but to legislate for the good of the majority is most certainly our business.  I conscientiously, honestly, within my heart, sincerely believe that I would be reneging on everything I ever believed in and on the traditions of my own people who went before me if I supported a Bill of this kind that sells out our true Christian values that have been cherished by so many and attacked without effect by so few until recent times when the few who attack true Christian values appear to be led by the intellectuals in the guise of the defenders of freedom of conscience, civil rights and civil liberties.  These people are a danger in public life.  They may be a danger to themselves in private life but that is no concern of ours.  Each man gets his reward according to the labour he renders, but when it comes to sowing the seeds of complete disruption of the family as a unit that is the time when there is a duty on all of us to stand up and be counted.</P>
    <P>I oppose this Bill and all its provisions. It is badly drafted, unworkable, ill-conceived, improperly designed and has an evil intention.  If I was never a Member of this House, as a member of the Catholic Church with allegiance to Rome, I could not support it.  I could not conscientiously say I accept the teachings of the Church of which I am a member if I supported this Bill.  Because of the strong conviction <Col N="952" /> of conscience I have in relation to it, I could not contribute in any way towards the implementation of a Bill which is designed to make legal what is unnatural according to the laws of God Who created all of us and Who, at the ultimate end, will be the supreme legislator Who will judge all legislators and their code of conduct. Let us not give scandal because of all sins scandal is, perhaps, the worst and the greatest.  Those of us who believe this Bill is wrong will most certainly be guilty of scandal if we support a Bill which we know will not be in the best interests of and for the good of the majority of the people.</P>
    <P>I hope this Bill will be beaten.  I would ask the legislators to reply to the one question addressed to them by the Irish Hierarchy and that is whether this legislation, weighing up all circumstances, will do more harm than good to the society in which we live.  If they calmly study it, they must conscientiously answer that a Bill of this kind is not in the best interests of our present day Irish society and will not be in the interests of the common good but will be a means of planting the seeds of immorality and will also be encouraging and giving State recognition to what is unnatural.  They will be recognising as right what the Church in its wisdom through the ages, has taught to be wrong.  That is the responsibility of legislators.  That is the responsibility which I, as one Member, will undoubtedly exercise here tonight if God spares me until the division bells ring.</P>
    <P>When I vote I can set off on the road home with a clear conscience that I have done my job in Parliament, the place to speak, that I have defended the teaching of the Supreme Being Who made me and gave me all the talents that I possess and thank Him for a million times over.  Perhaps I did not get very far in the public life of this country but I got as far as He wanted me to go.  While I am here in this House, I will be on the list of speakers in regard to what I believe is right and just where public morality is concerned.  If the Bill is beaten, I can readily say I contributed my share to its defeat.  If it wins, I will go home with a very clear conscience <Col N="953" /> in the full knowledge that I have done my part in advising my colleagues in this House and I will have given the example of the courage of standing up to be counted in the defence of what I believe is a right over a wrong.</P>
    <P>I hope my contribution will be accepted in that spirit.  I have made it with great respect to the views of all Deputies.  There are many Deputies who do not share my views and there are those who will laugh at the views I have been expressing for the past few hours.  They are entitled to their views and to their laugh.  That is one of the privileges associated with a democratic parliament.  I am glad some of the Deputies who have spoken are not in responsible positions where they can implement their views.  I hope for Ireland's sake, and for the sake of future generations, they never are.</P>
    <P>I believe that the future of this country depends on the creation of a sound public opinion.  Before I resume my seat I will make a final appeal to those who can contribute so generously towards the creation of a clean and new climate of public opinion in this country, that is, the Press, radio and television.  We need a good climate of public opinion and we need Christian representatives to stand up and be counted in their rejection of any legislation which comes before us which is in conflict with the law of God and the law of man.  I hope this Bill will be beaten. It is a bad Bill, ill conceived and evilly disposed.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Moore</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to preface my brief remarks on this Bill by a reference to the statement this morning of the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs when he implied that the lack of contraceptives or the short supply of them in this part of the country was a bar to Irish unity.  I recall his statement last week that he was not working for Irish unity so his statement this morning is a contradiction of that.  I think he is working towards unity, even if he does not know it, because he certainly has given me an insight into the mind of at least one Government Minister who is charged with the <Col N="954" /> grave duty of bringing about ultimate unity.  One may disagree with the Ulster militants, the Ulster Workers' Council or any of the other organisations up there but I suggest their principles are much higher than those put forward by the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs.  They would not sell out one iota of their stand for any sop like a supply of contraceptives.  The Minister would be well advised to stop referring to the North because in every speech he makes he is causing more harm and driving us further apart.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanMoore" hpid="Mr. Moore Mr. Moore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moore</NameTxt>
      <P>I will but the Minister made this rather confused statement this morning.  In relation to the Bill I believe there are much more serious problems facing the country than a Bill on contraceptives.  I appreciate the fact that the Government felt, after the Supreme Court decision, they had to do something and, perhaps, by that very act they have given the Supreme Court an eminence it hardly deserves in the context of this Bill.  I can say that in another time, and with different personnel, the Supreme Court might make a different decision.  I have no intention of suggesting that the Supreme Court is infallible in its judgment.  The judgment it gave could be very wrong but as it is the final arbiter on these matters at the present time we accept it.  The Supreme Court made its decision, even though it was not a unanimous one, and the Government felt they had to do something so they brought in this Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I feel the Bill is not workable but the Government probably did their best to meet the position they faced. The atmosphere of the present time has influence on that.  For the past few years we have had great publicising of this issue.  One wonders how much big business there is behind the whole move?  Is the name of the game profits in this case?  Have the manufacturers who stand to gain so much played their part in creating this atmosphere and <Col N="955" /> implied that the people want this type of legislation?  We had one case which went before the court and the court ruled in its favour.</P>
    <P>I do not intend to spend very long speaking on the Bill.  I think it is wrong and that the concessions given in it will not make any contribution towards a better society.  The Bill will not help to bring about a good common to all.  At the same time, I recognise this great temptation there must be for young couples, perhaps whose housing is not all that it should be, or people with different types of problems.  We all have problems of different types in different spheres of life, and we have to deal with them as best we can, and do what we think right.  This Bill makes no contribution towards a better society.  Therefore I intend to vote against it.  There has been a campaign on this matter for a number of years.  I am afraid that the young people who support this Bill are looking at it as if it will be a panacea for all their ills.</P>

Any request for the payment of subsidy for the type of accommodation referred to by the Deputy would be considered in the light of progress made in meeting these objectives.  An effective method of meeting the accommodation needs of such young people is to increase and improve the general housing stock where most of them will continue to find suitable accommodation.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>As I indicated in reply to a question by the Deputy on 5th July, 1973, the formulation of measures to relieve traffic congestion in the Dublin area is the responsibility of the road authorities concerned&mdash;Dublin Corporation, Dublin County Council and Dún Laoghaire Corporation.  They are taking action, in consultation with CIE where appropriate, on a number of fronts in discharge of their responsibilities, with due regard to environmental, financial and other relevant considerations. Such action includes the use of traffic management measures and the planning and execution of substantial road works.  While transportation planning is essentially an ongoing and developing process, the comprehensive Dublin transportation study of 1971 affords a reasonable framework for the work of the authorities concerned, work which may involve detailed study of specific aspects and areas.</P>

It has been stated by Dublin County Council that recent pollution of the stream has been traced to a local factory.

    <P>The consideration of legislative proposals to enable local authorities to appoint traffic wardens is now at an <Col N="964" /> advanced stage.  When a firm decision is taken on these proposals, I shall get in touch with local authorities, including Galway Corporation, who may be interested in appointing wardens.

    <Speaker pid="JamesLeonard" hpid="Mr. Leonard Mr. Leonard">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Leonard</NameTxt>
      <P>What prompted this question of mine was that for security reasons there should be one-way streets in Monaghan town and it would be essential that there would be wardens to control the traffic, with a limited amount of parking.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>What I said to the deputation in Galway was that the initiative rested with the local authorities. At that time there was no question of raising the matter with <Col N="965" /> me.  It would have to be cleared by the Garda authorities and I had no function in it.  As far as I was concerned&mdash;perhaps Deputy Molloy has also misunderstood&mdash;I was not preventing them from appointing traffic wardens, as seemed to be inferred by the deputation.

      <P>The question relates to the executives of any State or semi-State company.  If the Deputy wants a detailed explanation I can give it to him, but, briefly, the position is that by the application of a number of different formulae on the last occasion the Parliamentary Secretaries received a rate of increase which was greater than that received by others.

The formulae were not ours.  They were those that were achieved by the reference of the previous Government.</P>

    <P>The pound sterling has depreciated by 3.93 per cent against the Italian lira.</P>
    <P>A better picture of the real effects of exchange rate changes is given by the movement of the average trade-weighted or effective rate.  The depreciation in the effective rate of sterling since 1970 is about 17 per cent.  On the other hand, given the maintenance of the one-for-one relationship between the Irish pound and sterling and the pattern of our trade, the effective exchange rate of the Irish pound has <Col N="970" /> declined by only 6 per cent over the same period.</P>
    <P>In general, the effect of the depreciation is to increase the competitiveness of our goods in the countries concerned and this is being reflected in increased exports.  Exports to the other EEC countries, excluding Britain, increased by 78 per cent in 1973.  In the case of imports there may be opportunities of switching to cheaper sterling sources of supply. There may also be opportunities of switching to relatively cheaper domestic sources with benefit to Irish output and employment.</P>

The recent shortfall in availability of, and related price increases in, energy supplies serves only to emphasise further the necessity for a policy of economic growth which is firmly based on the most efficient use of national resources.

      <P>Since then, the Short-Term Economic Policy Committee has been abolished and its functions transferred to the Economic Policy Committee by a Council decision of the 18th February, 1974.  The new Economic Policy Committee exercise all the functions previously assigned to the Short-Term Economic Policy Committee, the Medium-Term Economic Policy Committee and the Budgetary Policy Committee.  It was established to advise the Commission and the Council on the formulation of short and medium-term economic policy and budgetary policy and to promote the co-ordination of these policies throughout member states.</P>

    <P>The Co-ordinating Group for Short-Term Economic and Financial Policies was set up pursuant to a Council resolution of 21st March, 1972.  The function of the group, which is attached to the Council, is to ensure a permanent exchange of information by the member States as regards their short-term economic and financial policies, and co-ordination of these policies in the framework of the economic policy guidelines established by the Council.

In accordance with this request the Council on 14th January, 1974, adopted a Resolution, OJ No. 07, 29 January, 1974, concerning the co-ordination of national policies and the definition of projects of Community interest in the field of science and technology.</P>
      <P>This resolution provides for a programme of examination and comparison of national policies in the field of science and technology in order to eliminate unnecessary duplication and to ensure effective co-ordination.</P>
      <P>It also established a Scientific and Technical Research Committee, CREST, consisting of representatives of the member states and the Commission.

      <P>Commercial banks have been giving bridging loans to individuals on the guarantee that they will be repaid when the grants for the houses are available.  They have since found that they have no legal right to claim the money directly from the local authority or the State and for that reason feel that bridging loans are insecure.  Is it a fact that the Central Bank directive now prevents these bridging loans from taking place?</P>

    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>No.  Bridging loans are invariably secured against the property or on the undertaking of the solicitor acting for the purchaser who has obtained the bridging loan.  There are no grounds for the suggestion that there are any doubts about the security on offer for bridging loans.</P>

      <P>Kerry County Airport Company was approved for grants totalling £71,000 from the special regional development fund towards the capital costs of establishing an airport at Farranfore on condition that the company would meet all operating costs from its own resources. The grants, which were channelled through the Department of Transport and Power, were subject to conditions accepted by the company. In so far as the conditions have been met, the company has been paid the grants due.</P>
      <P>The company sought a further grant of £33,000 to clear debts which have built up mainly because of operating losses.  Circumstances do not justify waiving the condition accepted by the company that a grant would not be sought to cover such losses.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not appear to have the accounts for 1973.  As far back as 1971 the company's auditors certified as follows: the company's books and records were not properly kept during the year under review and we have been unable to obtain adequate information and explanations <Col N="980" /> in relation to the unsatisfactory results disclosed by the accounts.  The auditors referred specifically to deficiencies on bar trading and on aviation fuel.  The annual general meeting of the company was reported at length in the local newspaper.  As the Deputy is aware, the secretary of the company was reported as stating that when he took up duty he discovered that the affairs of the company were being conducted on a very poor and improper basis.  He said that the property and goods of the company were being highly abused and so far as the bar was concerned there appeared to be no control whatsoever.</P>
      <P>That is the background to the losses which the company is now seeking to recoup.  Having regard to this specific condition under which the original grant was approved and allocation was made, circumstances would not justify the further spending of public money until the conditions are rigidly adhered to.</P>

Does he accept that it is vitally important that this airport be kept open, not only for the benefit of Kerry but for the whole south-west region?  He has an obligation to ensure that it is kept open while, I agree, not enabling by his action anybody to benefit who should not benefit.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, and he is exercising them.  Among those powers is not to make public money available when there is evidence that the management of the concern in question is less than satisfactory.  On the basis of the most recent figures available to my Department, there is a continuing loss and the original grant was made on condition that the State would not be asked to bear any part of the operating losses.  The original project was offered on the basis of its being a viable proposition which would not require continuing State aid.  If circumstances have arisen since which have led to losses, when steps are taken to correct that situation, then it will be time to have another look at the situation.</P>

      <P>The VAT receipts for the three months ended 30th June relating to expenditure in the months of January, February, March and April show an increase of about £1.4 million over the corresponding period last year.  This represents an increase in expenditure and an increase in disposable income of consumers in the same period.</P>

      <P>It may well be that people are spending less but that does not mean they have less disposable income. It may be simply that people are prudent.  For instance, it is common knowledge to people who are reasonably aware of what is going on that the number of new cars purchased this year is less than the number last year.  This is because people are obviously reflecting a certain amount of concern about the energy situation.</P>

      <P>I understand the Office of Public Works, in consultation with the Departments of Lands and Agriculture and Fisheries, have made arrangements to replant all the major trees in the park that are becoming aged.

    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am advised that an arboretum is a collection of trees grown as specimen plants whether planted for botanical interests or as an ornament around a house or in a garden.  As indicated in my reply, we will avail of the services of the Departments of Agriculture and Fisheries and Lands in endeavouring to provide such an amenity in the Phoenix Park.</P>

    <Speaker pid="NoelTLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>

      <P>I think it probably can to some extent but I would not like to make a final decision on the matter.  The Phoenix Park is primarily an area for public recreation and some of the specimens that would be suitable for an arboretum might not be the most appropriate for an area open to the public because of the particular delicacy of the specimens.

      <NameTxt>Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries (Mr. M.P. Murphy)</NameTxt>
      <P>While the early ending of the transitional period provided for in the Accession Treaty would involve considerable advantages for some of our agricultural exports, it would be unrealistic to expect that the transition could be ended only where this would be advantageous for us and not where difficulties would arise as in the case of the removal of protection for Irish industry.  It should also be borne in mind that, if the balance of the Accession Treaty were being disturbed in order to provide advantages for one member state, other member states would undoubtedly seek offsetting advantages for themselves.  There is also the consideration that, even if the early ending of the transitional period were regarded as being in the overall national interest, the negotiation of the necessary amendments to the treaty and their ratification by all nine member states would account for a substantial proportion of the remainder of the transitional period.</P>

      <P>There has been an assessment made of the advantages. As I indicated in the reply, it would be a very complex and complicated procedure to get this request adhered to.  Whilst it would undoubtedly have advantages so far as agriculture is concerned, it could be said these advantages might delay other sectors of our industrial development. Of course, on entry we were anxious&mdash;and the then Government were, I am sure&mdash;to keep the transitional period in agriculture as limited as possible whilst, on the other hand, getting a more extended period for other industrial development.</P>

The special measures which the Commission have taken in recent months with a view to stabilising the market include (a) a prohibition on imports of frozen beef, other than GATT quotas, except where an equal quantity of beef from intervention stocks is purchased; (b) suspension of special facilities for imports of frozen beef for processing; (c) the special régime for the import of calves and young cattle for fattening at reduced rates of duty, and free of levy, has been suspended; (d) the granting of licences for the importation of cattle and fresh or chilled beef from European Third countries has been suspended up to the 12th of July where applications are received after the 26th of June; (e) an increase in export restitutions.

    <P>Question again proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMoore" hpid="Mr. Moore Mr. Moore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moore</NameTxt>
      <P>One of the arguments put forward for the implementation of the Bill is the fact that we have so many ills in our society that it would be a panacea for all these ills.  We have at present a rash of people who go into various parts of the city, and particularly where the lower-paid workers live, and come back with horrifying tales of what they saw there.  They then use this as an argument for supporting this measure.  I want to point out that in the areas where lower-paid workers live, you may certainly have more children, but you have much less emotional disturbance, a much happier community and therefore the argument used by these people who have appointed themselves to work for this legislation does not hold water.  Having said that and being aware of all the injustices in our society and the handicaps of young married people, I do not want to suggest that they are not suffering in lots of ways, but it is our duty to try to remove these injustices by a proper code of development to ensure that every young couple will be properly housed and have such means as will ensure a good standard of living.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On the other hand, it is always hinted <Col N="998" /> that the manufacturers of these articles are some benevolent society whose only aim in life is to ensure that these are made available freely and cheaply.  We have to face the fact that the name of the manufacturers game is profit.  The people peddling these things at the moment, the vast majority of them, are doing it for profit and the advertising in some of the glossy magazines, which is contrary to the law and about which the Government have done nothing, is also being done for profit.  Let us get away from the idea that there is any benign design behind the campaign to have these made freely available, from the manufacturers' point of view.  I emphasise that I am referring to manufacturers with their outlook of the profit motive.</P>
    <P>We have to recognise this fact and the fact that in our society there are many injustices.  We have also to recognise that it is being suggested that young married couples and unmarried people also in the use of these devices will find a kind of panacea or solace for all their troubles.  The atmosphere has been created in the past three or four years.  The decision of the Supreme Court brought the matter to a head. In fairness to the Government, they did have to make some move, the Supreme Court having ruled in the McGee case, towards making certain changes and they introduced this Bill.  The people who examined it, even its technicalities, tell us that it is imperfect and will not serve any useful purpose whatever, but what we have to examine is what legislation would bring about such a situation as would go towards making a different society.  In my view, this Bill will make no contribution whatever towards achieving the common good.  Therefore, it must be rejected by us because it is the job of legislators everywhere in the world to ensure the happiness of their people. They must ensure that every act must lead towards a better society.</P>
    <P>If we look at other countries we will see that though they may have progressed as regards transport, housing and general wealth, the sum of their happiness has not been increased.  Therefore, we must look further afield if we are to find a solution to the problems <Col N="999" /> which this Bill is supposed to remedy. It has been suggested that unless this Bill is enacted and there is general availability of contraceptives here, our population problem will become frightful and that there will not be sufficient space to live in.  This was said many years ago by Malthus.  Few people listened to him.  Of course, the population has increased since then to a great degree but there are still many uninhabited parts of the world.  As well, the techniques of producing more food are being perfected all the time. So the Malthusian argument will not stand examination.</P>
    <P>It has also been claimed that this Bill is affording civil rights, but even humanists would question this because nobody has the right to do something or to propagate a cause which might eventually bring unhappiness.  I know it is held sincerely by many people in this country that they have a right to use contraceptives.  I recognise their right to think in that way but how often do we hear things which are not right, and is it not just as well at times that we are restrained by the laws of the country?  I have often had beliefs on different subjects which I felt were for the good of society but as one becomes a little more experienced one sees that these beliefs do not stand up to examination.</P>
    <P>It has been suggested that a referendum should be held on this question. One has noticed the great number of opinion polls that have been held, some of which, to my mind, were suspect.  I have not sought to hold an opinion poll but I have kept every letter and message I got for and against this legislation.  I represent a sophisticated, cosmopolitan area, Dublin South-East, which has a large section of the affluent society and a large section of not so affluent people. Of the letters and messages I got, 160 were against and five were for this legislation.  I have the file upstairs and if I can be guaranteed anonymity anybody can see that file.</P>
    <P>I am highly suspicious of the manufacturers outside this country who are propagating the need for contraception and of any advertisements I <Col N="1000" /> see.  Believing as I do that this Bill will not contribute to the common good, and because it is, as members on the Government side have said, a faulty Bill which is not workable, I must give due notice that I will vote against it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DavidThornlet" hpid="Dr. Thornley Dr. Thornley">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Thornley</NameTxt>
      <P>I will only say of Deputy Moore's speech that I share his admirable desire to extend the sum of human happiness.  I only regret that his party having spent almost 42 years unbrokenly in power did not succeed in doing so.  Unlike Deputy Flanagan, I have not been 32 years in this House&mdash;I have only been five years here&mdash;but I agree this is a vital debate, so vital that I returned from Strasbourg for the special purpose of speaking in it.  I can only say of the two speakers who preceded Deputy Moore&mdash;the short and explosive speech of Deputy Kitt and the long and explosive speech of Deputy Flanagan&mdash; that they filled me with a mounting sadness about the manner in which this debate was being conducted.  I felt somehow that time had stood still in Ireland.</P>
      <P>I will make only one point on Deputy Kitt's speech.  I, too, was brought up on the speech he referred to when he invoked the former President as a reason for voting against this Bill&mdash;a form of logic which rather escaped me.  I can almost recite that speech by heart about strapping youths and comely maidens living in frugality. Once upon a time I actually believed this until I found that under the regime of Fianna Fáil the strapping youths wound up digging the roads for the English and drowning their sorrows in Finchley Road.</P>
      <P>As to the speech of Deputy Flanagan, I should like to make two points, one very simple and the other more complex.  The simple one is that he made reference to the intake in mental hospitals in this country being very high.  Anyone who knows anything about socio-medical practice knows that the statistics for intake in mental hospitals in this country are distorted by the fact that we do not have adequate home geriatric treatment and we have to put our old people into mental homes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1001" /> The other point is more complex.  I do not want to criticise Deputy Flanagan who I assume spoke sincerely, but the constant linking of abortion and contraception by him is something which I found rather revolting. Speaking as a Catholic, no matter what the Bishops may have said, I see no connection between the two concepts.  There are absolutely no circumstances in which I would vote for abortion.  I regard it as murder and I consider it completely unrelated to this Bill.  Indeed, a section of this Bill prohibits the importation of abortifacients which gives some indication of the Minister's intentions in this respect.  They are the same as mine.</P>
    <P>I should like to say with reference to Deputy Flanagan's speech that since I totally disagree with everything he said, I hope that if I can assume his sincerity he will do the same for me as a Catholic with two children.  By way of preliminary.  I shall make a couple of other brief points.  If at times I appear to be flippant in this debate I hope, Sir, you will not take exception to it&mdash; my flippancy does not derive from the position that I do not regard this subject as serious but rather from a feeling, as I listened to some of the speeches in this debate, which is best reflected in a line from one of Byron's more famous poems:</P>
    <P>And if I laugh at any mortal thing</P>
    <P>'Tis that I may not weep.</P>
    <P>Also I apologise to you if I introduce an element of realism into this debate by occasionally referring to rather unpleasant specific and anatomical details, although Deputy Flanagan was not exactly reticent in doing precisely the same thing.</P>
    <P>I think this debate and all debates on this subject are surrounded by an element of hypocrisy, which I find distasteful.  Everybody knows, of course, that contraceptives have been available for years in this country particularly to the affluent middle classes.  Anybody who could afford the price of a return ticket to London, or who had a friend in England, was <Col N="1002" /> easily able to import these things.  We are putting our collective national fingers in our collective national eyes when we pretend anything else.</P>
    <P>Sometimes, listening with sadness to Deputy Flanagan, I felt there was no point in speaking in this debate at all, that everything that needs to be said about it has been said.  It has been said in particular by two people, one a gentleman with whom I do not normally get on very well, &ldquo;Back-bencher&rdquo; in <i>The Irish Times</i> who, in his articles swiftly and brilliantly destroys the framework of hypocrisy which surrounds this controversy and the other, my good friend, Dr. Patrick Leahy of Ballyfermot in a letter to <i>The Irish Times</i> for which he was disgracefully criticised, in my view, by Deputy Lemass.  I should like to add in this slightly cynical vein that as a European Parliamentarian and also as someone who is something of a linguist I can tell the House to rest assured that the protraction of this discussion over the last few years in Ireland has rendered us the laughing-stock of western Europe.</P>
    <P>Deputy Moore and others referred to receiving letters from large numbers of people telling us not to vote for this Bill.  I received those letters also; they were quite blatantly and patently part of an organised campaign, all verbally almost identical. In some cases they were even photocopies. Some of the admirable gentlemen or ladies who sent these letters descended to what I regard as the slightly unChristian omission of not stamping them so that in order to find out about them not wanting us to vote for the Bill one has to pay a surcharge to the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs.  This is slightly unfair. All these letters began with the proposition that they had voted for me in the last election, a proposition which I found implausible in my case since my views on contraception are pretty well notorious, and went on to say: &ldquo;You have no mandate to vote for this Bill, so do not vote for it.&rdquo; I am happy to tell the authors of these millions of letters that at the next general election they can have <Col N="1003" /> the pleasure of not voting for me because I intend to vote for this Bill.</P>
    <P>With due respect to Deputy Flanagan who said that no matter what damage was done to his electoral chances by his voting against this Bill he intended to do so, let me suggest that, particularly in the case of rural Deputies, they are far more likely to do themselves electoral damage by voting for the Bill than by voting against it.</P>
    <P>Since I take such a depressed and slightly cynical view of this Bill and this controversy or non-controversy, it may well be asked: why do I bother to speak on it at all.  The answer is a slightly conceited one: I shall not allow myself to go into the record as having voted for what I regard as an insufficiently liberal Bill without having explained the reasons while I shall take an apparently logically contradictory attitude.  I confess that the Fianna Fáil speakers who have called this a badly drafted Bill have a point.  I can see Deputy Andrews, a lawyer, waiting to get in and I am sure he will say that this is a badly drafted Bill.  I am inclined to agree with this.  I confess a little disappointment with my colleague the Minister for Justice in his drafting of this Bill particularly since I played a humble role in elevating him to the office he now holds by, as Labour's director of elections, transferring the Labour second preferences in Longford-Westmeath ruthlessly to him in the 1970 by-election, a process for which I was duly censured by my own Labour organisation.  That was, of course, in the halcyon days of &ldquo;going-it-alone&rdquo;, before the Labour Party leaders put wet towels around their heads and by the application of simple logic and mathematics arrived at the startling conclusion, only equalled by that vouchsafed to St. Paul on the road to Damascus, that under PR you could not turn 18 seats into 72 in one election.</P>
    <P>May I now make a few criticisms of the Bill for which I intend to vote? The Bill defines a contraceptive as &ldquo;any appliance, instrument, drug, preparation or thing designed, prepared or intended to prevent pregnancy...&rdquo; As Dr. Leahy pointed out&mdash;what is a <Col N="1004" />&ldquo;thing&rdquo;?  Could I draw the attention of the House at the risk of embarrassing it mortally to some of the facts of life?  Suppose, as Dr. Leahy pointed out, a young lady having failed to menstruate decided to terminate a suspected pregnancy by the time-honoured method immortalised in literature by Alan Sillitoe in the novel <i>Saturday Night and Sunday Morning,</i> to wit, taking a steaming hot bath and consuming a bottle of gin.  Does that constitute a bottle of gin a &ldquo;thing&rdquo;?  If an unmarried girl goes to a supermarket and seeks to purchase a bottle of gin, is she to be eyed suspiciously by her neighbours who may wonder whether she is buying the bottle of gin for the laudable and time-honoured purpose of becoming inebriated or whether she intends to use it as a &ldquo;thing&rdquo; to procure the termination of pregnancy?</P>
    <P>May I also draw some further facts of life to the attention of the House and particularly to Deputy Flanagan who appears to think that in this island, which Karl Marx once called this <i>sacra insula,</i> sin, fornication, abortion, contraception and things like that never happened until recently? As Dr. Leahy also pointed out, many an Irish unwanted pregnancy, and the life of many an Irish mother, has been terminated by the use of a knitting needle.  Does that constitute a knitting needle &ldquo;a thing&rdquo;?  If an unmarried mother goes into Woolworths to buy a pair of knitting needles, is she to be asked whether she intends to knit with them or to use them in a manner defined as illegal under this Bill?</P>
    <P>There are sections of the Bill that I must in all conscience criticise even though I shall vote for it.  Section 1 (2) for example says:</P>
    <P>For the purposes of this Act a person who has no living spouse shall be taken to be unmarried.</P>
    <P>So, the young woman married at 20 and widowed at 25, who purchases things between the age of 20 and 25 is acting perfectly legally but at the age of 25 such purchases ceases to be legal and become illegal.  This is a <Col N="1005" /> concept which I find it rather difficult to comprehend in terms of abstract logic.  I also have a criticism of this Bill which is at the same time a criticism of the Fianna Fáil Party for their persistence in opposition to it. If the Minister feels I am criticising him it is because this controversy has placed him in an utterly impossible position and the compromise he has endeavoured to produce is probably as good as he could produce in the circumstances. I hope he will accept my criticism in that spirit and that it can be seen in that light.</P>
    <P>In a sense, this Bill can be seen as a class Bill&mdash;that is one of my objections to it.  Because of its very complexity the people most likely to avail of it, if enacted, are precisely the people who are least in need of it because they are already provided for.</P>
    <P>Let us again cut through some of the hypocrisy which has surrounded this discussion&mdash;and I do not mean that to apply only today but to the discussion over the past ten years. Everybody knows that anyone who belongs to the class of myself or anybody else in the House can contact a sympathetic Dominican who will tell him or her that <i>Humanae Vitae</i> can be liberally interpreted&mdash;<i>pace,</i> Deputy Flanagan, I have read <i>Humanae Vitae</i>&mdash;and that, therefore, the use of the pill is all right.  Anybody who belongs to the affluent middle classes can find a sympathetic doctor who will indulge in the fiction that the pill is a menstrual regulator and not a contraceptive with the result that the middle classes can live happily ever after.</P>
    <P>Deputy Moore spoke as if he was oblivious of the fact of a housing shortage in Dublin.  I want to make a couple of points which are directly related to the class nature of our present contraceptive system which would not be ended in my view adequately by the passage of this Bill. As I said, I have not been 32 years in this House but in the five I have been here I have experienced a pattern which is very common in a working class area which principally concerns me.  The young pair get married: everything is blissful.  They <Col N="1006" /> move into the front room of a small house in the working class area.  They have a child.  They go to the corporation requesting that they be given a house but they are told that this is not possible since they have only one child.  The principle of the corporation in this context seems to be the ancient injuction to increase and multiply.  So the couple go back and have a second child.  Then, they go again to the corporation or they come to me or to Deputy Moore or to some other Deputy and, consequently, we write letters to the housing manager of the corporation but we are informed that Mrs. X has only two children and so her name is down on the waiting list but that she will be notified when her turn is reached and that there are many cases worse than hers.  The family return to living in their in-laws front room.</P>
    <P>The in-laws are sick at the sight of them.  The husband is sick at the sight of the wife and she is sick at the sight of the husband.  The husband is on the booze while the wife is on librium and valium in vast quantities and the ultimate conclusion of this cycle, which is far more common than most Deputies will have the honesty to admit, is that the husband perpetrates what Dr. Noel Browne has described as the Irish form of divorce. There is no legal divorce here but there is a form of divorce in that a husband simply buys a one-way ticket to London or some other place where he disappears into a limbo from which he is not rescued.  Luckily, progressive legislation in respect of deserted wives has brought this hideous problem to light in recent years.  If I may, I shall borrow an expression used by Deputy O'Connell at the last Labour Party conference when he said that in the case of housing applicants he never knows whether it is best to prescribe the contraceptive pill so that the couple might be happier or to prescribe the fertility pill so that they might qualify for a house.  Any Dublin Deputy who is not aware of that situation is talking through his hat.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1007" /> The Bill makes reference in section 1 to authorised persons.  I should like to refer here to statements made by Deputies O'Kennedy and Flanagan which I found profoundly distasteful. If this Bill is passed, which I hope it will be, will the millions of people who have been writing to Deputy Moore or to myself or to any other Deputy on this subject desist from their efforts?  I do not think so.  This Bill places chemists in a most unpleasant position.  Deputy O'Kennedy suggested that the issue should be left to medical prescriptions but that would place doctors in an equally embarrassing position.</P>
    <P>Deputy O'Kennedy referred to good, sound commercial practice perhaps dictating that a chemist would not apply to become a legitimate conveyor of &ldquo;things&rdquo;.  That reminds me of the nice ladies in the League of Decency and in the Family Protection Association going along to the chemist in, let us say, Ballygobackwards, that village immortalised by the late Jimmy O'Dea and saying: &ldquo;I trust we can rely on you not to buy &lsquo;things&rsquo; because if you import things we will take our business in cosmetics and toothpaste ten miles down the road to somebody else because, great though that sacrifice will be, no sacrifice is too great to keep Ireland in a chaste and holy situation&rdquo;&mdash;that situation in which Deputy Kitt thinks it continues to be.</P>
    <P>Furthermore, I can envisage the local chemist playing 18 holes of golf on a Sunday afternoon and the local parish priest saying to him: &ldquo;I know you are a good Catholic.  I trust we can rely on you not to pollute our community with &lsquo;things&rsquo;.&rdquo;  I can see the chemist succumbing to these pressures. This takes me back to my class point.  If one lives as I live&mdash;in relative affluence in Ballsbridge or Sandymount one can get hold of &ldquo;things&rdquo; just as at the moment one can get hold of pills but what about the people who really need these things, those people who are living in overcrowded circumstances?  What about the people who are not dependent on my intellectual confessor who tells me that I <Col N="1008" /> am so valuable to the community that I can do almost anything that remains within the purview of the Catholic Church?  What about the people who are dependent totally on the tender mercies of less liberal and older doctors and priests?</P>
    <P>One of the weaknesses of the Bill is in section 5 which provides for the restriction of sale of contraceptives to married people.  That is not necessarily wrong but I would like to ask how it is to be enforced.  My criticisms need not be taken as too stringent but if Fianna Fáil had the courage and honesty to allow the measure go to Committee there are details of the kind I have been discussing which could at that stage be tidied up by the introduction of amendments.  I am sure that I speak for all of us over here when I say that we would be delighted to give every co-operation to the people opposite if they were prepared to do as I suggest.</P>
    <P>Let me get back to the question as to how the restriction on the sale of contraceptives to married people would be enforced.  If, say, I had a young brother who was not married and this young brother was fornicating&mdash;to use a term employed by Deputy O'Malley with that wonderful Old Testament ring which he gave to the debate&mdash;I can assure Deputy Flanagan and also the Hierarchy and the plain people of Ireland that the first thing I would do would be to try to dissuade my younger brother from fornicating with his girl friend but if he had lost his religion or had become converted to, say, Judaism or Protestantism I would say to him to take precautions because it would be highly unfair to impregnate a single girl and consequently, to expose her to the consequences either of the production of an illegitimate child or to the horrific consequences, which are mentally unending, of an abortion.</P>
    <P>So, I go to the chemist and I buy my things&mdash;in fact, I do not buy things, but that is my business and nobody else's&mdash;and my mythical young brother buys his things.  We are known to everybody in Sandymount so when we emerge from the <Col N="1009" /> chemist's shop the people say of me: &ldquo;He is a public sinner, you know.&rdquo; They look at me with scorn and the worst thing they could do to me would be to write to the Administrator at St. Andrew's Church, Westland Row, and propose that no longer should I be allowed sing in the choir.  However, they take me away from my younger brother and they rush him down to the corner where there is standing the local garda, with thumbs in his pockets, like Jack Cruise in pantomime, wondering quietly whether he should move in and enforce &ldquo;holy hour&rdquo; in the local pub.  The people say to the garda: &ldquo;Arrest that young man: he is carrying &lsquo;things&rsquo; which he has purchased and to which he is not entitled.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>As a second proposition, suppose, because I feel so strongly about the horrors of impregnating unmarried women, that I swallow my principles and buy things and give them to my young brother, what would be the position?  My young brother might say: &ldquo;I appreciate, David, what you are doing but you are putting yourself to untold expense and, therefore, I must pay you for these &lsquo;things&rsquo;.&rdquo; At this point I become an unlawful purveyor of things and, either I am fined £100 or am sent to jail for six months for my crime while my young brother is also fined £100.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMKelly" hpid="Mr. Kelly Mr. Kelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>I think it would only be the young brother who would be fined.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidThornlet" hpid="Dr. Thornley Dr. Thornley">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Thornley</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sorry if I appear to be funny in dealing with this matter. But I am not being funny because the subject is a very serious one.  All I can say is that this Bill will provide the gardaí with a very interesting time. Already they are busy dealing with the problems of arson, theft, vandalism and wandering horses.  The Bill, too, would provide the legal profession with a varied and interesting addition to their already substantial income.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Having said all that let me say now why I defend the Bill.  I shall attempt to do this as tactfully and as politely as I can but I must say that the Fianna Fáil legalistic arguments against this Bill, strong as they may seem, are not <Col N="1010" /> put forward sincerely.  The spectacle of a man of Deputy O'Malley's age thundering about fornication, like an Old Testament prophet, from the benches of this House, reduces me to a state where I do not know whether to laugh or cry.  It reminds me of the equally nauseous spectacle which I had to endure about three years ago in this House when ex-Deputy Lenihan threw out the Browne-O'Connell Bill on contraception thereby earning himself the prestigious reward of a handshake from Deputy Flanagan.</P>
    <P>What is wrong with this proposal? No one is being forced to use &ldquo;things&rdquo;. These things are simply being made available for those whose consciences entitle them to use them.  Am I to say I am my brother's keeper as Deputy Flanagan says to the extent that even if my brother is a Protestant or a Jew, does not share my religious belief, I have got the right to say to him he cannot have these things?</P>
    <P>The Minister for Posts and Telegraphs has been derided for bringing the issue of Northern Ireland into this debate.  Nobody suggests that the importation of contraceptives is ultimately and determinately fundamental to the partition issue.  Nobody suggests that the ordinary Northern Protestant is some sort of raving sex maniac who will join up with the Republic of Ireland if he can have contraceptives available but not otherwise.  Nobody suggests anything of the kind.  But, there is a principle involved here. Articles 2 and 3 of the Constitution speak of this as one nation.  If it is one nation it contains at least 25 per cent of the population&mdash;at least 25 per cent&mdash; whose consciences, unlike Deputy Flanagan's&mdash;I suppose he would regard them as uninformed consciences as they are Protestant consciences and not Catholic consciences&mdash;enable them to have contraceptives.  Am I to say to that 25 per cent that they cannot have contraceptives?  I admit as some speakers say, that it is not fundamental but there is a principle at stake here.  Are the proponents, like Deputy Flanagan, on the retaining of Ireland as Catholic and subject to the teachings of the Pope, using a sort of paraphrase of Pádraig Pearse's fammatel <Col N="1011" /> ous remark, and I yield to no one in my admiration of Pádraig Pearse? What was it he said?  &mdash;Ireland not free merely but Gaelic also.  Are the Fianna Fáil Party saying, Ireland not free merely but Catholic also?  Is this the message of peace we are taking to our friends in the North?  It is absolutely farcical.</P>
    <P>I once had the experience of being very close to and friendly with a distinguished Protestant rector who went on to become very high in his Church who believed that his young parishioners were entitled to instruction in the use of contraceptives and used regularly to have to go to England and, like a thief in the night, smuggle them in.  Is this the way to treat the 5 per cent of our minority in the South and the potential 25 per cent of our minority when we have reunited the country as the Fianna Fáil Party are so adamantly determined to do?</P>
    <P>Deputy Flanagan made a reference to the fact that the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs&mdash;he said something patronisingly like &ldquo;an admirable and gifted man in every other respect&rdquo;&mdash; had not enjoyed the benefits of a Catholic primary education.  This is the kind of remark which induces nausea in me and it compels me to indulge in a little sort of breast beating because while it may be true of the Minister for Post and Telegraphs that he did not have a Catholic upbringing, in my case, while I did not have a primary Catholic upbringing, later in life I did become probably the only convert in the House.  I am not giving that lecture so as to beat my breast because I dislike breast beating but I think my Catholicity is pretty well known.  In fact, it caused me to be insulted at a Labour Party conference on one occasion.</P>
    <P>Deputy Flanagan invoked the name of the Pope a great deal.  May I say that I had the privilege of an audience with the Pope the other day?  I did not bring this issue up at the time. Also, I have read my encyclicals.  I have read my <i>Humanae Vitae, Populorum Progressio, Mater et Magistra, Rerum Novarum, Quadragessimo Anno</i> and <i>Mit brennender Sorge,</i> one <Col N="1012" /> of the less attractive encyclicals.  I have also read the Bull of Hadrian which brought the English in here in 1169.  I cannot quite see how this is particularly relevant to the way in which we should treat those whose religious beliefs are different from our own.</P>
    <P>If Deputy Flanagan wishes further instruction in encyclicals I can come to his help because I have copies of every encyclical of Pope Paul, Pope John, Pius IX, Leo XIII, Pius XII, Pius XI and I have selected editions of every previous encyclical from the beginning of the time when encylicals were issued.  I can give these to Deputy Flanagan if he wants to improve his Catholicity still further.</P>
    <P>As I have said, the North is not the issue really, although it is terribly relevant.  To me as a Catholic the point of view is whether the Catholic Church is a voluntary organisation of which one may or may not be a member and the State is something different or whether the two are coterminous.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Thornley</NameTxt>
      <P>We are discussing a very important principle which affects our relations with the North.  I think I am entitled to develop it very briefly. Deputy Flanagan was permitted to speak for three hours on almost nothing else but Catholic teaching.  It may interest Deputy Flanagan and others to know that the Church has abandoned the thesis antithesis concept, as it used to be called, and has moved over, under the influence of great theologians like the late Courtney Murray and our own Enda McDonagh, to the belief that the two are separate entities.  While I accept the right of the Pope to tell me what to do as a Catholic, I do not accept the right of the Pope to tell somebody who does not believe in the Pope what he should do.  This is very good straightforward Catholic teaching to be found in Courtney Murray.  I found all this out, by the way, it might interest <Col N="1013" /> Deputy Flanagan to know, in a period when I was lecturing in Catholic social teaching in St. Patrick's College, Maynooth as a substitute for the then Monsignor Jeremiah Newman, then President of the college, who has since been elevated to the Hierarchy.  So my credentials here are impeccable.</P>
      <P>I would appeal to the Fianna Fáil Party not to treat this matter as one of purely politics.  I would appeal to them to recognise&mdash;and I know this is a high-sounding cliché&mdash;that the eyes of (a) the North and (b) the world are on us when we consider this issue today. If the Fianna Fáil Party had come up with a single constructive amendment to this Bill or were prepared to permit it to go to Committee Stage as it stands and bring up amendments to it then, I could understand their attitude but as far as I am concerned they are treating one of the most fundamental areas of private human conscience that it is possible to consider simply as a political football in the hope of embarrassing this side of the House.  This is behaviour which is not worthy of them, particularly the younger members of their party.  I respect the feelings of older people, just as I would allow a free vote on this Bill.  I respect the feelings of those who disagree with me on this though I know and we all know that there are men on the Fianna Fáil side of the House, particularly, as I say, the younger men, who in their heart of hearts believe that the importation of contraceptives is a perfectly legitimate natural right for those who do not share the acceptance of the teaching of <i>Humanae Vitae</i>.  As I say, the eyes of the world and the eyes of the North are upon us in this.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I want to conclude by saying this: I very seldom agree with the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs on anything. I am, therefore, in a very particularly strong position to say what I am now going to say, a very strong position because my respectability as a Catholic has never been called in question, and a very strong position because my arguments with the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs over the issue of republicanism are also notorious, <Col N="1014" /> and it is notorious that we disagree profoundly on that issue.  In many ways I am closer to the people on the Fianna Fáil side of the House than I am to the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs on the issue of republicanism. So I say, with all the force at my disposal: if this House renders itself ludicrous by throwing out this Bill I will not be able to find an argument which will enable me to differ from the view of the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs that Articles 2 and 3 of the Constitution should be repealed and the reality of the position accepted.</P>

      <P>For the benefit of those who may go to the trouble of reading it must be stated again that due to the decision of the Supreme Court contraceptives are freely available to married people in this country if they wish to import them.  This Bill proposes to limit the importation of those to a certain extent by establishing distribution points and by emphasing that they will only be available to married people.</P>
      <P>On the question of distribution, a number of ways were open to the Minister to do this.  The Minister has chosen the chemist shop and no doubt this is one that offered itself to him being the vehicle for the distribution of medicines throughout the community. It would strike one that if this Bill is passed the nice man in the paint shop will have arrived in the town and he will have to look to his laurels.  However, I do not think this is the best way.  It was suggested that this could be done by the health boards.  It was also suggested that it could be done by the family planning units or organisations.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Bill suggests that under certain <Col N="1015" /> circumstances it can be done by people other than chemists or directly through the Minister's office.  Of all those the one that appeals most to me is distribution through the health boards, and that they form family planning units for this purpose.  It may be said that we have family planning units at present but, as far as I am concerned, those people have opted out.  They are only using the name family planning to distribute contraceptives amongst unmarried people.  In this way they have done a grave disservice to married people who wish this service. They have antagonised some people who would be anxious to help those married people.</P>
    <P>Distribution through health boards would mean that they would only be available to married people.  When we think of family planning in the context of this Bill we seem to be thinking only of artificial contraception but if the health boards established family planning units they would make natural methods of family planning available to the people who would approach them.  In this way they would be satisfying everybody, whatever his outlook on this matter is.</P>
    <P>The fact that the Bill has limited its benefits, such as they are, to married people is the nub of this legislation. This is where the searchings of conscience are arising.  Anybody who, like me, happens to be a family doctor in a rural area cannot escape the fact that family planning is essential for a number of families.  On my experience I would be prepared to place this as one in six.  They require this for various reasons.  To classify those, there are the persons who, for purely social reasons, wish to plan their family by virtue of the fact that their family, if it enlarges, will place certain restrictions on them and they will have to stay at home if they cannot get a baby sitter.  Therefore, it is irksome for them to have more children.  To my mind this is not a medical problem and, as such, should not be handed over to the doctor.  This is probably more in line for social workers.</P>
    <P>There are also families who, for financial reasons, may wish to plan <Col N="1016" /> their families or those who for illness may wish to do so.  There are also families who, through lack of accommodation, may wish to plan their families.  In my view all those should get some consideration and the people to give them this consideration are those on the health boards.  The fact that they need this consideration does not, of itself, mean that this help should be confined solely to artificial methods of family planning.</P>
    <P>On this matter one wonders how much at fault we have been, the Department of Health, the doctors and the various people concerned with the medical services, in not making those benefits available to people on a wider scale.  Perhaps we were afraid to do so in the past and the fact that this debate has taken place may be a good thing because it will act as a contribution in urging health boards to do this.</P>
    <P>It is the unmarried people who are creating most difficulty.  Some people have stated in the House that this Bill is illiberal, is not acceptable, or a complete answer to the problem unless those devices are made available to those people.  I do not go along with this and that is one of the reasons why I am voting against the Bill.  I believe that the suggested method of distribution will give rise exactly to the situation envisaged by the previous speaker: that those &ldquo;things&rdquo; will become easily available to unmarried people.</P>
    <P>It has been stated that contraception will lead to increased permissiveness and all that goes with it.  This is a very wide and difficult field to discuss and debate.  There is no doubt whatsoever but that permissiveness has been increasing.  The figures for illegitimate births, abortions and early marriages that have had first births inside the nine months, all point to the fact that there is increased permissiveness in the country.  It is arguable and has been argued, whether this is due to increased contraception or not.  I believe it is.  There is an old phrase which says that a taste of the grass makes a rogue of the cow and with sex experience, being such as it is, having being experienced once, the tendency is to wish to experience more <Col N="1017" /> of it, particularly where there is no fear attached.  The big fear that was attached to it in the past was the fear of being found out due to the fact that the female party became pregnant.</P>
    <P>It is my view that when this fear is removed there will be continued and increased permissiveness and all the difficulties that go with it.  I have no doubt that it must be creating an increase in the incidence of venereal disease.  I have no doubt that there has been an increase in the number of illegitimate children born.  The number of abortions, in spite of the fact that those contraceptives are available in other countries, has increased.  This has been investigated and reasons have been advanced for this situation.  The latest that has come to my notice, and something which is more or less new to me in the context in which it was presented, was contained in the correspondence column of <i>The Lancet</i> of 6th July, 1974.  A worthy contributor pointed out that already there is appearing an increase in cancer of the neck of the womb.  This he attributes to sexual relations at an early age.  He seems to be on such firm ground that he argues that it is not the number of acts that have taken place or the number of partners: at this point in time he is offering the opinion that it is due to early intercourse.  We as a Government and State have been trying to eradicate disease and there is something contradictory in turning round to provide conditions for the increase in disease.  There is an obligation on us to try to reduce disease and the State has gone out of its way to reduce it by various vaccinations, anti-natal services and preventive services that are in existence throughout the country.  Like all things the State proposes to do it will not be able to do this as well as it would like and this brings me back to the health board and the family planning clinic because, as a number of Deputies must be aware the health boards use clinics for the prevention of cancer of the womb already.  They carry out what is popularly called the smear test.  To my mind those two clinics could be linked together.  That would <Col N="1018" /> have the advantage that the person attending would not be labelled as going for contraceptives.  In fact she might be going for the smear test. This letter in <i>The Lancet</i> to which I refer points out that now there must be renewed thinking about the use of the smear test.  In the past it was suggested that those over 35 were the people the medical profession should recommend to have the smear test done but this correspondent suggests that it is the under 35 group who now must have it done and that is the group to watch particularly.  If this is eventually proven to be true it will be a sad comment on the type of society we are trying to develop.</P>
    <P>At times listening to this debate it struck me that we are a very presumptuous lot.  I suppose we are. The mere fact that we offered ourselves for election and presumed the people would elect us indicates that. However, I say this in another context now.  We are trying here to control what is probably the strongest instinct in man, probably the one that gives most pleasure, the one that is absolutely essential for the survival of mankind.  We are trying to control this when we have failed to control the other instincts and inclinations of man&mdash;our selfishness, our progressive outlook and other attitudes of the human being.  At times one wonders how worthy we are to be discussing this.  The thought ran through my mind from time to time whether, if Our Lord came amongst us again and started to write on the sand, we would be able to hold a quorum in the House.  Are we as qualified as we would like to be to discuss this problem? The more one thinks about it the more one is inclined to feel that we have been let down by the theologians. They are not able to give us unified advice on this matter.  We have been let down by statisticians because no matter what statistics are offered to us on the one side somebody is able to come along subsequently and draw a different conclusion from those statistics.  We have probably been let down by the doctors because if we had taken more interest in this problem we would have provided some <Col N="1019" /> of the answers by now and would not have left the House and perhaps the country in the situation which exists at present.</P>
    <P>Another aspect of this problem strikes me.  By and large the difficulties that are arising for Deputies are ones of conscience, ones of facing moral problems which are based on our religion.  We as Catholics have been told that if some definite way could be established of scientifically diagnosing the fertile period this would be a solution to all the problems facing us.  I am not prepared to agree with this because, assuming we could have this scientific test which would pinpoint exactly this time for the woman concerned, what guarantee have we that single people or teenagers would not do exactly as they are doing now, in other words, be promiscuous, make use of this information? This may not provide the answer to this promiscuity and excessive sexual relations that we can anticipate with the coming of contraceptives to the country.  Nobody has made any reference to that to date and I think it is as well that I should mention it.  We must ask ourselves what is the answer to that problem.  To my mind if we feel strongly enough about it it is one of education, education all along the line, at home by the parents, at school, outside school, to create the atmosphere, which would be very difficult.  If this time comes the problem will be with us just as much as we are told it will be if we accept this Bill or any Bill like it.</P>
    <P>Unfortunately we have been pressured by various groups on this question. I have made reference to some of them who I felt overplayed their hand and certainly did not impress me.  Those pressures come from the other side too.  As has been pointed out by the Minister and others, the biggest mistake that has been made has been assuming that this Bill is allowing contraceptives legally into the country for the first time.</P>
    <P>Reading the reports of the Supreme Court case it struck me that the plaintiff went to American law to get the precedents to establish her case <Col N="1020" /> before the court.  In view of the history of the United States, in view of what goes on there and the fact that they have so many social problems they are unable to solve and that many of their social problems are a disgrace to them considering their wealth, I thought it was sad that this should have been done.  Reading the report of the decisions of the judges I was disturbed to a certain extent too by their references to American law and their drawing conclusions from it.  I hope that if at any time in the future they have to decide such difficult problems in the area of sex or any thing relating to any social field they will be able to get better precedents than going to the United States. As far as we see their life at the present time they have not much to offer us.</P>
    <P>We may not be the best people and we may not have the knowledge to decide this problem but, unfortunately, that is what we are here for. We represent a cross section of the country.  There are people of various callings in the House and we have got to make a decision on this.  I am satisfied with my approach to the Bill.  I do not agree with making contraceptives easily available to unmarried people.  I believe there are married people who need those devices, contraceptives or other help, that they should get them and that they should be provided by law.  Pressure has been put on us to make those contraceptives available to single people on the basis that this is private morality and that we have no right to interfere in private morality.  One must ask oneself how many cases of private morality must there be before they become public morality or is that like asking how many angels could dance on the head of a pin?  I do not know. I do not think there is any obligation on me to support positive law in this House to enable a person who is an alcoholic or who wishes to damage his health by alcohol to help him to do this.  If a person has an interest in drugs and wishes to continue taking them, I do not think there is any obligation on me to help to bring in a positive law to aid him to do this. <Col N="1021" /> Both those things are wrong.  I also think that the provision of contraceptives for unmarried people is wrong and I think it is wrong that they should be easily available to them. This is my main reason for voting against this Bill.  Had some other type of Bill been offered which would cover the points I have raised, I would have been inclined to support it.</P>

      <P>We have before this House a Bill to restrict.  It is nothing more and nothing less.  &ldquo;Restriction&rdquo; is the key word.  We should not lose sight of that for one moment.  Some of the confusion in this House has been spread throughout the country by Members of the Opposition party for certain reasons.  We had people sending circulars to everybody adding more confusion.  If you ask anybody in the street what this is all about he will not know whether it is the Bill or the pill we are talking about.</P>
      <P>Certain Deputies in this House hold themselves out today to be paragons of virtue.  You would not know whether they were praying or speaking. I could start praying, too, and say &ldquo;Lead us not into temptation but deliver us from evil&rdquo;.  If I have nothing else to bequeath to my child but a freely available flow of contraceptives, then I have failed in this House to do my duty as a parent. Some people made craw-thumping, holier-than-thou speeches.  You could nearly see the haloes around their heads.  They should be around the necks of some of them.</P>
      <P>Every Deputy got circulars about this Bill even before it was published. A circular came to me which was signed by quite a number of people. When I approached one or two of those who had signed and asked them what they were against, they could not tell me.  The Bill was not even published at the time but my colleague Deputy Molloy had signed saying he was going to oppose the Bill.</P>

      <P>I am pointing out the <Col N="1022" /> confusion there was even among Deputies in this House at that time.  I think I am within my rights, with respect to the Chair, in referring to this.  The Fianna Fáil Party helped to spread that confusion abroad and this is what they want to cash in on today.  I compliment the Minister on taking action to stop the floodgates we have today due to the failure of a Fianna Fáil framed Constitution. This is the reason something has to be done.</P>
      <P>Reference has been made to under-age drinking and there is a lot of truth in it.  It is the greatest danger to our youth at the present time.  One man stated that in such circumstances they can get &ldquo;sex-sighted&rdquo;. There is another form of contraception and I think many of those who oppose this Bill practise it.  It is known as the rhythm method which is a form of contraception and the holier-than-thou think they did not fail in that respect either.</P>
      <P>Deputy Gibbons, who spoke before me, opened up well.  He pointed out the reasons why something should be done.  Of course, the Fianna Fáil Whip has forced that decent man to toe the line.  The fact that Fianna Fáil will use this House to take advantage of such a situation shows how low they will go to try to cash in on the present situation.</P>
      <P>We had a piece of medical advice from Deputy Dr. Gibbons. I have heard medical advice from other people.  A woman in our town had six or seven children and she was warned by a doctor not to have any more.  He told her about rhythm and other forms of avoiding pregnancy. She was warned that if she had another child her life would be in danger.  She had six healthy children since.  I asked her would she give back one of them and she said &ldquo;No. I would risk my life for everyone of them.&rdquo;  At times medical advice can lead people astray.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>What is before the House this evening?  Are we to stand idly by and do nothing?  We have had too much of that in other forms.  I was a member of as many Catholic organisations as anyone else.  No priest <Col N="1023" /> approached me.  Maybe in some cases a priest had to sign the circular sent out by certain groups.  I have discussed this matter with Catholic priests and they understand the Minister's position.  They appreciate that something must be done and that the Minister wants to do something.</P>
    <P>It is sad that Fianna Fáil will take advantage of this position.  It is a damned disgrace to say the least of it for them, for political expediency only, to create the confusion they have created.  I say to the Minister: &ldquo;Do something.  As a parent I ask you to do something to block the floodgates.&rdquo;  I am for the Bill and I am not ashamed to say that.  I can face my wife and children and I can hold my head high in that respect.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DavidAndrews" hpid="Mr. Andrews Mr. Andrews">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Andrews</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to pay tribute to the contribution made by Deputy Dr. Gibbons.  He is a rural doctor in general practice and he has told the House what he knows to be the true situation arising from his own experience.  Having heard all the arguments, having read the plethora of literature on the subject of contraception, having discussed the matter with many people and many groups, I must arrive at a decision on my own account.  Many people may disagree with that decision, and quite a number of other people may agree with it. This is a time for decision and for a rational discussion within the competence of one's knowledge of the subject on which one speaks.</P>
      <P>We are discussing the Control of Importation, Sale and Manufacture of Contraceptives Bill, 1974.  This proposal has been put before the House by the Coalition Government.  I hope to put to the House my intrinsic objections to the basic provisions in the Bill.  As I understand it the Bill stands or falls on section 5.  The rest of the Bill cocoons that section.  That is my interpretation.  Of course, it is open to disagreement.  As reported at column 286 of the Official Report of 4th July, 1974, the Minister said:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The legal position at the moment, therefore, is that importation without restriction as to quantity or type <Col N="1024" /> and by any person is quite legal; that the ban on sale which continues to subsist would appear to be liable to be challenged successfully.</P>
    <P>I agree with what the Minister said in the first part of the statement.  The latter part would be a matter for constitutional test.  I believe that if it were put to a constitutional test it would be found to be unconstitutional. I agree with the Minister in the totality of his statement.  The Minister said:</P>
    <P>I considered that this anomalous position had to be rectified because an anomaly itself is unsatisfactory but, in addition, I have had clear evidence that as a result of it a black market exists and is growing in the illegal sale of contraceptives in this country.</P>
    <P>If, as proposed in the Bill before us, contraceptives are to be made available to married couples only, I can see a very serious situation arising which will not be the fault of the pharmaceutical chemists who will distribute these contraceptives under the terms of the Bill.  It is a matter of fact that, if an outlet is available to married people for the purchase of contraceptives, they will become available to single people.  I do not think there is any gainsaying that.</P>
    <P>For the Minister to come in here and give as a reason, in my opinion a spurious reason, for the introduction of this Bill that a black market in contraceptives exists and that, in some way, he proposes to cure that situation by the introduction of this Bill, is a fallacy.  I agree with the Minister that there is a black market in contraceptives. The Minister has available to him knowledge which I have not got. He knows the extent of that black market and the size of it.  Do Members of this House really think that, by limiting the sale of contraceptives to married people, they will instantly become unavailable to single people? Is the Minister offering this as one reason, among a number of reasons, why he wishes to enact the legislation we are now discussing.</P>
    <P>Having outlined the reasons for the legal position post-McGee, I should <Col N="1025" /> like to pick out a number of quotations from what I would consider to be the liberal judgement of one of the members of the Supreme Court sitting in judgment on the constitutionality of the McGee case. The document I have in my hand is actually a transcript of the judgement of the learned and respected Judge Walsh.  At page 3 of the transcript of his reasoned judgement he said:</P>
    <P>There is no law in force in the State which prohibits the use of contraceptives either in or outside of marriage or the manufacture or distribution of contraceptives within the State.  It appears to be the accepted fact that at present there are no contraceptives manufactured within the State and therefore any contraceptives presently available within the State must necessarily have been imported in breach of the statutory provision and although innocently imported would not attract a penalty to the importer. Such importation would, however, leave the goods liable to seizure.</P>
    <P>That would appear to be the position. I am sure that, if the judge reads the Official Report of this debate, he will forgive me for skipping from page to page, but I consider the extracts I will quote from his judgement to be the most helpful for the argument I hope to pursue during the course of my short contribution on this important subject. At page 7 of the transcript Judge Walsh continued:</P>
    <P>To control the sale of contraceptives is not necessarily <i>per se</i> unconstitutional nor is a control on the importation of contraceptives necessarily unconstitutional.  There may be many reasons grounded in considerations of public health or public morality or even fiscal or protectionist reasons why there should be a control on the importation of such articles.  There may also be many good reasons grounded in public morality or public health why their sale should be controlled.  I use the term &ldquo;control&rdquo; to include the total prohibition.  What is challenged here is the constitutionality of making these articles unavailable. <Col N="1026" /> The decision of this appeal must therefore rest upon the present state of the law and the present state of the facts relating to the issues in dispute.</P>
    <P>At page 16 of the judge's transcripts he goes on to say:</P>
    <P>The sexual life of a husband and wife is of necessity and by its nature an area of particular privacy.  If the husband and wife decide to limit their family or avoid having children by the use of contraceptives it is a matter peculiarly within the joint decision of the husband and wife and one into which the State cannot intrude unless its intrusion can be justified by the exigencies of the common good.</P>
    <P>I was very pleased to see that the judge went on to develop that point, because I had grave doubts on reading the matter whether the State could intrude into the privacy of a marriage between a husband and wife.  The judge continues:</P>
    <P>The question of whether the use of contraceptives by married couples within their marriage is or is not contrary to the moral code or codes to which they profess to subscribe or is or is not regarded by them as being against their conscience could not justify State intervention.</P>
    <P>That places the matter in the proper perspective.  The situation is articulated clearly by the judge and he expresses my point of view far clearer than probably I could express it myself, and that is the reason why I use the quotation, to support the judge and to use his judgment in support of myself.  I do not think the State or anyone else has any right to interfere in or to intrude into the married life of a couple, least of all into the area in which they might use contraceptives. On page 22 the judge says in relation to the McGee case:</P>
    <P>As this particular case arose primarily out of the ban on importation, I think in so far as Article 41&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <P>of the Constitution&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <P>is concerned, the declaration <Col N="1027" /> sought should only go in respect of subsections (3) of section 17 of the 1935 Act.  That does not necessarily mean that the provisions as to sale in subsection (1) cannot be impugned. If in the result, notwithstanding the deletion of subsection (3), the prohibition on sale had the effect of leaving a position where contraceptives were not reasonably available for use within marriage, then that particular prohibition must fall.</P>
    <P>At the moment I do not think it necessary to make any declaration in respect of that and that brings me back to my agreement with the Minister where he states that the ban on sale which continues to exist would appear to be liable to be challenged successfully, and I think that is probably where the information came from arising out of the judge's comments in that respect.</P>
    <P>Another facet of the general argument and discussion is the matter of the enforceability of the Bill.  I make no apologies for being a politician.  I am proud to be such.  There is a suggestion that we are using this subject as a political football.  I would like to help in disabusing minds of that suggestion.  What I say must be taken as the utterances of a politician.  It has been suggested that there is something dirty about politics.  I do not want it to be considered in a &ldquo;dirty&rdquo; sense.  I personally do not understand the suggestion but it has been thrown out so often in the course of this debate that it is as well to get hold of it at the beginning.  Article 15.4 of the Constitution states:</P>
    <P>1º  The Oireachtas shall not enact any law which is in any respect repugnant to the Constitution or any provision thereof.</P>
    <P>2º  Every law enacted by the Oireachtas which is in any respect repugnant to this Constitution or to any provision thereof, shall, but to the extent only of such repugnancy, be invalid.</P>
    <P>This raises again the matter of the availability of contraceptives to single <Col N="1028" /> persons.  My information from one of the highest authorities in this land of ours is that when this Bill becomes law its constitutionality could be challenged by a single person, who may be a widow, a widower, people living in a common law situation, a common law marriage as it is usually called, or it may be just a normal person, not by the standards of some of the contributions here.  We do not know until we put it to the test whether the Bill is unconstitutional, but it is reasonable to accept the probability of it as suggested by this person of legal eminence.  Assuming he is correct, what we are doing then is enacting an unconstitutional provision, section 5 of the Bill:</P>
    <P>A person who is unmarried and not the holder of a licence granted under section 2 shall not purchase a contraceptive.</P>
    <P>The second part of section 5 states:</P>
    <P>A person who contravenes subsection (1) shall be guilty of an offence and shall be liable on summary conviction to a fine not exceeding £100.</P>
    <P>I am putting forward my views to put the House on notice.  We all of us come in here and give our reasons for or against the proposals before us. believe that the views expressed here are views honestly held by those who express them.  I also believe that those who express views believe that their views are genuine.  Section 5 is the nub of the Bill.  Making contraceptives available to married people only is just not enforceable and my argument is underlined by the Minister's own statement.  The Minister is in a very difficult situation and I really do not believe that he believes half of what he said in his introductory speech.  At column 287 of Volume 274 of the Official Report of 4th July he said:</P>
    <P>It has been asked if purchasers will be obliged to produce marriage certificates or other proof of marital status.  The answer is no.</P>
    <P>Leaving politics aside and, in all right <Col N="1029" /> reason, surely there you have the kernel of the matter in regard to the unenforceability of the Bill.  A single person can go into a chemist's shop and purchase contraceptives without having to produce a marriage certificate or other proof of marital status. There will be no obligation on the chemist to inquire as to the marital status of the purchaser.</P>
    <P>The Minister may say, as he said on the Prosecution of Offences Bill, that the section is there <i>in terrorum;</i> so long as people know it is there they will not do something which will bring them within the scope of the section.  Section 5 provides:</P>
    <P>A person who is unmarried and who is not the holder of a licence granted under section 2 shall not purchase a contraceptive.</P>
    <P>Clearly, there is no obligation on the chemist to inquire about, or on the purchaser to declare, his or her marital status.  Surely, straightaway the Bill is brought into disrepute.  That alone is a good enough reason for not voting for the Bill.  No doubt I will be asked what my alternative is.  I will produce my alternative.  I believe we are obliged to produce something other than what the Minister has produced.</P>

      <P>On the matter of the free vote, it has always been the function of a Government to stand over their own legislation.  Here you have a situation in which the Government are positively not doing their duty.  In the post-McGee situation the importation of contraceptives, without restriction, is quite legal.  The Government apparently wanted in some way to curtail the importation of contraceptives and to confine their sale to <Col N="1030" /> married people.  The Minister said that this Bill is designed to regulate their availability having regard to the constitutional decision in the McGee case.  If that is the intention of the Government then they should discharge that function.  This free vote is a funk vote in an effort to justify their inability to prevail on their own Deputies democratically to accept legislation which, according to the Government's interpretation, is necessary.  They are funking the issue by having a free vote and I maintain they are not doing their duty.  It is unfortunate that intelligent people like Dr. Thornley, to be followed, I assume, by Dr. O'Connell&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>Apart from considerations propounded by the learned Supreme Court judges as to the unconstitutionality of the decision in the McGee case, there are many other remarks in the Minister's opening statement which would be helpful to the House if he could clarify them.</P>
      <P>If the Bill is as imperfect as those who talked about amending it say it is, why did they not perfect it before bringing it into this House?  That would be the answer to the amendment question.  The Minister brought in a Bill full of humbug.  Opposition Deputies are being asked now to lend their names to amendments.  That is another reason why I think the Government are not doing their duty.  It is a well known fact that the Government parties met in their committee rooms to discuss this matter.  Why did they not amend the Bill to the satisfaction of the Deputies who want to put down amendments now?  It is humbug and cant.  I would like to discuss section 5.  As reported at column 287 of Volume 274 of the Official Report the Minister said:</P>
      <P>It has been asked if purchasers will be obliged to produce marriage certificates or other proof of marital status.  The answer is no.  Likewise there will be no requirement or obligation whatever on the vendor to inquire as to the marital status of the purchaser.</P>
      <P>Can the Minister honestly admit that the sale of contraceptives to unmarried people is unenforceable and that section 5 is not enforceable?  He will deal with that matter at considerable length, if he has any respect for the institution and the intelligence of this House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It was not my intention to deal <Col N="1033" /> with the proposed legislation in too much depth.  The Bill and the Minister's statement are so riddled with anomalies and inconsistencies that if a person was to sit down and look at them he would have to admit that they exist.  The two threads of my argument have been on the enforceability of the Bill and the probable unconstitutionality of the actual legislation when it becomes law.</P>
    <P>I do not think there is anybody in this House who could disagree with me about abortifacient.  Nobody in this House could support or argue for abortion.  Having read a number of medical journals on the interpretation of the meaning of an abortifacient, I am still in some doubt as to exactly what it means.  I am not competent to give a dissertation on matters pertaining to the medical profession nor is it my intention to give such a dissertation here.</P>
    <P>Under this Bill:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Abortifacient&rdquo; means any appliance, instrument, drug, preparation or thing designed, prepared or intended to terminate pregnancy which has resulted from sexual intercourse between human beings;</P>
    <P>That interpretation will stand in law if and when this Bill is passed.</P>
    <P>Our present population is three million. The estimated population in 1980 will be somewhere in the region of 3.3 million.  The most fertile period for the female population is between 15 and 44 years of age.  Of the present 3 million population, 1½ million are females.  Of those, over half a million are between 15 and 44 years of age. I got these figures from the latest available data.  The marriage rate is 7.3 per 1,000, which would be equal to 22,000 per annum.  The birth rate is 22.8 per 1,000, which would be equal to 68,000.  The death rate is 10.6 per 1,000, which would be equal to 31,000 per annum.</P>
    <P>From the latest figures available to me, an estimated 400 Irish girls went to the United Kingdom for abortions in a recent year.  My information is that the figure for the North of Ireland was considerably higher. <Col N="1034" /> As I understand it, the figure quoted for that year is a reduction in the figure for earlier years.  The figures on abortion must shock all of us who utterly abhor and deplore that insidious and unnatural practice.</P>
    <P>At columns 289 and 290 of the Official Report dated 4th July, the Minister for Justice in his introductory speech on Second Stage said:</P>
    <P>Those who oppose the Bill because it is too illiberal do so mainly on the ground that it seeks to restrict sales of contraceptives to married couples.  They seek to argue that it is impractical to do so and any attempt to do so will bring the law into disrepute.  I have already dealt with this argument when speaking of this restriction on sales to married persons only and the enforcing of it.  They also argue, however, that there is a right, a natural right in favour of single people to have access to contraceptives. I do not accept that there is any such right because that implies a right to fornicate and in my opinion there is no such natural right.</P>
    <P>I agree with the Minister in this matter.  Has a pregnant woman a natural right to have the child, born as a result of illicit love-making, aborted?  She has no such natural right.  If people intend to fornicate and if we cannot prevent that, would it not be better to provide them with the means to prevent pregnancy rather than forcing them out of the country to seek abortion abroad?  This is an extremely important question&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidAndrews" hpid="Mr. Andrews Mr. Andrews">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Andrews</NameTxt>
      <P>It is estimated that some 40,000 persons are taking what is commonly called the pill and my information is that this is the equivalent of 500,000 prescriptions per year. Some people may be taking the pill on the grounds of health but if we are to be honest we must admit that the majority are taking it for contraceptive purposes.  All the figures I <Col N="1035" /> have given are open to correction if they are not correct.</P>
      <P>There are 1,180 pharmacies in this country.  It is estimated that 400 or 500 family pharmacy outlets would give the professional service required in the regulation of the sale of contraceptives. There must be control in the sale and distribution of contraceptives. Many people are genuinely concerned about their free availability as it exists at the moment having regard to the lack of restriction in the importation for personal use.</P>
      <P>The matter of contraceptives has been of concern to the people for years.  There are genuinely held views but there is one view I deplore, that which tries to confuse the issue in some way, which tries to introduce the element of abortion.  I deplore the view that tries to suggest that we are discussing abortion in this debate, that the Government Bill provides for abortion or that the next obvious step will be the introduction of a Bill to allow abortion.  That is a spurious argument&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>There is a genuine anti-contraceptive lobby that we cannot dismiss but there is a dishonest lobby and I find the latter abhorrent.  These are the people who send us colour slides of aborted children being disposed of in buckets.  I do not think it is necessary for me to continue on <Col N="1036" /> these lines but it is this sort of argument that we, as Dáil Deputies, must react against.  I do not know whether or not we should condemn these people; they may be intelligent people but they are not necessarily honest people.</P>
      <P>It is interesting to note that Ireland, as a member of the United Nations&mdash; and I am sure the Minister for Foreign Affairs will agree with me here&mdash;is committed to (a) family planning in principle; (b) Ireland has also subscribed, as I understand it, to the Teheran Conference which regards family planning as a social right; (c) our own National Health Council&mdash;the supreme advisory body on all health matters&mdash;has recommended a change in the law here to allow family planning.</P>
      <P>On the matter of an alternative to the Government proposal, I do not think we as an Opposition are specifically obliged to introduce a Private Member's Bill.  If the Government had been doing their duty we would not find ourselves in the sorry impasse in which we now find ourselves.  If the Government had perfected the instrument which they now purport to be a perfection, then I do not think we would have the spurious argument about introducing amendments and people adding their names, in all-party sense, to these amendments.  However I shall not pursue that argument.  My alternative to the Bill&mdash;and again it is a personal alternative&mdash;and indeed any other suggested Bill on contraception is the amendment of section 17, subsection (3) of the Criminal Law Amendment Act, 1935, by deletion and the substitution of a new subsection setting out the pharmaceutical outlets as outlets for the sale and dispensing of contraceptives on prescription and, of course, the amendments consequential on such a proposal.  Again, one might find one's self in trouble elsewhere but, at the expense of finding ones self in difficulties in respect of my suggestion, very little divides my personal views from those expressed already by Senator Mary Robinson on the subject in the legislative sense.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is one other matter with <Col N="1037" /> which I might deal before concluding: the suggestion that in some way I refused to deal with this Bill as spokesman on Justice for Fianna Fáil. Nothing could be farther from the truth.  At no time did I refuse to take the Bill, at a party meeting or elsewhere; at no time did I refuse to deal with the Bill or with its subject matter. At no time did I refuse to deal with the Bill on radio or television; at no time did I articulate my refusal to take the Bill in committee of the party, front bench or elsewhere.  I would hope that the record will now be corrected in equally as strong language as that record was so unfairly misrepresented.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Foreign Affairs (Dr. FitzGerald)</NameTxt>
      <P>In this debate it is up to us, as legislators, to ignore the pressures on us from diverse sources. There are liberal pressures, sometimes based on principles with which many of us&mdash;most of us perhaps&mdash;do not agree.  There are conservative pressures, highly organised, dishonest in some respects&mdash;that is in the organisation of the campaign&mdash;and often, in fact mainly, ignoring completely the realities of the situation.  All the organised letters I have received have been ones which, even since the Supreme Court decision, have totally ignored its existence.  They have virtually all used the same form of words.  I have replied to every one; only in one instance out of scores has anybody written back.  What this signifies I do not know; whether I convinced them all by the logic of my argument; whether they did not feel they wanted to take the matter further; whether they had written a letter to me in the first instance and somebody else put their names to it&mdash; there are a variety of possible explanations.</P>
      <P>Our job here is to make up our own minds.  Although one would not have known it from what was said earlier today by Deputy O.J. Flanagan, that is something which has been put firmly and squarely to us&mdash;those of us who are Roman Catholics&mdash;by the Hierarchy of our Church who said, having made some preliminary remarks in their statement:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1038" /> It does not follow, of course, that the State is bound to prohibit the importation and sale of contraceptives. There are many things which the Catholic Church holds to be morally wrong and no one has ever suggested, least of all the Church herself, that they should be prohibited by the State.  Those who insist on seeing the issue purely in terms of the State enforcing, or not enforcing, Catholic moral teaching are, therefore, missing the point.</P>
    <P>Deputy O.J. Flanagan managed to miss the point for two hours this morning because he would not listen to what his Bishops said to him despite that he seemed to be talking as if he were a Bishop himself.</P>
    <P>The real question&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <P>The Bishops said&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <P>facing the legislators is: What effect would the increased availability of contraceptives have on the quality of life in the Republic of Ireland?  That is a question of public, not private, morality.  What the legislators have to decide is whether a change in the law would, on balance, do more harm than good, by damaging the character of the society for which they are responsible.</P>
    <P>They went on to suggest then&mdash;having put the responsibility for the decision fairly and squarely where it belongs in this House, and indeed in the other House&mdash;to make a case that there was evidence that the quality of life would be affected, a case which they are fully entitled to put, a case which some of us would feel was selective in the presentation of the figures, but which certainly needs to be considered seriously by anybody dealing with this matter.</P>
    <P>However I feel it was perhaps a mistake to confine the issue put to us to the question of public morality. I will come in a moment to deal with the question of public morality, and I reject completely the idea of some liberals that there is no such thing as public morality or that we should <Col N="1039" /> not concern ourselves with it.  But I think there are other matters as well as public morality to be considered. There is the question of human rights, which was not adverted to in the Bishop's statement.  There is the question of the wishes of the people, which also must have some consideration. There are other related political issues with which we are entitled to concern ourselves and have regard to unless there are compelling arguments under the headings of public morality or human rights, such as, for example, the impact of what we do or do not do upon opinion in Northern Ireland; upon the tensions that exist between the communities there and, therefore, upon the lives and prospects of life of the people there.  Therefore I should like to deal with this general question, because I will deal first with the general question of the rights and wrongs of controlling, not controlling, or having limited control of contraception.  I should like to deal with it from the point of view of these different principles&mdash; the question of human rights, public morality, the wishes of the people and impact on opinion in Northern Ireland.</P>
    <P>I am starting with this general issue. I am doing so because, although in fact what is before us today is not the principle of whether or not to control the availability of contraceptives, or whether or not to prevent them being available&mdash;because that issue has been determined by the Supreme Court; they must be available on some terms&mdash;nevertheless, so much of the debate outside and, to some extent, here has been on the general principles involved rather than on the practical problem of dealing with the Supreme Court decision, I feel it is right that somebody addressing himself to this subject should speak briefly on these general principles.</P>
    <P>First, the question of human rights. The various judgments of the Supreme Court on this are interesting and I do not think they have been sufficiently appreciated.  I think that something of the quality of the thought <Col N="1040" /> in those statements needs more publicity than it has had.  It seems to me that some of those statements derive from a strong sentiment&mdash;one might almost say a passion&mdash;for human rights which some of the judges felt were being ignored.  I want to quote from some of the judgments to illustrate what I mean by that.  Judge Walsh said that:</P>
    <P>the rights of a married couple to decide how many children, if any they will have, are matters outside the reach of positive law where the means employed to implement such decisions do not impinge upon the common good or destroy or endanger human life.  It is undoubtedly true that among those persons who are subject to a particular moral code no one has a right to be in breach of that moral code.  But when this is a code governing private morality and where the breach of it is not one which injures the common good&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <P>which comes into public morality&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <P>then it is not the State's business to intervene.  It is outside the authority of the State to intrude into the privacy of the husband and wife relationship for the sake of imposing a code of private morality upon that husband and wife which they do not desire.  In my view Article 41 of the Constitution guarantees the husband and wife against any such invasion of their privacy by the State.  It follows that the use of contraceptives by them within that marital privacy is equally guaranteed against such invasion and as such assumes the status of a right so guaranteed by the Constitution. If this right cannot be directly invaded by the State, it follows that it cannot be frustrated by the State taking measures to ensure that the exercise of this right is rendered impossible.</P>
    <P>Towards the end of his judgment, Judge Walsh concluded:</P>
    <P>I am of opinion that not only has the State the right to do so but by virtue of the provisions of the proviso to section 1 and the provisions <Col N="1041" /> of section 3 of Article 40, the State has the positive obligation to ensure by its laws as far as is possible (and in the use of the word &ldquo;possible&rdquo; I am relying on the Irish text of the Constitution) that there would be made available to married women in the condition of health of Mrs. McGee the means whereby a conception which was likely to put her life in jeopardy might be avoided when it is a risk over and above the ordinary risks inherent in pregnancy.</P>
    <P>Mr. Justice Walsh not only asserted that the State had not the right to interfere to prevent the availability of contraceptives but in cases like that of Mrs. McGee, have a positive duty to ensure that they were available.</P>
    <P>Mr. Justice Griffin said:</P>
    <P>The present case concerns a relationship lying within the zone of the privacy created by several fundamental constitutional guarantees.</P>
    <P>He went on to ask some rhetorical questions:</P>
    <P>Would we allow the police to search the sacred precincts of marital bedrooms for telltale signs of the use of contraceptives?  The very idea is repulsive to the notions of privacy surrounding the marriage relationship.  We deal with a right of privacy older than the Bill of Rights, older than our political parties, older than our school system. Marriage is a coming-together for better or for worse, hopefully enduring, and intimate to the degree of being sacred.</P>
    <P>Judge Griffin concluded:</P>
    <P>In my judgment, this subsection violates the personal rights of the plaintiff, in this case her right of privacy in her marital relations with her husband under Article 40, section 3, subsection (1).</P>
    <P>Mr. Justice Budd came to a similar conclusion, concluding that the Act with which he was dealing:</P>
    <P>is in particular in conflict with the personal rights of the citizen as to the guarantee of Article 40.3.1 to <Col N="1042" /> respect, defend and vindicate the personal rights of the citizen as far as practicable.</P>
    <P>Mr. Justice Henchy said that the section, section 17 had the effect:</P>
    <P>of condemning Mrs. McGee and her husband to a way of life which at best will be fraught with worry, tension and uncertainty that cannot but adversely affect their lives and, at worst, will result in an unwanted pregnancy causing death or serious illness, with the obvious tragic consequences to the lives of her husband and young children.  And this in a Constitution which in its preamble proclaims as one of its aims the dignity and freedom of the individual; which in Article 40, section 3, subsection (2) casts on the State a duty to protect as best it may from unjust attack and, in the case of injustice done, to vindicate the life and person of every citizen; which in Article 41 after recognising the family as the natural primary and fundamental unit group of Society, and as a moral institution possessing inalienable and imprescriptible rights, antecedent and superior to all positive law, guarantees to protect it in its Constitution and authority, as the necessary basis of social order and as indispensable to the welfare of the nation and the State; and which, also in Article 41, pledges the State to guard with special care the institution of marriage, on which the family is founded, and to protect it from attack.</P>
    <P>Section 17 in my judgment so far from respecting Mrs. McGee's personal rights, violates them.  If she observes this prohibition (which in practice she can scarcely avoid doing and which in law she is bound under penalty of fine or imprisonment to do) she will endanger the the security and the happiness of her marriage, she will imperil her health to the point of hazarding her life, and she will subject her family to the risk of distress and disruption. These are the intrusions which she is entitled to say are incompatible with the safety of her life, the preservation of her health her <Col N="1043" /> responsibility to her conscience, and the security and wellbeing of her marriage and family.</P>
    <P>He therefore concluded that:</P>
    <P>Section 17 violates the guarantee by the State to Article 40 section 3 subsection (1) by its laws to protect her personal rights not only by violating her personal rights to privacy in regard to her marital relations but in a wider way by frustrating and making criminal any efforts by her to effectuate the decision of her husband and herself, made responsibly, conscientiously and on medical advice, to avail themselves of a particular contraceptive method so as to ensure her life and health as well as the integrity, security and wellbeing of her marriage and her family.</P>
    <P>It is well that we should in this debate understand something of what lies behind the decision of the Supreme Court.  These are the views of four judges, asserting the people's marital rights <i>vis-à-vis</i> the State, and if at any time the State sought, as it did in 1935, or by constitutional change to interfere with these rights, this would be a very serious matter indeed.  Once the principle is established and is allowed to endure and is upheld that the State has the right to interfere in the private married lives of people in that way, then it would be difficult to sustain the proposition at some future time that the State would not have the right to interfere to enforce contraception on the people and force sterilisation on people.  The family has rights antecedent to the State and no State has the right to interfere with the inherent rights of the family or with the institution of marriage, and it is on those grounds which seem to me to be fundamental to the whole thoughtbasis of our community, fundamental to our Christian heritage, might I say, that these judgments of the Supreme Court are of vital importance. They have upheld a principle which had been ignored for far too long, the principle of the basic rights <Col N="1044" /> of people in marriage and of the fact that the State has no right or power to interfere with them in their private married lives.  That is a principle which it is very dangerous to seek to undermine.</P>
    <P>There are people at the moment who have put forward the proposal that we should go to the country in a referendum to take away this right of the family, to go to the country and put to the people the proposition that this right, proclaimed in words of some nobility by the Supreme Court should be taken from them, that a campaign should be waged to give the State powers it has not now got to interfere with the family.  I do not think that if such a foolish proposition were contemplated by any political party the people would entertain it. The dangers are much too great. There are rights antecedent to law and above all those rights concern marriage and the family.</P>
    <P>I turn now to the question of public morality, the second consideration which we have to bear in mind. At the outset I should like to reject the liberal view that there is no such thing as public morality.  The fact is that all States, I think, without exception&mdash;certainly I know of no exception&mdash;have such legislation.  They have legislation on marriage, legislation laying down conditions and limitations on divorce and abortion, legislation controlling pornography and blasphemy.  Even the most liberal States today have some legislation along these lines.  Public morality is the concern of the community and of the State and we have the right and the duty to protect public morality by legislating against public acts that may interfere with it, so long as in so doing we do not interfere with basic human rights.</P>
    <P>I also reject the liberal view that public morality is concerned only with public acts.  It is so concerned but not only with them, such as for example acts of public indecency.  Private acts, if tolerated or encouraged by State action, can have cumulative effects on the public mind and the <Col N="1045" /> social consequences of an aggregation of private acts must be considered. Thus the mere fact that a brothel is discreet, not advertised or clearly indicated on the exterior, does not mean that the law may not regulate or forbid brothels.  The suggestion to the contrary is the individual heresy of the liberal west in the 20th century expressed in the phrase so often used &ldquo;So long as I do not directly harm another person, I do what I like&rdquo; and indeed the adverb &ldquo;directly&rdquo; is often omitted from this proposition. The fact is that indirect damage must be considered too.</P>
    <P>For example, if we are considering the question of divorce, we cannot simply consider, as liberal thinkers do, the desire of the two parents to free themselves from entanglement and to enter into some other relationship. We must consider the indirect effects on the children and also the indirect effects if the availability of divorce should change the quality of marriage.  I do not wish to enter into a debate on this, nor do I want to express a view one way or the other on whether there should or should not be divorce.  I only want to reject the concept that in considering matters like divorce one can only consider the immediate effects on the people immediately affected and one has to rule out the impact on what has been called&mdash;though the phrase is so constantly used nowadays as to have become virtually derisory&mdash;the quality of life.</P>
    <P>Having said that, and having rebutted as far as I am concerned those liberal individualistic heresies so characteristic of much of western culture at the present time, the fact remains that when we come to regulate public morality we may not do so by infringing on basic human rights and certainly not by infringing on them in ways that cannot be shown conclusively to be required by the needs of public morality.  In any event, in this particular instance we are dealing with how strong is the public morality argument?  It has been put in this House by Deputies.  We are <Col N="1046" /> told that in other countries where there is contraception the quality of life has deteriorated and that immorality is prevalent.  But how many of those countries are ones that we can compare with our country and its particular culture?  How many of them are characterised by the strong Christian faith of the vast majority in this country?  How many of those countries have 85 per cent of their population practising Catholics?  It is not clear to me that what has applied in other countries with their cultural traditions has relevance here.</P>
    <P>In any event, it is not clear from anything that has been said, or any statistics or any assertions from whichever source and with whatever authority, that the availability of contraceptives has itself been the cause of immorality.  That proposition has been put but certainly has not been proven.  There is, however, one relevant example we can look to for an indication of the consequences of the free availability of contraceptives in an environment and cultural situation similar to our own.  That is, of course, Northern Ireland and particularly the parts of Northern Ireland which have an overwhelming Catholic population and are similar in their religious composition to much of the Republic.</P>
    <P>If we look to Northern Ireland and particularly to the Catholic areas there do we see a long history of pastoral letters directed against contraception as dangerous?  I have never seen one or heard of one.  The first reference I have seen to anything of the kind has only come in this debate during the last couple of months when suddenly some people have woken up to the fact that their case is weak on this account and have started to worry now, rather belatedly, about the quality of life in Northern Ireland.  The fact is that in Northern Ireland in general, and above all in those parts of Northern Ireland whose population have a similar religious composition to our own, there does not exist a situation comparable with that in Britain or America or the other countries we have been told to compare ourselves with.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1047" /> There is a situation in Northern Ireland in which people who want contraceptives can get them but they are not flaunted, there is no effort to affront public morality, there has been no visible significant large scale change in the pattern of human relationships or in the way people behave.  There have, of course, been changes similar to those that have occurred here, just as in this part of the country there is a much wider acceptance today of contraception than a couple of years ago.  That is also true of those parts in Northern Ireland, but there is no evidence that if in areas similar to our own in cultural composition and similar to our own in the attitudes of the people, if you abolish controls you will get any significant perceptible change caused by that.</P>
    <P>We are fortunate, indeed we are unique virtually, in being the only country which in legislating is able to look to somewhere and be confident that the example is one that is relevant because there is nothing inherently different between us and our fellow people in Northern Ireland in this respect.  It has been alleged that there are certain differences.  I do not accept their relevance.</P>
    <P>Two arguments were put forward. The first is that the repression which Catholics have suffered in Northern Ireland for so long has made them staunch in their faith and that we, not having had the benefit of such repression, having been completely free and having been strengthened in our faith, therefore are liable to fall into evil ways which the fortunate Northerners are free from, after 50 years of one-party Protestant Government until a couple of years ago.  I find that curious argument&mdash;an argument no doubt in favour of having one-party Protestant Government in Catholic areas&mdash;one I do not take to and I am not convinced by it.  Neither am I convinced by the reverse argument. I simply do not believe that this has fundamentally altered the attitude of Catholics in Northern Ireland or that we are such weak brethren here <Col N="1048" /> that we would necessarily react totally differently from the way they do.</P>
    <P>It has also been suggested from authoritative sources that the Northerners are more puritanical than we are.  I am half Northern and half Southern; I have been accused at times of being puritanical; I am never quite sure whether it is the Southern Catholic or the Northern Presbyterian in me, but I am not sure there is such an enormous difference in attitudes as has been suggested here.  I simply do not accept that the people of the Republic are such weaker brethren that they cannot be trusted with the liberties which can easily be given to people in Northern Ireland without dangerous effects.</P>
    <P>This argument is one which I reject for a number of reasons.  It would seem to argue in favour of Protestant repression, that we are a different kind of people, that Partition runs very deep, indeed, that there are two nations in this country so different that they require totally different legislation to keep them in their place.  I reject that.  I reject the divisive attitude involved here.  We might even say that Partition is the attitude involved.  I believe there is one people in this country, though with different subcultures, but I do not see that we ought to legislate in two totally different ways as if we were dealing with two peoples, one African and one Asian or something like that.  Whatever differentiation there is between North and South, it does not seem to me to mean that what is tolerable in the North and does no harm will destroy the quality of life down here.  The contrast is simply not credible and I do not accept it.</P>
    <P>Another argument is put forward and with respect, because I am quoting from it.  I must quote my source.  I recall several years ago his Eminence, Cardinal Conway, in a radio programme putting forward&mdash;I am not quoting verbatim and I hope his Eminence will forgive me if I do not give the full statement&mdash;in a few sentences two statements which could broadly be summarised as that there <Col N="1049" /> is no need to change the law here because in any event it imposes no hardship because if you want contraceptives you can get them easily; and that a change in our law would be disastrous.  I find it hard to accept the logic of those two statements in such juxtaposition.  I do not think that the situation is such that a change would be disastrous in that way.  I do not think one can argue on both these bases at once.</P>
    <P>Let us summarise the facts of our situation.  The pill is freely available. It has been said that 40,000 couples need it&mdash;Deputy Andrews mentioned that.  I made a quick calculation after he said it.  I checked the figure out and it seems to me to be roughly correct from information available from other sources, in this instance the evidence of surveys carried out which is in accord with evidence from medical or pharmaceutical sources.  Another form of contraception has been freely available to all since time began, that is, <i>coitus interruptus.</i> Nothing we could do or say would change that.  Contraceptives can be freely imported as set down in the Supreme Court decision and are being widely pushed.</P>
    <P>These are the facts that we have to consider.  Yet we are told that a change we make in the law will radically change the whole way of life in this country.  If that is to be argued it would have to be shown that at the moment there are restrictions and that the change would involve such a degree of liberalisation that it could have such a big effect.  Given the facts I have mentioned and given the controls to be imposed by this legislation, it does not seem to me credible that it would have any really significant effect on our way of life.</P>
    <P>We must also consider the fact that the vast majority of our people are practising Roman Catholics&mdash;about 85 per cent of them&mdash;that we are a people who have traditionally a high standard of sexual morality and that, therefore, we are unlikely suddenly to change our way of life simply because one particular form of contraception became available at points of sale <Col N="1050" /> inside the country rather than freely importable.  A change involving the legal availability of contraceptives within the State to married people will not change the quality of our life.  The quality of life here will change anyway.</P>
    <P>I, therefore, am simply unconvinced with the arguments on public morality. They seem to me to have been expressed unconvincingly and at times even hysterically.  I do not see enough in the arguments here to justify even contemplating intruding on the basic human rights which have been put forward so effectively in the Supreme Court judgment.</P>
    <P>There is another consideration which a democratic Legislature must consider.  It is not the only consideration. Human rights and public morality are important considerations &mdash;most important&mdash;but we must also consider the wishes of the people.  It is relevant in legislation to consider them.  We are not bound by them; I do not feel as a legislator that I must always look at the latest public opinion poll to see what percentage voted what way.  On the other hand, it would be wrong not to have some regard to the wishes of the people, not to try to establish what they want and take it into account unless there are strong contrary indications in such areas as human rights and public morality.  It happens that we know a lot about the wishes of our people in this matter.  Three surveys of public opinion have been carried out in the course of the present year.  These surveys provide cross-checks on each other and all the cross-checks that one can make show a high degree of internal consistency between them. What they indicate is that there is a majority in favour of the availability of contraceptives&mdash;the questions put are slightly different in different cases &mdash;and that feeling is very strong among married women of the age at which they could have children and is overwhelming among younger married women.</P>
    <P>I should like to illustrate that with some actual figures.  As regards the <Col N="1051" /> population as a whole we have two surveys, the Market Research Bureau survey carried out earlier this year, in the spring, with a random sample of 571.  We have the Irish Marketing Survey carried out around the same time with a quota sample of 1,600. The MRB sample excludes people aged under 18 or over 60&mdash;it does not cover the whole range of age in the population.  For the range it covered it showed 58 per cent in favour of the availability of contraceptives.  The question as to whom they should be available is one I shall return to because they went on to ask that question and a very clear picture emerged.  The range of variation was from 73 per cent in the 20-24 age group down to 38 per cent in the 55-60 age group.  The IMS survey, covering the whole population, showed a figure of 70 per cent for the age group 15-24&mdash;very close to the 73 per cent figure for the 20-24 age group in the MRB survey&mdash;declining to 30 per cent for the 55-upwards age group, the whole group above that, that is, 30 per cent of everybody over 55 as compared with 38 per cent for the 55-60 age group.  The older you get the less the support, but the two sets of figures are very closely comparable.</P>
    <P>In regard to married women we have three surveys giving different figures.  Taking the MRB and the IMS surveys they show, overall, 54 per cent of married women in the MRB case, in favour of availability of contraceptives and 51 per cent in the IMS survey in favour of availability of contraceptives through chemists&mdash;the question was put in more precise terms.  Taking individual age ranges for married women of an age likely to have children, up to 44, the MRB service shows 72 per cent in favour and the IMS 68 per cent&mdash;again closely comparable.  If you take the sub-groups of age you get similar figures.  Incidentally I should correct this: when I said MRB I should have referred to the other survey of married women carried out by Mr. Wilson-Davis. The two I am comparing are the Wilson-Davis survey with a random sample of 754 and the IMS survey. <Col N="1052" /> If you go through the different age groups you get the same compatibility of figures.  It is therefore clear, given the size of samples, the three different surveys and the gross compatibility between the figures that whatever some people may think, or like to think, the facts are that our population as a whole have come to the view that on some basis or another contraceptives should be available: that view is held by the great majority of married women, women of marriageable age, the people most directly affected.</P>
    <P>The surveys also tell us something about those to whom contraceptives should be available and on that, from the Wilson-Davis survey there is a very strong view that they should be available only to married people.  I do not suggest that view should be compelling with legislators but it is a very strongly held view and legislators should have regard to it in legislating. I want to put the point that the Dáil, subject to other considerations, should have some regard to the wishes of the people and the wishes of the people, so far as they can be established, have been established with more clarity and certainty and consistency than usual and we have information which can guide us in our decision&mdash; not the determining factor, but one to take into account, when one has had regard to human rights and public morality.</P>
    <P>What about the Churches?  All the Protestant Churches have specifically asked the Government to have legislation to make contraception available. The Catholic Church, through their authoritative spokesmen, have opposed this or, to put it more accurately, indicated in their statement last November that their inclination would be towards not making contraception freely available and that they feel the balance of argument on public morality grounds lies in that direction.  Our Catholics themselves are divided on the issue.  The Wilson-Davis survey of married women showed, in relation to the attitude of Catholic married women to <i>Humanae Vitae</i> that 23 per cent either did not understand it or had no opinion, <Col N="1053" /> about 33 per cent agreed with it and 45 per cent disagreed.  So, although the authorities of the Roman Catholic Church have a clear preference in the matter of legislation as they have indicated, while leaving the decision entirely to the legislators, the views of the Church in terms of the members of the Church on this issue, at least as far as married women are concerned, are not even on the moral issue&mdash;never mind the legal issue&mdash; consistent with the views expressed by the leaders of the Church.  I do not think that should compel us one way or the other, but it is a point worth noting.</P>
    <P>The final consideration which we should take into account in deciding our attitude on this general question before I come to the legislation itself, is the impact of what we do or say, or do not do or say, on the situation in Northern Ireland.  It would be wrong to say that this is a major issue in the minds of people there; wrong to say that if we take a particular decision on this Bill or on the broad issue of contraception, that even if we remove all constraint on contraception it would have a significant effect on people's attitude in Northern Ireland or would bring peace there perceptibly nearer.  To assert that would be to assert an extravagance.  What is, however, clear is that the rejection of access to contraception would tend to confirm hostile views and would have an adverse affect on opinion there.  In so far, therefore, as this issue is one that is significant the balance clearly lies with taking action to make contraception available in the Republic in view of opinion in Northern Ireland, although this is a very minor element by comparison with the three other considerations I have put.</P>
    <P>To sum up&mdash;the Supreme Court has asserted very clearly that the availability of contraceptives for married people, at any rate, is a human right : the public morality argument is a valid one in principle but on the practical facts it does not seem to me to stand up and carry the weight and the burden that is being put on it by those who are pressing it.  The <Col N="1054" /> people seek a change in the law regarding availability of contraceptives for married people because, as I said, the figures are very compelling.  In the Wilson-Davis survey something like 63½ per cent favoured them for married people only, rather more than half wanted them on prescription only while 21½ per cent would be in favour of them only in cases of medical need and only 8 per cent of all the married women concerned thought they should be available to everybody. Admittedly these were the views of married women.  The views of single women might be different but it is the one indication we have of the views on the particular point of legislation regarding confining contraceptives to married people.  It seems a strong view and had we an indication of opinion over a wider range of women in the child-bearing age groups, it is unlikely that we would have a reversal of that view.  It seems fairly clear that there is a strong opinion in favour of the limitation of contraceptives to married people.  Whether that is practicable is another question. I am dealing with the question of what people want.</P>
    <P>With regard to my fourth point, it is my belief that the rejection of the availability of contraceptives would do damage in so far as Northern Ireland is concerned.  Therefore, had there not been the Supreme Court decision and if we were now deciding whether to leave the law as it is or whether to change it, I think the balance of argument would be strongly in favour of change.</P>
    <P>I have gone on at some length on that because so many people are still arguing that issue.  Although it is not an immediate issue, the counter-argument needed to be put clearly and, I hope, with some cogency.  The Supreme Court has taken a decision and we must ask ourselves whether we leave the situation as it is or whether we legislate and, if we legislate, how? It would be undesirable to leave a situation where instead of the availability of contraceptives to married people who consider it necessary to have access to them there would be every incentive for people outside the <Col N="1055" /> country, perhaps, in conjunction with people inside the country, to promote contraceptives by way of a direct mail campaign of a kind the Minister for Justice has outlined in this House.  That is an undersirable situation.  I do not consider it desirable that young people, old people, or unmarried people should be subjected to literature through the post urging them to make use of contraceptives. This is a source of scandal to people and they should be protected from it but legislation is required to afford them that protection.  The question is : What kind of legislation?</P>
    <P>First, the legislation has to determine through what outlets contraceptives should be made available.  It is my opinion that even if the outlets were not restricted the evidence of Northern Ireland suggests the high improbability of serious abuse or public scandal within the country.  Nonetheless, there is the evidence of this campaign from outside.  Perhaps there would be unscrupulous people here, too. who would seek to publicise contraceptives domestically.  Therefore, there is a case for a restriction of outlets and the principle restriction seems to be to chemists' shops.  These premises are to be found throughout the country, they are easily accessible and people turn easily to them for other requirements of a medical or cosmetic character.</P>
    <P>It has been suggested from the other side of the House that contraceptives should be made available through health clinics.  If I understand the suggestion correctly it advocated the setting up of health clinics for this purpose.  It would seem an unnecessary complication to begin establishing special clinics for this purpose.  The existing availability of clinics is not anything like the availability of chemists' shops so that from the point of view of carrying out the spirit, the intention and the letter of the Supreme Court decision, access through chemists' shops seems to be the more sensible course to adopt.  A point one could consider is whether contraceptives might be available also through health clinics.  However, to confine them to health clinics would be unduly restrictive and could <Col N="1056" /> make it more likely that even the restrictions on sale that we would have then could be overruled by the Supreme Court.  However, these are Committee Stage points and I hope this Bill reaches Committee Stage.</P>
    <P>The other point is to whom contraceptives should be available.  It is argued from the other side of the House that it would be unenforceable to restrict them to married people.  I accept that and on the whole I would prefer to have legislation which could be enforceable but there is evidence that our people have a strong preference for confining them to married people.  Perhaps our people may not understand fully the difficulty involved in doing this but when we come to legislate in this way we are entitled to take into account what is public opinion.  If contraceptives are confined to married people, even if this is not enforceable, the Bill will go some distance towards meeting what appears to be a strongly held view of our people.  I do not hold a strong view on this but it is possible to defend the inclusion of this limitation on democratic grounds.  May I say that in this controversy a number of people on the liberal side as well as people on the other side have at different points shown not very much regard for the question of democracy. Some of the criticisms of the Bill from the liberal side have suggested that we should have no regard for what people want but that we should give them what liberal opinion thinks they should have.  On the conservative side the view seems to be that no matter what people want they should not have it.  Our task here, unlike that of the liberal or conservative people, is to try in some way to respond to public opinion.  I am not enthusiastic about an unenforceable ban on the sale of contraceptives to other than married people but that reflects public opinion.  However, I would not be unduly upset if that particular element of the Bill were to disappear.  I would appeal to the other side of the House who are not strongly represented at this moment&mdash;I mean in number rather than on the question of calibre&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>&mdash;&mdash;to think again about what they propose to do because a decision to reject the Bill and to Whip people to do so is clearly a political act.  The arguments put forward from the other side of the House are unconvinving to the point of being ridiculous.  The Bill may contain elements which some people have found humorous in some respects.  This is because of the difficulty of trying to enact legislation in this area while responding to the needs of the situation, meeting human rights and providing for the genuine requirements of public morality and of public opinion, but the argument from the other side of the House is a lot more ridiculous than anything that is contained in the Bill.  Their attitude of voting down a Bill because it contains some elements which they do not like is a negation of parliamentary democracy.  The whole way in which we legislate here is that when a Bill is brought in, either it is something that is trying basically to do the right thing but may not in detail be well expressed, in which case the Opposition agree to its Second Reading but fight it on Committee Stage, or it is a Bill which is so objectionable in principle to the Opposition and which goes so much against their whole philosophy, that they vote it down on Second Stage.  Nothing said on the other side of the House suggests that this Bill falls into that category. The criticisms of the Bill have been Committee Stage points and could not warrant honestly a rejection on Second Stage, particularly since this is the one Bill that the Opposition have such a good opportunity of amending.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the ordinary way on Second Stage when there are strong differences of opinion, when the Whip would be applied on both sides, the Opposition might say that they would vote against the Bill concerned on Second Stage since they probably would not get very far on Committee Stage.  I hope this Government have shown their willingness, as did a number of Ministers in the previous Government, but not all, <Col N="1058" /> to accept amendments from the Opposition. In this instance this eminently amendable Bill is the one Bill that the Opposition have every chance to amend because of the fact that there is a free vote on this side of the House.  Any Opposition amendment put down to achieve the results proposed there would surely find some like-minded Deputies on this side to support it. It would be difficult to resist Opposition amendments in such circumstances.  If the matter is left open there is every chance of the Bill being modified if a majority in this House wish it to be modified.  Therefore, there are no grounds whatever for rejecting this Bill on Second Stage.  It would be a dishonest political act to do so and would be playing games with a matter of serious public policy involving human rights and public morality.  It would not be an honourable act by the Opposition to play politics so far as this Bill is concerned and it would not be sensible politically for them to do so.  Their argument is one that will not be accepted easily on this side of the House.  Their argument that we should not have allowed a free vote is disgraceful. It turns democracy on its head.</P>
    <P>I have some difficulty in accepting the conventions of the democratic parliamentary system under which one is Whipped to vote, regardless of whether one is in favour of the issue involved, but to turn that on its head and to say that one must always do so and that it is wrong morally to allow a free vote, that it is wrong to allow people to vote according to their consciences, is a proposition which should not come from the other side of the House.</P>
    <P>We at times in the past have accused Fianna Fáil of being authoritarian.  I frankly never thought they would be as authoritarian as that and I do not think they are, either.  I do not think it is because of a genuine authoritarian view that free votes are immoral that this line is being taken.  It is being taken because of a curious and rather childish belief that if they can defeat the Bill it will in some way damage the Government.  The one thing you cannot do is bring down a Government <Col N="1059" /> by defeating a Bill on a free vote.  The Constitution does not provide for that.  Any embarrassment in the defeat of the Bill will rest on the other side of the House.  We will have done our best to bring in legislation. It may have defects but defects easily remediable, readily remediable on Committee Stage.</P>
    <P>We have done our best to bring in a Bill.  We have allowed our people to vote in accordance with their consciences. It seems to me to be a minimum right of a Deputy in a matter which pre-eminently involves moral issues.  Moral issues may not bother people so much on the other side.  I do not know.  It may be that they have a different approach.  As far as we are concerned, we have tried to bring in a Bill which reflects the needs of the situation, which guarantees the human right involved, which protects public morality, which reflects public opinion.  Whatever defects the Bill has, they arise because of trying to do these three things at once.  Perhaps we are trying to do too much. It is an honest attempt.</P>
    <P>We have allowed a free vote on our side of the House to allow for people's consciences.  That has not met with a response on the other side of the House.  I hope it may yet.  I hope that before the Bill concludes the Opposition may reconsider their position because I would look forward to a Committee Stage debate on this Bill in which there would be free votes and in which the Bill might in some respects be amended.  I would listen to everything that was said on the different issues with an open mind and would be willing to join with others in amending the Bill if a good case was made for it.  Therefore, I appeal at this late stage to the Opposition to reconsider their position.  It does them no credit.  It does Parliament no credit.  It is not going to do the country any good.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiBrugha" hpid="Ruairí Brugha Ruairí Brugha">
      <NameTxt>Ruairí Brugha</NameTxt>
      <P>Acting Chairman, your presence in the Chair prompts me to repeat a remark made to me upstairs in one of the offices by a lady.  She said that if instead of having <Col N="1060" /> 141 men and three women in this House, there were 141 married women &mdash;and the word &ldquo;married&rdquo; was stressed&mdash;and three men this thing could be dealt with very quickly and logically and there would be no problems.</P>
      <P>This is a political assembly and we represent political parties.  I want first of all to put a political question to the Government.  Why did the Government suddenly change their minds two days after the debate on Northern Ireland and introduce this Bill to be taken last week after agreement had been reached for the Order of Business for last week and bearing in mind that the Government had not included this Bill as part of the Order of Business?  Because, at that time&mdash; last Friday week&mdash;the Government must have known that if the Bill passed the Second Stage which is now being debated it could not possibly get through Committee Stage.  I would think this would be so because if the Bill did reach Committee Stage there would be bound to be a lot of amendments from all sides of the House since it is a Bill that not only has a party political aspect to it but has an individual aspect and amendments would reflect individual views.</P>
      <P>As I see it, this could only mean that the Government anticipated that the Committee Stage could not come up sooner than the next session which, although it is not yet fixed, would be in or around mid or late October. I am rather puzzled to know what the Government have in mind because as a member of the Opposition front bench I have been very much aware in the past couple of weeks of efforts on the Government side to get agreement for an adjournment on the 19th, that is tomorrow week. So, it does not seem to me that it would have been possible to get this Bill through all its Stages in this session.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This means that if, as I anticipate, the Bill is defeated on this Stage it would make little or no difference to the present position regarding the contraceptive issue since no legislation could be put through the House before <Col N="1061" /> possibly November-December of this year.</P>
    <P>On that question which has been mentioned by a number of speakers on the Government side, I do not see a great problem on the Government side if the Bill is defeated.  The Government's function is to secure the passage of necessary legislation through this House and if it emerges that there is not support for this particular piece of legislation then the Government's responsibility still remains to bring in a Bill that will get the necessary support.  It may be felt that for the Opposition to defeat this Bill would be in some way wrong, as implied by the Minister for Foreign Affairs, but I would say, looking at the thing from a practical point of view, that this debate itself, including the Minister's contribution that he has just made, is a part of the beginning of a process of education in regard to this problem which is badly needed in this country.  I say that having in mind the numerous letters that I along with other Deputies have received in which there seems to be a complete misunderstanding of at any rate the legal situation in relation to the contraceptive issue.</P>
    <P>This morning some speakers on the Government side seemed to think that speakers on this side of the House were misleading them by appearing to support the Bill and winding up their contributions by saying that they were going to oppose it.  So, I will begin by saying that my party have decided not to support this Bill because we believe and are advised that it is unworkable and will not fulfil the necessary purpose and the purpose, as we understand it, is not control and importation, sale and manufacture, but rather is the control of distribution of contraceptives.</P>
    <P>I see it as the function and responsibility of the Government to introduce necessary legislation and it is the function of the Opposition to support and/or amend or oppose legislation. The reasons for opposition might be opposition in principle or opposition to a Bill because we believe it to be unworkable and not <Col N="1062" /> capable of amendment so as to make it what we would support.</P>
    <P>Personally I do not approach this Bill from the point of view of opposition in principle but I believe that we as an Opposition are entitled to treat this Bill as we would treat any other.  Referring back to speeches made this morning I would say that the motives attributed to us by members of the Government, and particularly by the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs as expressed earlier today, are their conclusions only and are as likely to be wrong as right.  They are expressions of political opinions and conclusions and no more than that.</P>
    <P>For example, the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs said this morning that we can let this Bill survive and amend it in Committee.  I understood him to ask the Opposition spokesman on Foreign Affairs to deal with that side of it and I am not sure that he did. We have been advised that the Bill as presented, if it were allowed through to the Committee Stage, would not be capable of amendment because what has been put forward by our spokesman on Health involves a radical change in the Bill itself.  Consequently, if it reaches Committee Stage, I am advised it cannot be amended.  I am not a lawyer and I am merely giving an opinion passed on to me.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Posts and Telegraphs said we should consider the effect defeat of this Bill may have on relations between Catholics and Protestants in Northern Ireland and the Parliamentary Secretary to the Taoiseach said we will never hear the end of it if this Bill is defeated.  These are merely speculations.  It may be that the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs and the Parliamentary Secretary to the Taoiseach have been talking to different people than I or that the nature of the questions put by either of us was different.  This is merely legislation which is necessary and is being introduced following the Supreme Court decision.  I do not believe it can become law before the end of the year nor do I believe it can be an issue in Northern Ireland. <Col N="1063" /> As a result of my frequent visits to Northern Ireland over the past ten years I have come to the conclusion that many of the people there are inclined to be a lot more rigid in these matters than we are.</P>
    <P>If this Bill is rejected, and my party have decided to oppose it as it is presented, it will be because we see it as bad legislation, however well intentioned, and not adequate to fulfil its purpose.  I acknowledge that the Government have at least made an effort to fulfil their responsibility by introducing the Bill although this Bill is unworkable.  I also believe that the Government are weak in allowing a free vote. The Minister for Foreign Affairs referred to this but in my view it is the Government's responsibility to put forward legislation and have it passed.  I see a considerable difference between a free vote and a recognition that there may be some Deputies who consider it a matter of conscience not to support a Bill of this kind although I find it difficult, as I am sure the Minister does, to understand how conscience comes into this question because the purpose of the Bill is to impose restrictions where there are none.  I am satisfied that legislation is necessary to control the distribution of contraceptives.  Here I echo what the Minister said last week that the Supreme Court decision means that there is now no effective control over the distribution of contraceptives.  Certainly up to the week before last I had the feeling that the great majority of people did not understand this.  The people who wrote to me did not know it.</P>
    <P>In connection with the general principles of controls in a question of this nature the majority of people in the Republic, and in the North, expect the civil authority to set a good public moral standard or example. They expect the legislators to be seen to be discouraging rather than encouraging permissiveness.  They expect the State to carry some of the responsibility for the protection of young people from commercial exploitation in this area.  In my view this is the <Col N="1064" /> feeling of the majority of people here. From the questions I have posed I am satisfied that this is certainly the view of all parents.  All parents agree that there should be some form of control over distribution so far as young people are concerned during their formative years of adolescence and until they reach maturity when discipline and self-restraint have developed.</P>
    <P>I believe the State is obliged in the public area to provide some means to ensure that contraceptives are not freely available to be commercially exploited to the detriment of young people.  It is my opinion as a citizen that neither the State nor any Church has the right to make matters of private conscience such as relations between married couples the subject of legislation, particularly criminal legislation.  A marriage contract is between a man and a woman and the Churches and the State are merely assistants or witnesses to that contract. In effect marriage is the oldest institution in the world which existed before any State or Church was heard of.</P>
    <P>I do not believe there can be any question that the State can, in any circumstances, have the right to legislate for or against sin.  It is a matter for the individual and primarily between him and his God.  It is a matter for the individual, if he or she is a member of a Church, to accept the guidance and advice that may be given.  The State has no function here and should not have.  It is worth repeating that no legislation in the moral area should be criminal legislation directed against the individual in his or her private life.  There may be a good case for legislation to deter anyone from engaging in commercial exploitation in the distribution of the means of corruption.  That type of legislation could be criminal legislation.</P>
    <P>Deputy Thornley referred to the existing social situation and to the undesirable side of it.  In the public area the civil authority are bound to have regard to the danger by omission of encouraging permissiveness.  I do not like referring to statistics but <Col N="1065" /> it is significant that the statistics for illegitimate births in this State are in the region of 2,000 per annum for many years past.  The figure has been in this region for many years.  Statistics recorded in London, I do not know if they are correct, show that many hundreds of women giving their names and addresses as being from this country seek abortions in clinics in that city.  From the point of view of the public authority I do not think that we can afford to close our eyes to the existence of that sort of thing.</P>
    <P>The public authority seem to me to have a responsibility in regard to what happens to the individual particularly if one takes the example of 2,000 illegitimate births in this country, and considers the consequences to the individual concerned particularly in situations where an unfortunate girl who has not meant any harm may be disowned by her parents and thrown out.  One does not wish to visualise the subsequent consequences to that unfortunate individual for the remainder of her life.</P>
    <P>It is for reasons such as this that I believe the public authority have a right to try to legislate in an intelligent and practical way.  One of the suggestions made on this side of the House as a practical alternative was that the problem could best be solved by the health boards or by committees set up under them.  It seems to me that such committees would be well suited to fulfil the very good objectives that are behind the Bill put forward by the Minister and also to do something that is not included in the Bill&mdash;whether it is the function of the State or not is another question&mdash; that is to provide education on natural as well as artificial means of contraception. I believe, and I am speaking now as a politician who has been talking to people, that something of that kind would find ready acceptance on the part of many people.</P>
    <P>Finally I should like to refer to a question which has been mentioned in letters to the Press and was mentioned by the Minister for Foreign Affairs today, the question of a referendum. I have not heard any arguments <Col N="1066" /> in relation to the idea of a referendum in connection with this which would convince me that any majority has the right to impose religious or moral beliefs on any minority.  Consequently I, and I am speaking personally, would be opposed to any idea of either the Government or the Opposition trying to evade their responsibilities by putting a referendum to the electorate on this question.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickBelton1961" hpid="Mr. P. Belton Mr. P. Belton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Belton</NameTxt>
      <P>I heard a portion of Deputy Flanagan's speech and I appreciate that he solemnly believes what he said.  If people feel that way about a Bill which does not deal with economic matters I do not see why we should not have a free vote.  I think we are correct in having a free vote.  I do not agree with Deputy Flanagan's point of view.  The arguments he used while I was listening to him could have been used for voting for the Bill.  At the moment we have no Bill to allow contraception but since the Supreme Court decision one can import contraceptives but cannot sell them.  Deputy Flanagan mentioned alcoholism.</P>
      <P>Alcoholism is reckoned to be caused by people having too much time on their hands or by worry.  One often sees businessmen becoming alcoholics because of worry.  How many women become alcholics because they have too many children and cannot cope? How many people are admitted to mental hospitals for the same reason? How many broken homes are there because of too many children? That is not always the reason.  There are various other reasons.  Child neglect is another aspect.  I would have used all those arguments of Deputy Flanagan's in support of the Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I know of one area in my constituency where there are a number of women with six or seven children whose husbands are in jail.  We have the problem of bad housing.  In many cases these women can hardly read a document which would tell them where they can get help.  They go to their local Deputy, the parish priest or the social worker.  They themselves <Col N="1067" /> come from big families in the same circumstances.  It is not so much the large family that is the problem as the large family in which the children are like steps of stairs.  This is why women become alcoholics and husbands leave or go into jail.</P>
    <P>Deputy Flanagan also mentioned the huge increase in venereal disease where contraceptives are used.  The fact is that where the pill is used venereal disease has increased but where the the condom is used it has decreased because it is a safeguard to an extent against VD.  According to certain people the whole moral fibre of this country will be upset because we are legislating in regard to where contraceptives should be sold.  We are coming back to the old idea.  There is only one sin in Ireland, sin against the sixth commandment.  There is no other sin according to the Irish.  Honesty? Forget it.  Charity?  Forget it.  We are not interested.  There are many other commandments more important than the sixth.</P>
    <P>The position is that prior to the case in the courts the pill was available and was used by a tremendous number of married and single women.  Nobody knows the exact percentage, whether it was one in two or one in three, but it was used by a tremendous number. Condoms came in from the North of Ireland and from England.  There was no trouble.  Some were brought in for personal use and some for sale.  In fact it is well known in Dublin that the &ldquo;Enterprise&rdquo; was known as the &ldquo;Durex Express&rdquo;.  It is a question of getting them across the Border rather than having them under control here. It is well known that a woman can have a contraceptive coil fitted by going to England.  If one crosses over the Border one will get it on the national health.  In this country many doctors will operate on a woman to make sure she will have no more children. If she has a number of children already he can use it as an excuse and say that she has got to the stage where it would be dangerous to have any more.</P>
    <P>People and pressure groups wrote to me for and against this Bill.  I <Col N="1068" /> answered each one and I told them that I would answer finally when the Bill was introduced.  I told them I would vote for it.  I knew some of the people.  Two single women, aged about 55, wrote to me and said that contraception was wrong.  They have voiced their opinion but I do not think they should become part of a pressure group to dictate to people what way to vote when they have not got the experience married women have.  I also feel that people of a generation ago had to face a different way of life from that which young people have to face today.  It may be better today but there is more pressure.</P>
    <P>There have been arguments by Deputy O'Malley and Deputy Colley and by the Minister and other Deputies on this side of the House in relation to the McGee case.  They took different meanings out of what the judges said.  We all know that if you can import contraceptives the day must come when they must be sold here.  All that has to happen is for somebody to take an action and he will get permission to buy them.  I do not think anybody can disagree with that.  It is imperative for the Government to legislate where they are sold, how they are advertised and where they are advertised.  The Minister for Industry and Commerce said last week that contraceptives should be sold by chemist shops to everybody. He also pointed out the case of people who live together for six or seven years and believe in their own minds they are married.  As far as I can remember, when I was at school I was taught that the priest is only a witness at the marriage ceremony, that if a couple were on a desert island and lived together all they needed to say was they wished to get married and they were married.  The priest just solemnises the marriage.  It is very wrong if two people think they are married and want contraceptives but are not allowed have them.</P>
    <P>I would like this Bill to go a little further.  I would like it to control advertising.  I would like contraceptives to be obtained in chemist shops <Col N="1069" /> only.  I would not like to see them going through the post where there is a chance of their getting into the hands of young people.  I am for the Bill.  I would like married couples to be able to buy contraceptives and I would also like anybody over 21, whether married or unmarried, to be able to buy them.  They have then come to an age where they can make up their own minds what they want to do.  We should also keep them from the young.  Is it not stupid for a Government or the Church to make a law saying that a man 50 or 60 years of age cannot get contraceptives if he wants them? We are treating him like a child if, for instance, he is a divorced man.  You cannot control a man, after he reaches a certain age, for the rest of his life.  The State should not have a right to say you must be a Catholic or a Protestant or that you cannot have contraceptives. There should certainly be an age limit and we should not allow them to be given to people under that age.</P>
    <P>I do not think we are a contraceptive nation.  While we are thinking of selling contraceptives to married couples only I have a feeling we might be selling them to a married man for extra-marital reasons.  We should certainly control where contraceptives are sold.  We do not want to end up with the position like it is in other countries where you can get contraceptives out of a slot machine the same as you can get a packet of Smarties or a bar of chocolate.  They are wrong to have this in those countries and it would be very wrong to have them sold in that way here.</P>
    <P>I am a father of six children and I can say that no parent wants his children in their teens to be able to get contraceptives freely.  We should be honest about this.  Which would parents prefer to find out, that their children had used contraceptives, that their daughter was pregnant or their son had made a girl pregnant? In some countries people boast about having illegitimate children but in this country a girl who has an illegitimate child is an outcast.  People point the finger at her.  That is the <Col N="1070" /> reason why many girls who become pregnant have abortions.  There is no charity in this country at all.  Some people even laugh at girls who have had illegitimate children and boast how they got away with it themselves.</P>
    <P>I have heard the speeches of most Fianna Fáil Deputies.  They are not prepared to agree with this Bill.  They want contraceptives provided through the health authorities.  If that was to be done some people in those health authorities would know who had got them.  Deputy O'Malley said that if they were made available through chemist shops only the gombeen man in the different towns would know the number of times a particular man had intercourse.  In health authorities the whole office would know who had received them.  I prefer contraceptives to be given out by chemist shops or doctors rather than having the health authorities knowing who got them.</P>

      <P>When the President was Minister for Health he said he had everything worked out and that he would set up family clinics and contraceptives could be got there. Deputy O'Malley said that a chemist shop in the West of Ireland may not have contraceptives.  What about the health authority in the west?  They come in from Westport and Ballina to Galway to collect them.  It has been said that chemists will not sell them. At the moment chemists are selling <Col N="1071" /> the pill and there is no bother about it.</P>
      <P>With a free vote on the Government side, Fianna Fáil should have a free vote.  I believe that 90 per cent of all parties are for the Bill.  On Committee Stage they can put down whatever amendment they like and they could be voted on again on a free vote.  They want to play politics and defeat this Bill and perhaps bring in their own Bill and try to get something out of it.  I do not believe there are any votes in this.  You might lose a few votes for talking about it or you might gain a few if you kept your mouth shut.  The parties should get together and get this Bill through. Perhaps this subject has been discussed too much over the past couple of years but perhaps no Bill would have been brought in without a little pressure.</P>
      <P>Men have been discussing a problem which is 90 per cent a woman's problem.  Men have a part in it but a woman lives with it.  It is a part of her nature.  She has to bear the children. She has a monthly period.  She becomes pregnant.  She has morning sickness for three months.  She carries the child for nine months with all the risk of a miscarriage.  She is thinking of the child all the time.  The child may be born dead.  Consider the sorrow and depression that go with that. She has the pain of childbirth.  She has to build up her health before and afterwards.  The husband who causes the pregnancy visits her in the nursing home and goes out and gets drunk. He celebrates for a week when a child is born.  Women are involved, not men, and men are laying down the law for women.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>To me contraceptives are a method of spacing families.  Within a couple of months after a child is born very often the woman is pregnant again.  I heard a story the other day.  If a Catholic has nine children people say: &ldquo;That is a big family&rdquo;, but if a Protestant has nine children people say: &ldquo;My God, he is a sex maniac&rdquo;.  Catholics are expected to have large families, particularly those in the poorer class.  I know parents who had eight or nine children <Col N="1072" /> in the same number of years.  Must we not be worried about their health? Are we just to play politics? I believe that in the case of a fairly large family there should be a reasonable spacing to allow the mother to build up her health.</P>
    <P>Some people intend to vote against contraception but we have contraception at the moment.  I believe the pills should be available for people who want them.  I suppose that one in three women are on the pill and we are talking about contraception.  We are afraid to admit that doctors are prescribing the pill.  We are afraid to legalise what is already happening.  The question now is will they allow in condoms and other contraceptives.  I see nothing wrong in making them available to people over 21 whether they are married or not.  I go a little further than the Bill goes.  I object to having contraceptives going through the post or having them on display in slot machines or advertised in the papers or on television.</P>
    <P>If you have a party of several people a large number of women in that group are on sedatives, usually librium.  They are suffering from their nerves because they have too many children and they are not able to control them because they are all more or less the same age and one cannot mind the other.  Would it not be better for those women to have spaced their children better?  How many women have nervous break-downs? After two or three births, with the pace of modern life, many women have a nervous breakdown and have to go into hospital and get electric treatment.  I believe that is appalling, but it has to be done.  They are sedated and their brain is shocked.  This is happening because of the pace of life and because they have too many children. They are frightened because they cannot control their children.</P>
    <P>This Bill should be accepted.  It could be amended and made harder or more liberal.  There should be an age limit for married or unmarried men and women who can buy contraceptives.  I back this Bill so far as it goes.  There is also the question of the number of wage earners compared to non-wage earners.  In England it is something like <Col N="1073" /> 2:4 or 2:3; in Germany it is 2:5; and in Ireland it is 1:7.  These are approximate figures.  That is an economic factor.  I am not putting it forward as an argument.</P>
    <P>I would not in any way be for abortion.  I am completely against it. People have sent literature to me and I have sent back letters asking them how they connect contraception with abortion.  I am all for spacing children. As regards pornography, there is nothing wrong with it provided it does not get into the wrong hands. I will conclude by asking the Fianna Fáil Party to vote for the good of this country and not for party politics.</P>

      <P>At this stage of the debate the arguments for and against the acceptance of this Bill have well and truly been made and it will be difficult to avoid repetition.  The subject we are debating is a very emotional one, but it is also a very serious one.  It is one which poses great difficulty and much uncertainty for many men and women and, I expect, for many Deputies.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As the debate proceeds there is evidence of very real objection in principle to the fact that a Bill of this nature is before the House.  By and large, Deputies have a reasoned approach to this and recognise that, following the Supreme Court judgment, such legislation is necessary. They realise that the law in relation to contraceptives has been changed anyway in spite of anything this House might or might not do.  The <Col N="1074" /> net result of the Supreme Court findings is that all laws prohibiting the sale of contraceptives, including their importation for sale, remain in force, but now there is nothing in the law which bans the importation of contraceptives for any other reason than for sale.  This has been said in the Minister's speech and no doubt it has been repeated during the day.  Certain Members of this House, and maybe people outside it, wax very emotional on this and tend to disregard that fact.</P>
    <P>Contraceptives are available on mail order, a black market is building up, and some of us Deputies are aware from evidence which relates to us personally that children in the 12 and 13 age group are capable of obtaining contraceptives by mail order.  I have heard some cases where this has been done with the consent of the parents just to ascertain that such was possible.  We have no guarantee that it is not being done without the consent of the parents as well.  That should carry great weight with those who are putting forward the case that no Bill of this kind is necessary.</P>
    <P>This Bill is a sincere effort to control the situation I spoke about.  It also takes cognisance of the fact that the court ruling declared unconstitutional that married couples, in the present situation, have not access to contraceptive devices.  I do not think there is anybody in this House, even the Minister himself, who does not realise that the Bill has shortcomings. It is open to criticism, but surely the logical consequence of any criticism should be amendments on Committee Stage.</P>
    <P>I have heard very good speeches from the opposite side of the House &mdash;in fact, an excellent speech from Deputy Brugha a few moments ago&mdash; in favour of this Bill.  The only argument he advanced on behalf of his party against it was the fact that, though he thought it was necessary and met his requirements in all respects, they were advised legally that it was not capable of amendment.  I am not a lawyer; I am certainly not very well briefed on what is capable <Col N="1075" /> or what is not capable of amendment. Provided the Bill is agreed in principle, even if it means deleting whole sections and substituting other sections, it is desirable to implement it.</P>
    <P>Allegations have been made here that the Bill is impractical and not capable of being enforced.  Some people maintain it is too restrictive. Others that it is not restrictive enough. Many of these arguments are made seriously, and I would suggest that this is a situation in which we should get together and enact the best legislation and not play party politics. No Bill on such an emotive topic could meet every Deputy's viewpoint. I do not think this Bill aspires to that, but it is an honest attempt to put forward a consensus of the views of this House.</P>
    <P>What this measure purports to do is to regulate the importation, the sale and the manfacture of contraceptives, as its title indicates.  It endeavours to do this in a way that will give reasonable access to contraceptives to married couples while safeguarding public morality, and it does its best to interpret the will of the majority of the people as well.  What this Bill does is to give access to contraceptives to married couples who have no conscientious objection to their use.  It will not oblige anybody to use them.  This matter is of great importance to women.  Any woman who, because of her religious beliefs or who for any reason whatsoever does not want to avail of what this Bill makes accessible, is not obliged to avail of them. That is as simple as could be.</P>
    <P>It is conceded by all, Church and State, that family planning is the sole right of the husband and wife.  The Protestant religions in this country have made their point of view known. The Catholic Church condemns the use of artificial methods, officially anyway.  Any Church is entitled to declare its viewpoint on this subject and to lay down norms of conduct for the people who subscribe to the beliefs of that Church.  However, the method employed in relation to family planning is a matter of private morality, and while the Church may advise, I take <Col N="1076" /> the point completely that the State has no function in that regard and has no right to interfere in the private morality of a married couple.  In fact, Article 41 of our Constitution, which was quoted freely here today, guarantees the husband and wife against invasion of their privacy by the State.</P>
    <P>All that has been decided for us by the McGee case.  All that is at issue for us here in this House today is the form of the Bill, the extent of the availability of contraceptives, their sale and so on.  On that, by and large, we agree in principle.  We can debate the form of the Bill and discuss the various sections in Committee.  I endorse some of the points raised today.  I endorse the suggestion that some advisory and educational service should be provided, that it should be a feature of this Bill. I agree that some provision might be made for that on Committee Stage, and that is the place to do it.</P>
    <P>I see the difficulty the Minister has, I see the difficulty many Deputies have in relation to, for instance, the outlet selected for the provision of contraceptives to married couples and in relation to defining what is an abortifacient.  This is an extremely difficult area.  It is an area with which this Bill is making a serious effort to grapple and, from that point of view, the Bill deserves the full consideration of every Deputy to ensure that the best possible legislation is passed.</P>
    <P>Everyone respects the conscientious objector but there is no place for playing politics with a measure like this.  Opposition Deputies professed themselves in favour of the Bill and, at the same time, advanced as the only reason for their opposition to the present measure their assertion that the Bill was incapable of amendment. When one hears an argument like that advanced one immediately becomes suspicious.  The Minister will probably be in a better position to challenge the Opposition on that argument than I am, but I cannot, quite honestly, accept that this Bill is a Bill incapable of amendment and I cannot accept the advice given to us by the Opposition on that score.</P>
    <P>There is no place for emotionalism on this issue and a good deal of emotionalism <Col N="1077" /> has, unfortunately, been generated both inside and outside the House.  For instance, today I heard an Opposition Deputy speak about the preservation of the quality of Irish life.  A very worthy object and one about which we are all concerned, but he went on to wax eloquent about our athletic boys and comely maidens and one could not help thinking of the cruel treatment meted out by Irish society to those comely maidens who have the bad luck or are unfortunate enough to become unmarried mothers.  That situation obtains in many parts of this country up to this very day.  There is a great deal of hypocrisy in this area.  The hypocrisy is not confined just to this Bill.  It exists in all too many spheres of life in this country.  We close our eyes to the facts which we do not want to admit.  That can be said about those people who, wittingly or unwittingly, refuse to appreciate in the absence of a Bill of this kind a situation would obtain, and grow, in this country, a situation which they would be the last people who would wish to see it preserved.</P>
    <P>I think everybody is convinced, as I am convinced, that there must be a Bill of this nature.  I am convinced this Bill was brought in because it was clearly seen that the majority of the people want such a Bill.  They want married people to have access to contraceptives. The Bill obliges no one to use contraceptives.  The outlet,the restriction, and so on are matters that can be negotiated on Committee Stage.  The Bill deserves mature consideration and that is something the public expect from us here in this House.  Certainly married women of child bearing age expect that from us. Figures have been quoted and I want to remind Deputies that it is well to remember that 68 per cent of women in the child bearing age group wanted this law repealed.  It has been repealed but, even had there been no High Court action, there would still be an onus on us to remember that 68 per cent of the women of this country want the legislation now before the House.  I am not going into the reasons why 68 per cent of the women <Col N="1078" /> of child bearing age wanted the law repealed; suffice to say these are the people most directly concerned and these are the people to whom we should give prior considertion.</P>
    <P>This House has a duty to debate this measure constructively.  It affects intimately the lives of many of our people.  He have a duty, whichever side we sit, to be constructive, to share views and not simply try to score debating points.  There have been several appeals already made and I am now adding my voice to those appeals.  I know the Opposition are not totally opposed in principle to this Bill and I appeal to them now to let this Bill go through to the Committee Stage, a Stage on which I hope many Members of the Opposition will have constructive criticisms and suggestions to make in a combined effort to improve the Bill.  Only in doing that will we be sincere in discharging our duty to the people and, particularly, our duty to Irish women.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. B. Desmond Mr. B. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>One of the difficulties in discussing this particular measure is the fact that Dáil Éireann, as currently constituted, is an almost totally male dominated Assembly. Added to that is the fact that the wives of most Members are beyond the child bearing age.  This constitutes a difficulty in trying to assess objectively the views of Members on this matter.  It is ironic that we have had only one woman Member contributing to the debate.  I find that situation very, very sad.  We have a male dominated Assembly deciding whether or not 41,000 women currently &ldquo;on the pill&rdquo; are acting criminally or otherwise.  It is a unique experience for our Parliament to find itself in that kind of analytical situation. There are all the elements of a rather sick debate because of the peculiar structure of the House.  Thus the attitudes reflected on this particullar issue.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not propose to refute the views of my fellow-backbencher, Deputy Oliver J. Flanagan.  I listened painfully for almost three hours to Deputy Flanagan and I found myself in total disagreement with him.  The innuendoes <Col N="1079" /> and the sweeping assertions made by him were certainly not the result of an objective analysis.  One simply could not find oneself sympathetic towards his views and I doubt very much if the views of Deputy Flanagan are shared by very many people.  They are certainly not shared by the bulk of the constituents I represent.  They are certainly not shared by the very many people to whom I have spoken throughout the country.</P>
    <P>I am not a medical doctor.  I am not a social worker.  I have no professional experience in advising people on the very fundamental issue of family planning.  As a Member of Dáil Éireann, I have tried to assess as best I can the various arguments put forward over the years, and in particular over the past six months, about family planning, particularly in the context of the use of contraceptives. I have not come to my views lightly because of my upbringing and education. I do not accept the view put forward by the Hierarchy of the Catholic Church that contraception is intrinsically wrong and morally evil, even when it comes from so articulate a spokesman as Bishop John McCormack.  He said that the Hierarchy regarded the use of contraceptives as morally unlawful.  When he expresses these views this is where we part company.  As a politician, I have tried to read as much as I can about this subject.  I have discussed it with professional individuals who should know something about the subject and I consider I am as well equipped as the Bishop or anybody else to reach an informed judgment in conscience.</P>
    <P>I have listened to the Fianna Fáil aberrations and consider them to be a kind of political idiocy.  Deputy O'Malley suggested that the only alternative to the Government Bill was that the medical doctors, such as the district doctors under the various health boards, should issue prescriptions on so-called medical grounds. When he was caught on that point he immediately reverted to saying that prescriptions could be issued for contraceptives <Col N="1080" /> by health boards for social reasons.  That kind of argument, even on the most superficial examination, does not hold water.  It has been rejected by speakers on both sides of this House.</P>
    <P>Deputy O'Kennedy followed suit by saying that contraceptives could be issued through the agency of the regional health boards but it would not be necessary to have prescriptions. I would like Fianna Fáil to make up their minds on their so-called alternatives because they have no alternatives. They have an &ldquo;against&rdquo; political strategy.</P>

There are 22 Deputies in the Fianna Fáil Party who would like to see appropriate amending legislation. There are about 46 Deputies on the Opposition side who would be opposed to any change.

      <P>I wish to discuss the more serious issues in this debate. The first and the simplest reason why the House should legislate for public availability and sale of contraceptives is that the use of contraceptives&mdash;and the more broad question of family planning&mdash;is a fundamental human right.  While this has been repeated by many Government spokesmen, it cannot be stressed too often.  No legislator or group, whether in the majority or in the minority within the Republic, has the slightest right to deprive others of a fundamental human right&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>Legislation is secondary to the fundamental human rights of people in this country.  Dáil Éireann is secondary to the fundamental rights of the citizens, as enshrined in the Constitution.  I found it appalling and somewhat frightening to find nuances within the Fianna Fáil opposition to the Bill, which suggest that the judgment of the Supreme Court should be set aside.  When it comes to the fundamental issue of human rights in our society, any suggestion or implication that the judgment issued in the Supreme Court by Justice Walsh, Justice Henchy, Justice Budd and Justice Griffin, should not be implemented is frightening.  This attitude can only lead in the long term&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>Any action by Dáil Éireann that would seek to circumscribe or refuse to implement the judgment of the Supreme Court is, in my opinion, incipient fascism.  We are not the supreme authority in this country.  In terms of legislative acceptance by the nation we must bow to the views of the Supreme Court. In all my life I have never heard or read such mealy-mouthed hypocritical <Col N="1085" /> reaction on the part of an Opposition towards the genuine efforts of the Minister for Justice to put into effect the situation as advised by the Supreme Court.</P>
      <P>First, I would comment on some of the statements made by the Minister on Second Reading.  The House should also take particular cognisance of the viewpoint given by the Minister for Justice which was obviously written with great care.  At column 286 of the Official Report dated 4th July, he said:</P>
      <P>The <i>rationale</i> of the Supreme Court judgment was to the effect that married couples are entitled not to have reasonable access to contraceptives denied to them and that the ban on importation was such a denial.  The court did not go on to decide whether the ban on sale constituted such a denial but, having regard to what was said in some of the judgments, I would have little doubt that if a case were shown to the court that the total ban on sale meant that reasonable availability was not possible then that ban too would be found unconstitutional.</P>
      <P>I think that this House must, therefore, not only take into account the actual findings of the Supreme Court but we must also, if we are to retain our credibility as a legislative institution, anticipate what we would regard as further constitutional blowing of holes in the existing legislation, as would undoubtedly develop if we refuse to anticipate the likely outcome of further constitutional action.  On that basis, most certainly I think the Minister has an obligation, in his reply, to develop that point.  But certainly Dáil Éireann has an obligation, as a minimum requirement, at least to pass this Bill <i>in toto</i> on Second Stage and amend it in Committee if necessary. In relation to several provisions of the Bill I am perturbed; I am not very convinced about the practicality of several sections and I am not very convinced about the constitutionality of several sections.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Certainly I would wish to retain these views and put them forward in <Col N="1086" /> the form of amendments because, although I hold the position of Government assistant Whip, and the Whip of the Labour Party, in a free vote situation I would regard myself as being entirely entitled to put down amendments to the Bill and to debate them with the Minister from a purely political point of view&mdash;in view of the fact that I am not an expert in this field&mdash;and to endeavour to tease out, as carefully as I could, the best course of action for amendment of the Bill. Therefore, I think the House has a fundamental obligation at least to ensure that we get that normal opportunity here to elaborate on the desirable amendments to the Bill itself.</P>
    <P>In relation to the whole of the Bill, Deputy O.J. Flanagan suggested very strongly that all the indications were that this country would go to the dogs morally if we decided to pass this legislation.  He suggested that the youth would suffer from an outbreak of permissiveness, the likes of which we have never seen in western Europe.  Quite frankly, I think we should dismiss these thoughts from our heads in relation to this Bill because there is no objective evidence whatsoever available to any member of Dáil Éireann which would suggest that the inevitable outcome of this Bill would be a rampant outbreak of fornication in the country, a growing and rocketing incidence of V.D., for example, that there would be a major breakdown of marital relations, or that the youth would become, with the availability of contraceptives, sexually promiscuous and permissive to an abnormal degree.  I think we in Dáil Éireann&mdash;so many of us ageing; many of us perhaps in a very perverse way rather jealous of youth&mdash;insult the common sense and intelligence of young people and particularly young married people, by implying that the change of legislation we are now advocating will turn them into some kind of raving sex maniacs.  I use that kind of strong language because I had to suffer three hours of it from Deputy O.J. Flanagan when he berated us with that kind of extreme language.</P>
    <P>In my experience&mdash;and I have had <Col N="1087" /> only one marriage; we have three children and I am most intimately involved with my family&mdash;Irish people are not like that.  People do not live like that.  People have not lived like that and are not likely to live like that. I hold the view sincerely that some of the very peculiar, traditionally ultra-puritanical, very puritanical throw-back sexual attitudes of many Irish people have been reflected in some of the contributions we have had in this debate.  In many respects I think we are at a turning point in our history.  I do not think we will have a debate like this ever again in the history of Dáil Éireann; I hope to God we will not, although I can assure the Opposition that if this Bill is thrown out there will be another Bill.  That is my personal interpretation of what the Government may well have to do.  The Government probably would have no option but to bring in further legislation.  By then, of course, Deputy Jack Lynch may &ldquo;grasp the nettle&rdquo; and he may indeed decide to support the particular piece of legislation, having failed to get some common sense out of his Parliamentary Party on this issue.</P>
    <P>I suggest sincerely, to those who have been so perverse in their opposition to this essential legislation, that they are reflecting social attitudes which are of the days gone by and which most certainly, by and large, we have put past us in attitudes to marriage, attitudes to young people and their sexual lives, attitudes to children within marriage and attitudes, in particular, to family planning. I must confess that I find it revolting and rather horrifying that the Deputies who come in here and wax so eloquently, so vehemently and emotionally about the dangers of contraception&mdash;when we have Estimates speeches on the Department of Local Government&mdash;do not say one word about the horror of alcohol in its effect on social attitudes.  I would hazard a guess&mdash;and I am talking subjectively now; I have no evidence because I do not put forward any objective evidence&mdash;if I may indulge in some subjective speculation on <Col N="1088" /> human and social attitudes, that perhaps alcohol has contributed more to whatever degree of sexual promiscuity there may be, or to whatever degree of youthful permissiveness there may be in this country.  I would suggest that the considerably high incidence of alcoholic consumption in this country probably influences social behaviour in relation to sexual attitudes far more than the availability of contraceptives.  Certainly I hold the view, purely as a public representative, and meeting many married couples in regard to housing and social problems that the abuse of alcohol in marriage has created far more marital tension, far more human and family distress and has destroyed more children than the overwhelming assertion on the part of some Deputies that if we had contraceptives available the outcome would be far worse.</P>
    <P>Many of those who turn the searchlight on the question of contraception should take into account these kinds of problems, for example, the availability of alcohol to young people and, I would say, the extremely permissive attitude in many families and many social gatherings towards alcohol and the outcome of excesses of alcohol on our community.  And I do not suffer from any hang-up in relation to alcohol itself.  I simply counter-pose that point as one which should indeed be considered because it can be held&mdash;and I can share the view of Senator John Horgan who put it, I think, appropriately in the Seanad debate on the Family Planning Bill&mdash;that it may well indeed be that alcohol could be a far greater stimulus, for example, to extra-marital sexual intercourse in our community than the availability of contraceptives. It is a view but I should like the House to consider it objectively. Of course, nobody in this House would dare to suggest that we should ban the importation of alcohol, the production of alcohol, the consumption of alcohol or, indeed, that we should prohibit the consumption of alcohol, for example, by single persons in our community.  We would, of course, make a laughing-stock of <Col N="1089" /> ourselves in Europe on that basis and we have come perilously close in this debate to making ourselves the laughing-stock of Europe in relation to this issue.</P>
    <P>I have found another social attitude very disturbing in this debate and particularly disturbing coming from the Fianna Fáil side.  I have noticed an obsessional preoccupation with contraceptive devices, with contraceptive methods and the very word &ldquo;contraception&rdquo; itself, while I notice very little stress given to, and very little concern with or attempt at, an analysis of what would constitute a happy family, what could constitute a normal, stable and happy relationship between a man and a woman. There are of course some people who are not married and who live together. Such people do exist.  Fianna Fáil may not be aware of it but it does happen in our society.  Such people do live together and some live together happily.</P>
    <P>It is one of the facts of life which we find it terribly difficult to legislate for because we choose to ignore the realities of life in many areas of our social living.  This is the point that we have completely lost sight of in this debate, that in relation to family life, in relation to the advice we give to young people and the advice available within our educational institutions, there is the absence of family planning.  It is not, therefore, just a question of definitions relating to abortifacients, to contraceptive devices; it is the wider absence within our community of sane, sound, professionally competent and trained advice to people on how to plan their families, how to space their families if they wish, and indeed, if necessary, advice to young persons before marriage and whether they marry or not.  That is their privilege, and we as a Legislature have failed miserably in the context of our health services, our educational services, our social welfare services, to make provision for that fundamental necessity, that fundamental prerequisite to people living normal, happy, stable, democratic and secure lives in the community.  There <Col N="1090" /> are very many people in our mental hospitals suffering from serious psychiatric side-effects because of the failure of our society to come to grips with this pressing need in our community and it is from that broader point of view that I certainly feel that the passing of this legislation is needed.</P>
    <P>I detest and find sexually perverse the obsession within the Fianna Fáil Party with the intricacies of sexual activity.  These, as we know, are but a very tiny part of what constitutes a human relationship, and a human relationship even in the Christian sense.  I most certainly reject that kind of searchlight which has been so particularly directed in relation to Dáil Éireann and the feelings of many Deputies on this matter.</P>
    <P>There have been suggestions that there are no pressures on Deputies to change their votes on this issue.  It has been suggested that we have been entitled to make up our minds within the general views expressed by the Hierarchies of the different churches and within the viewpoints expressed in newspaper articles, and so on.  Yet I find it strange that in the post this morning, I should receive&mdash;I do not normally buy the paper&mdash;<i>The Irish Catholic</i> of Thursday, 4th July, 1974, with the heading &ldquo;Dáil Deputies on Trial&rdquo;.  Of course it contains the loaded comment in the editorial.  I do not know who the editor is but he has my sympathy when he writes this kind of stuff.  This is what he has to say in relation to those such as myself who would vote in favour of the Bill:</P>
    <P>The Deputy who takes it upon himself to decide that he will vote in favour of the Bill even in the absence of a mandate to do so, cannot expect to win favour in the eyes of those whose support he will be seeking when election time comes around again.</P>
    <P>I suppose <i>The Irish Catholic</i> next week will publish the names of all the Deputies who voted for and against and those mandated to abstain.</P>
    <P>There is a new word in Dáil Éireann in relation to this Bill: people do not abstain, they fade, and we may see on the Fianna Fáil side a few <Col N="1091" /> faders by the end of the debate.  That is the kind of stuff to which we have been subjected.  I have received, through the post, material which I have had to ensure my children did not see.  I have received large lurid photographs of the remains of abortion and the outcome of therapeutic operations.  I have received these through the post from as far away as Canada, sent specially to me since I made my views known on this matter. These are the kinds of pressures which I hope, quite frankly, many Deputies will not respond to but which I find most disturbing in terms of trying to arrive at one's views on this matter.</P>
    <P>There is a more subtle pressure. There is the suggestion on the part of the largest single Hierarchy in this country that Deputies should follow their consciences in this matter, but in so doing, must bear in mind the view of the Catholic Hierarchy, and I quote here a particular view, that of the Bishop of Meath, the Most Reverend Dr. McCormack, secretary to the Catholic Hierarchy, in a personal statement, that the bishops stood by their statement of last November, that contraception was morally wrong.  He says:</P>
    <P>The Hierarchy would regard the use of contraceptives as morally unlawful.</P>
    <P>Within that statement of last November, there was the attempt to suggest that of course while the Catholic Hierarchy were conveying their view that contraception was morally wrong, they were in no way suggesting to Deputies that they should be unduly influenced by that particular view.  As far as I am concerned, a statement in relation to contraception by the Catholic Hierarchy of this country is a political judgment.  It is a moral judgment in so far as Bishops pronounce on moral matters but it is also a political judgment and as such, does inevitably bear on the minds of Deputies.  It is rather disingenuous, to say the least, that this statement came in this manner because, as far as I am concerned, inevitably a substantial <Col N="1092" /> block of Deputies will regard that statement as a directive, a quasi-directive, a quasi-suggestion, that &ldquo;You are free to do something which is immoral and of course you are free to take that political decision.  So be it on your conscience and, of course, as a Member of Dáil Éireann you will be contravening the moral law&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>This is the implication.  This is the view that has been conveyed to Deputies by the Catholic Hierarchy and I for one do not accept that statement just as I reject emphatically the overtones of many of the statements made, particularly by the senior member of the Hierarchy, Cardinal Conway, in relation to contraceptives. I have found them to be unacceptable, more particularly when I found the parallels drawn on this subject between Northern Ireland Protestants, the Republic, a united Ireland and the other connotations which his Eminence managed to bring into debate.</P>
    <P>As a Member of Dáil Éireann I would be very lacking in comment if I were not to say that in the past two years in relation to the statements made, particularly by the said gentleman, I have been increasingly perturbed that this kind of simplistic evasion of the rights of the minority in the Republic and of the minority in Northern Ireland should have been bandied about.  I am sure a growing proportion of the community in the Republic would not disagree with me. If I have been harsh in these comments I frankly feel it is time we were harsh on such comments.  There is very substantial pressure in relation to the views put forward.</P>
    <P>Yet another pressure group seem to have plenty of money, with due respect to Deputy Oliver Flanagan who ranted and raved this morning about a couple of thousand pounds which the International Family Planning Association gave to the Irish fertility clinics.  I think that association are a hell of a sight more reputable in international standing and in medical standing than the particular organisation mentioned by the Deputy and who have sent in a great <Col N="1093" /> deal of stuff to Deputies in this House. We have been bombarded with it.  I received 90 letters in the past few months on this subject and I can produce these letters if any Deputy does not believe me.  Some of the stuff I have received, particularly in relation to the rights of the minority in the community, has been nothing short of inverted racism.  I will quote one section of a document which is headed &ldquo;Can Protestants Survive Contraception?&rdquo;  I quote:</P>
    <P>The minority position of Protestants in our State should rather dispose them to welcome a prohibition on contraception in order to preserve their numerical strength. They are heard to protest loudly and frequently against the decline in their number which they allege to be due mainly to the bringing up in the Catholic faith of the children of mixed marriages.  This, however, is to wilfully ignore the greater loss which may have been caused by the surreptitious use of contraceptives by Protestants in recent decades. Mixed marriages in those decades were comparatively infrequent. Moreover, all the children born of such marriages might not have been born if the Protestant partners had married other Protestants, because in the wholly Protestant marriage contraceptives might have been used.  Everybody but Protestant friends and acquaintances is well aware of the high proportion of Protestant couples without children or with one or two children where it can be reasonably assumed and is also known to be admitted that contraceptives have been used.  Protestants therefore cannot reasonably object to a prohibition on contraceptives if they are genuinely concerned to maintain their numbers.</P>
    <P>This is the kind of quasi-racism which has flooded into Deputies here and which I think has had some impact on Deputies and which certainly has given rise to some of the rather sick debates we have had here from some members of the Opposition.</P>
    <P>There is a medical point which should be made and in this connection <Col N="1094" /> I should like to quote one distinguished medical correspondent, Dr. David Nowlan.  It has been suggested by Deputy Oliver Flanagan and by other Deputies, notably Deputy Kitt, that involved in this are abortion and euthanasia.  I thought Deputy Kitt would finish up with divorce and the devil knows what else.  There has been a very strong suggestion in the Fianna Fáil approach by several of their utterly irresponsible Deputies that the introduction of contraceptives in this community will inevitably lead to abortion.  The reason why I raise this issue is that there was in the Catholic Hierarchy's statement last November an implicit follow-through in relation to abortion.  That statement did not deal exclusively with contraception but went on to infer grave concern about the allegedly growing incidence of abortion within these islands.  Here one must endorse the view of Dr. Nowlan, which I share, that contraception is a means to prevent abortion and can be, and I quote:</P>
    <P>most certainly a particular method by which any incidence of abortion could be reduced.</P>
    <P>I ask this House if it has the moral courage to face, or if it cares a damn about, the fact that last year, and I believe the year before, more than 2,000 Irish women went to Great Britain and had abortions there? Where is the concern of the Opposition to ensure that the appalling and tragic plight of a woman in the Republic who would decide to go to England to have an abortion&mdash;would it be fair to suggest that if contraception were available in the Republic she would not have to go&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I emphasise the point made by the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs, Deputy Cruise-O'Brien, this morning when he said&mdash; I hope I am not misquoting him&mdash; that the use of contraceptives was an integral part of preventive medicine.  I share that view.  I hope that we will take cognisance of that fact when we come to deal with the points made by many of the speakers.</P>
      <P>It would be remiss of me if I did not pay a well-deserved tribute to perhaps the most outstanding Irish woman in the attempt to convince this male-dominated Assembly and the other equally male-dominated Assembly, the Seanad, of the need for family planning legislation.  I refer &mdash;and I gather I cannot refer any further after that&mdash;to Senator Mary Robinson.  I have been aware of her efforts and it can be said fairly that she has spurred on the Government&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>&mdash;&mdash;and where faint hearts have tended to develop she, by pressing a particular view in the Seanad ensured that we in Dáil Éireann were not lax in our duty in this regard.  She made a distinguished contribution.  There are many other notable individuals in our community such as Rev. Doctor Good whose views as a fellow Corkman I share on many aspects of religion and family life.  I think that he also took the brunt of the commencement of this debate in our community.  These people deserve a measure of support and thanks from the whole community.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not, and it would be quite wrong for any Deputy to suggest that we should particularise in relation to the precise use and best form of contraception for any given family.  I have sufficient confidence in the medical expertise of Irish doctors who provide such medical assistance to accept their views on what is the best form of contraception for married couples or particular persons who wish to avail of contraceptives.  One argument is implicit in a great deal of the Fianna <Col N="1096" /> Fáil argument and in a great deal of the propoganda showered into this House by those who say this Bill must be rejected.  I refer particularly to the material we received&mdash;I am sure all Members are aware of it&mdash;entitled <i>Is Contraception The Answer?</i>, by a team of Catholic parents which went on to suggest in the document itself that there were available to Irish families various methods of family planning which could be used without any need to change the law, the rhythm method, the temperature method and the ovulation method.  I have also read carefully the Papal encyclical on these matters and a good deal of material issued officially by the Catholic Church.  I have read with even greater care the views of a fellow Corkman, Bishop Lucey and of gentlemen such as Senator Quinlan on, for example, the Billings method. I find in regard to their particular proposition regarding the so-called natural family planning methods of contraception that it is incredible that they would suggest that by virtue of using these methods there is an entirely Catholic, natural and one might even say, aesthetically acceptable and open form of contraception while they would run miles from the pill itself or any other form of contraceptive recommended by some medical advisers.</P>
    <P>Without going into details I would regard the Billings method from what I have read of it&mdash;and I have read some very odd versions of it&mdash;as unacceptable. I would not care to be married to somebody who would avail of a clatter of thermometers and sticky labels on calendars and so on and find that we would mark up our diaries with punctual regularity and then decide, perhaps, as husband and wife that we should have sexual intercourse. To me the particular methods that are advocated widely as being natural methods of contraception are distasteful, aesthetically unacceptable and puritanical.  I would like to have an explanation some time from a columnist&mdash;if I may name a particular columnist&mdash;such as Angela McNamara.  My interpretation of marriage and human sexual relations &mdash;perhaps I am all wrong and suffer <Col N="1097" /> from some particular hang-up&mdash;cannot be reconciled with such methods. That is not my understanding of what constitutes human love and mutual respect and regard as human decision in relation to contraception or family life or even human life itself.  Many of these methods advocated by many members of religious orders&mdash;and I have been assured by several priests that these are the methods that are quite natural and in accordance with the natural law&mdash;stem from a very unique, spiritual, clinical, cold, efficient interpretation of what should be, I presume, spontaneity in the human relationship between husband and wife.</P>
    <P>I find in the kind of material that has come through my letter box and which has received widespread publicity and is vigorously promoted by some Deputies and notably by some Senators, especially Senator Quinlan, that it is also a question of iron self-discipline in implementing the precise procedure imposed and I find it as repulsive as the very reading of the proposition contained therein.  Therefore this artificial spiritual distinction, this unique, classical, puritanical extension of what constitutes contraception in the eyes of some legislators and some advisers and so-called advisers on contraception is something which is certainly not based in many areas on human experience and is certainly open to question on grounds of medical efficiency and is, to say the least of it, codding some of the people some of the time but codding many all of the time in terms of contraception.</P>
    <P>I have ranged somewhat wide of this Bill and I return to the point I made at the beginning.  It would be a disastrous day for Ireland and above all for family life in Ireland and disastrous as regards giving advice and guidance to the young people if we in Dáil Éireann abdicated all responsibility and left it to the courts to decide.  I find it disingenuous, if not slightly ingenuous, on the part of Deputy Colley to suggest that on the grounds of public morality contraceptives should be distributed through the health boards.  He says this while <Col N="1098" /> accepting fully that Dáil Éireann should not interfere in the area of private morality.</P>
    <P>This is what one might call another magnificent interpretation of the principle of subsidiarity in moralistic thought and in theological exactitudes at which we have become brilliant in this country but we are so cold about it that one would wonder whether a child had ever been born to a married couple.  What is the precise distinction between public and private morality?  Deputy O'Malley says that it is not the function of Dáil Éireann to legislate for fornication and permissiveness while saying at the same time, that if people wish to fornicate privately or to be permissive Dáil Éireann has no function in the matter. Fianna Fáil have, for one set of circumstances, a pre-occupation with public morality which, in the most intimate sense becomes private morality so that we are left with a confusion of thought from them on this issue.</P>
    <P>The gyrations of which Fianna Fáil have been guilty during this debate will bring Dáil Éireann into disrepute if we do not face up to our responsibilities. Therefore we must restore the balance by providing a properly planned State subvented, voluntarily assisted, professional family planning service in our community.  We should do that within a broad social framework. We should amend substantially the existing legislation in this regard. By so doing Dáil Éireann will recover the self-respect and the regard which the people had for this House but which have been eroded during this debate.</P>
    <P>I thank God for the Supreme Court without whose judgment this House would never make up their minds on the issue before us.  I implore the Opposition to pay heed to that judgment and in particular to the summing up of Mr. Justice Walsh who said that the sexual life of a husband and wife is, of necessity and by its nature, an area of particular privacy, that if the husband and wife decide by the use of contraceptives to limit their family or to avoid having children, that is a matter peculiarly within the <Col N="1099" /> joint decision of the husband and wife and is one into which the State cannot intrude unless it is an intrusion which can be justified by the exigencies of the common good.  In conclusion, Mr. Justice Walsh said that the question of whether the use of contraceptives by married couples within their marriage is contrary to the moral code or to codes to which a couple profess to subscribe could not justify State intervention.  Similarly, he said, the fact that the use of contraceptives may offend against the moral code of the majority of our citizens would not, <i>per se,</i> justify an intervention by the State to prohibit their use within marriage and that the private morality of citizens would not justify intervention by the State unless and until the common good requires it.</P>
    <P>I ask Fianna Fáil, in conscience, to accept the validity of the assertion made by Mr. Justice Walsh in his judgment.  I ask them at this late stage to indicate to the Minister&mdash;they can do this either through their spokesman on Justice or their spokesman on Health&mdash;that they are willing to reconsider this critical area of social family life in our community.  Let them not make of this issue a spurious political football.  That is what they have done during the course of this debate.  If there are defects in the Bill, we can meet on them.  The Minister is anxious to ensure that a fair democratic and reasonable piece of legislation goes through this House.</P>
    <P>I will conclude, not on any note of threat or of recrimination against Fianna Fáil, by saying that if, for narrow, party political advantage, they decide to oppose this legislation or if they do so solely for the transient benefit of saying: &ldquo;We beat the Government; were we not great?&rdquo;, they must bear the consequences of their action.  In the Seanad the Leader of the Fianna Fáil Party there, Senator Lenihan, is on record as having said that Fianna Fáil would view any measures introduced by the Government in this regard in a constructive, sympathetic, sensitive and compassionate manner.  At a Fianna Fáil Ard-Fheis <Col N="1100" /> the Leader of the party, Deputy Lynch, said that contraception was a matter of personal private morality and that his party would not be found wanting on the matter.</P>
    <P>Are the Opposition implementing the pledge given in the Seanad by the leader of their group there?  Are they honouring the views of the Leader of their party on this matter?  Are they prepared to honour the views of the last Minister for Health, who now holds an exalted position in this country and who favoured a change in the legislation when he was Minister for Health?  Are they prepared to discuss these matters in an objective and calm way?  Should they fail to do so they will ensure that this country will have a period of human distress and human frustration because of the lack of what might be called an essential piece of preventative medicine in our community.  They will ensure also that the status of Dáil Éireann will be diminished forever in the eyes of the community in the Republic and will be diminished particularly in the eyes of those in Northern Ireland who are noting carefully the comments made during the course of this debate.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M.E. Dockrell</NameTxt>
      <P>It is with a good deal of what I might call distress that I enter into this debate.  I say this because there are so many aspects of this issue that I should like to put before the House and before the people.  Yet I feel that I am a very inadequate vessel to put forward these views.  I speak here as an Irishman, a Member of this House, as we all do.  In a wider sense, outside the House, I speak as a member of a religious minority, as a Protestant.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have no authority to speak as a Protestant, but I am one and my views are naturally coloured in that way.  So I should like in the course of this speech to put forward some Protestant views.  I am not authorised to do so.  I do so only in a private way.  If in the course of trying to interpret views which are held by all the Members of this House and views which are held by Protestants, I fail through lack of precise words, I hope the House will give me its forgiveness <Col N="1101" /> and sympathy.  I want to put certain things in an entirely non-controversial way.</P>
    <P>I will start by talking about the Bill.  The Minister is to be congratulated on bringing such a Bill to the House.  We often say that here but we do not always mean it precisely.  I offer the Minister my very sincere congratulations for his courage in bringing in this Bill.  I do not entirely agree with all of the Bill.  Nobody does.  Even the Minister himself does not agree with every aspect of the Bill.  The fact that there are such divergent views held in the country, divergent views held in our party, divergent views held in this House is the reason why this Bill is difficult to speak on and why this subject is still more difficult to legislate on, but the Minister has courageously put his political future at risk in doing this and has put to some extent the party's political future at risk, because this is a great Catholic country.  By that I mean that while Ireland is not a great power, nevertheless she is a great Catholic country.  Many Catholic views have held, and do still hold, that this is a wrong thing that we are attempting to do in this House.  There are other equally Catholic views which hold the exact opposite.  I do not want to go into that.</P>
    <P>I want to start off by saying that this is a brave effort by the Minister and a brave effort by the party.  I am proud that they have taken their courage in both hands because although we could not in all conscience leave the position as it is at the moment, namely, with the position undecided with regard to the sale of contraceptives, nevertheless we could, as a Government and as a party have carried on as things are and could have hidden our heads in the sand.  The Minister and the Cabinet did not do that and as a result they have left themselves open, and knowingly left themselves open, to what has happened from the other side.  I am sincerely sorry that Fianna Fáil did not take their courage in their hands and say that this is something which is above politics.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1102" /> This is a matter which is in that strange realm of part public and part private morality but one in which the Government would have to move to legalise and clear up the position which has arisen from the McGee case and the interpretation put on it by the Supreme Court.  That is primarily why we are debating this subject here in Dáil Éireann.  I heard, I think it was Deputy Flanagan, asking almost with a sense of horror, who would have thought five years ago that a Bill such as this could be introduced into this House.</P>
    <P>One would think that the Bill was introduced because various Members of the House wished to legalise or render easy forms of sexual intercourse. That of course is not the reason at all.  The Bill has arisen not because public or private morality in this country has altered in any way but because the interpretation of the Constitution has altered and because our laws must be altered to conform with that or we have to scrap our Constitution.  God knows how that could be done.  I am not a constitutional lawyer and I would hate to see it attempted especially now when in this world so much has been scrapped.  That is part of the reason horror arises in the minds of certain sincere people on both sides of this House.  They think of this wave of madness which has swept over the whole world, and not only in the forms of human behaviour, sexual behaviour.  This madness is not sweeping over the world as a result of contraception. It is because human beings are challenging those views of the past, those actions of the past.  Many of us stand aghast at that sort of thing.</P>
    <P>This Bill is not something to bring about the permissive society in a more easy fashion.  It is not to allow sexual behaviour to alter in any way.  No evil magic wand will wave over this country as a result of there being free sale of contraceptives.  None of us wants to see that being done but we do want to see family planning carried out in a way that it never has been carried out here.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1103" /> This will happen in this country even if this Bill is not passed.  Things will never be the same again as a result of the Bill the Minister for Justice has brought into this House.  I do not see what this Bill has to do with abortion because in my view the availability of contraceptives will prevent the need for abortion.  Abortion is a terrible and horrible thing but preventative measures do not constitute abortion.  This is recognised by all churches as not being an abortive measure but the point at which preventativeness ends and abortion begins varies amongst theologians and this has led to terrible results and suffering among human beings.</P>
    <P>We have been accused of not being sympathetic in this House in the earlier stages of this debate and of not having compassion.  That was true enough of the earlier stages but the people outside who criticised the way the Opposition spoke and described them as being like school boys let out of school should realise that this was something which Dáil Éireann never talked about in this fashion before. They could quite realise the vast field of human agony, suffering and compassion which may be covered in this Bill.  Some did and touched on it but as men they shied away from the profundities. Now they have begun to come out.</P>
    <P>We often hear in this country of large families.  A large family is a beautiful thing and it is wonderful to see a proud father and mother surrounded by healthy and happy children but that does not always happen. What we do not see and what we turn our faces away from is the mother who has too many children too fast and who has insufficient money and poor housing to rear these children. Successive political parties have striven manfully to alter the terrible poverty we have had in this country and they are still working towards the elimination of that poverty.  Governments have built houses to help people with large families and they have also done their utmost to help itinerants by establishing settlements.  However, we have all shied away from the need <Col N="1104" /> to provide our married people with the objects, be they pills or artificial methods, of contraception.</P>
    <P>Because we have shied away from that into small council houses and itinerant settlements have come, almost yearly, a baby.  Sometimes they were unwanted babies and very often the parents had insufficient money to pay for the food for their children. This Bill is a step towards helping certain people, especially certain women, to drag themselves out of the mire of too many children and not enough money with which to rear them.  It is not always a question of money because, as other speakers have mentioned, it can be a question of mental health and nervous health.</P>
    <P>I cannot understand how we with our great love of liberty and the liberty of the individual refuse to certain people the right to plan the size of their own family.  I am aware that some Members on both sides of the House have spoken as if the one effect of this Bill will be to increase permissiveness.  &ldquo;Permissiveness&rdquo; is a foolish word to use in this regard and I will substitute with the word &ldquo;lasciviousness&rdquo;.  They speak as if all our teenagers will quite suddenly lose all the natural instincts they have towards decent behaviour because of the Bill.  As human beings, we have a lot of instincts but life would be impossible if in civilisation and in civilised communities we did not keep our cool.  There are people who when they see something attractive in a shop and because they do not have sufficient money to buy it break the shop window and steal the article but there are others who can wait until they have saved up enough money to buy that article.  Some people do the same in the realms of human behaviour and I do not think that the fact that individuals can obtain contraceptive devices will necessarily make them more inclined to misbehave themselves.</P>
    <P>Some people are born optimists and some people are born pessimists. There are some individuals who will look at a cup and say it is half empty while others will look at it and say it <Col N="1105" /> is half full.  I am an optimist.  I like to look at the half full side of life. It is possible to look at aspects of this Bill and say: &ldquo;You are trusting human beings to behave.  You know statistically that all of them will not.&rdquo; I think more of them will behave themselves than the pessimists think. Certainly married people will be given what the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs referred to today as an arm of medicine.  That is what contraceptives should be.</P>
    <P>I have a great admiration and respect for the Family Planning Association, especially for the noble woman who brought the Bill into the House upstairs, Senator Mary Robinson.  She is a woman we can be proud of, a happily married woman with children of her own.  She brought in a Bill and we know what happened to it.  The family planning people are of that calibre.  I was sorry to read in one of the newspapers that the secretary of that association does not like this Bill.  I do not like the Bill and I do not think the Minister is in love with it but it is a great step forward.  I say from here to the Family Planning Association that they should throw their weight behind this Bill and let us try to amend the Bill to suit the various views which would emerge on Committee Stage.  It is a beginning.  I am a great believer in taking what you can get legislatively and working on from that.  The Adoption Act started out as a much more restrictive measure than it is now.  It has been widened down through the years.  I believe this Bill, if it is passed, as I hope it will be passed, will be widened and strengthened, not only in Committee but in the years to come.</P>
    <P>I am sorry that Fianna Fáil have taken up the attitude they have taken on this Bill.  I think they, like ourselves, have some people in favour of it and some not in favour of it, which reflects the view of the country, but we are people here in this assembly who are not necessarily supposed slavishly to follow various views which are put to us by and through groups, sometimes referred to as pressure groups.  It is our business as Deputies to filter those views which come from pressure <Col N="1106" /> groups and decide ourselves whether they are wise or foolish views and whether they are in the national interest or not.  I am sorry Fianna Fáil did not give that chance.  I do not like speaking narrow party politics but I do think that they have played party politics with this Bill.  It is with the lives of women they have played it and I am sorry.  I hope I am wrong in that and that the Bill will be passed.</P>
    <P>One of the speakers from our own side, Deputy Flanagan, referred to this as being based on Mrs. McGee's health.  It is not based on Mrs. McGee's health at all.  It is based on the interpretation of the Constitution as laid down by the Supreme Court. It is based on a legal decision and what we believe to be human justice to our adult population.  I think we are very wrong if we think we cannot trust our teenagers and their parents to use this newer power wisely and in the human interest and, indeed, in the national interest.  This Bill should be passed on the basis of human justice or what used to be called the rights of man although, indeed, it is more the rights of woman.  It has been too much of the rights of man in the past and not enough of the rights of woman, who had to find the food to cook, and look after the children. They should be the prime deciders on the spacing and the number of the family.  This will give people that chance and it is not opening the door to any form of abortion or to any wider sexual permissiveness.</P>
    <P>I hope the Deputies will pass the Bill.  I am sorry I did not make a more moving, wider speech on this.  I wanted to do it partly because I am one of the very few people who belong to the minority Protestant religion here.  I do not think, as such, we are terribly interested in it in the sense that Catholics must be because we do not think it is any sin.  We do not like it very much.  Our church does not encourage it but it has not forbidden it and it thinks, on balance, that greater good would ensue to the Irish people as a whole.  It is in that spirit that I support the Bill and I hope it will be in that spirit that it will be passed by this House.</P>

      <P>It is not my intention to take up the time of the House on this issue.  My views on the subject are well known to all.  Since 1966 I have been a firm advocate of the right to family planning and I have been much maligned for it.  In 1968, when I raised the matter in the Dáil by way of a parliamentary question, the Government thought I was guilty of a heinous crime in mentioning the matter.  I was also associated with a Private Bill to have legalised family planning in Ireland.  I did so originally as a doctor as I saw the medical need for this in so many cases.  I have changed my views since as I now consider it a basic human right and for this reason I have grave reservations about the present Bill.</P>
      <P>I am of the opinion that it will hold us up to ridicule and will not be workable. I firmly believe it will be challenged in the courts and we may find ourselves in a very short time confronted with the same problem in the House unless there are radical amendments to the Bill.  That is why I have grave reservations about voting for the measure.  I can understand people who in conscience are sincerely opposed to it because it will be unworkable. I have the greatest admiration and respect for the Minister for Justice.  I think he is a very good and humane man and I think he means the best but the Bill, as drafted, holds us all up to ridicule and makes a mockery of the whole issue.</P>
      <P>It is with these grave reservations that I support the Bill and then only if I am assured that the amendments which I and many others like me will propose are accepted to make this a workable Bill.  I am mainly concerned about the basic human rights issue here.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In 1966 at the United Nations conference in Teheran the people of Ireland signed the document establishing the right to family planning and we, with the Vatican, subscribed our names to the document prepared by the United Nations.  I cannot understand because of this the views of the Opposition who were in Government when this was declared.  I <Col N="1108" /> can understand people who by virtue of their conscience are somewhat afraid of the issue.  The biggest problem is that we have not had enough healthy discussion on the subject of contraception.  The word has been taboo in this country for too long.</P>
    <P>I understand the fears of the pressure groups who sent us voluminous letters and petitions.  The other day I received a petition with 220 signatures on it.  The people concerned were afraid that if contraception was legalised it would open the floodgates to permissiveness.  We must understand this.  I have to be tolerant and I must accept the other person's point of view.  We should make clear that this is not a question of wanting everyone to practise contraception.  The onus is on us as legislators to make this clear.  We ought to have free and frank discussion on it and let the people know that it is only a human right, giving the right to people if they feel like it, to married couples, if they want to space their families, to obtain contraceptives.</P>
    <P>I accept there are other methods of family planning and I do not decry them or the organisations who put forward these methods as possible alternatives.  The Billings method has its advantages.  I do not agree with people who ridicule these methods. They are aesthetic in their own way. They have their advantages.  I say to the people who wish to follow those methods and to practise them &ldquo;Yes&rdquo; but there are people not educated enough to understand the ramifications and the complications of these methods.  I believe we should have the normal contraceptive means available for these people.  This should be available as of right and it should be made known that we are not asking everybody to practise contraception.</P>
    <P>We all talk about human rights and decry the conditions in the North where people are denied their basic human rights.  We have not the right to speak as we do because we are hypocrites if we start talking about denial of rights in Northern Ireland when we refuse to grant the right to people here to practise contraception <Col N="1109" /> if they wish.  It is ironical that when this Bill was presented in the Dáil for a Second Reading in the Seanad they were discussing the Northern Ireland situation and the problems up there. I do not say that the passage of this Bill will bring about unity but we should say to the people in the North that we will ensure that the people in this country, minority and majority, have basic human rights such as contraception. We can say to them that they cannot point the accusing finger at us that we are Rome ridden, a Catholic Church ridden State.  It is not the law of the Catholic Church that should predominate in this country and we should not be bound by the laws of one church.  We have Protestant and other churches here and we should not ask that the law of one church be imposed on the entire people of this country.</P>
    <P>We might just as readily say it is illegal not to attend Mass on Sunday. We cannot legislate on the rules of one church.  It would be wrong to do so.  Unfortunately, we have been doing this for too long in this country.  It would be a major step forward if we were to have a Bill passed in this House on contraception to eliminate another area where there has been discrimination for too long.  We cannot legislate on private morals and we should not try to.  Those who have fears in this regard can only depend on the proper upbringing of their children to feel confident that they will do their best as they grow up.  You cannot say you will stop alcoholism by closing down every public house.  It would be ludicrous to talk like that. We must hope that we will rear our children properly and have a proper community.</P>
    <P>We have not made any attempt to educate the people in regard to exactly what is required and what we are endeavouring to do as legislators. I like the idea in this House&mdash;it is very rare&mdash;of having a free vote.  I hope it will be the forerunner of many more such votes where we will not be bound slavishly by party legislation and party rules.  We have rarely had a free vote in this House and I <Col N="1110" /> welcome it in the present instance very much.</P>
    <P>I would say to those who have fears that contraception will lead to abortion that there is no rationale behind that suggestion.  If I could be persuaded as a medical doctor that it would, I would be prepared to listen. It is illogical to talk in terms of contraception leading to abortion. There is no logic behind that argument. Those who have propounded it have sought only to deceive and confuse the public.  From all the experience, contraception cannot and does not lead to abortion.</P>
    <P>It is being said that it will open the floodgates and that once contraception starts abortion begins.  I am very opposed to abortion.  It is anathema to me.  I would not and could not support any legislation that would legalise abortion.  Under no circumstances would I do so.  I would walk out of the House before I would be persuaded to support abortion.  Therefore I can speak with absolute conviction when I say that a Bill legalising contraception, and contraception <i>per se</i>, will not and cannot lead to abortion.  That argument is completely illogical.</P>
    <P>I have expressed reservations about this Bill because, in my opinion, it will be unworkable and hold the law up to ridicule.  Unless it is amended very significantly, it will be challenged in the courts and we will find ourselves endeavouring to enact new legislation. I have made my views clear that a Bill dealing with contraception should be passed in this House.  I cannot accept that the sale of contraceptives through chemists' shops or, where they are not available, through other means, is workable.  A proper family planning service is needed here.  It should be operated under the control and supervision of our health boards.</P>
    <P>We should have family planning clinics under the control of the health boards as part of the national health service.  This would ensure that family planning, and not just contraceptive devices, and education and instruction in all forms of family planning methods were available to all those who sought them.  This could be done <Col N="1111" /> very readily by the health boards.  We should make it a statutory obligation on the health boards to provide them.</P>
    <P>In outlying areas as part of the normal preventive service operated by the health boards, we could have family planning services with mobile clinics in the same way as we provide clinics for child welfare and mother welfare.  This could be part of the entire health service.  This would be ideal.  It would ensure that there would be no abuse because anyone seeking contraceptive devices would go into a clinic to discuss family planning methods, education in family planning, which I maintain is badly needed, and full information on the type of family planning service which would be available. I think that would be best suited to our country and, in this way, we could be guaranteed that there would be no abuse of the system.  It would be under the control of specialised people, social workers, medical doctors, and others.  This is the way in which we could organise a proper family planning service.</P>
    <P>I do not accept all the provisions in the Bill.  I was very disappointed when I saw the Bill and I still am.  I will try as far as I can to have it amended. It will be a difficult task.  I have grave reservations about it.  The only thing in its favour is that it is an attempt in this country, which has been so reactionary and so conservative, to introduce family planning legislation. For that reason only I feel compelled to support it.  I would not vote for the Bill on its merits; far from it.</P>
    <P>I would not ridicule the Opposition for their stance.  Some of them are very seriously and very sincerely opposed to contraceptive measures and methods. I would not for one minute attack them, because anyone who is conscientiously opposed to contraception is entitled to be opposed to it.  I do not think this should be a party political issue.  We should not discuss it as such. I would make this earnest appeal to them.  It is not their own conscience which is at issue here.  This might be borne in the mind by Members of the Opposition in considering this Bill. This is a question of rights for other <Col N="1112" /> people, and not for them, or how they feel about contraception.  That is not the issue.  I respect their right to oppose the Bill, those who are opposing it on genuine grounds.  If I felt it was not for the good of the community I would oppose any legislation.  Irrespective of how the party voted, I would judge it by how I felt the people would be affected.</P>
    <P>What is happening here is being watched by the people in the North, in Britain and in other parts of Europe. This is a very serious matter.  It is wonderful that we have had this debate and that we have had people's views on it.  If the Bill is defeated it is not a calamity.  It is not a disaster.  It may have enlightened many people and I will not be pessimistic if it is defeated. If it is, we should try again.  We should make a greater effort to enlighten the public on what is at stake and explain to them that we are not opening the floodgates to permissiveness, that we are granting people the right to family planning.  I do not think we should discriminate between single and married people.  It is a matter for their own conscience.  It is their own decision. The law as it stands is wrong and I have thought that for a number of years.</P>
    <P>I admire the Minister for Industry and Commerce who admitted openly in the Dáil that he was breaking the law.  It is bad for the country and the people that they were breaking the law.  Many obstacles were put in the way of members of family planning clinics who were seriously and sincerely trying to help people who had no other place to get help.  They carried out a wonderful task.  Every attempt was made to obstruct them in their work. I admire them for their efforts.  They brought satisfaction and relief to families and to couples who had problems.  They performed a wonderful duty.  I hope that they will continue their two clinics in Dublin and I would like to see them extended throughout the country.  I would like to think that no legislation passed here would make it difficult for them to continue doing this work.</P>
    <P>I am sorry that there was not consultation <Col N="1113" /> with the members of the family planning clinics, the people who have been trying to ensure this basic human right, as to the best means of bringing in legislation which would be acceptable to all and which would ensure that this basic human right would be available.  I am afraid the Bill was brought in without enough consultation.  This was a great pity.  I am sorry there was not consultation with the Opposition on the Bill.  I think it would have been a good idea.  The Leader of the Opposition wanted to see a Bill on contraception passed in this House, and a little consultation with him might have produced the required piece of legislation. It is to be deplored that this consultation did not take place, to my knowledge anyway.  If I remember rightly, it was the Leader of the Opposition who realised the necessity to have contraception legislation brought in and I think he had it in mind to do this.  A few years ago legislation of this kind could not be discussed.  It is not normal, perhaps, to consult the Opposition in regard to legislation but this was a unique situation that demanded that consultation take place so that there could have been agreement on the introduction of an acceptable piece of legislation.</P>
    <P>I would like to hear assurances from the Minister about accepting amendments that will ensure that this legislation will be workable and will not create problems for the future.  I have great reservations about it at the present time, and, perhaps, the Minister in the short time remaining to him would give those assurances.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McDonald</NameTxt>
      <P>I merely want to make a short intervention to explain my vote, which is common practice in another forum in which I have the honour to sit.  I cannot recall any piece of legislation that has evoked so much controversy and misunderstanding. Some people say: &ldquo;You have no mandate from me to vote for this Bill which will allow the sale of contraceptives in our country.&rdquo; These good-intentioned people must surely realise that it is not in contravention of any of our laws to possess and distribute contraceptives in Ireland today.</P>
      <P>I intend to support the Government to put through the strongest possible legislation to control the sale and distribution of family planning aids and devices, because to leave the matter as at present whereby anyone, young or old, married or single, can have whatever they desire in this line mailed to them from outside the Republic, is not in the best interest of the country, when seen from the point of view of those who cherish and wish to conserve all that is good in our country and wish to have our families reared and educated in the same healthy and Christian environment that we ourselves were born into.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This Bill is a step in the right direction. It does not seek to open any floodgates but merely to allow freedom of choice among married couples. Section 2 prohibits the importation and sale of contraceptives except under licence.  Section 4 prohibits the manufacture of contraceptives, again <Col N="1115" /> except under licence.  Section 5 prohibits the purchase of contraceptives by unmarried persons.  Section 6 prohibits the display of contraceptives for sale, and so on right through the Bill.  I believe this Bill is an honest attempt to control and improve the present situation.</P>
    <P>To my mind the Bill does not go far enough, but I have the utmost faith in my fellow countrymen, and I do not think that the mere fact that contraceptives are on sale under strict control will turn the whole of our population into a licentious or permissive society.  Irish youth today enjoy better educational opportunities than ever before in our history. Teachers, both clerical and lay attend and graduate from special courses in catechetics, and I believe that our young people are benefiting from the new and improved methods of teaching Christian doctrine in our schools. This must surely mean that our people can be relied upon to follow the dictates of their conscience&mdash;their better informed conscience, I would submit, from now on.</P>
    <P>We must distinguish between the morality of contraception and legalising access to it.  These are distinct questions, but it is naive to think that because they are distinct questions they are unrelated.  I am supporting this Bill which seeks to control the sale of contraceptives, but I want to stress that I am not the keeper of my neighbour's conscience.  I do not set myself up as a judge of my neighbour's actions.  I have but my own soul to save and my trust is in the God of compassion and love.</P>
    <P>Married people today live in a tense, pressurised, changing world. They live in a sexually seductive world in which the expression and experience of mutal love relieve the loneliness and the longing that characterise modern living.  By their loving sexuality religion enters their shared lives, since love, to my mind, is the essence of Christianity.  Just because from now on contraceptives will be on sale in some places under strict control does not mean, as has been suggested by some speakers, that anyone <Col N="1116" /> will be obliged to use or purchase them or have anything to do with them.  If the Bill can be interpreted as liberalising the law, it should be seen primarily as a recognition of the dignity of the individual and a step towards a more open, honest and mature society.</P>
    <P>I should like to take this opportunity of expressing my thanks to the very many people&mdash;most of them outside my constituency&mdash;who bothered to mail me their views either for or against this Bill.  I hope to get around to acknowledging their efforts and I certainly appreciate their interest.</P>
    <P>It is noteworthy that tonight there is an unusually large number of young people in the public gallery.  Incidentally, when we were looking for pairs last night in the European Parliament&mdash;some very important controversial company law is before that Assembly at the moment&mdash;people did not take us seriously when we told them we were being recalled to vote on an issue relating to contraceptives. We should not bury our heads in the sand.  We should be proud of the educational advances we have made. Our people are now much better equipped from the point of view of education and I have every confidence in their ability to make up their own minds.  I also believe there are people who will benefit from and find solace in this legislation.  I hope the Bill will get a speedy passage.  We should not deny people who are competent to make up their own minds and satisfy their own consciences the use of contraceptives, particularly when their use in designed to ensure economic stability in the home and an enriched family life.  I shall vote for the Bill. I hope the Bill will be passed and that many Irish mothers will, as a result of this legislation, be saved a great deal of worry and hardship.</P>

      <P>No Deputy on this side of the House has spoken on this very controversial issue since 6.45 p.m. Deputy Ruairí Brugha was the last speaker on these benches.  The object was to enable the Minister to have sufficient time to conclude the debate. If there are Deputies on the Government benches who had problems of conscience or who wanted to make explanations to their constituents, we were providing them with an opportunity to do this.</P>
      <P>It is quite obvious now that the Government have no intention of concluding this debate tonight and facing the position debated <i>ad nauseam</i> in this Chamber.  Great emphasis has been laid on the free vote.  Deputies on the Government benches have been clapping their fellow-travellers on the back, congratulating them on this free vote and suggesting that legislation would be improved if the House had more free votes.  In actual fact&mdash;we are all aware of the activity of the Whips during the day&mdash;the Government decided not to conclude the debate tonight because of the number of waverers in the Government back benches and because there is a prospect that they might succeed in the application of the Whip before the vote is finally taken.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Everybody knows from the public Press, which has gone out of its way to ridicule those who have expressed opposition of this Bill, with the willing assistance of both radio and television, that a great effort culminating in this Bill has been made over the last ten years to turn this country into a <Col N="1118" /> completely permissive State.  I do not normally agree with Deputy O. J. Flanagan, my political colleague in Laois-Offaly; I do not see myself agreeing with him in the future and I certainly will not go so far as he did today in pontificating on certain aspects of the moral law, but I am aware of the fact as a result of Press reports of various Government-sponsored meetings over the last few months that there were at least ten Government Deputies who, in a free vote situation, and I stress the word &ldquo;free&rdquo;&mdash;&mdash;</P>

The Minister for Posts and Telegraphs said that this discussion had been going on for the past ten years.  This Bill is here today as a result of lobbying by liberals over the past ten years. There is no doubt that the Deputies today and on the previous occasion who made their honest and conscious contributions to this debate will be castigated in the Press tomorrow and on radio because they are the &ldquo;not with it&rdquo; people.

    <P>Our legislation was described by a number of speakers as leading to the situation where our country was a laughing-stock all over Europe.  If that <Col N="1123" /> is so, behind that laughter, the impression that we are not &ldquo;with it&rdquo;, that we are antiquated and ruled from Rome, is the castigation that the ordinary, God-fearing Irishman gets from the liberals and the scribes who are so fond of being up-to-date and permissive.  They are endeavouring to introduce into this country the same type of permissiveness that even people on the Government side have condemned.</P>
    <P>It is not my intention at this stage to contribute to the debate.

    <Speaker pid="PatrickJLalor" hpid="Mr. Lalor Mr. Lalor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lalor</NameTxt>
      <P>A number of Deputies, including myself, have referred to the fact that they received numerous letters from pressure groups and individuals. It was alleged that a number of the letters were the result of a kind of sponsorship and this I accept.  These people wrote to us and said we had no mandate; they were the people who were against the Bill.  Quite frankly, I rebelled against letters which stated I did not have a mandate.  The speakers in favour of the Bill seem to spend most of their time talking about this <Col N="1124" /> inspired letterwriting, castigating and reflecting on those who wrote them.  On the other hand, there are the insidious pressure groups, sponsored mainly by the Press, radio and television.  I am convinced that the writing of the liberals in the past ten years has been directed towards achieving the permissiveness that I and many others are worried about.</P>
      <P>One of the reasons we are opposing the Bill is because of its blatant inadequacies in dealing with the matter.  The intention of the Bill is to make contraceptives available to married couples and make it illegal for others to obtain them, but everyone who has spoken in favour of the Bill has said that contraceptives have been freely available for years.  The inadequacy of the legislation was admitted by a number of speakers on the Government side.  Deputy Thornley said he could find many faults with the Bill but that he was willing to buy it for the moment.  He admitted it lent itself to shocking abuse.  In view of the fact that so many people on the Government side took time to quote the Leader of this party and the Leader of our party in the Seanad, to use their speeches&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>It was obvious that my colleague from Laois-Offaly, Deputy McDonald, had just arrived back from Europe because he said this Bill sought strictly to control the sale of contraceptives.  Had the Deputy been in this House he would have heard most of the supporters of the Bill admit that it would not strictly control their sale and that it was just a pious wish.  While the law states that contraceptives may be sold only to married couples, it was admitted openly that it was a law which could not be strictly enforced.  Then we had the unfortunate situation where, apparently, the Minister for Industry and Commerce took pride in breaking the law.  Naturally, it would be understandable that the ordinary John Citizen would take his example from such a renowned Minister of State.</P>
      <P>I found one thing most disgusting arising from the contribution made by the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs who introduced a subject which apparently is not quite near and dear to his heart&mdash;the question of reunification&mdash;when he said that if this Bill was defeated the repercussions on the North would be tragic.  I have my own ideas about the Loyalists and the opposition to reunification from the North of Ireland.  But the one thing I do not accept, and the one thing that the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs will not sell to me, in any case, is that the Loyalist people of the North can be bought by contraceptives. I have more respect for them than that.</P>

    <Title>Adjournment Debate: Kerry Airport Company.</Title>
    <Speaker pid="JohnOLeary1965" hpid="Mr. J. O'Leary Mr. J. O'Leary">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>Today I raised the question of the financing of the Kerry County Airport Company and asked the Minister for Finance to state the present position concerning the application by the company for further financial aid and for the payment of the balance of a grant to enable the company to clear outstanding debts and whether he had regard to the <Col N="1130" /> importance of the airport in the future development of the county.  The Minister in reply stated that grants totalling £71,000 from the special regional development fund had been made towards the cost of establishing the airport at Farranfore and that the conditions attached to the grant were that the company would meet all operating costs from its own resources. I know that the grants were channelled through the Department of Transport and Power and that the conditions were accepted by the company. I know also that some of the grants are still payable to the company.</P>
      <P>The company sought a further grant of £33,000 to clear debts which have built up as a result of the capital investment in the project and not as a result of operating losses, as stated by the Minister in his reply.  He said that circumstances do not justify waiving the condition accepted by the company that a grant would not be sought to cover such losses.  I now propose to submit to the Minister the circumstances in which it appears clear to me the Minister should waive the conditions originally accepted by the company and in which a further grant should be paid to the company to enable it to clear off outstanding debts because the operations of the company, apart from paying off the interest on the capital and on the loans, are certainly run on a profit basis.</P>
      <P>The Minister stated in reply to supplementary questions that the affairs of the company caused concern to the auditors as far back as 1971 and also said that the operating losses arose from mismanagement of the company's affairs.  The 1972 figures showed an operating loss of over £6,000, but it appeared from his replies today that he had not got the accounts for 1973, which I understand are available.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>That is my information from the company.  If the Minister says he has not got them, I accept it.</P>
      <P>The Minister stated that the annual general meeting of the company in 1972 was reported at length in the local newspapers and the secretary of the company was reported as saying that when he took up duty he discovered that the affairs of the company were being conducted in a very poor and improper way.  I do not agree that the background of the losses which the company is now seeking to recoup is the cause of the problem. The debt is in respect of interest on loans raised for capital purposes in the initial stages and in the initial development of the airport at Farranfore. The development costs exceeded by far the original estimate. The original project was offered on the basis of its being a viable proposition which would not require continuing State aid, but this was mainly on the assumption that the ultimate cost would be in or around the estimated cost and I would ask the Minister to have another look at the situation from this point of view.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I want to point out to the Minister the steps that have been taken by the company to correct the situation which appears to have existed in 1971. In 1972, as the Minister pointed out today, there was a loss of over £6,000. This was mainly due to the servicing of the loan of approximately £33,000. In 1973, the audited figures, I am told, show a loss of £2,702, after paying interest rate charges on loans amounting to £3,401.  In other words, if you deduct the interest charges on the loans, the operating profit would be in effect approximately £700.  The total expenditure in 1973 was £4,978; interest charges amounted to £3,401; maintenance cost was approximately £165; depreciation accounted for about £432; and the balance was made up mainly of miscellaneous expenses, such as rates, ESB charges, heating and telephone expenses.  I believe that if the company did not owe this money to the bank and to a finance <Col N="1132" /> company, they would not have a loss but would have shown a profit of £700 for 1973.  I understand as well that the projection for 1974 shows an increase in gross revenue from £2,200 in 1973 to £3,500 in 1974.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Can the Deputy say why none of these figures was given to the Department of Finance before now?</P>
    </Speaker>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>Did the Minister when making his decision ask for the figures for 1973 and the projection for 1974?  He should have done so.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Of course, and they should have been furnished, but they have not been.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnOLeary1965" hpid="Mr. J. O'Leary Mr. J. O'Leary">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>There would be a profit of at least £2,000, were it not for the interest on the loans which now runs at approximately £4,300 per annum or £12 per day or 1p per minute, if we go into it as close as that.  We have reached a stage when landing traffic is increasing and is likely to increase further, particularly when we get the two landing strips in Kerry, one in Ballyferriter and one in Ballinskelligs which were recently announced.</P>
      <P>Is the Minister aware that the initial expenditure came to £126,000 whereas the investment by way of grant and loan came to only £100,000? This is really the kernel of the problem. I understand that the loans outstanding at the moment are mainly in respect of something more than £10,000 due to a local bank and between £17,000 and £18,000 due to a finance company.  One was obtained in 1970 as a bridging loan pending the floating of a rights issue which was not successful.  In 1972 another loan was raised pending the payment of a State grant, all of which has still not been paid.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If the company were not in debt <Col N="1133" /> they would not have had an operational loss.  The company have taken steps to correct the position which occurred in 1970-71.  They let some of the property, changed the method of running the bar by letting it and accepting the highest tender, and they now intend to let some of the property for the purpose of advertising.  I am surprised the Minister has not yet requested or received the 1973 figures.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="JohnOLeary1965" hpid="Mr. J. O'Leary Mr. J. O'Leary">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>The position is that the Minister and the Government must decide whether this airport is vital for the development of Kerry by reason of its location.  Recently one firm expressed interest in using the airport extensively.  I believe the Minister has an obligation to ensure that the airport is kept open while at the same time&mdash;I agree entirely with him on this&mdash;not enabling anybody who should not benefit from it to do so.  I honestly submit that the abuses mentioned in the auditor's report for 1970 and 1971 have been completely eliminated. It would cost more than £250,000 to acquire and develop the lands at Farranfore.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The annual general meeting of the company will be held shortly to decide whether the company should be wound up.  The property may well be left lying idle and derelict for years because it would be very difficult to get even speculators to put up the above mentioned sum to acquire this property for which a substantial State grant was allocated and most of it paid.  I do not want to make a political football out of this airport or to accuse the Government of not being anxious to help out in this problem in respect of which there has been substantial State investment.  I submit, however, that the Minister should reconsider the application for a final grant of £33,000 which would be justified by reason of this capital asset in Kerry, bearing in mind what it <Col N="1134" /> would cost to acquire the land nowadays and to construct the buildings, and so forth.</P>
    <P>I ask the Minister earnestly to discuss the matter with the Kerry County Development Team and with the managing director and the secretary of the company with a view to arriving at a favourable decision as a matter of urgency before the annual general meeting of the company.  I can assure the Minister that this project was thoroughly investigated by the Kerry County Development Team and by the people of Kerry before it was undertaken. The last Government readily gave support to the project by way of grant.  As I have said, I do not want to make any political capital out of it and I again earnestly appeal to the Minister to seek up-to-date information from the company.</P>

      <P>There has been a great deal of genuine public unrest recently about public representatives using their public positions in order to make overtures and representations and exert influence on behalf of themselves or their friends or partners or contacts in business or commerce, and I think it is regrettable indeed that Deputy O'Leary, before he raised this matter in this House or while he was talking tonight, did not declare his own interest in this matter.

      <P>The Deputy has now declared his interest.  That is not the only interest of Deputy O'Leary and his friends in this enterprise.  I think it is intolerable that a Minister for Finance should be chastised for not giving a grant to a company whose record of management has been publicly denounced as insufferable. The Minister for Finance is being chastised for not making a decision on the basis of the figures supplied to him which refer only to December, 1972.  If the company were genuine in getting assistance as distinct from trying to use their own incompetence and mismanagement for political purposes, they would have furnished the figures Deputy O'Leary trotted out so easily here tonight for examination in the cool, calm and analytical atmosphere&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>The reality of the situation is that when this matter was first recommended against because the proposition then advanced was not viable, in 1968 it was claimed by the promoters of this company that the annual landing fees, in 1968 figures, would be £600 per annum.  Since 1968, the figures have never reached £600 per annum.  The figures were as follows: for the 15-month period ended December, 1970, £164; the year ended December, 1971, £67; the year ended December, 1972, £212; and on the basis of the last figures we had from the company's auditor, for December, 1973, £145.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When the company were offered an additional grant of £21,000 for extension purposes it was issued on conditions which the promoters accepted, that they would raise additional share capital of £14,000, and in exchange for that undertaking the State agreed to pay a grant of £3 for every £2 <Col N="1136" /> raised in share capital by the local promoters on whose behalf Deputy O'Leary professes to speak.  That would have meant a total grant of £71,000.  Only £58,285 has been paid to date because the local contributors, the local promoters on whose behalf Deputy O'Leary asserts that this is a viable, profitable and commercially successful promotion, have not been able to produce the revenue.  I see no reason why I should vary the conditions laid down by Deputy O'Leary's political friends when Ministers from his own party laid down these conditions which he and his friends said would be fulfilled&mdash;and they have not lived up to their promises.  And they have not lived up to their promises because, as the Central Development Committee forecast in 1968, it is not a commercially viable operation.  That would be difficult enough and one might face that situation in the interests of the people of Kerry if all were proper and above board but, as I pointed out at Question Time, the auditors of the company who examined the books of the company said that the company's books and records were not properly kept.  They said they had been unable to obtain adequate information and explanations in relation to the unsatisfactory results disclosed by the accounts.  The company secretary at the annual general meeting said&mdash;and these remarks were quoted in the Kerry newspapers for everybody in Kerry to read&mdash;that when he undertook his duties he discovered that the affairs of the company were being conducted on a very poor and improper basis.  &ldquo;The property and goods of the company are being highly abused,&rdquo; he said &ldquo;and so far as the bar was concerned there appeared to be no control whatsoever.&rdquo;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. O'Leary</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am told that was years ago.  We have been furnished with no accounts whatever from this outfit to suggest that the situation is any different.  The last accounts are in respect of the year 1972 and these disclose a loss of £6,250.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1137" /> Any Minister for Finance must discharge his primary public responsibility and that is not to issue public funds until he is satisfied about the integrity of the people to whom he is giving them and also satisfied that these funds are being properly managed. We have not seen sufficient evidence in this regard to justify offering any further public funds to this enterprise.  We know that the local people who are prepared to stick their hands into the pockets of the taxpayers to get more money are not themselves prepared to put up the money which two years ago they said they would put up.  What they are seeking now is not what they originally sought, a State contribution towards part of the cost.  They now want 100 per cent State subvention for an enterprise which, on the evidence of their own auditor and secretary, has been improperly managed.  I would be failing seriously in my public duty if I were to advance any public money in those circumstances.  Those who seek public money must come with clean hands and if their hands are not clean I would regard it as my primary public duty to refuse money to such people.  If the situation improves, if the local interest which Deputy O'Leary professes is there is there in reality and evidence of this is furnished, the situation can be re-examined.</P>
    <P>I was asked today at Question Time in the original question whether I considered that Farranfore airport had an important part to play in the future development of the county.  I would hope it would have but the evidence is very much against it. When the landing fees at Farranfore are less than one-third of what the operators projected six years ago, how can it be said that this is a development which is essential to the future prosperity of the region?  All the facts, all the evidence and the record to date are against the protestations which have been made here.  Perhaps if the airport had been under the control of other hands the situation would have been different; I do not know; I am not in any way passing judgement on the possibilities that an airport <Col N="1138" /> in Kerry could be of advantage but, on the evidence to date, that case has not been proved.</P>
    <P>Finally, we are told that the £33,000 which is now sought is interest to date.  On the figures furnished, no matter what exorbitant, usurious rate of interest might have been charged, interest to date could not amount to as much as £33,000.</P>

      <P>Then the argument here is contrary to the basis on which the first application was made.  You are now seeking repayment of principal in addition to that which was approved in 1968 and again approved in 1971.  If the people of Kerry have no faith in this local enterprise it is very difficult for people far beyond Kerry who have not been given the facts and figures to have faith in it.  I know there are people in Kerry who have faith in their county and who are investing considerable sums of money in it and making sacrifices to do so and who have a record without blemish or suspicion but these are not the people who, with all due respect I might say, appear to be involved here.  I have no doubt several people are involved in this enterprise who are innocent of what appear to be malpractices in relation to it.  I do not want to injure anybody who does not deserve the opprobrium which, on the facts, certainly somebody must carry in relation to this operation but I suggest that people should first put their own house in order and if and when the State see that the local house is in order we shall only be too ready to have another look at the situation.</P>
