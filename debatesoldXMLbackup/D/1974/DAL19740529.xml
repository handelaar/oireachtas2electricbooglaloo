      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="LiamCosgrave" hpid="The Taoiseach Liam Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The answer is in the negative.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>First, may I ask the Taoiseach whether the Sunningdale Agreement as such can be said to exist?  Secondly, can the package that was damaged in transit be discussed at some future date&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>I thought the breaking of the package must be relevant; I am sorry if it is not, not that I am worried about it being broken.  Thirdly, does the Taoiseach hold the view that the whole Sunningdale débâcle was a lot of ballyhoo from first to last?</P>

      <P>Question No. 2.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>May I ask the Taoiseach if it is his intention to deny information to Members of this House?  Regardless of whether they represent a large or a small number, they have been elected to the House, are entitled to be heard in the House <Col N="152" /> and entitled to some courtesy and information.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LiamCosgrave" hpid="The Taoiseach Liam Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy asked me if it was intended to hold a referendum and I said the answer was in the negative.  The Deputy has considerable experience and I think he will appreciate that the rest of his supplementaries are quite irrelevant.</P>

    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>Further arising from the Taoiseach's reply, for which I thank him, may I ask what was the purpose of the front bench Member, Deputy Cruise-O'Brien&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanTreacy" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Seán Treacy">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>This is a separate matter and is quite irrelevant. The Deputy's question deals with whether a referendum or plebicite should be carried out.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, and the information was that the answer was in the negative.  I am asking if it is not a fact that the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs, Deputy Cruise-O'Brien, when sitting in the Taoiseach's seat and obviously speaking for the Government during the debate on the Sunningdale package or agreement, said that if the Opposition sought a referendum or a general election on the agreement the Government would accommodate them?  Is that the actuality of the situation, or is it that the Minister was talking through his hat and that his Leader does not know what he was talking about?</P>

    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>Might I ask the Parliamentary Secretary whether the Irish farmers have been starved of certain essential fertilisers as a result of what can only be described as a racket by NET in getting markets abroad while closing all imports to this country and leaving farmers, with a very bad year's grass, in a worse position than they have ever been in before?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware of the plight of many of our farmers who have gone deeply into debt at the advocacy of the Minister and his predecessors to them to build up stocks, to extend their buildings and change their method of working in order to produce more than they ever did before, and that they are now in a really bad way?  Surely the Minister must be aware of this, and the idea that he might be excused on account of being out of the country&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="MarkAClinton" hpid="Mr. Clinton Mr. Clinton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Clinton</NameTxt>
      <P>The total quantity of beef accepted by the Irish Intervention Agency to date is approximately 15,000 tons of which 11,000 tons is stored in other member states, including Holland.  Recent acceptances of beef into intervention in this country have been at a level varying from 800 to 1,000 tons weekly.  It is not feasible to predict the quantity that may be offered into intervention each week later this year but the steps recently taken to strengthen the Community Beef Market, including the requirement linking the purchase of intervention beef to imports from third countries, should ease the situation considerably.  The deboning of beef now being provided for will enable better use to be made of available storage facilities.  Such boning of the Irish beef will be carried out in this country.</P>

      <P>My Department in consultation with other Departments concerned are studying the pros and cons of seeking a modification, for the purposes of the Common Agricultural Policy, in the representative rate of the Irish £ <i>vis-à-vis</i> the Unit of Account in order to bring it more into line with the current market rate. This is a very complex issue with many implications, and pending completion of the study at present in progress I do not propose to make any detailed comment.</P>

      <P>The report to which the Deputy refers is a study of land potential for grazing in Ireland in the course of which an estimate is made of the minimum area required to generate incomes comparable to those received outside agriculture under a dairy cow farming system.  The conclusions are based on the technical capacity of the land only and account is not taken of capital availability or servicing or of managerial or social factors obtaining at farm level.  The report confirms my view that a high proportion of small farms in Ireland, if managed efficiently, have the potential for achieving viable incomes.</P>

Having regard to that, will the Minister, in spite of the advice he may have given about the legal aspect of it, which I submit is incorrect, see to it that a new limit will be imposed, or alternatively see to it that the operation of the schemes of his Department and his responsibility will not be impeded because of regulations of a kind which, apart from being oppressive, prevent these schemes from operating properly?</P>

For sums exceeding £100 formal proof of title such as probate of the will or letters of administration is required.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries if he will give details of the EEC directive which states that after this year live turkeys may not be marketed to the public in the customary manner but must be wrapped and oven-ready; if he proposes to implement this directive; and if the poultry industry and producers have been consulted in the matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MarkAClinton" hpid="Mr. Clinton Mr. Clinton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Clinton</NameTxt>
      <P>An EEC Poultry Health Directive made in 1971 provides that trade in fresh poultry meat is only allowed where the meat was obtained from birds slaughtered in approved plants and subjected to veterinary inspection before and after slaughter.  Before plants can be authorised under the directive they must meet very high standards as regards premises, equipment, processing procedures, staffing, hygiene, storage and packaging.  The directive came into effect for intra-Community trade in July, 1973, and will apply to home trade from February, 1976. It covers fresh, chilled and frozen meat of hens, cocks, broiler chickens, turkeys, geese, ducks and guinea fowl.  It does not apply to trade in live birds.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Because of the requirements that birds must pass through an approved plant and undergo post-mortem veterinary inspection, application of the directive to the home market in 1976 would have the effect of precluding trade in New York dressed <Col N="171" /> birds which, of course, are not eviscerated and many of which do not pass through processing plants at all.  This would be a serious matter for our small producers particularly in regard to our traditional New York dressed trade in turkeys especially during the Christmas season each year.</P>
    <P>Both this country and the UK have been pressing for amendment of the directive to enable us to continue with the New York dressed trade after 1976.  Producer and processing organisations have been consulted in the matter.</P>

Is he further aware that this directive has caused considerable inconvenience to the poultry producers in Denmark?

      <NameTxt>Mr. M.P. Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>The most farreaching measure which has been taken for the conservation of our salmon stocks is the Control of Fishing for Salmon Order, 1973, which prescribes the maximum number of net licences which may be issued for each fishery district.  The order also lays down strict criteria of eligibility of applicants for licences that are aimed at ensuring that only <i>bona fide</i> fishermen are granted licences.  Other measures which have been adopted to <Col N="174" /> conserve salmon stocks involve the prescribing of an annual close season and a weekly close time, the prohibition of net fishing in certain areas and the prohibition of other methods of fishing including the use of nets in excess of prescribed lengths.</P>
      <P>While the final report of the Inland Fisheries Commission has not yet come to hand three interim reports have been issued two of which relate to the regulation of netting for salmon at sea and in estuarine waters.  The main recommendations in these reports have been implemented by the Control of Fishing for Salmon Order, 1973.</P>

My information is as stated in my reply and I do not accept that the holdings contain the area mentioned by the Deputy.  The first holding contains approximately 33 acres and has a valuation of £2.65p; the second holding contains 18 acres and has a valuation of £2.70p; the third contains 15 acres 1 rood and has a valuation of £4; the fourth contains 7 acres 6 perches and has a valuation of £1.90p and the last one has an area of 8 acres 1 rood and 32 perches and has a poor law valuation of £2.50p.

      <P>Is é an cuspóir atá leis an mBille seo ná ardú ó £6 mhilliún go £10 milliún a dhéanamh ar an uasteorainn do na hairleacain a eisítear as an bPríomh-Chiste chuig Gaeltarra Éireann.  Uasteorainn £500,000 a leagadh síos sa bhliain 1957 agus ardaíodh í go dtí £2 mhilliún sa bhliain 1965 agus go dtí £6 mhilliún sa bhliain 1971.  Is mithid í a ardú arís anois toisc go bhfuil an £6 mhilliún íoctha le Gaeltarra cheana féin.  Caiteachas caipitial ar fad atá i gceist agus, i ngarbh-fhigiúirí, is iad na príomhshuimeanna atá san áireamh go dtí seo ná&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      <P>£1½ mhilliún ar fhoirgnimh agus ar ghléasra do na tionscail atá á reachtáil ag Gaeltarra féin,</P>
      <P>£3 mhilliún ar mhonarchana lena gcur ar cíos, agus</P>
      <P>£1½ mhilliún ar scaireanna i gcomhlachtaí ina bhfuil Gaeltarra agus daoine eile i gcomhar lena chéile chun comhthionscail a reachtáil.</P>
      <P>Beidh £4 mhilliún breise ar fáil do na cúrsaí sin faoin mBille seo.  Ar ndóigh, bíonn caiteachas caipitil i gceist chomh maith sna deontais tionscail a thugann Gaeltarra ó 1965 i leith, agus is amhlaidh a chuirtear an t-airgead sin ar fáil trí Vóta Roinn na Gaeltachta gach bliain.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="185" /> Faoi mar atá ráite agam go minic, is é mo thuairim féin gurb é an lán-fhostaíocht sna seachtóidí do phobal na Gaeltachta an rud is tábhachtaí ar fad. Ní beag a bhfuil déanta sa treo sin.  I dtionscail a bhfuil cabhair tugtha ag Gaeltarra dóibh agus i dtionscail Ghaeltarra féin, tá thart faoi 2,500 duine ag obair agus is le bliain anuas a thosaigh os cionn 500 díobh.  Na tograí go léir a bhfuil cabhair ceadaithe ag Gaeltarra dóibh, meastar go gcuirfidh siad fostaíocht ar fáil do suas le 4,000 duine nuair a bheidh siad faoi lánseol.  Is ábhar misnigh na figiúirí sin.</P>
    <P>Faoi mar a luaigh mé sa Dáil cúpla mí ó shin, tá Bille eile á ullmhú againn chun Údarás na Gaeltachta a chur in ionad Ghaeltarra Éireann agus chun na cumhachtaí feidhmiúcháin is leithne is féidir a thabhairt don chomhlacht nua ar mhaithe le forbairt uileghabhálach na Gaeltachta.  Bheidh forálacha airgeadais sa Bhille sin freisin.  Idir an dá linn, áfach, ní foláir a chur ar chumas Ghaeltarra leanúint ar aghaidh leis an dea-obair, agus is chuige sin atáim ag iarraidh ar an Dáil glacadh leis an mBille beag seo.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesCTunney" hpid="Mr. Tunney Mr. Tunney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tunney</NameTxt>
      <P>Is Bille beag é seo ach tá sé mór-thábhachtach ag féachaint don mhianach lena mbaineann sé.  An té ón dtaobh amuigh a bhreathnaíonn ar an mBille seo feichfidh sé gur ceadúnas do chaiteachas £4 milliún atá ann.  Mura bhfuil aithne aige ar oifigí íontacha Ghaeltarra Éireann nó muna dtuigeann sé an obair fhíorthábhachtach atá idir lámhaibh ag Gaeltarra Éireann is dócha go mbeadh ceist nó dhó le cur maidir leis an gceadúnas atá á iarraidh.  Déanfaidh mé tagairt do na ceisteanna sin níos déanaí.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Chomh fada is a bhaineann se liom féin, fáiltím go hiomlán roimh an mBille seo.  Fáiltím roimh an mBille mar chomhartha fáis, mar chomhartha forbartha, mar chomhartha dóchais agus mar chomhartha áthais do mhuintir na tíre.  Dá mhinice a thagann Aire Gaeltachta ar bith os comhair an Tí seo ag iarraidh cabhrach de chineál ar bith do mhuintir na Gaeltachta is amhlaidh is fearr liomsa é.  Ba mhaith liom a chur ar <Col N="186" /> Thuairisc Oifigiúil an Tí seo nach aon bhrú ar dhoicheall a bhéas ann chomh fada is a bhaineann sé liomsa nó le muintir Fhianna Fáil.  Níl mé ag rá go mbeimid sásta uair ar bith <i>carte blanche</i> a thabhairt d'Aire ar bith maidir le caiteachas airgid.  Mar bhall fiú amháin den Choiste um Chuntais Phoiblí bheadh orm ceisteanna a chur agus is ag a bpointí seo is maith liom ceisteanna &ldquo;an fhir ón taobh amuigh&rdquo; ar ar thrácht mé níos luaithe a chur.</P>
    <P>Deir an tAire linn gurab é atá i gceist anseo ná an uasteorainn a cheadaíodh i macsamhail an Bhille seo i 1971 a ardú anois tré £4 mhilliún sa bhreis a chur leis.  Chomh maith leis sin tuigimid uaidh go bhfuil an uasteora de £6 mhilliún a bhí ann geall le bheith sroiste ag Gaeltarra Éireann cheann féin.</P>
    <P>Luann an tAire freisin an ráiteas a rinne sé anseo agus in áiteacha eile maidir le hÚdarás na Gaeltachta, ráiteas ar chuireamar fáilte agus fiche roimhe.  Do réir mar a thuigimíd beidh an t-údarás ann taobh istigh de bhliain.  Mar sin, ar son an fhir eile agus ag éirí as na dualgaisí atá orm ba mhaith liom an cheist seo a chur. An bhféadfadh an tAire beagáinín níos mó eolais a thabhairt dúinn maidir leis an ghá atá ann £4 mhilliún a cheadú anseo?  An amhlaidh go bhfuil Gaeltarra Éireann imithe thar an teora a bhí ann cheana féin nó an amblaidh go bhfuil siad cinnte go mbeidh gá leis an £4 mhilliún seo taobh istigh de bhliain eile?</P>
    <P>Os ag trácht ar dhualgaisí atá muid measaim nach ndéanfadh sé dochar ar bith an dualgas a luíonn ar Roinn na Gaeltachta a bhreacadh síos anseo.  Tá siad ar eolas ag na Teachtaí cheann féin ach measaim féin nach ceart riamh dearmad a dhéanamh orthu.  Nuair a bunaíodh Roinn na Gaeltachta leagadh síos gurb é leas cultúra, sóisialach, geilleagnach na Gaeltachta a chur chun cinn agus cabhrú le caomhaint agus leathnú na Gaeilge.  B'shin é an dualgas a bhí orthu.</P>
    <P>Tá sé chomh maith freisin an dualgas a luíonn ar Ghaeltarra Éireann maidir leis an Ghaeilge ag <Col N="187" /> éirí as an bpríomh-Acht seo, Acht, 1957 a bhreacadh séos.  I rannóg 4 (2) deirtear: &ldquo;Is é dualgas an Bhoird cabhrú le caomhaint agus leathnú na Gaeilge mar ghnáth urlabhra sa Ghaeltacht.&rdquo;  Agus, ar ndóigh, is féidir linn glacadh leis sin i n-áiteacha eile nach í.</P>
    <P>Níl éinne níos fearr ná mé féin a thuigeann nádúracht agus fealsúnacht an tsean-fhocail a dheineann trácht ar an ngad is goire don scórnach. Glacaim go hiomlán&mdash;agus tá sé ráite agam na céadta uair cheana féin &mdash; nach aon mhaith bheith ag trácht ar an nGaeltacht mura nglacaimíd mar bhun-chloch go bhfuil muintir na Gaeltachta i dteideal slí bheatha, slí mhaireachtála agus córas maireachtála a fháil chomh hard le háit ar bith eile sa tír agus b'fhéidir níos aoirde.</P>
    <P>Glacaim go hiomlán leis an gá a bhaineann le lán-fhostaíocht ach níor mhaith liom go ndéanfadh an glacadh sin dall muid ar an ghné eile den Ghaeltacht atá chomh tábhachtach leis an gcóras maireachtála.  Sé tá i gceist agam ná maireachtáil aigne, maireachtáil traidisiúin, maireachtáil náisiúin.  Níl na rudaí sin le feiscint níos soiléire in áit ar bith ná mar atá siad le feiscint sa Ghaeltacht.</P>
    <P>Maidir leis an ndualgas i leith na Gaeilge atá ar Ghaeltarra Éireann, conas a chomhlíon muintir Ghaeltarra an dualgas sin a bhí orthu?  Gheibhimid tuairiscí faoi na dualgaisí eile.  Tá an-iontaoibh agam féin as an Aire, as Roinn na Gaeltachta agus as Gaeltarra Éireann ach chomh fada agus is eol dom ní fhaca mé riamh tuarascáil reatha ar an dualgas úd i leith na Gaeilge atá orthu.</P>
    <P>Cén mhaith í an Ghaeltacht ach go bhfuil an Ghaeilge ann?  Cén mhaith aon dul chun cinn a dheinimid chomh fada agus a bhaineann sé leis na glaonna atá ar an ngnáth-dhuine maidir le maireachtáil?  Cén mhaith na rudaí sin uilig má táimid chun an seoid úd eile atá níos luachmhaire a chailliúint?  Níl mé ag caitheamh anuas ar Ghaeltarra.  Tá a fhios agam go bhfuil an dualgas sin comhlíonaithe acu chomh maith in Éirinn agus is féidir leo ach de bhrí nach bhfaca mé an tuarascáil nó nach bhfaca éinne <Col N="188" /> eile í, níl a fhios againn cé acu an bhfuil an dualgas úd á chomhlíonadh acu nó nach bhfuil.</P>
    <P>Ó bunaíodh an Teach seo bhí tuiscint ann maidir le ceist na Gaeilge.  Ní heol dom go ndearna Rialtas amháin seachas Rialtas eile aon phointe mór faoi a ndearna siad maidir leis an nGaeilge nó maidir leis an nGaeltacht. Tá súil agam gur mar sin a bheidh an scéal.  Tá sé tábhachtach go mbeimid go léir ar aon fhocal maidir leis an nGaeilge.</P>
    <P>Ní dhéanfaidh mé ach tagairt amháin eile d'óráid an Aire.  Níl ach aon chlamhsán amháin agam. Measaim go ndearna an tAire iarracht tairbhe a bhaint as an mBille san tagairt a rinne sé do 500 post a chuireadh ar fáil in rith na bliana. Tuigeann sé chomh maith agus a thuigeann gach duine sa Teach nach fás aon oiche a bhí sna postanna sin. Ní bheadh na postanna sin ann marach an obair a bhí déanta ag daoine eile agus ag Airí eile roimhe. Luaigh mé sin chun a theaspáint chomh tábhachtach is atá sé deighilt a dhéanamh i gcónaí idir chúrsaí polaitíochta agus ceist na Gaeilge agus na Gaeltachta.</P>
    <P>Traoslamím leis an Aire as ucht a bhfuil á ndéanamh aige.  Tá sé ar a dhícheall ag tabhairt le tuiscint go dteastaíonn uaidh chomh mór agus a theastaíonn uaimse an oiread agus is féidir a dhéanamh ar son na Gaeilge agus ar son na Gaeltachta.  Chomh fada agus a leanann sé féin nó Aire ar bith eile an treoir sin beidh mise leo.  Tá a fhios agam nuair a bhéas freagra á thabhairt aige amach anseo go ndéanfaidh sé tagairt don mhéid atá ráite agam, go mór mhór nuair atá bás Ghaeltarra fógraithe cheana féin agus go mbeidh ar a gcumas an £4 mhilliún sin a chaitheamh.  Tá súil agam go ndéanfaidh sé tagairt freisin don mhéid a lua mé maidir leis an dtuarascáil agus cé chomh tábhachtach is a ghlacann siad an Ghaeilge féin a bheith.</P>
    <P>Tá a fhios agam nuair a bhíonn forbairt ann i gcónaí bíonn bua agus cailliúint agus caithfimid i gcónaí an dá rud sin a mheascadh lena chéile agus a chur san áireamh.  Bheadh díomá ormsa dá mbeadh an caighdeán <Col N="189" /> maireachtála sa Ghaeltacht níos aoirde ná mar atá sé in áit ar bith eile ach gurb é an praghas a íocadh air sin go raibh an Ghaeilge imithe, go raibh laige inti, go raibh cultúr na Gaeltachta imithe, go raibh cultúr na tíre, an ceol, agus an drámaíocht imithe.</P>

      <P>Ba mhaith liom cúpla focal fáilte a chur leis an méid atá ráite cheana ag an Teachta Tunney agus fáilte a chur roimh an mBille chomh maith.  Ní hí seo an chéad uair adúirt mé i gceachtar Teach den Oireachtas go mba chóir don Ghaeilge agus gach a mbaineann léithe a scaradh ón pholaitíocht sa méid agus is féidir é.  In aghaidh an lae le 50 bliain anuas nó níos mó tá cineál peile á dhéanamh as an nGaeilge ag cuspóirí polaitiúla agus sí an Ghaeilge agus an Gaeltachta a bhíonn thíos dá bhárr.</P>
      <P>Tá coiste sa Teach seo agus é bunaithe le bliain nó dhó anuas ag deighleáil le ceist an Tuaiscirt agus le cúrsaí Éireannacha.  Níl fáth ar bith ann, dar liom, nach mbeadh a leithéid de choiste ann chomh maith chun leas na Gaeilge a chur chun cinn agus féachaint chuige na bealaí is fearr chun sin a dhéanamh.  Ní maith liom ar chor ar bith a fheiceál go mbíonn ceisteanna éagsúla, ceisteanna teoirice nó ceisteanna praicticiúla, á bplé sa Teach seo nó áit ar bith eile agus á bplé mar cheisteanna nach mbíonn tábhacht ar bith iontu seachas an pholaitíocht, cuir i gcás, cé cáiliúil Ros a' Bhíl.  Táimid go léir cráite sa Teach seo le céard a thárla nó nár thárla leis an gcé sin. Is cuma liomsa sa diabhal arbh é Fianna Fáil nó an chéad Comhrialtas nó an dara Comharialtas nó an treas Comhrialtas ba chiontach leis an mhoill agus ba chúis le gan é a bheith ann go fóill, cé go bhfuil an obair sin tosnaithe.  Ach idir an dá linn, le linn na díospóireachta fada tá go leor daoine imithe as an áit agus b'féidir go mbeidís ann i gcónaí dá mbéadh an cé tógtha 30 nó 40 bliain ó shin.</P>

Ba mhaith liom dá mbeadh aontas eadrainn ar an gceist seo mara mbeadh sé eadrainn ar cheist ar bith eile.  Féach an chaoi ina bhfuil Conradh na Gaeilge dulta siar le fada an lá toisc gur mheasc sé é féin sa pholaitíocht ó aimsir Dhubhglas de hÍde, an Chraoibhinn Aoibhinn, i leith.  Léigh muid go léir nó chonaiceamar ar an dteilifís cúpla oíche ó shin cur síos ar an Ard-Fheis a bhí ag Conradh na Gaeilge an tseachtain seo caite, an Ard-Fheis ba lua dá raibh acu riamh.  Sé an fáth go bhfuil an Conradh ag dul i laige ná go bhfuil iarrachtaí á ndéanamh de réir a chéile ag an ngrúpa seo nó ag an ngrúpa siúd seilbh a ghlacadh ar an gConradh chun a gcuspóirí polaitiúla féin a chur chun cinn.  Sí an Ghaeilge a bhíonn thíos leis sin.  Is maith liomsa an spiorad síochánta a thaispeáin an Teachta Tunney a fheiceáil sa Teach seo.  Sin é an spiorad ba chóir a bheith eadrainn féin, pé eágsúlacht eile a d'fhéadfadh a bheith eadrainn faoi cheisteanna aíthride eile.</P>

    <P>Ní ar obair nó ar airgead amháin a <Col N="191" /> bhraitheann beatha na Gaeltachta, agus is maith is eol sin do na Teachtaí atá ina suí romham amach gur as ceantair Ghaeltachta iad.  Feicim an Teachta Gallagher ós mo chomhair amach.  Do chaith mé tráthóna Dé Satharn seo caite i nDáilcheantar thart ar Gaoth Sáile.  Bhí cuma ar an áit go raibh na daoine ag obair.  Bhí foraoiseach ann, monarca minfhéir, Bord na Móna, agus obair á déanamh iontu go léir.  Cúis lúthgháir dhom ab ea é.  Ach ní ar obair amháin agus ní ar cibé áiseanna a d'fhéadfadh Gaeltarra Éireann a sholáthar do na daoine ins na ceantair Ghaeltachta amháin a bhraitheann slánú na teangan.  Braitheann sé ar an spiorad nó an misneach a bhíonn ins na daoine ar ceantar dúchas dóibh ceantar Gaeltachta, go mór mhór ar féin-mhuinín i gcúrsaí cultúir, mar nach maith leo iad féin a fheiceáil mar shaoránaigh den dara grád.  Leis an tímpeallacht mhór Bhéarla atá thart orthu luíonn an dualgas go trom ar pé Rialtas a bhíonn i réim an misneach sin a chothú ar gach uile bhealach agus is féidir leo chun deimhin a dhéanamh de go bhfeicfidh muintir na háite sin nach lú a luach iad ná na daoine ar shaoránaigh Éireannacha iad chomh maith a chomhnaíonn i n-áit ar bith eile sa tír.  Luíonn an dualgas sin ar gach eagraíocht ar chás leo an Ghaeltacht, agus go mór mhór Roinn na Gaeltachta agus Gaeltarra Éireann atá i gceist agam anseo.  Pé ní is féidir leo a dhéanamh le go mbeadh níos mó misnigh agus féin-mhuinín ag na daoine astu féin, sé is túisce a bhéas an Ghaeilge in ann seasamh ar a bonnaibh féin, rud nach bhfuil sí in ann a dhéanamh go nuige seo.</P>
    <P>Ba mhaith liom dá gcuirfeadh an tAire, an Teachta Tunney agus gach Teachta ar an dá thaobh den Teach gur chás leis an ábhar seo a nguailne le pé gníomh is féidir a chur i bhfeidhm a neartódh an féin-mhuinín sin.  Cuir i gcás, ba mhaith liom féin, mar adúirt mé sa Teach seo i ndíospóireacht eile cúpla lá ó shin, go mbeadh clár iomlán Gaeilge teilifíse le fáil, agus ba chuma liom an méid a chosnódh sé.  Dá mbeadh £10 millún le caitheamh, bhéinn sásta é <Col N="192" /> chaitheamh ar an gcuspóir sin.  Ní aontóinn ar chur ar bith leis an dearcadh go mba chóir staid na Gaeilge a laghdú i gcúrsaí teilifíse nó i gcúrsaí craolacháin.  Í a neartú ba mhaith liom a dhéanamh.  Tá mé cinnte go n-aithníonn an tAire nach ar an airgead amháin a bhraitheann slánú nó beatha na teangan ach ar an misneach chomh maith agus ba mhaith liom dá gcuirfeadh sé a ghuala le pé gníomh eile i gcúrsaí cultúra agus a leitheíd ach go mór mhór i gcúrsaí cultúra a thabharfadh an spiorad sin do na daoine.</P>
    <P>Leis an gcúpla focal sin ba mhaith liom, mar a dúirt mé i dtosach báire, fáilte a chur roimh an mBille agus traoslú leis an Aire.  Nára laga Dia é.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnGeoghegan" hpid="Mr. Geoghegan Mr. Geoghegan">

      <P>Cuirim fáilte roimh Bille ar bith a dheineann maith nó a thugann níos mó airgead don Ghaeltacht chun obair a chur ar fáil is cuma cén Aire nó cé taobh den Teach atá i gceist.</P>
      <P>Tá airgead leagtha amach anseo le haghaidh monarchain a thógáil chun obair a thabhairt do na daoine.  An bhfuil ar intinn ag an Aire an t-airgead seo a fhágáil i lámha an choiste agus go mbeidh na monarchain á gcur suas anseo agus ansúd? B'fhéidir go mbeidh na monarchain uile i n-áit amháin nó b'fhéidir go mbeidh siad scapaite ar fud na Gaeltachta uiligh.  Dúirt an tAire i 1970 go mbeadh chuile dhuine ag obair sa Ghaeltacht.  Tá súil agam gur mar sin a bheidh sé ach tá faitíos orm. Ba mhaith liom chuile dhuine bheith ag obair sa Ghaeltacht.  Ba mhaith liom freisin nuair a dhéanfeadh an tAire socrú fá Údarás na Gaeltachta nó coiste eile go scaipfí na monarchain seo ar fud na Gaeltachta, nach mbeidh siad i n-aon áit amháin. B'fhearr liom deich monarchain a thógáil agus 50 duine ag obair iontu ná ceann amháin i n-áit amháin agus 500 ag obair ann.  Má scaipfear iad ar fud na Gaeltachta coimeádfar na daoine sa Ghaeltacht.  Má tá ceann mór amháin ann beidh daoine i n-áiteacha eile sa Ghaeltacht ag imeacht as bailtí beaga.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Coicís ó shin thóg an tAire isteach cupla áit sa Ghaeltacht.  Thóg sé isteach dhá áit thíos i gCiarraí agus áit <Col N="193" /> amháin i bPortláirge.  Teaspáineann sin domhsa go bhfuil an Ghaeilge ag dul ar aghaidh sna áiteacha sin.  Tá eolas maith agam ar an áit a thóg sé isteach i gCiarraí.  Bhí mé ann.  Bhí áthas orm nuair a tógadh isteach é. Ba mhaith liom freisin go ndéanfaí scrúdú ar áiteacha eile go mba cheart bheith istigh sa Ghaeltacht freisin agus go mbeadh seans acu anois áit a bheith acu ar an gcoiste seo agus go mbeadh siad in ann monarchain a thógáil le daoine a chur ag obair iontu.</P>
    <P>Níor mhaith liom aon áit a lua thar aon áit eile ach má fheiceann tú páróiste sa Ghaeltacht briste suas, an chuid ar thaobh amháin den bhóthar sa Ghaeltacht agus an chuid ar an dtaobh eile sa Ghalltacht, tá rud éicint déanta as bealach ansin.  Ba mhaith liom go ndéanfaí scrúdú ansin agus iad a thabhairt isteach sa Ghaeltacht chomh lua agus is féidir agus na monarchain nua a chur isteach sna háiteacha seo.</P>
    <P>Faid atá airgead ag teacht isteach, faid atá daoine ag obair sa Ghaeltacht beidh siad sásta fanacht sa Ghaeltacht.  B'fhearr leis na daoine bheith ag obair sa Ghaeltacht ná dul isteach sna bailtí móra.  B'fhearr leo bheith amuigh faoin tír, ina n-áit féin, san áit ina rugadh iad.</P>
    <P>Tá súil agam go rachaidh an obair atá ar siúl ag an Aire faoin mBille seo ar aghaidh agus go leanfaidh sí ar aghaidh ar fud na Gaeltachta uilig.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesWhile" hpid="Mr. White Mr. White">
      <NameTxt>Mr. White</NameTxt>
      <P>It is only fitting when I welcome this Bill to mention that the people of the Gaeltacht have certainly been very impressed with the present Minister for the Gaeltacht. They have been impressed by his sincerity, by the effort he has put into his Ministry.</P>
      <P>I am speaking in English because my Irish is not as fluent as that of previous speakers.  Yet, I cover the biggest Gaeltacht constituency in this land.  To me what is most important is to understand the people's problems and to work for the people and to ensure that they can develop their culture.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I listened with interest to Deputy Tunney.  He certainly displayed sincerity. The first thing that he <Col N="194" /> suggested was that, perhaps, an outsider, a person from outside the Gaeltacht, does not really understand the problems of the Gaeltacht.  This is very true.  There certainly have been tremendous problems in the Gaeltacht areas.  That is why I welcome this Bill.  Deputy Tunney wanted to know why was the extra £4 million needed for industrial development.  In the few minutes that I have at my disposal I will talk on some of the things that have been done and some of the things that are being done in my constituency.  The Deputy mentioned section 4 of the 1957 Act the intention of which, he said, was to help foster and develop the Irish language.</P>
    <P>I have no doubt that 95 to 96 per cent of the people agree with that intention but we must be realistic. We who have served the people of Gaeltacht constituencies realise that for generations the decline in the population of the Gaeltacht through emigration has been tremendous and alarming.  The serious effort to stem that tide of emigration only started to be made in 1971.  There is no point in talking about fostering the Irish language if the people have to emigrate, as they have had to, to America, to Scotland and to England. We are proud of our Irish tradition. The Gaelic people are proud of their tradition.  We are proud of our Irish dancing, our way of life, our music and our drama but if we are to be realists about this we must give employment not alone to keep the people at home but also to give the emigrants who want to come back jobs in their own areas.  For too many years the policy of all previous Governments was to speak about Irish, to encourage Irish, but we forgot about employment.  This Bill is to increase industrial development in the Gaeltacht areas from £6 million to £10 million.  From 1957 to 1968, eleven years in all, the total estimate was only £10 million.  The Minister is looking for a sum of £10 million today.</P>
    <P>As the Minister has said, the extra £4 million is going on three types of development (1) premises and plant <Col N="195" /> (2) factories for letting, advance factories and so on and (3) shares in different types of companies.  In my part of the Gaeltacht, in County Donegal, the emigration figure for eleven years up to 1971 was 14,000 people, over 1,000 people per year.  It was only in 1971 that the then Government decided to take a serious look at remedying the plight of the people in the Gaeltacht areas.  I am proud to say that over the last three years, but especially over the last 14 months, tremendous development has taken place.  In the Gaelthacht areas now there are in the region of 2,500 people employed.  This year there will be 500 more jobs started and Deputy Tunney was quite right when he pointed out that those 500 jobs just do not take place over six or 12 months.  We must remember that there are another 1,000 jobs over the next couple of years awaiting the people in the Gaeltacht.</P>
    <P>A new factory has been allocated, the biggest factory ever passed by Gaeltarra Éireann, to a town called Kilcar which has a small population. The grant for that factory is in the region of £1.2 million.  This will give much needed employment at the southern end of the Donegal Gaeltacht. At present Gaeltarra Éireann are buying an industrial site at Dungloe which is famous for its festival but also famous for its emigration over the years.  I should like to compliment the Minister on his initiative in seeing that this town has got an advance factory site.  Last year the Minister sanctioned a major grant for a fishing co-operative in Brutonport and nobody but the Minister can take credit for that.  Probably the most important thing that Roinn na Gaeltachta and Gaeltarra Éireann have done over the last 14 months is to have got a pilot factory for Arranmore Island.  This is something new, something that the islanders want. The islanders are delighted that they are getting a chance to make this pilot scheme work.</P>
    <P>The Opposition are quite entitled to take credit and I would certainly congratulate them on their initiative <Col N="196" /> in starting the Gweedore estate at Bunbeg.  That happened in 1971. Bringing an industrial estate to Gweedore was probably one of the best things that took place in this country.  I do not think this is enough. The Minister this year has extended that site by two new factories.  He has also passed three more factories which are due to open in the next 12 months.  Let us give credit where it is due.  I would appreciate it if the people on the Opposition benches would say a word of thanks for the work the Minister has put into his Department.</P>
    <P>I can speak about the industrial site at Falcarragh.  I can speak about the extension to Crolly.  I can speak about the industrial site at Downings. I can speak about the development at Roskill.  I am not saying the Minister deserves all the credit for what has been done but if the people on the other side are serious they should pay him a compliment which I am sure he would appreciate.  The people of the Gaeltacht now have a new confidence.  It is evident that they have got a new hope and when we see people from the Scotland and England beginning to return home to the Gaeltacht we must all say that at last our policies are working.</P>

      <P>Ba mhaith liom fáiltiú roimh an mBille seo.  Aontaím go bhfuil gá le hairgead a chaitheamh sa Ghaeltacht agus cosúil leis na daoine eile a labhair tá bród mór orm a fheiceáil go bhfuil an oiread seo á thabhairt.  Is ar éigin a dúradh tada faoin mBille féin.  Labhradh faoi rudaí nár bhain leis an mBille ar chor ar bith.  Níl dúil agamsa leanúint ar an gcaoi sin.  Labharfaidh mé faoin mBille féin.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deir an tAire go bhfuil £1½ milliún le caitheamh ar fhoirgnimh agus ar ghléasra do na tionscail atá á reachtáil ag Gaeltarra féin, £3 mhilliún ar mhonarchana lena cur ar cíos, agus £1½ milliún ar scaireanna i gcomhlachtaí ina bhfuil Gaeltarra agus daoine eile i gcomhar lena chéile.  Tá cuid mhaith le déanamh nuair atá tionscal le bunú in áit ar bith. Caithfidh lucht oibre a bheith ann, <Col N="197" /> caithfidh córas traenála a bheith ann, caithfidh bainistíocht, uisce agus séarachas, bóithre, gutháin, cumhacht aibhléise agus a leithéid a bheith ann. Tá an lucht oibre sa Ghaeltacht agus tá neart oibrithe le postanna a thógáil go mór mhór ins na Gaeltachtaí nár dearnadh aon rud go fóill le tionscal a bhunú iontu.  Mo Ghaeltacht féin, cuir i gcás, Gaeltacht Mhuigheo, cé go bhfuil beagán ar siúl sé an beagán é agus tá dúil agam go mbeidh cuid mhaith den airgead atá luaite sa Bhille seo le caitheamh i nGaeltacht Mhuigheo.</P>
    <P>Chun daoine a thréanáil in obair mhonarchan caithfidh scoileanna cearta a bheith ann.  Caithfidh ceardscoileanna a bheith ann; caithfear tréanáil cheart a chur ar fáil d'oibrithe. Tá ceard scoil i nGaeltacht Achaill agus níl deis ar bith ann chun lucht oibre a thréanáil.  I láthaire na huaire, faraoir, tá an tAire Oideachais ag dí-scéimniú na scoile seo. Déanfaidh sé sin an scéal níos measa mar nach mbeidh aon chaoi ag aos óg an pharóiste tréanáil cheart a fháil le dul ag obair sna monarchana.</P>
    <P>San am gcéanna tá tionsclaithe ag teacht isteach agus iad ag rá go bhfuil dúil acu monarchana a bhunú san áit agus ag an am gcéanna, tá an Aire Oideachais ag déanamh díscéimniú ar cheardscoil a chuideodh go mór le tréanáil a tabhairt do lucht oibre.  Muna mbíonn áiseanna sna scoileanna beidh sé deacair bainistíocht cheart a mhúineadh agus daoine a thréanáil.</P>
    <P>Maidir le tithe, is dócha go dtig le Roinna na Gaeltachta bród a bheith orthu faoi na tithe breátha atá tógtha acu ar fud na Gaeltachta leis na blianta fada anuas.  Bíonn bród ar na daoine a théann thart ar fud na Gaeltachta nuair a chíonn siad na tithe breátha atá ins na Gaeltachtaí.</P>
    <P>Tá faitíos orm nach bhfuil uisce ná séarachas ins na bailte móra, más féidir bailte móra a thabhairt orthu, ar fud na Gaeltachta a bhfuil tionscail le bunú iontu.  Mar chruthú air sin chuir mé ceist chuig an Aire Rialtais Áitiúil faoi Bhéal an Mhuirthid, inné:</P>
    <P>To ask the Minister for Local <Col N="198" /> Government the up-to-date position with regard to Belmullet regional water scheme, County Mayo.</P>
    <P>Is é seo an freagra a thug sé:</P>
    <P>As I indicated to the Deputy on the 5th July last, the proposal currently mooted is only at tentative planning stage.  While there have been discussions and technical aspects of it, I cannot say when the scheme is likely to develop.</P>
    <P>Anois, sé an fáth go bhfuil mé á luadh seo ná go bhfuil tionscleoirí ag iarraidh teacht isteach go Béal an Mhuirthid le tionscail a bhunú.  I láthair na huaire, an seirbhís uisce atá ansin níl sé sásúil.  Níl muintir an bhaile féin sásta leis.  Níl an uisce atá ansin féiliúnach agus is beag an mhaith do thionscleoirí teacht isteach agus tionscail a bhunú muna gcuirtear na háiseanna ar fáil.</P>
    <P>Tá an scéal céanna fíor faoi na bóithre.  Arís i nGaeltacht Mhuigheo tá cé le tógáil i mBaile Glas agus caithfidh an Roinn Rialtais Áitiúil agus an comhairle chontae iarracht faoi leith a dhéanamh le bóithre a thógáil ansin.  Tá monarchana tógtha ansin agus ní féidir leo cumhacht aibhléise a fháil.  Bhí conspóid idir Gaeltarra Éireann agus Bord Sholáthar an Leictreachais maidir le cé acu ba chóir dóibh an chumhacht aibhléise a chur ar fáil no nár chóir.  Ar deireadh b'éigin don fhear a thóg an monarcha ineall dá chuid féin a fháil le cumhacht aibhléise a chur ar fáil san monarcha.  Tháinig an duine seo arais ó Shasana.  D'fhág sé an tír lena mhuintir nuair a bhí sé in a ghasúr óg, thart ar seacht nó ocht mbliana d'aois.  Bhí suim aige i gconaí san áit agus tháinig sé arais le monarcha a bhunú agus is mór an fáilte a cuireadh roimhe.  Ní mór feabhas a chur ar an scéal.</P>
    <P>Bhí mé ag éisteacht le clár radio agus chuala mé go raibh Gaeltarra ag brú ar an Roinn Poist and Telegrafa na háiseanna seo a fheabhsú.  Is maith an rud é sin ach níl a fhios agam an raibh mórán sásaimh ann.  Ní fhaghaim féin mórán sásaimh nuair a chuirim ceisteanna ar an Aire Poist agus Telegrafa maidir leis na rudai seo.  Luaigh an Rúnaí Pairliminte ansin Gaoth Sáile.  Seachtain ó shin <Col N="199" /> nó mar sin fuair mé freagra ón Aire Poist agus Telegrafa nach raibh sé sásta telefón poiblí a thógáil san áit sin.</P>
    <P>Sé an fáth go bhfuil mé ag luadh na rudaí seo gur sílim sar a dtéann tionscall isteach in áit go bhfuil gá leis na rudaí sin ar fad.  Caithfidh tú bóithre a bheith agat.  Caithfidh tú cumhacht aibhléise a bheith agat agus caithfidh deis tréanála a bheith ag an aos óg.  Tá mé ag dul isteach ins na rudaí seo mar sílim go bhfuil sé thar am ag an Aire cuimhneamh ar Údarás na Gaeltachta a chur chun tosaidh agus a bhunú.  Ba cheart cumhacht a bheith ag an údarás an t-airgead atá riachtanach leis na rudaí seo ar fad a chur chun cinn a fháil agus a chaitheamh go dtí go mbeidh an bhun-chloch cheart san áit le tionscal a chur ar siúl.</P>
    <P>An mbeidh cuid mhaith den airgead seo ag dul do Chontae Mhuigheo?  An bhfuil an tAire chun é a caitheamh in Achill, i mBéal an Mhuirthid nó i dTuar Mhic Éadaigh?  Tá súil agam nuair a bheidh sé ag tabhairt freagra go mbeidh sé in ann an mioneolas seo a thabhairt dúinn.</P>
    <P>Luaigh Rúnaí Parlaiminte an Taoisigh Conradh na Gaeilge agus tá súil agam nach raibh sé ag caitheamh masla le Conradh na Gaeilge.  Tá a fhios againn go maith go bhfuil daoine ann a théann isteach ag iarraidh cumhacht a fháil i go leor áiteanna agus is deacair cosc a chur le rudaí mar sin.  Caithfimid a admháil go bhfuil daoine i gConradh na Gaeilge go bhfuil an-obair déanta acu, go bhfuil go leor creidiúnt fáite acu agus go bhfuil buíochas mhuintir na hÉireann uile tuillte acu mar gheall ar an obair atá déanta acu.</P>
    <P>Sin an méid atá le rá agam.  Tá bród orm an breis airgid seo a fheiceáil ag dul do na Gaeltachtaí agus tá dúil le Dia agam go bhfeicimid a thuilleadh fostaíochta agus a thuilleadh oibre ag munintir na Gaeltachta. Ar ndóigh tá buntáiste mór ag an Aire seo sa mhéid nach bhfuil aon chúram eile air ach cúram na Gaeltachta.  Tá buntáiste aige nach raibh ag aon duine eile riamh i Rialtas. Is ball den Rialtas é agus tig leis <Col N="200" /> troid a dhéanamh chun neart airgid a fháil dá Roinn féin.  Tig leis níos mó ama a chaitheamh ar cheist na Gaeltachta ná duine ar bith eile a raibh an cúram sin ar cheana.  Cé go bhfuil cuid mhaith oibre déanta ag an Aire ní fheicimse go bhfuil aon rud úr tugtha isteach aige.  Níl sé acht ag leanúint leis an obair ar cuireadh bun leis nuair a bhí Fianna Fáil sa Rialtas.  Níl aon rud úr im thuairimse déanta aige in áit ar bith ach amháin leanúint ar aghaidh leis an obair sin.  Bhí bun mhaith tugtha agus tá súil le Dia agam go leanfaidh an obair ar aghaidh.</P>

      <P>I will repeat in the second language what I have just said in the first language: I compliment the Minister on his efforts in regard to the Gaeltacht.  I am sorry to see that Deputy Molloy is not here, a real Irish speaker, not like some of the people I heard in the last few minutes, gan teanga.  Many of these were paid to learn Irish.  On the other hand, you have the people in the Gaeltacht who crowded into a certain hotel one day and Deputy Molloy came in and he was expounding on the Gaeltacht. They listened to him for a short while and then one of the men stood up, turned around and said to the crowd: &ldquo;Could any of you here tell me who the last Minister of the Gaeltacht was?&rdquo;</P>

    <Speaker pid="FintanCoogan" hpid="Mr. Coogan Mr. Coogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Coogan</NameTxt>
      <P>The reason for the Bill is to spend money on the Gaeltacht.  Not one of those men &mdash; they were Aran Islanders&mdash;could answer that question.  If the same question were asked now there would be a chorus of &ldquo;Tom O'Donnell&rdquo; because Deputy Tom O'Donnell is an active Minister for the Gaeltacht.  Go to any corner of the Gaeltacht and ask&mdash;&mdash;</P>

I have seen young men in the Gaeltacht who had no jobs because there was no money like this available.  There were young men taught through the medium of Irish and, when they were offered temporary postmanships, they could not take them; the names on the letters were in English and they could not read English.</P>

I believe we have another wise man from the east as a shadow Minister. I suppose he will impose on us too. The only danger I see here is that, if the Minister stands in the Gaeltacht, I will have no hope in hell he is that active.  I compliment him on what he has done so far.  I have seen him burning the midnight oil and travelling the roads of the Gaeltacht. If he were married he would be divorced by now because no woman would put up with a man who was so often away from home.</P>

      <P>The purpose of the Bill is to see how money can be best spent.  We will have the EEC fund in addition to this.  I know the Minister will be very active in having improvements carried out, improvements that cannot be undertaken by county councils.  There are boreens which are badly in need of improvements.  They provide access to bogs.  The emphasis now is on fuel prices.</P>

I know the Minister will be down to see how this money is being spent.  He will always be welcome.  I hope he will see action pretty soon.  I did not like Deputy Tunney's remark that the Minister was drawing attention to himself.  The Minister does not have to draw attention to himself.  He is so active in the Gaeltacht he is ahead of the posse all the time.  He will see that things are put on a proper basis. I know a number of jobs are earmarked. I trust the new authority will be very active in the interests of the people in the Gaeltacht.  I hope they will have the widest possible executive power.  This is a very important start in decentralisation. There was too much in Dublin.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Faulkner</NameTxt>
      <P>Nuair a bhí Rúnaí Parlaiminte an Taoisigh, an Teachta Kelly, ag caint shíl sé nár cheart ceist na Gaeltachta ná ceist na Gaeilge a bheith ina cnámh spáirne idir lucht polaitíochta.  Aontaím leis sin.  Is minic adúirt mé é sin nuair a bhí mé sna bínsí ar an dtaobh eile den Teach.  Ní shílim go dtiocfadh leat a rá gur mór an cuidiú an méid adúirt an Teachta Coogan ina leith sin ach ní shílim go gcuireann mórán daoine suim sa mhéid adeireann an Teachta Coogan. <Col N="203" /> Sfleann muid uilig go mba cheart dúinn uilig cuidiú lena chéile le forbairt na Gaeltachta a chur ar aghaidh.</P>
      <P>Fáiltím roimh an mBille.  Ní gá dom a rá nach inné ná inniu a thosaigh mé féin ag cur suime i gcúrsaí na Gaeltachta.  Nuair a chuala mé an bhliain 1973 á lua cúpla uair ar a laghad sa Teach chuir sé ar ais mé ar bhóithrin na smaointe, mar is sa mbliain sin a chuaigh mé i mbun oibre mar Rúnaí Parlaiminte do Roinn na Gaeltachta.  Cuirim suim fosta sa leagan amach atá anseo faoi dtaobh de &ldquo;caiteachas capitil&rdquo;.  Chím anseo £1½ mhilliún i leith foirgnimh agus gleasraí na dtionscal atá á reachttáil ag Gaeltarra féin, agus £3 mhilliún i leith monarchanna le na gcur ar cíos. Caitheadh an t-airgead sin.  Sílim nár thuig an Teachta a tháinig romham é sin mar bhí seisean ag caint faoi dtaobh de na figiúiri sin sa dóigh go raibh siad le teacht.</P>
      <P>Cuireadh an chéad réamh-mhonarcha ar bun le mo linnse i nGaoth Dobhair.  Ní hé amháin gurbh é sin an réamh-mhonarcha is túisce a cuireadh ar fáil sa Gaeltacht ach ba é an réamh-mhonarcha is túisce a chuireadh ar bun sa tír.  San am sin, níorbh é an gnáth rud é réamh-mhonarcha a chur ar fáil.  Caithfimid a rá gurb iad Roinn na Gaeltachta a ba thúisce a chuirsmaoitigh ar an rud úr seo agus is mór a chuidigh sé sin le forbairt na Gaeltachta ó shin.  Thart faoin am céanna a cuireadh an rud eile ag obair, is é sin scaireanna a ghlacadh i gcomhlachtaí ina bhfuil Gaeltarra agus daoine eile i gcomhairle le chéile chun comh-thionscail a reachtáil. Is féidir liom a rá faoi na ceimeanna uilig seo gur mór an cuidiú a tugadh d'fhorbairt na Gaeltachta ó shin agus is mór an obair a cuireadh ar fáil do mhuintir na Gaeltachta.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Ni hé seo an chéad uair, agus tá súil agam nach í an uair dheiridh í, a ghlacfar le Bille mar an Bille seo. Tá ráite ag an Aire féin san óráid a thug sé gur leasaíodh an Bille seo roinnt uaireannta cheann féin.  Chuile uair, cuireadh níos mó airgid ar fáil do mhuintir na Gaeltachta le fostaíocht a chur ar fáil dóibh.  Rud ar bith a chuidíonn leis an nGaeltacht, beidh muidne ar an taobh seo den Teach <Col N="204" /> gó mhor i mbái leis, ní amháin leis an nGaeltacht a chaomhnú ach an Ghaeltacht a leathnú chomh maith. Tá a fhios againn uilig nach dtig an Ghaeilge a athbheochan gan an Ghaeltacht a bheith ann.  Tá a fhios againn fosta gurb í an Ghaeilge an rud is mó a thaispeánann an dá rud. Is fearr a bhíos sin le tabhairt faoi deara ag Éireannaigh nuair a théann siad thar lear.  Sin an tráth is fearr is léir dóibh a ndíth nuair nach féidir leo an Ghaeilge a labhairt.</P>
    <P>Is mór an moladh atá ag dul do mhuintir na Gaeltachta as ucht an Ghaeilge a choinnéail beo.  Bhí deacrachtaí os a gcomhair ar feadh blianta fada.  Bhí orthu, cosúil leis na daoine eile a bhí ina gcónaí in áiteanna nach raibh saibhreas aiceanta iontu, dul thar lear ar feadh tamaill.  Sin í an ghnáth-shlí bheatha a bhí acu ar feadh tamaill fhada.  Ach le blianta anuas, tá athrú mór tagtha ar na cursaí sin.  In ionad dul thar lear, tá cuid mhór de mhuintir na Gaeltachta ag teacht abhaile.  Ba chuimhin liom féin, nuair bhí me im rúnaí ar Choláiste Gaeilge Rann na Feirsde am amháin nach raibh ach páiste amháin sa cheantar a bhí faoi aois bhun-scoile.  Bhí an chuma ar an scéal san am nach mbeadh scoil ar bith fágtha.  Ach cionn is go ndearnamuid faoi Rialtas Fhianna Fáil an oiread sin oibre sa cheantar sin, ní amháin i nGaoth Dobhair ach in Anagaire agus thart faoin gceantar uilig, tháinig athrú mor ar an áit. In ionad daoine a bheith ag dul thar lear, thosaigh siad ag teacht abhaile agus tá thart ar 80 páiste sa scoil sin i Rann na Feirsde inniu.  Is comhartha é sin ar an méid oibre a rinneadh.</P>
    <P>Is í an bharúil a bhí agamsa i gcónaí, agus barúil atá agam go fóill, gurb í an déantúsaíocht an rud is tábhachtaí i leith forbairt na Gaeltachta&mdash;déantúsaí móra agus déantúsaí beaga.  Le mo linn cuireadh eagar ar Ghaeltarra agus cuireadh an eastát tionsclaíochta ar bun i nGaoth Dobhair.  Cuireadh an chéad réamh-mhonarcha ann agus tá an-fheabhas ar saoil eacnamaíochta na ndaoine sa cheantar sin le feiceáil.  Tá seans níos fearr ag an Aire seo ná mar a bhí ag duine ar bith roimhe ós rud <Col N="205" /> é go ndeachamuid isteach sa Chomhmhargadh. Ní amhain go bhfuil airgead le fáil ón gComhmhargadh ach chomh maith leis sin tá a lán déantúsóirí ag iarraidh teacht go dtí an tír seo.  Cionn is go bhfuilimid sa Chomhmhargadh ní amháin go bhfuil siad ag iarraidh teacht ó thíortha eile atá sa Chomhmhargadh féin ach tá siad ag iarraidh teacht ó thíortha eile thaobh amuigh den Chomhmhargadh i dtreo is go mbeidh siad ábalta a gcuid earraí a dhíol sa Chomhmhargadh. San dóigh sin tá seans ag an Aire nach raibh riamh ag aon Aire roimhe iad a mhealladh go dtí an Ghaeltacht le monarcha a bhunú ann.</P>
    <P>Ba mhaith liom fosta tagairt do rud amháin eile: sílim go mbeadh sé ina chuidiú agus go dtabharfadh sé misneach do mhuintir na Gaeltachta dá mbeadh daoine a fuair oideachas ollscoile agus ar innealtóirí iad sásta dul ar ais go dtí an Ghaeltacht agus tionscail a bhunu ansin.  Seo an rud a chuir an smaoineamh sin i m'intinn: is cuimhin liom roint blianta ó shin nuair a chuaigh mé ar turas oifigiúil go dtí an Bhreatain Bheag go dtainig mé go dtí ceantar tuaithe agus bhí monarcha bunaithe ansin ag fear óg a raibh an-éirim intinne ann, a raibh céim ollscoile aige agus a raibh anseans aige an-airgead a shaothrú in áiteacha eile.</P>
    <P>Shíl sé gur cheart dó dul ar ais go dtí a cheantar féin agus do bhunaigh sé an mhonarcha ansin agus dúradh liom nach raibh ach scaifte an-bheag ar fad ag obair sa mhonarcha nuair a chuaigh sé ann i dtús ama.  Nuair a bhí mise ann ní amháin go raibh an tionscal mór ach bhí sé ag díol earraí le tíortha thar lear agus orthu sin bhí Yugoslavia agus ag an am sin ní raibh mórán earraí ag dul ón Bhreatain Bheag go Yugoslavia.</P>
    <P>Thug sé an-mhisneach do mhuintir na háite sa cheantar mar bhí duine díobh féin a tháinig ar ais agus duine díobh féin a bhunaigh an tionscal sin agus, mar a dúirt mé, dá mbeadh duine ar bith ón nGaeltacht a raibh seans aige an chéim a bhaint amach, dá mbeadh duine mar sin sásta dul ar ais sílim gur mór an uchtach a thabharfadh sé do mhuintir na Gaeltachta féin.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="206" /> Ba mhaith liom aontú leis an méid a dúirt an Teachta Ó Gallchobhair fá dtaobh de thraenáil.  Ba cheart chomh fada agus is féidir é, áiseanna a chur ar fáil do dhaoine óga ins na Gaeltachtaí. Nuair a tosaíodh ar an fhorbairt tionsclaíochta dúirt daoine liom dá dtéinn ar aghaidh leis go dtiocfadh an Béarla isteach agus nach mbeadh sa Ghaeltacht ach Béarla.  Bhuel, cineál Hobson's Choice a bhí ann mar bhí fhios agamsa mura rachainn ar aghaidh leis an tionsclaíocht nach mbeadh duine ar bith ann agus nach mbeadh Gaeilge ann ach an oiread.  San am céanna, sílim go mba cheart dúinn a bheith íontach cúramach.  Chonaic mise le linn dom a bheith ansin áit ar bith a raibh Gaeilge ag na daoine a bhí ag obair ar an urlár mar a déarfá gur Béarla a bhí ag na daoine a bhí ina mbainisteoirí.  D'imigh an Ghaeilge as áiteacha den tsort sin.</P>
    <P>Ar an ábhar sin, sílim go mba cheart dúinn an oiread traenála a thabhairt agus a thig linn ó thaobh bainistíochta dhe i dtreo is go mbeidh Gaeilge ag lucht stiúrtha na monarcha sin.  Má bhíonn Gaeilge ag an lucht bainistióchta mairfidh an Ghaeilge sa Ghaeltacht san áit a mbeidh siad ó thaobh na nGaeltachtaí beaga caithfimíd a bheith níos cúramaí mar dá gcuirfí monarcha mhór isteach i nGaeltacht bheag ní thiocfadh leat an mhonarcha a fheidhmiú gan scaifte mór daoine a thabhairt isteach ón ceantar mágcuaird agus Béarla a bheadh ar siúl i gceann tamaill bhig sa mhonarcha sin.  Ní hé sin an rud atá ar dhíth orainn agus ar an áhar sin sílim go dtiocfaidh linn cuidiú na Ghaeltachtaí beaga trí na deontaisí atá air fáil do na tionscail bheaga.</P>
    <P>Chuir sé lucháir ormsa nuair a bhí mé sa Roinn sin a fheiceáil an oiread daoine a bhí sásta glacadh leis na deontaisí seo agus feabhas a chur ar cibé déantús beag a bhí ar siúl acu, agus go minic in ionad a bheith ag obair as a gconlán féin bheadh, de bharr deontais den tsórt a fháil, triúr nó ceathrar nó cúigear ag obair dóibh agus ba mhór an cuidiú é sin i gceantar ar bith Gaeltachta.</P>
    <P>Ní shílim gur gá dom mórán eile a rá faoin mBille seo.  Mar adúirt mé ag an tús fáiltím roimhe.  Tá súil <Col N="207" /> agam go n-éireoidh go breágh leis an nGaeltacht de thairbhe an airgid atá á chur ar fáil anseo.  Mar adúirt mé ag an tús tá an-suim agam i gcúrsaí na Gaeltachta agus sa Ghaeilge féin agus nior mhaith liom dá mbeadh achrann idir dhá thaobh den Teach fá dtaobh de.  Ag an am gcéanna bíodh a fhios ag an Aire mura bhfuil muid sásta le pé rud atá ar siúl aige go mbeidh muid á cháineadh ach tá muid go léir ar an dá thaobh den Teach sílim go mór i bhfábhar le forbairt na Gaeltachta.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DickBurke" hpid="Minister for Education (Mr. R. Burke) Richard Burke">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Education (Mr. R. Burke)</NameTxt>
      <P>Ba mhaith liomsa taithint ar an Dáil go nglacfaidis leis an mBille seo ó Aire na Gaeltachta, An Bille um Thionscail na Gaeltachta (Leasú), 1974 faoi mar a d'iarr sé orainn a dhéanamh ag deireadh na hóráide a bhí uaidh.</P>
      <P>Anois níl aon dlúth-bhaint agamsa leis na cúrsaí seo ach mar is eol do gach duine a léann na páipéirí tá an-chuid oibre á cur isteach ag an Aire san ghníomh seo atá sé ag déanamh don Ghaeltacht.  Chuir sé an-áthas ar fad ormsa go bhfuil £4 mhilliún breise á chur ar fáil dona chúrsaí a reachtálann Gaeltarra Éireann.  Tá an méid ag dul ó £6 mhilliún go £10 milliún agus tá anmhuinín agamsa go mbainfear an tairbhe is fearr as an gcaiteachas seo faoi stiúrú an Aire agus le comhoibriú ó Ghaeltarra Éireann féin. Cuireann sé an-áthas orm freisin go bhfuil suas le 2,500 duine ag obair ins na tionscail atá á reachtáil ag Gaeltarra agus le bliain anuas go dtáinig breis agus 500 fhoráis ar an méid sin agus nuair a bheidh deire báire ann go mbeidh suas le 4,000 duine fostaithe ins na tionscail atá á gcur ar aghaidh ag an eagras seo.</P>
      <P>Anois mar adeir an tAire is ábhar misnigh na figiúirí sin ach ní amháin sin ach is ábhar misnigh do na Gaeltachtaí eile go bhfuil Aire againn anois atá chomh tógtha suas ag an obair atá ar siúl aige.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Mar is eol dúinn go léir a léann na páipéirí, tá sé ar an duine is taithneamhaí do lucht na bpáipéar de na hAirí go léir agus molaim é agus <Col N="208" /> tabharfaidh mé aon chuidiú is féidir liom a thabhairt dó ins an obair atá ar siúl aige.  Níl aon ní i ndán don teanga seo againne&mdash;teanga na Gaeilge &mdash;mura mbíonn an Ghaeltacht ann. Mar is eol dúinn is í foinse agus tobar na Gaeilge an Ghaeltacht féin.  Mar sin ó mo thaobhse dhe san oideachas caithfimíd féachaint go beacht ar aon scéimeanna a chur ar aghaidh san oideachas chun scoileanna a oscailt nó scoileanna a dhúnadh mar gur áit speisialta í an Ghaeltacht.  Is féidir liom a rá go bhfuil an-dlúth caidreamh idir an bheirt Aire seo, Aire na Gaeltachta agus an tAire Oideachais, ins na cúrsaí seo léir.  Is siúráilte ná beidh Gaeltacht ann mura mbíonn cothú beatha ann do mhuintir atá suite sa Ghaeltacht.  Mar sin molaim go árd an tAire as a bhfuil déanta aige anois le bhliain anuas agus molaim é go hárd as na pleananna atá ar siúl aige.  Anois thairis sin bheadh súil ag duine go mbeadh tarraingt ar dhaoine lasmuigh chun teacht laistigh den Ghaeltacht má bhíonn borradh agus fás le feiscint laistigh den Ghaeltacht.</P>
    <P>Bhí baol ann blianta ó shin go bhféachfaí ar an nGaeltacht mar Iarsmalann Náisiúnta, abair, gur beag baint a bhí ag an iarsmalann seo leis an náisiún ar fad ach mar is eol dúinn anois tá dlúth-bhaint dá déanamh ag an Aire agus ag na daoine a gníomhaíonn faoina chúram chun an Ghaeltacht agus an tír fré chéile a shnaidhmiú le chéile ionas nach iarsmalanna bheidh ann a thuilleadh.</P>
    <P>Né hé sin a bhí ann ariamh ach bhí an smaoineamh sin ag gabháil tímpeall. Mar sin, cuidím go mór leis an méid atá ar siúl aige.  Tá athrú eile tagatha ar an scéal ós rud é go bhfuil páirt glactha ag an tír seo sa Chomhchumann Eorpach agus bhíothas ag casaoid go mbeadh deireadh leis an nGaeltacht dá nglacfadh muintir na hÉireann ballraíocht sa gComhmhargadh, agus is breá liomsa gur éirigh leis an Rialtas a bhí ann cheana le cabhair uainne taithint ar an phobal gur cheart dóibh dul isteach ann.  Níl aon dul chun deireadh sa nGaeltacht ann ach is borradh agus fás atá i ndán di agus tá cuid den bhorradh sin ag dul don bhallraíicht <Col N="209" /> Eorpach.  Is fearr liomsa go mór go bhfuil an dearcadh nua seo ag an Aire, go bhfuil an bhéim á cur aige ar bhorradh agus ar fhorbairt na dtionscal mar mura bhfuil tionscail ann ní bheidh jobanna ann.  Ní bheidh cothú beatha ag muintir na Gaeltachta agus, mar adeirim, is mór an cuidiú ba mhaith liomsa a thabhairt go pearsanta.</P>
    <P>Mar is eol dúinn le tamall beag anuas tá an-athrú tagtha ar Ghaeltarra Éireann gur mó anois do údarás forbartha agus infheistíochta atá ann ná deilbhíocht tionsclaíochta agus cuirimse fáilte go mór leis sin mar nach leor infheistíocht agus eagraíocht tionsclaíochta ní leor forbairt amháin mura bhfuil gach aon duine de shaol an phobail snite fuaite isteach ann.  Mar sin, ba mhaith lion a iarraidh ar an Aire leanúint ar aghaidh leis an rud atá ar siúl aige, sé sin le rá, lár-ionad cultúrtha agus sóisialta a bhunú i ngach aon chuid den Ghaeltacht fiú na cinn bheaga chomh maith leis na cinn mhóra mar mura mbíonn na híonaid seo ann ní bheidh an tarraingt agus an stíl bheatha a theastaíonn ó mhuintir na hÉireann ann. Ní ceart go mbeadh ar mhuintir na Gaeltachta glacadh le córas beatha atá níos lú ná an córas in aon chuid eile den tír.</P>
    <P>Is maith liom a fheiceáil go bhfuil Gaeltarra Éireann ag cur iarsheirbhísí ar fáil cosúil le cuntasaíocht, módhanna oibre agus oiliúint do na comhthionscail agus do na miontionscail agus go bhfuil na seirbhísí tógála chun freastal ar riachtanas an tionscail, dá neartú agus córas dá bhúnú le fostú daoine ar fud na Gaeltachta. Ábhar sásaimh dúinn an dul ar aghaidh atá dhá dhéanamh anois ag Gaeltarra Éireann.  Tá an-athrú tagtha orthu faoi chúram an Aire seo. I dtús na bliana seo cuireadh cúig comhalta nua ann ar an mbord, triúr ón nGaeltacht ann thiar, thuaidh agus theas, feidhmeannaigh cheárdchumann agus feadhmannach sinsearach ón Údarás Forbartha Tionscail.</P>
    <P>Mar adúirt mé cheana is í an aidhm a bhí ag an Aire ins na cúrsaí seo ná forbairt na Gaeltachta a thúirt isteach i mór-shruth na forbartha náisiúnta agus teagmháil níos mó agus níos <Col N="210" /> dlúithe a bheith ann idir phobal na Gaeltachta agus ar chuid eile de phobal na hÉireann.  Do thug an tAire cead do Ghaeltarra na deontais a mhéadú agus a árdú ó £20,000 go dtí £40,000. Ba ghá é sin a dhéanamh ós rud go bhfuil luach an airgid ag tuitim ar fud an domhain.</P>
    <P>Mar is eol dúinn, tá sreath de mhiontionscail ann nach mbíonn Gaeltarra féin páirteach iontu go bhfuil cabhair á tabhairt ag Gaeltarra dóibh. Chabhraigh an tAire agus Gaeltarra Éireann le iad a bhunú agus thugadar breis cúnaimh d'fhonn 28 miontionscail a bhí ann a mhéadú.  Cuirfidh sé seo go léir fostaíocht ar fáil do bhreis agus 1,000 duine nuair a bhéas siad faoi lán tseol.  Is breágh liom a fheiscint go bhfuil coiste ceardaíochta bunaithe ag Gaeltarra chun oiliúint agus gach deis ceardaíochta a fhorbairt agus go bhfuil dlúth-bhaint nó baint níos dlúithe ná mar a bhí ann cheana idir an Roinn Talmhaíochta agus Iascaigh agus Gaeltarra Éireann ar thaobh amháin agus leis an bhForas Talúntais ar an dtaobh eile agus go bhfuil staidéar déanta ar na caladhphoirt iascaireachta a fhorbairt agus go bhfuil cabhair á tabhairt ag Gaeltarra sa mhonarach éisc in Alt an Chorráin agus sa Daingean.</P>
    <P>Mar is eol dúinn tá iarrtha ag Gaeltarra go ndéanfaí staidéar speisialta ar na hoileáin Ghaeltachta.  Is breá an rud freisin gur chuir Gaeltarra ionadaí ar an gcoiste cuartaíochta a bhunaigh an tAire sa Roinn agus a rachaidh chun tairbhe do phobal na Gaeltachta agus an Ghaeilge chomh maith.  Molaim é freisin go ndearna sé taispeántas a chur ar fáil ar an tugadh <i>An Ghaeltacht Bheo</i> i mBaile Átha Cliath anseo tamall ó shin, tosach an tsamhraidh seo caite mar is cuimhin liom, rud a chabhraigh chun saoire Gaeltachta a chur ar fáil do na gnáthdhaoine. Cuireadh an taispeántas sin ar fáil i dTráighlí agus i Luimneach ó shin agus is maith an rud freisin gur cuireadh cúrsaí nua traenála ar siúl chun aonaid fheiliúnacha a reachtáil i nGaoth Dobhair ag AnCO.</P>
    <P>Is cúis áthais dúinn go bhfuil <Col N="211" /> deontais de £100,000 ceadaithe ag Ciste Sóisialach na hEorpa chun cabhrú le cúrsaí oiriúnacha sa Ghaeltacht agus tá iarratais eile is dócha ag dul ar aghaidh chuig an gciste sin ag an Aire agus ag an Roinn. Is breágh liom freisin a fheiscint go bhfuil staidéar speisialta ar chúrsaí iompair agus cumarsáide ar siúl agus go bhfuiltear chun cúrsaí cumarsáide a fheabhsú idir na ceantair Ghaeltachta. Is maith liom a fheiscint freisin gur cuireadh tús leis an seiminéar forbartha d'fhonn an pobal i ngach ceantar Gaeltachta a ghríosadh chun páirt a ghlacadh i bhforbairt eacnamaíoch shóisialach agus cultúrtha agus d'fhonn tacú sa cuspóir sin.  Chuir an tAire freisin tús leis an gcomórtas forbartha, comórtas go bhfuil duaiseanna fiúntacha ar fáil dó.</P>
    <P>Tá pointe eile ann, pointe gur mhaith liomsa luí go mór air.  Tá cúrsaí tithíochta ag dul chun cinn go maith.  Rinne Gaeltarra socrú leis an Ghníomhaireacht Foirgníochta Náisiúnta d'fhonn 72 teach a thógáil i nGaoth Dobhair.  Molaim go hard an tAire agus Gaeltarra as ucht é sin a dhéanamh.  Nuair a bheidh an scoil phobail faoi lán-tseol mar atá agus na tithe seo ann beidh fás agus forbairt sa Ghaeltacht sin.</P>

      <P>Ní fíor sin mar má tá tú ag iarraidh cur ina luí ar an Dáil gur mise a chuir i gcoinne scoil phobail d'Acaill, nílim.  Tá mé ag tathaint orthu an socil phobail a chur ar siúl ann.  Níl mise ag cur ina choinne.  Ba bhreágh liom fáiltiú go mór roimh an obair atá á cur ar siúl ag an Aire seo, Aire na Gaeltachta. Traoslaím a chuid oibre leis.

      <P>Bhí mé ag éisteacht leis an Aire timpeall uair a chloig ó shin, ach ní raibh mé in ann fanacht leis an díospóireacht ar fad a chloisint.  Díospóireacht an-mhaith an méid a chuala mé ach amháin an t-áiféis ó Chonamara, an Teachta Coogan.  Seafóid ab ea a chuid cainte.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="212" /> Ar aon nós, tá mé an-sásta go bhfuil an Bille seo os ár gcomhair, agus ba mhaith liom, chomh maith, comhgháirdeachas a dhéanamh leis an Aire mar gheall air.  Níl ach páirteanna beaga de Chontae Mhuigheo sa Ghaeltacht ag an am seo, agus is mór an trua é sin.  Is cuimhim liom seanfhear as Béal Átha hAmhnais a casadh orm timpeall is dhá fhichead bliain ó shin is é ag caint i nGaeilge go nádúrtha &mdash; an fear deireannach san áit sin a bhí in ann caint mar sin, tá mé cinnte, agus arís, is mór an trua é.</P>
    <P>Aontaím leis an Teachta Gallagher as Acaill sa méid a dúirt sé go bhfuil sé riachtanach aibhléis, uisce agus mar sin de a bheith ann sula gcuirtear monarchana ar bun.  Tá a lán uisce i gContae Mhuigheo&mdash;ceapaim uaireanta gur uisce faoi thalamh é, ach tá mé sásta nach uisce faoi thalamh an Bille seo.  Tá súil agam ar aon nós nach ea.</P>
    <P>Táim an-tsásta go bhfuil an méid seo ar fáil le haghaidh tionscail ins na Gaeltachtaí.  Tá an ceart ag an Aire gurb é an rud is tábhachtaí na blianta seo chugainn obair a thabhairt do na daoine óga sa Ghaeltacht. Dúirt an tAire go mbeidh Bille eile os ár gcomhair le údarás a chur in ionad Ghaeltarra Éireann, agus ceapaim nach bhféadfadh sé rud níos fónta ná sin a dhéanamh ag an am seo.</P>
    <P>Déanaim comhgháirdeachas leis an Aire as ucht bheith ar an ród ceart, agus tá súil agam go mbeidh sé in ann an obair seo a chur i gcrích chomh luath agus is féidir.</P>

      <P>Is mian liomsa fáiltiú roimh an mBille seo freisin.  Aontaím leis na daoine a deireann gur ceist eacnamaíochta an cheist is tábhachtaí agus is práinní i leith na Gaeltachta. I dtús an chéid seo bhí níos mó den rómánsaíocht ag baint leis an meon a bhí ag daoine i leith na Gaeltachta ná mar atá anois.  Bhíodh caint ar shaol simplí na Gaeltachta agus seafóid den tsórt sin.  Ach nuair a léirigh Máirtín Ó cadhain, go ndéana Dia trócaire air, an saol sin ní raibh aon dabht ag aon duine ansin nach bhféadfadh an saol, cé go raibh sé simplí ar bhealach, ach bheith casta <Col N="213" /> in aon áit a bhfuil aon duine den chine daonna.  Tá an rómánsaíocht imithe i léig anois agus na daoine atá ag déanamh iarratas an saol atá ag muintir na nGaeltachtaí éagsúla a fheabhsú, tá siad ar an mbóthar ceart.</P>
      <P>Ceannródaí ab ea an tUasal Faulkner nuair a bhí cúram na nGaeltachtaí air, mar a dúirt sé linn. Chuir sé an chéad réamh-mhonarcha sa tír ar fáil do na daoine i nGaoth Dobhair agus mar atá luaite cheana anso, tá sé an-tábhachtach go mbeadh an bainisteoir agus an fhoireann atá aige, go háirithe na daoine atá i gceannas sna monarchain seo, ábalta ar Ghaeilge a labhairt, agus ní amháin sin ach bheith ina gceannairí agus ina dtreoraithe sa réigiún, mar tugann sé sin misneach do na daoine.  Ní hionann sin ag na daoine as na Gaeltachtaí a bhíonn ag obair i Sasana.  Bíonn na bossanna go léir ag labhairt Béarla agus na hoibrithe go léir ag labhairt Gaeilge i Northampton uaireanta.  Dá bhrí sin, tá sé an-tábhachtach go mbeadh na daoine atá ag dul le bainistíocht ábalta a gcuid oibre a dhéanamh i nGaeilge. Tá súil agam nach ndéanfaidh an tAire dearmad ar sin nuair a bheidh sé ag cur an údaráis nua in áit Ghaeltarra Éireann.</P>
      <P>Nuair a bhí an Teachta White as Tír Chonaill ag caint anso dúirt sé go raibh muinín nua ag teacht go dtí an Ghaeltacht i dTír Chonaill.  Is fear deas, ionraic é an Teachta White, ach, má cheapann seisean gur rud nua an mhuinín i Gaoth Dobhair, tá go leor le fólaim aige go fóill.  Tá eolas agamsa ar Ghaoth Dobhair agus aithne mhaith agam ar na daoine ansin agus ní raibh muinín in easba orthu riamh i gcúrsaí peile, i gcúrsaí drámaíochta nái gcúrsaí oideachais. Ní scéal inniu ná inné é muinín a bheith acu ansin.  Tá áthas orm go bhfuil forbairt chomh maith sin tagaithe san taobh tíre sin.  Tá siad an-mhórtasach as a gcultúr agus as a dteanga agus chuile rud.  Tá fhios agam nach mbeidh an Béarla i réim ansin mar tá an-spiorad ins na daoine.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Dúirt an tAire ina óráid go bhfuil <Col N="214" /> £1½ milliún i scaireanna i gcomhlachtaí ina bhfuil Gaeltarra agus daoine eile páirteach i gcomhar le chéile.  Ba mhaith liom a fhios a bheith an comharchumann atá i gceist nuair a deireann siad &ldquo;daoine eile&rdquo; ansin.  Is dóigh liom go bhféadfadh comharchumann a bheith páirteach ins an obair sin.</P>
    <P>Nuair a bhí an Teachta Gallagher as Contae Mhuigheo ag caint, chuir sé an-bhéim ar fad ar an infrastructure agus is dóigh liom go bhfuil sé antábhachtach&mdash;tá sé luaite ag cainteoirí eile fosta&mdash;go mbeadh oiliúint le fáil ag na daoine óga ins na ceantracha éagsúla ionas go mbeadh siad ábalta na postanna a ghlacadh agus a líonadh ins na monarchana nua.</P>
    <P>Nuair a bhí Rúnaí Parlaiminte an Taoisigh ag caint, ní dóigh liom gur chaith sé acmhasán le Conradh na Gaeilge; ach bhí amhras air fúthu.  Níl a fhios agam an é an casadh clé a thug an Conradh atá i gceist aige, agus, más é sin atá i gceist aige, ba mhaith liom go ndéanfadh sé pas beag comhrá le Páirtí an Lucht Oibre faoi.  Níl a fhios agam cén fáth go mbeadh sé sin ag cur as dó nó ag cur imní air.</P>
    <P>Tá súil agam nach dtiocfaidh siniciúlacht ar bith ar mhuintir na Gaeltachta féin.  San am a chuaigh thart, go mór mór sul ar bunaíodh an Stát, bhí cuid mhaith acu ag imeacht as an tír agus go dtí áiteacha éagsúla i Sasana agus ins na Stáit Aontaithe. Do chlaoigh siad le na ndúchas féin. Níor thréig siad tréithe ná ceol, ná fiú amháin a dteanga féin, nuair a bhí siad i gcéin.  Aon duine a léann an méid a scríobh Mac Amhlaoibh tá a fhios sin aige go bhfuil an spiorad sin ionta agus tá siúl agam go dtiocfaidh daoine den tsórt sin ar ais agus go lonnóidh siad ins na Gaeltachtaí agus go mbeidh obair ann dóibh agus tá súil agam go mbeidh an fhorbairt seo ag dul ar aghaidh, is cuma cé a bheidh ina Aire.</P>
    <P>D'iarr Rúnaí Parlaiminte an Taoisigh orainn gan a bheith ag déanamh bolscaireacht d'ár bpáirtí féin nuair a bhímid ag caint ar na Gaeltachtaí.  Is ollamh é an Teachta Kelly.  Ba chóir dó cupla ceacht faoi sin a mhúineadh do chuid de na daoine atá ina phairtí féin.</P>

      <P>Níl sé deacair cuidiú leis an mBille seo.  Sílim go bhfuil gach aon Teachta go bhfuil suim ar bith aige inár gcultúr agus inár dteanga fabhrach leis.  Ba mhaith liom traoslú leis an Aire.  Is é mo thuairim go bhfuil an tAire ag iarraidh gníomhú ar aon chuma agus go bhfuil fíorshuim aige ina chuid oibre.  Is tábhachtach an rud é sin in aon Aire na Gaeltachta.</P>
      <P>Luaigh an tAire go bhfuil thart faoi 2,500 duine ag obair i dtionscail a bhfuil cabhair tugtha ag Gaeltarra dóibh agus i dtionscail Ghaeltarra féin, agus gur le bliain anuas a thosaigh os cionn 500 díobh agus, i gcás eile, go gcuirfidh siad fostaíocht ar fáil do suas le 4,000 duine nuair a bheidh siad faoi lánseoil.  Nuair a bheas an tAire ag cur freagra ar an díospóireacht b'fhéidir go míneodh sé cén sórt postanna, d'fhír agus do mhná, atá i gceist.</P>
      <P>Bhíos ag éisteacht leis an Aire Oideachais ag tabhairt léachta fada uaidh féin, ag moladh seo agus ag moladh siud.  Tá súil agam, nuair a shroichfimid an Meán-Fhómhair so chugainn nach mbeidh ar an Aire Oideachais a admháil nach raibh an líon sin scoláirí ins na Gaeltachtaí de bharr an polasaí nua atá á leanúint againn.  Tá súil agam go n-éireoidh leis an polasaí sin.  Tá beagáinín amhrais orm.</P>
      <P>Luaigh an Teachta Wilson anseo an tábhacht a bhaineas le lucht oibre nó bainisteoir a chuirtear i mbun aon tionscail in aon Ghaeltacht.  Ba mhaith liom cuidiú leis an méid atá ráite aige.  Tá sé ins an tuarascáil a fuair an tAire ó SFADCO-Gaeltarra gur an-tábhachtach ar fad an rud é nach é amháin go mbeadh ábaltacht ag aon duine a chuirtear i mbun tionscail ach go mbeadh an tuiscint aige féin agus an creideamh aige féin sa tábhacht a bhaineas le Gaeilge a úsáid agus dea-shampla a thabhairt sa Ghaeltacht.  Is feasach é sin do Ghaeltarra Eireann féin; ní gá ach bainisteoir amháin nach bhfuil suim ar bith aige in aon ní ach a shlí bheatha a chuir i mbun aon tionscail sa Ghaeltacht a thugann an drochshampla agus scriostar aon mhaitheas don Ghaeilge sa cheantar san.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="216" /> Tá súil agam go n-éireoidh leis an Aire an bhliain seo romhainn níos mó cabharach a thabhairt do na Gaeltachtaí.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cunningham</NameTxt>
      <P>Cuirimse freisin fáilte roimh an mBille seo.  Is céim chun tosaigh é chomh fada is a bhaineann sé le forbairt na Gaeltachta ach níl aon fhocail anseo mar gheall ar na céimeanna eile atá tugtha agus a bhí tugtha ag Airí eile nó Rúnaithe Parlaiminte eile a bhí ag obair chomh dian leis an Aire féin agus a chuir ar fáil le blianta anchuid airgid do na gnóthaí éagsúla a bhaineas le forbairt na Gaeltachta. Ní shin le rá nach bhfuilimid sásta leis an dul chun cinn seo.  Tá súil againn go dtiocfaidh an toradh atá i dtrácht annso.</P>
      <P>Cuid de na rudaí seo, is léir nach anuraidh ná an bhliain roimhe sin a cuireadh ar siúl iad.  An toradh atá tagaithe go dtí seo ní féidir leis an Aire creidiúint iomlán a ghlacadh mar gheall orthu agus ba cheart dó san oráid a rinne sé creidiúint a thabhairt do dhaoine a chuaigh roimhe.  Ní inniu ná inné a tharla an fhorbairt, abair, i nGaoth Dobhair. Tá mórán bliain imithe thart ó leagadh síos láthair tionscaileach ansin.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Níl a fhios agam an léann an tAire na páipéirí a foilsítear go háitiúil i dTír Chonaill ach má léann sé ráiteas ó Theachtaí dá pháirtí féin chífidh sé gurb é an meon atá ag roinnt acu a chur ina luí ar mhuintir Thír Chonaill maidir le gach rud a tharla, gach post atá curtha ar bun, gach post i ngach monarchan atá curtha ar bun, gurb é an Rialtas agus an tAire atá anseo faoi láthair is cúis leo.  Ar ndóigh, níl sé seo fíor agus tá sé in am do na daoine seo, don Aire féin, nuair a rachaidh sé go Tír Chonaill, don Aire Poist agus Telegrafa nuair a rachaidh sé chun na Gaeltachta, stad den sort sin bolscaireachta i bhfábhar an Rialtais atá ann anois mar níl sé ag déanamh aon mhaitheas do chúis na Gaeltachta agus is é an chéad uair do bholscaireacht den sórt sin a bheith á dhéanamh ar an gcumas go bhfuil se á dhéanamh anois.  Ní maith an rud é.  Rinneadh a lán san am atá thart agus cé nach <Col N="217" /> bhfuilim ag rá gur ceart creidiúint a thabhairt d'aon Rialtas, nuair atá Rialtas mar an Rialtas seo ag iarraidh creidiúint a ghlacadh as gach rud atá ag tarlú sa Ghaeltacht anois, na torthaí atá annsin anois, ba cheart dom a rá go bhfuil na torthaí sin ag fás ar chrainn a chuireadh síos i bhfad sula dtáinig an Rialtas seo i réim.</P>
    <P>Rud an-tábhachtach an rud adúirt an Teachta Wilson, is é sin, is maith an rud é agus is gá i ngach ceantar de chuid ár dtíre go mbeadh obair le fáil ag na daoine.  Tá sé sin fíor maidir leis an Ghaeltacht agus obair thionscail chomh maith le obair ar na feirme ná obair de shaghas ar bith eile.  Is gá é i ngach áit sa tír ach chomh maith leis an obair thionscalach a chur ar siúl anseo ba cheart go n-úsáidfí é chun cultúr agus teangan na Gaeltachta a chur chun cinn agus chun forbairt a dhéanamh chomh maith ar an Gaeilge, ar an gcultúr Gaelach.  Tá a fhios agam go bhfuil sé sin ar intinn ag an Aire, ach molaim don Aire súil a choinneál ó am go ham ar an scéal, go mbeadh daoine i mbun na dtionscal sin chomh fada agus is féidir é&mdash;ní ceart, dar liom, go bhfeallfaí ar thionscal toisc purism de chineál ar bith ach mar sin féin is féidir an dá rud a dhéanamh&mdash;is féidir tionscal a reachtáil go maith agus daoine a chur i bhfeighil na dtionscail sin go bhfuil an spiorad, an meoin agus an croí san áit cheart acu chomh fada is a bhaineann leis an Ghaeltacht. Is féidir daoine a chur síos ansin a bhfuil Gaeilge acu.  Ní leor sin. Caithfidh siad an spirad ceart a bheith acu, caithfidh siad dea-shampla a thabhairt, caithfidh siad a bheith ar an wavelength céanna le muintir na Gaeltachta agus molaim don Aire féachaint chuige sin.  Ní rud é ar féidir a bheith lán chinnte é a bheith ann ach is fearr súil a choinnéal ar an scéal.</P>
    <P>Le blianta anuas bhí an-mheas agam agus tugaim an chreidiúint do Ghaeltarra Eireann a d'obair go ciúin ag cur obair ar fáil do dhaoine ins na Gaeltachtaí ar fad.  Tá creidiúint an-mhaith ag dul dó agus tá creidiúint fosta ag dul do dhaoine eile, comhlachtaí eile agus cumainn eile a raibh an meoin céanna aca.  Ní do Ghaeltarra <Col N="218" /> Éireann ná Roinn na Gaeltachta amháin atá buíochas ag dul faoin dul chun cinn atá tagtha ar an Ghaeltacht. Tá daoine a d'imigh as an Ghaeltacht nuair nach raibh obair ar bith le fáil acu.  Chuaigh siad go Sasana, go Meiriceá agus go hAlbain agus go háiteacha eile ach, toisc an meon agus an spiorad atá i muintir na Gaeltachta, tháinig siad ar ais agus tá siad ag teacht ar ais anois.  Chíonn siad go bhfuil main ag muintir na hÉireann dul chun cinn agus daoine a rinne airgead taobh amuigh den tír seo tá siad ag teacht ar ais chun na Gaeltachta chun slí bheatha a bhaint amach dóibh féin agus cuid acu ag cuir tionscail bheaga ar siúl agus tá an IDA agus na foirne forbartha ins na contaethe ag cabhrú le sin.  I gcás Gaeltacht Thír Chonaill molaim le daoine ag déileáil ansin le blianta anuas le gach cúis forbartha agus teangan agus cultúra.</P>
    <P>Tá creidiúint ag dul don gComhairle Contae ansin.  Is maith an obair a rinne an Chomhairle Contae chomh maith agus fós an coiste gairmoideachais san Ghaeltacht i dTír Chonaill. Is cuimhin liom, mar a deireann siad i dTír Chonaill, nuair a chuir Gael Linn tionscail ar siúl ar an gCarraig, gur thug an coiste gairmoideachais cabhair dóibh.  Chuir siad múinteoir adhmadóireachta ar fáil.  Bhí báid á ndéanamh ach nuair d'imigh Gael Linn agus gur chuir siad an sórt céanna oibre ar siúl in áit éigin taobh amuigh den Ghaeltacht, in oirthear na hÉireann, ní raibh creidiúint rómhaith ag dul dóibh as ucht an ruda sin.  Sílim gur dream iad a bhfuil go leor airgid acu agus go dtiocfadh leo níos mó a dhéanamh.</P>
    <P>Ní féidir leis an Rialtas ná le Roinn Rialtais déileáil leis an fhadhb ar fad. Caithfidh muintir na háite féin teacht isteach agus cabhrú.  Ar ndóigh, tá a lán daoine agus a lán coistí agus eile, comhairle contae agus eile, a bhfuil obair sármhaith déanta acu.  Dá bhrí sin molaim an rud seo.</P>
    <P>Rud eile, pé méid post, pé méid job tionsclaíochta a chuirtear ar siúl i nGaeltacht ar bith beidh gá, fiú amháin i measc na dteaghlach a bhfuil duine, beirt nó triúr díobh ag obair <Col N="219" /> ins na monarchain, le feirmeacha beaga, agus le forbairt a dhéanamh ar iascaireacht ansin.  Beidh gá le dul chun cinn i gcúrsaí saoire ansin, rudaí a chur ar siúl, tithe ósta chun freastal ar chuairteoirí go dtí an nGaeltacht. Beidh gá leis na rudaí sin go léir.  An rud atá ar siúl leis an mBille seo, is cuid amháin é den fhorbairt is ceart a chur ar siúl.</P>
    <P>Ní dóigh liom go bhfuil moltaí an Aire, ag leagadh béim láidir go leor ar na rudaí eile ar cheart a bheith ag plé leo, cuir i gcás na deontaisí agus na háiseanna a bhí ag na feirmeoirí beaga cun slí bheatha a bhaint amach, tá siad sin curtha ar ceal agus tá an scéim nua ar siúl chun deilbh nua-aimsire a chur ar fheirmeacha.  Dar liomsa, agus b'fhéidir go bhfuil mé mí-cheart ins an rud seo, i dtaobh na feirmeoirí beaga san nGaeltacht, cuid acu a bheidh ag obair ar na feirmeacha beaga, b'fhéidir nach dtig leo bheith ag obair páirt-aimsireach i dtionscail.  Caithfidh siad cuid den slí bheatha a bheidh ag obair ar na feirmeacha beaga, b'fhéidir nach dtig leo bheith ag obair páirt-aimsire i dtionscail. Caithfidh siad cuid den slí bheatha a bhaint amach as an fheirm bheag. Sílim nach mbeidh na deontaisí ar fáil do na feirmeoirí beaga sa nGaeltacht mar ní bheidh siad ábalta cáiliú mar fheirmeoirí forbartha, &ldquo;development farmers&rdquo;.  Siad na feirmeoirí forbartha a gheobhaidh an chuid is mó de na deontaisí a bheidh ar fáil.  Is olc an rud é sin.  Go dtí an chéad lá d'Fheabhra bhí na feirmeoirí ábalta na deontaisí sin a fháil chun feabhas a chur ar an talamh, chun tithe feirme a thógáil, chun fálacha cnoic a dhéanamh, chun na rudaí sin uile a dhéanamh.</P>
    <P>Nuair a bhí an Teachta Seán Flanagan ina Aire Tailte dúirt sé gur mhaith an rud cuid den slí beatha a bhaint amach ar na feirmeacha beaga ins na Gaeltachtaí agus i gcontaetha an iarthair go ginearálta, agus gur mhaith an rud freisin cuid eile den slí bheatha a bheith ar fáil i dtionscail bheaga nó i dtionscail ar bith.  Sin an rud a bhí ar siúl, iarracht a dhéanamh tionscail a chur ar siúl, agus sin an rud atá á dhéanamh ag an Aire.  Molaim é as ucht an ruda sin ach ní ceart dearmad a dhéanamh ar na slithe <Col N="220" /> beatha eile atá ag muintir na Gaeltachta agus gur ceart iad a fheabhsú. Is dóigh liom, maidir leis an scéim deontaisí feirme atá leagtha síos ag an Aire Talmhaíochta, nach mbeidh buntáiste ar bith le fáil ag na feirmeoirí beaga ins an nGaeltacht agus is gá sin mar caithfidh an dá rud leanúint i dteannta a chéile, taobh le taobh, forbairt tionscail a bheith acu, forbairt feirme, iascaireachta, cuairteoireachta agus eile.  Ba cheart do Aire na Gaeltachta an tAire Talmhaíochta a thógaint ar leataobh agus focal a chur ina chluais.  Mura n-oibríonn sé sin b'fhéidir go gcuirfeadh sé rud éigin eile ina chluas.</P>

      <P>There is always change and improvement and the case I am making is that this is a continuation of improvements that have taken place down the years.  We give the Minister credit for what he has done.  To illustrate the point I was making, I will take one example: we must have farm development and all the other developments working side by side.  No matter what industries we establish some members of all families will derive part of their means of livelihood from small farms. If the Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries has devised a farm modernisation scheme, admittedly subsidised <Col N="221" /> by the EEC to the tune of 25 per cent, the other 75 per cent will be subscribed by our own people&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I have advised the Minister for the Gaeltacht&mdash;this is for the benefit of Deputy White &mdash; to take the Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries aside and whisper in his ear that the farm modernisation scheme will hit small farmers in the Gaeltacht.  It is actually hitting them now.  I know small farmers in the Gaeltacht, indeed in Donegal, who have had improvement schemes, development schemes, reclamation schemes and so on sanctioned and who have been told now that they had better finish these schemes quickly and, if they do not do so, they will have to opt for the farm modernisation scheme.</P>

      <P>This is one aspect of Gaeltacht development.  It is a welcome one.  In order to tie it up with what Deputy Seán Flanagan, when Minister, and others also, advocated, I am pointing out that we should have running side by side with this development the development of farms from which the workers in these factories will come.  This Bill will benefit people.  That is its purpose.  At the same time we have another Minister taking action cutting across and devaluing this Bill.  That is the point I am making.  I want to get it home to Deputy White.</P>

    <P>Chun oibrithe a fháil do na monarchain seo is gá traenáil agus chomh fada is a bhaineas le Tír Chonaill agus Gaeltachtaí Thír Chonaill molaim go mór an obair atá déanta ag Coistí Gairmoideachais ansin le blianta anuas.  Buíochas do Dhia tá coláiste réigiúnach i dTír Chonaill, i Leitir Ceanainn, agus is féidir le daoine, go speisialta daoine a mbeidh postanna tábhachtacha acu ins na monarchain sin, traenáil a fháil ansin.  Ní hé amháin an dul chun cinn atá déanta le bliain&mdash;tugaimse creidiúint sa <Col N="222" /> mhéid go bhfuil seisean freagarthach dó ach chomh maith leis sin tugaim creidiúint do na daoine &mdash; tá rudaí eile riachtanach, an láthair tionscalach, scoil réigiúnach agus mórán rudaí eile a tugadh go bhféadfaí an rud seo a dhéanamh.</P>

      <NameTxt>Aire na Gaeltachta (Mr. O'Donnell)</NameTxt>
      <P>Ar dtús ba mhaith liomsa buíochas a ghabháil leis na Teachtaí a labhair ar na mBille seo.  Bhí díospóireacht gairid againn ach díospóireacht cuidíoch a bhí ann agus tá áthas mór ormsa mar Aire go raibh na Teachtaí a labhair chomh dáiríre sin agus go raibh dearcadh chomh réalaíoch acu i dtaobh cúrsaí na Gaeltachta.  Taispeánann an díospóireacht gairid a bhí againn inniu go bhfuil suim ar leith ag na Teachtaí Dála ó gach taobh den Teach seo i leas na Gaeltachta agus i leas na Gaeilge.  Bhí áthas orm chomh maith tuairimí na dTeachtaí a fháil agus déanfaidh mé mo dhícheall chun freagraí a thabhairt ach mura féidir é scríobhfaidh mé chuig na Teachtaí sul i bhfad.</P>
      <P>Ar dtús mar is gnách do thug an Teachta ó Tonnaí ráiteas anréasúnta. Bhí séag lorg níos mó eolais maidir leis an ngá atá le £4 mhilliún a cheadú ag an bpointe seo.  B'fhéidir nach gcaithfidh Gaeltarra Éireann £4 mhilliún sul a mbunófar Údarás na Gaeltachta.  Mar sin féin sílim gur fearr a bheith cinnte anois go mbeidh go leor airgid ag Gaeltarra fad a bheas sé ann go deireadh na bliana seo ná bheith ag teacht ar ais go dtí an Dáil le Bille eile.  Chomh maith leis sin do dhein an Teachta Ó Tonnaí tagairt do na hoibritheoirí atá ag obair le Gaeltarra Éireann agus maidir le stáid na Gaeilge, stáid na teanga agus an tsuim atá acu sa teanga.  Ar leathanach a 6 de <i>Ghaeltarra Éireann Tuarascáil Bhliantúil</i> 1972 faoin dteideal Forbairt Imshaoil tá an méid seo a leanas:</P>
      <P>Eagraíodh ranganna Gaeilge i gcaitheamh na bliana ar ar fhreastal fostaithe ón Ardoifig, ó mhonarchana Thuar Mhic Éadaigh, Chill Chárthaigh, Fhaisin Chonamara Teo.  agus ó na tithe ósta sin a bhfuil infheistíocht ag an mBord iontu. Cuireadh tús le foclóir téarmaí tráchtála agus téarmaí teicniúl a chur le chéile.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="223" /> Bunaíodh Comhairle chun feabhas a chur ar úsáid na Gaeilge agus ar chúrsaí sóisialta.  Tá ionadaithe ón Ardoifig, ó na rannóga trádála agus ó na comhchomhlachtaí ar an gComhairle sin. Spreagadh foirne na monarchana agus na hArdoifige chun cuidiú le cur chun cinn na Gaeilge agus imeachtaí sóisialta trí pháirt ghníomhach a ghlacadh i gcúrsaí caidrimh ina gceantair fein.</P>
    <P>Tá dul chun cinn an-mhaith á dhéanamh ag Gaeltarra.  Tá tuairisc iomlán ins an tuarascáil bliantiúil 1972 agus beidh áthas orm cóip den tuarascáil a thabhairt agus ba mhaith liom cóip a chur chuig an Teachta Tunney.</P>
    <P>Dúirt an Teachta Kelly go mba chóir dúinn ceist na Gaeltachta a bhunú anseo sa Dáil.  Sin pointe nua agus b'fhéidir go mba chóir dom breathnú ar an gceist sin.  Sílimse go gcabhródh ceist mar sin go mór. Chuir an Teachta Geoghegan ceist orm ag fiafraí an mbeadh na monarchain ar fad le chéile sa Ghaeltacht nó an mbeadh siad scaipthe ar fud na Gaeltachta.  Is ceist an-tábhachtach í sin.  Nuair a bhí mé ag dul mór-thimpeall na Gaeltachta an Luan seo caite, bhíos i nGaoth Dóbhair chun monarcha nua a oscailt go hoifigiúil. Bhíos ag caint le daoine ansin agus bhíomar ag plé cúrsaí tionscail agus sé an tuairim a bhí ag na daoine sin nach maith an rud na tionscail go léir a bheith in áit amháin.  Is é mo thuairimse, agus táim cinnte go bhfuil sé mar thuairim ag Teachtaí eile anseo, go bhfuil gá le tionscail Stáit ar dtúis ach ansin go bhfuil géar-ghá le tionscail i ngach baile agus beagnach i ngach paróiste ar fud na Gaeltachta. Is furast é sin a rá ach is deachair é a dhéanamh.</P>
    <P>Mar a dúirt mé, bhí sé d'onóir agam monarcha nua a oscailt i nGaoth Dóbhair an Luan seo caite.  Chomh maith leis sin, tá monarcha an-mhór á thógáil faoi láthair.  Beidh an foirgneamh críochnaithe sa bhFómhar agus beidh daoine fostaite ann roimh dheireadh na bliana.  Nuair a bhí an Teachta Cunningham ag caint dúirt sé nár thug an tAire creidiúint do <Col N="224" /> na scéimeanna a rinneadh romham. Ó tháinig mise isteach sa Teach seo i 1961 do thugas creidiúint i gcónaí d'éinne go mba chóir dom creidiúint a thabhairt dó.  B'fhéidir nach raibh deis ag an Teachta mo ráiteas ar an mBille seo a léamh, ach ag leathanach a 2 deir mé:</P>
    <P>Faoi mar atá ráite agam go minic, is é mo thuairim féin gurb é an lánfhostaíocht sna seachtóidí do phobal na Gaeltachta an rud is tábhachtaí ar fad.  Níl beag a bhfuil déanta sa treo sin.  I dtionscail a bhfuil cabhair tugtha ag Gaeltarra dóibh agus i dtionscail Ghaeltarra féin, tá thart faoi 2,500 duine ag obair agus is le bliain anuas a thosaigh os cionn 500 díobh.  Na tograí go léir a bhfuil cabhair ceadaithe ag Gaeltarra dóibh, meastar go gcuirfidh siad fostaíocht ar fáil do suas le 4,000 duine nuair a bheith siad faoi lánseol.  Is ábhar misnigh na figiúirí sin.</P>
    <P>Dúirt an Teachta Gallagher rud an-tábhachtach ar fad a bhaineann leis an mbun-struchtúr&mdash;na bóithre, uisce agus leitreachas agus mar sin de.  Gan dabht ar bith, is gá feabhas mór a chur ar na seirbhísí sin.  Mar a dúras, tá sé mar phríomh-aidhm againn lán-fhostaíocht a chur ar fáil do mhuintir na Gaeltachta ins na seachtóidí.  Is furast é sin a rá ach is deacair é a thabhairt chun críche.  Ní foláir dúinn smaoineamh a dhéanamh air go bhfuil réigiúin iargúlta in Éirinn nach bhfuil a leithéid in iarthar na hEorpa agus sé tá i gceist againn ná forbairt tionscail a dhéanamh iontu.  Ach tá deacrachtaí an-mhóra maidir leis an mbunstruchtúr, le uisce agus gach rud mar sin.  Bhí deis agam i rith na bliana seo caite cuairt a thabhtirt ar beagnach gach ceantar Gaeltachta; tuigim anois go maith na deacrachtaí atá iontu.  Tá fonn mór orm gach rud is féidir liom a dhéanamh chun na deacrachtaí sin a réiteach.</P>
    <P>Os rud é go bhfuilim ag déanamh tagairt don Teachta Gallagher, ba mhaith liom a rá go bhfuil an-áthas orm go bhfuil dul chun cinn ar siúl anois i gContae Mhaigh Eo, go bhfuil monarcha nua dá thógáil; chomh maith leis sin tá <Col N="225" /> cosúlacht ar chúrsái ann leis an rud a dúirt an Teachta Cunningham maidir leis na feirmeoirí sa Ghaeltacht.  In iarthar Mhaigh Eo tá ionad beatha ann&mdash;an chéad cheann in Éirinn.  Tá sé ag dul ar aghaidh go han-mhaith. Chomh maith leis sin, chuir sé an-áthas orm a chloisint le deanaí go raibh comhlachtaí nua bunaithe i gceantar Iorrais&mdash;is é sin, chuaigh Gaeltarra Éireann i gcomhpháirtíocht le Comhar Iorrais chun comhlacht nua a bhunú chun forbairt talmhaíochta a dhéanamh.  Is maith an rud é sin.  Is céim ar aghaidh an-mhaith ar fad é.  Ba mhaith liom comhghairdeachas a dhéanamh le gach duine a raibh baint aige leis an obair sin.</P>
    <P>D'fhiafraigh an Teachta Gallagher cá gcaithfear an t-airgead seo.  Caithfear ar fud na Gaeltachta é&mdash;ar fud na Gaeltachta uile.  Go luath tar éis mo cheapacháin mar Aire, bhí cruinniú agam le Bord Ghaeltarra Éireann agus is í an chomhairle ghinearálta a thug mé dóibh go mba chóir dóibh cúram a thabhairt, ní d'aon áit amháin sa Ghaeltacht ach don Ghaeltacht ar fad. Thug mé comhairle dóibh forbairt a chur ar fáil i ngach paróiste agus an t-airgead a chaitheamh sna monarchain atá dá dtógáil ar fud na Gaeltachta.</P>
    <P>Rinne an Teachta Faulkner tagairt do dhaoine as an nGaeltacht a fuair céimeanna ollscoile agus dúirt sé go mba cheart dóibh filleadh chun na Gaeltachta.  Bheadh an-áthas ormsa bualadh le héinne mar sin agus tabharfaidh mé gach cabhair dóibh.  Is féidir le héinne mar sin a bheith cinnte go mbeidh gach cabhair le fáil aige ó mo Roinnse agus ó Ghaeltarra Éireann má tá plean aige chun monarchain a bhunú sa Ghaeltacht.</P>
    <P>Chomh maith leis sin, maidir leis na daoine ón nGaeltacht a fuair oideachas ollscoile tá fonn mór ormsa i leith fostaíocht oiriúnach a chur ar fáil dóibh sin agus maidir leis sin, mar is eol do na Teachtaí tá ionad ríomhaire, is é sin computer centre, á thógáil anois ins na Forbacha agus cuirfidh an tionscnamh sin postaí ar fáil do timpeall 30 duine a bhfuil cáilíocht speisialta acu in ardoideachas. Tá géar-ghá le, mar adéarfá i mBéarle, service industry, is é sin <Col N="226" /> tionscail seirbhísí, ar fud na Gaeltachta. Tuigim go bhfuil saineolas ag an Teachta Tunney maidir leis an gceist sin 2.0 agus do phléamar an cheist sin cúpla uair anseo sa Dáil i rith na gceisteanna.  Tá géar-ghá le fostaíocht den sort a ghabhann le tionsclaéocht seirbhísí agus tá gach iarracht á dhéanamh faoi láthair ag Gaeltarra Éireann chun fostaíocht mar sin a chur ar fáil, go háirithe do dhaoine ón nGaeltacht a raibh deis acu céim ollscoile a bhaint amach nó cáilíocht speisialta a fháil.</P>
    <P>Dúirt an Teachta S. Flanagan gurab é an rud is tábhachtaí ar fad ná obair a chur ar fáil do na daoine óga sa Ghaeltacht agus aontaím leis sin. Táim cinnte go n-aontaíonn muid go léir leis sin.  Tá sé ráite agamsa go minic maidir leis an fhostaíocht agus forbairt ins an nGaeltacht gurab é an rud is tábhachtaí agus is práinní ná fostaíocht a chur ar fáil go háirithe do na daoine óga.  Mura mbíonn fostaíocht ar fáil ag na daoine óga rachaidh siad go Baile Átha Cliath nó thar lear agus áiteanna eile.</P>
    <P>Dhein an Teachta Wilson tagairt do na comharchumainn agus ní gá dhom a rá go bhfuil suim ar leith agam i ngach comharchumann Gaeltachta. Tá deá-obair ar siúl acu go háirithe i gCorca Dhuibhne agus i nGleann Cholmcille agus áiteanna eile.  Bhí an Teachta Wilson ag lorg eolais maidir leis na comharchumainn a bheith páirteach i gcomhthionscail i dteannta Ghaeltarra.  Tá an-áthas ormsa a rá go bhfuil, go háirithe i gCorca Dhuibhne agus i gceantar Iorrais agus in Alt an Chorráin i gCo.  Dhún na nGall.  I gcás Chorca Dhuibhne tá Gaeltarra Éireann chomh tábhachtach le Comharchumann Chorca Dhuibhne i dtionscail na garradóireachta agus tá an-áthas ormsa a rá go bhfuil tionscnamh eile den tsaghas sin á thosú faoi láthair i mBaile an Fheirtéaraigh. I gcás Iorrais mar a dúras tá forbairt an-mhaith ar siúl ann maidir le feabhsú talún.  Tá Gaeltarra Éireann comhpháirteach le Comhar Iorrais. In Alt an Chorráin i gCo.  Dhún na nGall tá Gaeltarra Éireann comhpháirteach le comharchumann iascaireachta ann agus tá monarchain próiseála tógtha ann agus tá dul chun cinn an-mhaith á dhéanamh acu.  Tá <Col N="227" /> suim ar leith agamsa ins na comharchumainn agus is maith an rud é go mbeadh Gaeltarra páirteach leis na comharchumainn i bhforbairt na Gaeltachta.</P>
    <P>Chuir an Teachta Brugha ceist mar gheall ar na poist atá curtha ar fáil sa Ghaeltacht.  Tá áthas orm a rá gur poist do shaothraithe is mó atá iontu ach tá sé an-tábhachtach ar fad go mbeadh&mdash;maidir leis an fhostaíocht agus go háirithe maidir leis an lán-fhostaíocht ins na seachtóidí nó roimh dheireadh na seachtóidí go mbeadh fostaíocht ar fáil do na daoine óga mar a dúirt an Teachta Flanagan ach ní hé amháin go mbeadh fostaíocht ar fáil do na daoine óga ach do na fir agus na mná ionas go mbeadh forbairt chothrom againn.  Tá sé an-tábhachtach ar fad, go háirithe faoin dtuaith, ins na bailte beaga agus ins na ceantracha éagsúla ar fud na Gaeltachta, go mbeadh tionscail ina mbeadh cailíní agus fir ag obair.  Nuair a bhíonn an scéal mar sin bíonn caoi ag an bhfear ón áit an cailín ón áit a phósadh agus i rith na mbliana bíonn clann acu agus sin é an saghas forbartha is mian liomsa a fheiceál sa Ghaeltacht.</P>
    <P>Is é mo thuairimse go ndearna mé tagairt do gach Teachta agus arís táim an-bhuíoch do na Teachtaí a labhair ar an mBille seo.  Is mór an trua nár thug an Bille gairid seo deis dhúinn chun díospóireacht iomlán a bheith againn i dtaobh forbairt na Gaeltachta ach de réir na rialacha ní raibh aon rud eile le déanamh agam ach ráiteas gairid a thabhairt agus baint díreach ag an ráiteas sin leis an mBille, ache le cúnamh Dé sul i bhfad agus a luaithe is féidir beidh deis againn, nuair a bheidh meastachán á thabhairt os comhair na Dála agus ina dhiaidh sin nuair a bheidh an Bille den údarás una faoi chaibidil.  Go raibh míle maith agaibh.</P>

      <P>Níl mé sásta fós gur thug an tAire le tuiscint domsa i bhfoirm go bhféadfainn glacadh leis cén fáth go bhfuil an gá leis an airgead atá ag teastáil anseo.  De réir mar a thuigimid go dtí an pointe seo <Col N="229" /> tá Gaeltarra ag obair ar £6 mhilliún. De réir an Bhille seo, tá tuilleadh airgid ag teastáil uathu.  Is maith liomsa gur mar sin atá ach tá £4 mhilliún ag teastáil uathu.  Sin taobh amháin den scéal.  Tá a fhios againn go mbeidh Gaeltarra Éireann ag imeacht roimh dheireadh na bliana seo b'fhéidir.  Fágann sin go bhfuil £4 mhilliún le caitheamh idir seo agus deireadh na bliana.  Ó 1971 tá an oiread sin oibre déanta acu leis an airgead breise a fuair siad ná gur féidir leis an Aire tuarascáil atá ansásúil ar fad a thabhairt.  Céard tá déanta?  Tá eolas uaim maidir leis an £4 mhilliún seo.  Measaim nach féidir glacadh go ginearálta go gcaithfear é anseo ná ansiúd.  Is mór an méid é £4 mhilliún.  Teastaíonn uaimse eolas a fháil an bhfuil cuid den airgead sin geallta cheana féin do chomhlachtaí áirithe.  An bhfuil ar intinn againn monarchana nua a thógáil nó céard tá i gceist a dhéanamh le £4 mhilliún idir seo agus deireadh na bliana?  In éaghmais an eolais sin, caithfidh mise fanacht idir dhá linn sul ar féidir liom a rá go bhfuil mé sásta amach is amach aontú leis an gcaiteachas seo.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Sílim nach dtóigfeadh aon duine orm é.  Ba bhreá liomsa agus ní aon airgead as mo phócasa é a rá bíodh agat, ach, mar adúirt mé níos luaithe sílim go bhfuil an dualgas seo orainn go léir a bheith cúramach agus a thaispeáint nach gcaitear airgead timpeall an Tí seo gan a bheith cinnte céard le n-aghaidh a bhfuil sé ag teastáil. Ní fhéadfaidh Aire ar bith eile a theacht isteach anseo agus a rá &ldquo;tá £4 mhilliún ag teastáil uaim bíodh iontaobh agaibhse asam go gcaithfear i gceart é&rdquo;.  Sílim dá dtiocfadh Aire ar bith eile isteach agus an scéal sin aige nach bhfuigheadh sé ón Teach seo an cead sin agus, mar sin, tá mé ag brú ar an Aire más féidir liom a dhéanamh.  Tá gá le níos mó eolais a thabhairt.  Abraíodh sé, más féidir leis a rá liom: &ldquo;Feach cheana féin tá geallta ag Gaeltarra Éireann go dtabharfaidh siad £1 milliún do dhá chomhlacht atáa ag teacht isteach i nGort an Choirce go bhfuil £½ mhilliún eile geallta acu do chomhlacht atá ag teacht isteach i gCois Fharraige, go bhfuil £½ mhilliún eile <Col N="230" /> geallta do chomhlacht a teacht i gCorca Dhuibhne&rdquo;.  Bhuel! tuigfidh mise ansin go bhfuil sé chomh maith socrú £1 milliún eile a chur isteach san áireamh le haghaidh imeachtaí agus rudaí eile nach bhfuil luaite.  Má tá airgead den chineál sin le dul timpeall, is féidir liomsa a mholadh do Ghaeltarra b'fhédir cén chaoi go bhféadfaí é chaitheamh agus sin é ábhar mo chainte.</P>
    <P>Is cuma cén socrú atá déanta acu cheana féin, mholfainn go dtoghaidís, idir seo agus deireadh na bliana, abair beirt nó triúr eile as chuile Ghaeltacht atá ann agus go gcuirfidís oideachas agus traenáil faoi leith orthu agus, mar a dúirt Teachtaí eile anseo níos luaithe, go bhféadfaimis na daoine sin a chur, mar atá déanta cheana féin, ag obair ar son Gaeltarra ins na Gaeltachtaí agus go nglacfadh muintir na Gaeltachta agus muintir na háite annsin i bhfad i bhfad níos fusa leis an tuairim go raibh muid dúthrachtach faoi mhuintir na Gaeltachta as a son féin agus nach rabhamar dúthrachtach as an nGaeltacht nó as an nGaeilge de bhrí go raibh muide mar a dúirt Teachta eile níos luaithe &mdash;a fáil rud éigin as.</P>
    <P>Tuigeann mise nach bhfuil an tAire ná aon duine eile anseo, ná aon duine sa Roinn ná aon duine i nGaeltarra agus an brabach sin acu. Os ag trácht ar mhuinín agus iontaobh atá muid ba mhaith liomsa go mbeimis ag teacht níos gaire don lá go mbeadh muid in ndon a rá le muintir na Gaeltachta: bhí sibh lag agus muide cinnte nach raibh sibh i ndon é dhéanamh sibh féin.  Tá an lá sin imithe.  Tá sibh beathaithe go maith anois agus mar chruthú air seo tá muide sásta na himeachtaí seo agus na dualgais sin a fhágáil fúibh féin. Má tá airgead le sparáilt anseo mholfainnse go gcuirfeadh muid de leataobh é nó go gcaithfeadh muid sa gcaoi sin é chun an oiliúint nó oiliúint níos mó a thabhairt do mhuintir na Gaeltachta ionas go mbeidís i ndon a ngnóthaí féin a stiúradh agus a dhéanamh.</P>
    <P>Ach ag filleadh ar an bpoinnte a luaigh mé agus pointe an-tábhachtach é ó tháinig an príomh-Acht os <Col N="231" /> comhair an Tí seo í 1957 go dtí an lá atá inniu ann nár chaith muintir Ghaeltarra ach £6 mhilliún, is é sin, ó 1957 go dtí 1974.  Níor chaitheadar ach £6 mhilliún.  Tá os ár gcomhair anois Bille ag iarraidh £4 mhilliún a chur ar fáil dóibh agus a fhios againn nach mór dóibh é go léir a chaitheamh roimh dheireadh na bliana.</P>
    <P>Mar sin arís tá sé ráite, agus ba mhaith liom a athrá, go gcaithfidh an tAire&mdash;tá mise cinnte go bhfuil na pleananna seo ag Gaeltarra&mdash;níos mó iontaoibhe a chur sa rud seo, go gcaithfidh sé sinne a ghlacadh ar iontaobh agus nach ceart a bheith ag súil go mbeimis sásta muc a cheannach i mála.  Ní fhéadfainn, a bheith, thar ceann na dTeachtaí atá ar an taobh seo, sásta le iarratas nó tairiscint ar bith ó Aire ar bith a cheadódh caiteachas £4 mhilliún idir seo agus deireadh na bliana gan níos mó eolais a bheith agam faoin gcaiteachas.</P>
    <P>Ba mhaith liom a chur in iúl go bhfuil mé ag tacú leis an Teachta Gallagher, leis an Teachta Cunningham, agus leis na Teachtaí eile a bhí ag iarraidh a chur i dtuiscint don Aire cé chomh tábhachtach is a bhí sé forbairt a dhéanamh taobh amuigh den gnáth-mhonarcha.  Bhí mise ag caint le déanaí le fear óg ón Spidéal agus dúirt seisean liomsa gur thuig sé ó dhuine eicínt a labhair leis ar son an Aire Talmhaíochta, gurb amhlaidh, in ionad níos mó béim a chur ar scéimeanna ansin agus in ionad níos nó oifigigh a chur isteach ansin chun lámh chúnta a thabhairt do fheirmeorí na Gaeltachta, go raibh laghdú taghta ansin agus nach mbeadh feasta an oiread oifigeach ann agus an Ghaeilge acu agus a bhí ann deich nó fiche bliain ó shoin. B'fhéidir nach bhfuil ansin ach ráfla, ach tá mé ag tagairt dó mar go measaim go mba cheart do Ghaeltarra, atá ag obair mar sórt snaidhm idir na heagraíochtaí agus na córais eile atá ag gníomhú sa Ghaeltacht, féachaint chuige, go mór mhór agus muid anois sa Chomhphobal agus airgead le fáil ón Chomhphobal le haghaidh áiteacha cosúil leis an Ghaeltacht, gur chun tosaigh a bheas muid agus an <Col N="232" /> t-airgead seo ghá chaitheamh.  Ba cheart nach ndéanfaimis dearmad go bhfuil feirmeoirí, de chineál áirithe, admhaím, sa Ghaeltacht, go bhfuil iascairí sa Ghaeltacht, agus go mb'fhéidir gur fearr na cúramaí sin a chur faoi Ghaeltarra agus gan iad a fhágáil faoi na Ranna a bhfuil a gcúram orthu faoi láthair.</P>
    <P>Dúradh níos luaithe agus sílim go raibh áthas orainn go léir nach raibh an iomad seafóide ná mórán den phoilitíocht grána ag baint leis an méid a bhí dhá rá anseo maidir leis an nGaeltacht.  Cé go dtiúrfainn pardún don Teachta Ó Cuagáin, ní bheinn sásta an pardún sin a thabhairt don Aire Oideachais.  Tháinig sé isteach anseo agus shílfeá nár thosaigh saorú na Gaeltachta go dtí gur tháinig an Rialtas nua i réim.  Bíonn gach duine lághach go dtí go dtéann an bhó ina gharraí féin agus ní maith le duine a mhaide a ligean le sruth. Bheinnse ag súil le níos mó ó Aire Oideachas.  Sa liodán a lua sé faoi na rudaí breá a tharla ó tháinig sé féin i réim maidir leis an Ghaeltacht, an t-aon rud amháin nár lua sé ná an fógra a rinne sé féin maidir leis na cláracha teilifíse a bhí sé le chur ar fáil i measc dáltaí na Gaeltachta.</P>
    <P>Thagair sé freisin&mdash;agus shífeá gurb iad muintir Fhianna Fáil a bhí i gceist aige&mdash;do na daoine a bhí ag rá roimh dhul isteach sa Chomhphobal dúinn nach mairfeadh an Ghaeltacht ná an Ghaeilge agus muid sa Chomhphobal.  Do réir dealraimh, ní aithníonn sé a chomhluadar nua, mar is iad na daoine a bhí chun tosaigh ag rá nach raibh sé de mhianach i muintir na hÉireann an dúlán nua a bhí ag bagairt a sheasamh, ná an tAire Poist agus Telegrafa, an tAire Tionscail agus Tráchtála atá ann faoi láthair agus a shuíonn in aice leis chuile sheachtain.  Sin iad na daoine nach bhfuil muinín acu as muintir na Gaeltachta nó as muintir Ghaeltarra nó as muintir na hÉireann, mar sin iad na daoine a bhíonn i gcónaí ag breathnú ar mhuintir na hÉireann trí shúil na banríona.  Tá súil agam go gcuirfidh Gaeltarra Éireann agus muintir na hÉireann ina n-aghaidh mar sin iad na daoine a bhfuil ar intinn acu amach anseo dearcadh na <Col N="233" /> banríona a chur os comhair mhuintir na Gaeltachta.</P>
    <P>Ní maith liom críochnú ar nóta den chineál seo, ach, nuair a thagann comhalta den Rialtas seo os mo chomhair ag iarraidh go nglacfainnse uaidh nach raibh suim ar bith ag aon duine i rudaí atá Gaelach nó nach raibh suim ar bith ag éinne ón taobh seo i muintir na Gaeltachta go dtí gur tháinig sé féin agus a chomhluadar i réim, is deacair cur suas leis.</P>
    <P>Ag teacht ar ais go dtí rudaí a bhfuil níos mó spéise agamsa iontu agus is taitneamhaí liom, cuirim arís an cheist sin ar an Aire atá, glacaim, níos dúthrachtaí b'fhéidir ná mé féin maidir leis an nGaeilge agus maidir leis an nGaeltacht.</P>
    <P>Is fear é an tAire ar éirigh leis ar a laghad súile mhuintir na hÉireann a iompó air fhéin agus ar an Ghaeltacht agus is rud thar a bheith tábhachtach é sin agus sa mhéid sin tá mise sásta an chreidiúint sin a thabhairt don Aire atá ann anois. Nuair a smaoinimid ar an gcomhluadar atá aige, agus a fhios agam faoi na slabhraí agus na ceangail agus na srianta b'fhéidir atá air san gcomhluadar sin is amhlaidh is mó a ghlacaimse leis an dualgas atá orm cabhrú leis san leanúnachas atá ann sa dea-obair seo ar cuireadh tús leis na blianta ó shin nuaír a bhí daoine cosúil leis an Uasal Risteárd Ó Maolchatha anseo, nuair a bhí daoine cosúil le Proinsias Mac Aodhagáin anseo, cosúil le Micheál Ó Móráin agus leis an IarThaoiseach, Séan Ó Loingsigh, daoine gur theastaigh uathu an t-aitheantas seo a thabhairt do mhuintir na Gaeltachta mar gurb ann atá scathán gach duine againn.</P>

      <P>Ní dóigh liom go bhfuil gá le freagra iomlán.  Maidir leis an £4 mhilliún ba mhaith liom a chur in iúl don Teachta gur caiteachas caipitiúil ar fad atá i gceist anseo agus go gcaithfear an t-airgead ar fhoirgnimh agus ar ghléasanna do na tionscail atá á reachtáil ag Gaeltarra féin.  Caithfear an t-airgead ar scaireanna i gcomhlachtaí a bheidh á reachtáil ag Gaeltarra agus daoine eile i gcomhairle <Col N="234" /> lena chéile.  Is mar sin a chaithfear an £6 mhilliún.</P>
      <P>Mar a dúirt an Teachta, b'fhéidir nach bhfuil aon ghá leis an £4 mhilliún.  B'fhéidir go ndéanfadh £2 mhilliún nó £3 mhilliún an gnó.  Mar a dúras, b'fhearr liomsa a chinntiú anois go mbeadh go leor airgid ag Gaeltarra idir Mí Bealtaine agus Nollaig.  Beidh sé sin i bhfad níos fearr ná bheith ag teacht ar ais le Bille eile chun an tsuim a ardú go £6 mhilliún, b'fhéidir, nó mar sin.  Obair leanúnach atá ar siúl i bhforbairt na Gaeltachta agus nuair a bunófar Údarás na Gaeltachta leanfaidh sé ar aghaidh le Gaeltarra. Aon chuid den £4 mhilliún nach gcaitear beidh sé fágtha don Údarás nua Gaeltachta.</P>
      <P>Maidir leis an bpointe ginearálta a ndearna an Teachta Tunney tagairt dó, maidir le eolas i dtaobh imeachtaí na gcomhlachtaí Stáit, bíonn deacrachtaí ann agus is cuimhin liom go maith nuair a bhí mise i mo shuí ar an suíochán sin agus mé i mo phríomhchainteoir thar ceann mo pháirtí ar chúrsaí Iompair agus Cumhachta, gur thuig mé go raibh sé deacair.  Rud amháin maidir leis an £4 mhilliún, cé nach gcaithfear an £4 mhilliún go léir roimh seo agus Nollaig, le déanaí tá cuid mhaith tionscail mhóra curtha ar bun ag Gaeltarra.  Tá cúpla ceann eile ar bealach faoi láthair a chosnóidh thar £1 mhilliún.  Do ceadaíodh tionscail i gCill Chártha i gContae Dhún na nGall i mí Eanáir seo ar chostas £1.4 mhilliún.  Is fearr bheith cinnte go mbeidh go leor airgid ag Gaeltarra idir é seo agus Nollaig, agus aon airgead a bheidh fágtha beidh sé ar fáil d'Údarás nua na Gaeltachta.</P>

      <P>I move: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>The object of this Bill is to enable effect to be given to a proposed agreement with Britain and Northern Ireland for the reciprocal enforcement of maintenance orders, pending the accession of the new member states to the EEC Convention on Jurisdiction and the Enforcement of Judgements in Civil and Commercial Matters.  That convention provides for the reciprocal recognition and enforcement throughout the EEC of civil and commercial judgments, including maintenance and affiliation orders, and for that purpose lays down rules of jurisdiction to be observed by the courts.  The convention came into force between the six original member States of the EEC on 1st February, 1973.  Negotiations for the accession of the new member States are at present proceeding but are not expected to be concluded before 1976.</P>
      <P>It is intended that the agreement will follow closely the recognition and enforcement provisions of the EEC Convention and thus provide an opportunity to see how the convention will operate in practice between the State and Britain and Northern Ireland in relation to maintenance orders.  For the same reason, the text of the Bill also follows these provisions of the convention, as far as practical and appropriate.  For ease of reference, the Bill contains marginal references to the relevant Articles of the convention.  In addition, an English translation of these Articles has been given in the appendix to the explanatory memorandum circulated with the Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am glad to say that the discussions on the proposed agreement are proceeding very satisfactorily.  Five formal meetings have already been held at official level, and a further one is due to take place in July.  In between meetings there has been a great deal of correspondence and informal discussions.  I expect that the <Col N="236" /> agreement will be finalised shortly after the July meeting and, if the Bill is passed by the Oireachtas before the adjournment, I anticipate that it would be possible to have the agreement signed during the recess. The actual enforcement arrangements will come into operation upon the making of a commencement order, provided for in section 2 of the Bill, and, on the British side, of an Order in Council applying their Maintenance Orders (Reciprocal Enforcement) Act, 1972, with the necessary adaptations, to orders made in the State.</P>
    <P>At this point I should like to express my appreciation of the fresh initiative taken in this regard by the then Lord Chancellor, Lord Hailsham, when he wrote to me in March of last year after I became Minister.  The goodwill manifested at that time by the Lord Chancellor, and indeed by those of his Cabinet colleagues who were concerned in this matter, has been continued by their successors.  At official level also we have received most valuable co-operation and assistance throughout the negotiations.</P>
    <P>The arrangements envisaged in the Bill for the recognition and enforcement of British and Northern Ireland maintenance orders in the State are briefly as follows.  A request for enforcement, together with the necessary supporting documents, will be received by the Master of the High Court from the Secretary of State.  It will be considered by the Master privately on the basis of the documents before him.  He will then make an order for enforcement unless it appears to him from these documents, or from his own knowledge, that recognition and enforcement would be prohibited on one or other of the three grounds specified in section 9.  These are that recognition and enforcement would be contrary to public policy; that, where the maintenance order was made in default of appearance, the defendant was not duly served with notice of the institution of the proceedings in sufficient time to enable him to arrange for his defence or that the order is irreconcilable with a judgement given in a dispute between <Col N="237" /> the same parties in the State.  As regards the public policy ground, the question may arise whether some British or Northern Ireland maintenance orders made in connection with divorce proceedings can be recognised and enforced here.  This will be a matter for the courts to decide, having regard to the relevant provisions of the Constitution.</P>
    <P>Where the Master makes an enforcement order, he will inform both parties.  The notice to the debtor must contain a statement of his right of appeal, the restrictions on the taking of measures of execution against his property during the time allowed for appeal and the circumstances in which recognition and enforcement are prohibited.  The order will then be forwarded to the District Court for enforcement against the maintenance debtor, as if it were an order made by that court in maintenance or affiliation proceedings in the State.</P>
    <P>Provision is made for a right of appeal by the maintenance debtor to the High Court against the Master's decision granting enforcement.  The appeal must be lodged within one month of receiving notice of the Master's decision.  The decision of the High Court may be appealed to the Supreme Court, but only on a point of law.  Where the Master refuses to make an enforcement order, the maintenance creditor has similar rights of appeal.</P>
    <P>I think I should emphasise the various provisions made to safeguard the debtor's rights.  First of all, he will already have been served with notice of the institution of the maintenance proceedings against him in Britain or Northern Ireland.  Arrangements have been agreed to have these notices transmitted by the Secretary of State to the Master of the High Court for service on defendants living here.  As indicated in section 3, the form of notice varies as between Northern Ireland, England and Wales and Scotland but in each case the defendant will have an adequate opportunity to make representations to the court or give evidence. No final maintenance order can be made against him unless he has been served with the notice and given sufficient <Col N="238" /> time to defend the proceedings. Where a maintenance order is made, he may appeal in the ordinary way in the jurisdiction in which the order was made.  Finally, where it is sought to enforce the order against him here, he has one month after notice of the enforcement order is served on him within which to appeal against the Master's order.  During this time no measures of execution may be taken against his property other than any measures that may be ordered by a court with a view to protecting the interests of the creditor.  Corresponding safeguards are being provided for defendants living in Britain or Northern Ireland where the proceedings are taken here.</P>
    <P>In relation to the enforcement of maintenance orders under the Bill by the District Court, I should like to draw attention to two innovations, both of which are designed to improve the effectiveness of the enforcement machinery.  First, all maintenance payments under orders being enforced under the Bill must be made to the local district court clerk for transmission to the maintenance creditor. Secondly, the district court clerk is being empowered to apply for the enforcement of the order where the maintenance creditor so requests in writing and the debtor has defaulted.</P>
    <P>Up to now I have been speaking of the enforcement here of orders made in Britain or Northern Ireland.  As regards the enforcement of our orders there, the Bill provides for conferring jurisdiction on courts in the State to hear and determine proceedings in desertion and affiliation cases where the defendant is residing in Britain or Northern Ireland.  Before a maintenance order can be made, the court must be satisfied that the defendant was served with notice of the institution of the proceedings in sufficient time to enable him to defend them. The notice will be sent by the Master of the High Court to the Secretary of State for service on the defendant. Where a maintenance order is made, it will, at the request of the maintenance creditor, be transmitted by the Master to the appropriate jurisdiction for enforcement.</P>
    <P>The Bill makes provision in relation <Col N="239" /> to obtaining evidence required by our courts from a person residing in Britain or Northern Ireland in connection with maintenance or enforcement proceedings under the Bill.  Provision is also made for taking evidence in the State for the purpose of maintenance or enforcement proceedings before British or Northern Ireland courts. These provisions will enable the courts concerned to have the evidence of persons who could not, or would not, travel to attend the court proceedings, but who would be prepared to give evidence at a local venue.  Finally, the Bill provides, subject to various safeguards, for the admissibility in evidence of the various documents which must be submitted in connection with the recognition and enforcement of maintenance orders in the State, of evidence taken in Britain or Northern Ireland at the request of courts in the State and of statements contained in documents of a kind likely to be produced in maintenance proceedings.</P>
    <P>I think it only right to point out that any reciprocal enforcement arrangements of the kind we are here dealing with are bound to have some practical limitations.  Orders can be made and enforced only if the whereabouts of the husband or putative father are known.  Furthermore, though the formalities are being kept to a minimum and though the Bill goes as far as can reasonably be expected in making it possible to admit documentary evidence on behalf of parties living in another jurisdiction, the outcome will not, in many cases, be as satisfactory as if the absent party had been present in court and subject to cross-examination.  Notwithstanding such limitations, I am confident that the Bill will benefit a substantial number of deserted wives and unmarried mothers and as such will make an important contribution to alleviating some of the serious human problems of our society.  I am sure it will be welcome by the various voluntary organisations who are working to such good effect in this field.</P>
    <P>Before concluding, I should like to say that I am aware from the concern shown by my predecessor in relation <Col N="240" /> to the problem with which this Bill seeks to deal, and from the views expressed by Deputies of all parties, that there will be general sympathy with its objectives.  If the Bill can be dealt with by the Oireachtas before the summer recess, I would hope that the agreement could be signed and the arrangements for reciprocal enforcement brought into operation before the Dáil reassembles.</P>
    <P>I commend the Bill to the House on this basis and ask that it be given a Second Reading.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DavidAndrews" hpid="Mr. Andrews Mr. Andrews">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Andrews</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister concluded hs statement by saying that he is concerned that the House should be sympathetic towards the provisions of the proposed legislation.  I should like to assure the Minister that we on this side of the House are very concerned with the urgent need for the legislation which is now before us.</P>
      <P>The Minister states that before a maintenance order can be made the court must be satisfied that the defendant was served notice of the institution of the proceedings in sufficient time to enable him to defend them.  This raises a very serious element.  This Bill by definition cannot be enforced unless the person in the jurisdiction concerned is located. While this is a worthy Bill in every respect and while it is one which we on this side of the House consider is urgently needed, the effectiveness of it will rest or fall on the location of the errant husband, the deserting husband, as the case may be.  The Minister may have a fairly good reason for dealing at quite considerable length with the situation where a person is to be found in this country as against a situation in the other jurisdictions, in this instance, Great Britain.  We are anxious that he explain why his introductory speech deals with a situation which arises in Britain.  The Bill deals in eight or nine sections with cases where the enforcement orders are made in Britain and sent across here. It deals to a greater extent with the situation whereby an enforcement order is made here and sent to Britain.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="241" /> The reasons for the Bill are worthy.  It is important to point out that not only does it deal with maintenance orders but also with affiliation orders under the 1930 Illegitimate Children (Affiliation Orders) Act.  The Bill before us is an effort to improve a bad situation which has existed for too long.  We realise it is becoming a more obvious social problem every day, that a greater number of wives are being subjected to desertion as the years go on and consequently there is great urgency for this legislation.</P>
    <P>This is a good Bill but the difficulty in operating it can be seen in a paragraph in the Nineteenth Interim Report of the Committee of Court Practice and Procedure, page 12, paragraph 32, which states:</P>
    <P>The number of deserted wife allowances in payment by the Department of Social Welfare is approximately 2,900 while the total number of claims received is approximately 4,500.  The majority of deserting husbands abscond mainly to Great Britain.  Many disappear leaving the families in ignorance of their whereabouts.</P>
    <P>In fact, my figures tell me that the number of deserting husbands going to Britain, as distinct from any other jurisdiction, is somewhat in the region of 95 per cent.  The report goes on to state:</P>
    <P>Inquiries to the police authorities here and in Great Britain, the Irish Society for Prevention of Cruelty to Children and the National Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Children occasionally result in tracing the deserting husband, but such cases are exceptional. Even if steps to secure his return to Ireland are successful, that does not ensure that she will secure her maintenance.</P>
    <P>The point I want to make is that it is only occasionally that a husband is traced.</P>
    <P>The Bill provides for reciprocal legislation and it is important that such legislation be there.  I am not critical of the Minister because we <Col N="242" /> see he is completing a job begun by this side of the House when we were in Government.  He conceded that in his opening remarks.  It has to be seen in practice how effective the Bill will be when it becomes an Act.  It may act as a deterrent to absconding or deserting husbands but it is important to point to the reference in the Nineteenth Interim Report of the Committee on Court Practice and Procedure regarding the tracing of deserting husbands despite the number of agencies to which inquiries are made to try to identify where they are in Britain in particular.  We are dealing with Britain in this instance.</P>
    <P>The Minister refers to the work done by former Ministers in Fianna Fáil administrations previous to the present Government taking up office. The present legislation is interim legislation subject to our acceding to the EEC Convention on Jurisdiction and the Enforcement of Judgments in Civil and Commercial Matters.  This came into force between the original member States of the EEC in February, 1973.  In the meantime, quite a lot of work has to be done before we can actually accede to it.  It is proposed to make an agreement for the reciprocal enforcement of maintenance orders, including affiliation orders, between this country and Britain and Northern Ireland.  When this Bill is passed effect will be given to this agreement, and an order in counsel will be made in Britain.  It is fair to say that the EEC countries frown on bilateral agreements between countries and that is one of the reasons why we are acceding to the convention.</P>
    <P>The Minister says when we accede to this convention in 1976, when negotiations are finalised, then our legislation will become reciprocal in all member countries within the EEC. On the matter of procedure in our jurisdiction an order is made in the reciprocating jurisdiction, which in this instance is England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland, and it is then sent to this country where it is recognised.  The necessary documents will be attached to the request to the maintenance debtor and they <Col N="243" /> are then sent to the Master of the High Court.</P>
    <P>Another feature of the Minister's opening statement which appeals to me is that he will work towards informality. The more informal the proceedings are the better, within the rules of evidence, but we should have a flexible approach to the whole matter of the reciprocal legislation between this country and Great Britain in the first instance.  After all the documents have been received from the reciprocating jurisdiction the Master of the High Court considers the matter privately after which he issues his decision to the maintenance debtor.  If the maintenance debtor is dissatisfied with the Master's decision he may appeal to the High Court and he has a month in which to do this.  Judgment on appeal to the High Court may be tested in the Supreme Court only on a point of law. Naturally the maintenance creditor may also appeal in the same way against a refusal of the Master of the High Court to grant her a maintenance order and she has the same legal remedies open to her as the maintenance debtor has.</P>
    <P>The order, having been made, is then transmitted to the District Court and becomes a maintenance order in respect of which an enforceable order has been made.  We believe this is the proper machinery to attach the deserting husband but, here again, there is the problem of locating the deserting husband.  Perhaps the Minister has considered the possibility of locating deserting husbands through the British social security system, the various local employment exchanges or the income tax offices.  That would be one way in which deserting husbands could be located.</P>
    <P>I believe this Bill will act as a deterrent but no more.  I do not wish to throw cold water on this legislation. It is good legislation, but legislation, to be effective, must be seen to work and the difficulty in relation to husbands who desert to Britain is that quite a number of them move around the country and, in some instances, they change their names or try to <Col N="244" /> avoid the grip of the income tax authorities and so on.  The people who try to locate these deserting husbands in Britain cannot be blamed for their inability to locate husbands who do not want to be located.  At the moment there are 2,900 people in receipt of a deserted wife's allowance from the Department of Social Welfare. That will give some idea of the problem and the difficulty.</P>
    <P>Paragraph 28 of the 19th interim report of the Committee on Court Practice and Procedure points out that: &ldquo;if the whereabouts of the husband are unknown, or if he fails to contribute to the upkeep of his wife and family, the deserted wife may apply to the Department of Social Welfare for a deserted wife's allowance under section 22 of the Social Welfare Act, 1970. Stringent conditions are laid down for eligibility for these allowances.  These include a means test, an uninterrupted six months' period of desertion and a failure of the husband to contribute to the family support.  When all these conditions are satisfied, and when it is clear the husband cannot be located, the provisions of section 22 of the Social Welfare Act, 1970, come into play.&rdquo;  It is in those circumstances that there is absolutely no point in the deserted wife seeking maintenance through the Master of the High Court as there is no point in his going through the machinery of issuing such an order through his counterpart in the United Kingdom.  That authority means the person in reciprocating jurisdiction with functions corresponding to those of the Master of the High Court under section 18 (3) of the Bill.</P>
    <P>I do not wish to be pessimistic about the operability of the Bill&mdash;quite the contrary&mdash;but one has to face the reality of its effectiveness.  We do not deny it is good legislation but, in order to be better, it has to be seen to be effective.  Its effectiveness will, of course, only be seen when it becomes law.</P>
    <P>There are some points the Minister might clarify for us.  On the matter of costs, section 12 provides:</P>
    <P>No security or deposit, however described, may be required from a person seeking enforcement of a <Col N="245" /> maintenance order made in a reciprocating jurisdiction solely on the ground that he is not residing in the State.</P>
    <P>The Minister might explain that section for us.</P>
    <P>Again, section 13 (1) (d) says: where appropriate, a document showing that the maintenance creditor is receiving legal aid in that jurisdiction.</P>
    <P>Do the provisions of the free legal aid scheme still apply?  My instinct tells me they do.</P>
    <P>Another rather important point arises on section 9, which provides:</P>
    <P>A maintenance order made in a reciprocating jurisdiction shall not be recognised or enforceable if, but only if&mdash;</P>
    <P>(a)  recognition or enforcement would be contrary to public policy,</P>
    <P>Two other grounds are then set out under which a maintenance order cannot be allowed.  Would the Minister elucidate on the matter of public policy and, in doing so, will he refer to the definition or interpretation section, section 3, line 25, which provides:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;maintenance order&rdquo; means&mdash;</P>
    <P>(a)  an order (including an affiliation order or an order consequent thereon) which provides for the periodical payment of sums of money towards the maintenance of any person, being a person whom the person liable to make payments under the order is, in accordance with the law of the jurisdiction in which the order was made, liable to maintain, or</P>
    <P>Where divorce is concerned, if a husband divorces his wife and then returns to this country, will the courts recognise the entitlement of the wife to apply for a maintenance order, the maintenance order in this case being alimony?  Would the courts here recognise alimony arising from an English court decision?  Can Irish courts in that instance enforce the payment of <Col N="246" /> alimony through the procedures provided in this Bill?  This is an extremely important point.</P>
    <P>On the attachment of a husband's salary the Bill appears to be silent. Can the appropriate authorities in the reciprocal jurisdiction attach a husband's salary?  Can they go to the employer?  If the Bill does not provide for that situation should it not do so? If the husband cannot be located, of course the Bill is totally ineffective and the court award to the maintenance creditor will be absolutely useless.  If the husband has been located and the enforceable maintenance order is sent to the reciprocal jurisdiction and the appropriate authority there sets out to recover the amount, what happens if the husband does not pay on foot of that order? Can the authority go to the employers of the maintenance debtor and say: &ldquo;I am here on foot of an enforceable maintenance order sent over by the Irish courts.  Can I attach the salary of the erring husband?&rdquo; It is an important point on which clarification has been sought by various groups who have been engaged in seeking legislation of this kind.</P>
    <P>Various groups have been formed seeking legislation of the type now before the House.  The voluntary organisations which the Minister mentioned include AIM, FLAC and the various denominational religious organisations, the Society for Prevention of Cruelty to Children and so on. They are anxious to have this type of legislation introduced, including the reciprocal arrangements between ourselves and Britain in particular.  It will become important when we accede to the EEC convention on jurisdiction and enforcement of judgments to consider the matter of non-nationals who will in future not find any succour here.  Such conventions will widen the net, but the reality is that 95, 96 or perhaps 97 per cent of deserting husbands leave this country to gain employment in Britain.  It is no use trying to gainsay that situation.</P>
    <P>If we are members of a common community we should apply our laws in common with them.  It is there that <Col N="247" /> we would agree with the Minister that he should continue his talks with people in other countries who are interested in this type of legislation. We are anxious to allow this Bill a speedy passage but I am sure a number of organisations who have knowledge of the imminence of such legislation have not notice of the introduction of this Bill at this moment.  They will be on notice when doubtlessly they will see the Minister's full statement tomorrow and it is important that they be able to examine the Bill section by section.  Indeed, we would all urge them to do so and any representations the Opposition may get from individuals or organisations will be welcome.  No doubt the Minister would also welcome such representations.</P>
    <P>Anything we on this side can do to improve the legislation by way of amendment will be forthcoming.  We may have a number of amendments for Committee Stage.  The Minister told us this matter does not become urgent until some time in July and we would urge, therefore, that the Committee Stage be taken not earlier than two or three weeks' time.  This will give us an opportunity to study the details of the Bill.  I personally have studied the Bill in depth.  However, one would need to peruse it three or four times in detail to get the meaning of terms like &ldquo;reciprocal legislation&rdquo;, &ldquo;maintenance orders&rdquo;, &ldquo;appropriate authority&rdquo;, &ldquo;enforcement order&rdquo;, &ldquo;maintenance debtors&rdquo;, &ldquo;maintenance creditors&rdquo; and so on.</P>
    <P>That is why we should be slow in passing legislation of this kind.  We should give the concerned groups I have mentioned an opportunity to study the Bill in detail.  Having so studied it, they could then produce their views to the Minister and the Opposition and we, having examined any proposals for amendments to the Bill and having decided they were appropriate amendments&mdash;in addition to whatever amendments we might have ourselves&mdash;we would table these for consideration by the Minister. Any amendments we might put down for Committee Stage would be for the <Col N="248" /> improvement of the Bill and would in no sense be intended to delay the passage of this socially just legislation.</P>
    <P>We hope that this will be seen as the beginning of the updating of the whole area of family law.  This Bill deals with the reciprocal enforcement of maintenance orders, to include affiliation orders.  We hope the Minister will continue to produce Bills of this nature.  The type of thinking in this Bill reflects our thoughts on this side of the House.  The actual ground-work was conducted by the Minister's predecessors in office.  It will go some of the way at least in indicating to people outside this House that the Government are reasonably concerned about the introduction and updating of legislation relevant to the whole field of family law.</P>
    <P>I have a number of Bills from the Minister.  They include the Adoption Bill, on which we shall be assisting him so that it may have a reasonably speedy passage.  However, I do not think co-operation should be given just for the sake of haste.  Having conducted our Second Reading speeches and gone to Committee Stage, the Opposition, the Minister and his officials should have two or three weeks to reflect on the Bill before we progress to Report Stage and that is why we would ask the Minister to allow us this perusal of the Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TomJFitzpatrick" hpid="Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick (Dublin Central) Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick (Dublin Central)">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Dublin Central):</i> Like Deputy Andrews, I welcome this Bill.  It is good social legislation.  Deserted wives seem to be a new development in our society.  The number of women applying for the deserted wife's allowance is increasing every year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister is right to bring forward this legislation.  Certainly, we support it on this side of the House. But there remains to be solved the cause of the problem: why the husbands leave, which I know is not relevant to this Bill.  In many cases it is brought about by the conditions in which they live and various other factors.  I have met quite a number of deserted wives in my constituency and I try to trace back each case and the circumstances in which the desertion <Col N="249" /> developed.  One finds that perhaps they were ill-equipped to get married when they did&mdash;probably they were living with in-laws and one finds that that has been the first reason for their breaking apart.  The wife lives with her mother and the husband with his people.  Very often, this is the first step.  Apart from this legislation, we shall have to look at the social consequences and see whether we can get to the root of the problem because, bringing in legislation alone, will not solve it.  I agree it is of some help but certainly it will not eradicate this problem developing in our society.  It is a social and an economic problem and in Dublin it is a problem probably caused by the housing position.  On numerous occasions I have seen people living in over-crowded conditions and this brings the first break-up of a family.  Eventually, the husband leaves the home each night, goes back for his meals but eventually leaves.  Then there is dissension in the household and a dispute with the in-laws and then one finds the husband leaving.  He will lose his job and more than likely his next destination will be England. Lack of sufficient housing accommodation is the root cause in the majority of these cases.  It is a terrible experience for a woman with three or four children to find some week that her husband has deserted her and gone to England.</P>
    <P>As has been pointed out here, at the moment we have 2,900 women in receipt of the deserted wife's allowance. The total applications amount to 4,500.  Recently a woman who came to me was looking for a deserted wife's allowance.  Her application was disallowed.  She received a letter from the Department of Social Welfare telling her that she had not made sufficient effort.  She was a woman with four children, having no knowledge of the law, having no money to carry out these proceedings.  The Department of Social Welfare informed her that she had not made sufficient effort to trace her husband or to get a maintenance order against him.  There are many pathetic cases like this.  Indeed in my opinion there are more than <Col N="250" /> 4,500 deserted wives in this country. There are many wives who when their husbands desert them, stand on their pride, fall back on their families or obtain a job and are no burden on the State.  There are many deserted wives who never notify the Department of Social Welfare and I think that will continue even when this Bill goes through.  But, basically, this is a social problem: to try to provide proper accommodation for families. We shall also have to start in the schools to prepare people for married life.</P>
    <P>I welcome the Bill but I foresee a lot of difficulty in its implementation. First of all, one has to locate the deserting husband and that is an enormous problem.  Anybody who has had any experience of people going to and returning from England will have good knowledge of how these people move from job to job there, especially if they are employed in the building or construction trades.  These people move from job to job in England and, indeed, have other motives for so doing. When this Bill becomes law, I foresee that these people for whom it is designed will become more and more evasive.  This is why I foresee a huge problem in its implementation.  Certainly, we shall need the co-operation of the police both in this country and in England in trying to trace such people's whereabouts.  I am not sure that we have a sufficiently large police force for that purpose although I believe that the number of cases we would be trying to trace here would not be too large in comparison with the number in England.  But, if they are located in England, this will be a very difficult problem.  It is quite obvious from the Bill that no final maintenance order can be made against a deserting husband unless he has been served with a notice and given sufficient time to defend the proceedings. When he is located in England he will be given sufficient time to do this and there is a certain danger here.  How will it be possible to trace him?  Will he be able to go to another job, where the same process of tracing him will have to be repeated?</P>
    <P>I suggest when he is found that some <Col N="251" /> kind of endorsement be placed on his tax form or social welfare form.  If such a person is allowed to roam around England or wherever he may be, it will be impossible to enforce the maintenance order.  When the maintenance order is obtained here, it should be submitted to some Department in England, perhaps the Revenue Commissioners, and an endorsement should be put on the person's cards.  In this way it would be clear to his employers or the Department concerned that there was a maintenance order against him.</P>
    <P>If a man is prepared to leave his wife and family without making any provision for them, he will make every effort to evade the maintenance order.  Unless we ensure that the process is tightened we will waste a lot of public money in making the orders. The income the man receives in England will be the determining factor in setting out the amount of maintenance and a system must be devised so that we may know his exact earnings. We must have recourse to the Revenue Commissioners or the man's employers because it would be ludicrous to ask our courts to make maintenance orders without having the full facts regarding the man's income. It will be necessary to have some co-operation from the employer or the Revenue Commissioner in this matter.  It may not always be easy for the Revenue Commissioners to help in the matter because many people move from job to job in England.</P>
    <P>Perhaps it might be better if the man's employer would arrange to have the money sent here every month or every week.  If possible, I should like to see the responsibility put on the employer to deduct the appropriate amount from the man's salary. Employers are asked to make many deductions of one kind or another, for instance in respect of PAYE and other schemes and it would not be too much to ask them to make an arrangement with regard to maintenance orders.  I realise there may be some dissension between the employee and the employer on the matter but I think it is the only feasible way to <Col N="252" /> get the money sent back to this country.</P>
    <P>We know what happens when maintenance orders are granted here.  The money will arrive for the first three or four weeks but after that the payments cease.  The same thing will happen in this case unless we tighten the regulations, find out what the person is earning and follow up the matter with the employer.  I am in complete agreement with the scheme and it will be a great pity if it fails. I have known of cases of deserted wives and any legislation we can introduce to help them will be welcomed by our party.  I know we can legislate but it is an entirely different matter to implement the legislation.  It is very difficult for a deserted wife to get an allowance at the moment; indeed, many women will not subject themselves to the humiliation of applying for it.  We were told that 4,500 women applied for allowances but quite a number have not applied.  They fall back on family resources rather than go through the humiliation of seeking this aid.  We must make it as easy and as simple as possible for them and ensure that they are not involved in any legal expense.  I hope that in this legislation there will be provision to ensure they are not liable for such expense.</P>
    <P>All of us deplore the behaviour of the man who leaves his wife and children and emigrates to England or elsewhere without making provision for them.  He has an obligation to his family to maintain them but it is getting more common to hear of cases of desertion.  Nowadays many married people think they have no such obligations. We must ensure that a man who leaves his family without making provision for them is forced to accept his responsibilities.  This Bill may help in some way; if nothing else it may be a deterrent to any husband who thinks he can leave an unfortunate wife and family without support.</P>
    <P>As Deputy Andrews stated, any amendments we may put down will be for the purpose of improving the Bill.  It is very important that some improvements be made so that the measure may be implemented.  We <Col N="253" /> will need close co-operation between the police forces in England and in this country.  There must certainly be consultations with the Department of Social Welfare or else the Revenue Commissioners to see if these people can be traced.  I welcome the Bill and wish it every success through the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMarkCooney" hpid="Minister for Justice (Mr. Cooney) Patrick M. Cooney">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice (Mr. Cooney)</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to thank Deputies Andrews and Fitzpatrick for their contributions on this important Bill and to acknowledge the points they have made.  They stated that the success of the Bill depends on the effectiveness of the machinery that can be devised for tracing the deserting husband or the putative father.  This is a matter of administration and essentially not a matter of law.  It is something to which attention will have to be given.  The details of how this information will be obtained and transmitted will require some careful thought.  It will not be a simple matter for two police forces to co-operate in, because it can happen that this particular area does not have any criminality attached to it.  It could essentially be a private domestic matter quite unsuitable for police investigation.</P>
      <P>This is a problem I come up against from time to time.  People report to the police that a person is missing, and I get complaints that the police do not seem to take any action.  There is a misunderstanding that the police have a specific legal duty or function in such a matter.  They have not, for the very simple reason that a person, for good and proper legal reasons, may go off about his business, and it would be quite inappropriate to set the machinery of the State, in the form of the police, after him.  This is an area that has delicate connotations which will have to be teased out.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Likewise, in regard to obtaining information from social security or Revenue sources, Deputies will readily concede that this, too, raises implications of some delicacy.  Indeed, it raises the whole question of privacy.  It is an area of the law which has not got much attention up to now, but which is increasingly <Col N="254" /> coming under scrutiny.  I think it is well settled that Revenue information must be confidential and that it would be wrong that the Revenue should be the source of information to help to deal with these problems.  This is something that, as I say, will have to be given attention, but perhaps there is something in Deputy Fitzpatrick's suggestion that the order for maintenance could, in some way analogous to an endorsement of a driving licence, be recorded on the person's social insurance record.</P>
    <P>As regards the difficulties in the way of getting information as to the whereabouts of deserting husbands or putative fathers, these will have to be examined and eased and, if possible, overcome.  I agree that if this Bill is to be fully effective, the most efficient administrative machinery practicable will have to be provided. The Bill, of course, does not attempt to do this.  It would be outside its scope to attempt to suggest ways and means of curing this difficulty.  The Bill is a technical, legal measure to provide for the reciprocal enforcement of maintenance orders.  It is an underlying assumption that it is going to be possible to detect the whereabouts of people against whom these orders are to be enforced.</P>
    <P>This would be less of a problem in the case of orders being enforced within this jurisdiction because of the smaller size of our country and the more intimate nature of our society. It would, conversely be more difficult for our orders to be enforced in Britain because of the vastly bigger population and the greater degree of urbanisation there which makes it easy for people such as errant husbands to go to ground.  This is, in effect, what will happen: many of them will go to ground.  There is no point in denying the fact that if a husband or a putative father wants to run away and hide it can be done, but there are many cases in which the whereabouts will be known.  There may even be communication between the deserting husband and his wife. The deserting husband may have gone to friends or relatives or to people who were neighbours at home.  These contacts are the means by which intelligence <Col N="255" /> could be gathered as to the whereabouts of deserting husbands or putative fathers.  I agree that until such time as such information is readily and completely and accurately available, the full benefits of this measure cannot be experienced.  However, that does not take away from the desirability, <i>per se</i>, of providing the machinery to follow them when they can be found, and that is what this Bill does and does for the first time.</P>
    <P>This is a bilateral arrangement with Britain pending our accession, with Denmark, to the EEC Convention.  It was not necessary to get the permission of the EEC to have this bilateral arrangement, although, of course, as a matter of courtesy they were kept informed of what was happening.  In fact, there is provision in the convention itself for bilateral agreements in relation to special matters.  The operation of the agreement with Britain will be a useful experience for us, and it will give us knowledge which we can use with benefit to ourselves and our partners in the EEC in the discussions on the accession by the three new members to the convention.</P>
    <P>Deputy Andrews raised a number of queries on the text of the Bill itself. He referred to section 9 (a), this being the section prohibiting the enforcement of maintenance orders in certain cases. One of these would be if enforcement would be contrary to public policy here.  This raises a large question and brings into the discussion immediately the recognition or non-recognition in this country of divorces obtained abroad.</P>
    <P>I would be slow to guess here this evening at the type of order that might come within the terms of section 9 (a), because I think I would be trespassing on the function of the courts.  Our Constitution is specific in regard to the prohibition of divorce.  There has been some judicial interpretation of the constitutional provisions.  I can imagine, but would offer it only as a very tentative opinion, that if parties were English citizens, married and divorced in England, and one of them took flight to this country, an order in that case made by the English court would <Col N="256" /> be within the terms of this Bill and would not be contrary to public policy. I would not attempt to offer even a tentative opinion if either of the parties was an Irish citizen irrespective of where the marriage took place.  These, I would feel, are questions that the courts may have to decide and it would be wrong of me to venture an opinion on them when it is clearly a matter within the judicial area.  But this is generally what is meant by section 9 (a)  and I am sure this is what Deputy Andrews had in mind when he raised the point of clarification.</P>
    <P>He also raised the question of section 12.  Section 12 provides that no security or deposit may be required from a person seeking enforcement&mdash; security for costs&mdash;solely on the grounds that he is not residing in this State.  This is to ensure that a British maintenance creditor will not be prejudiced by a rule of our courts which enables security for costs to be required from a plaintiff solely on the ground that he is not resident within the jurisdiction.  The purpose of the section is to remove any such discrimination in the case of a nonresident coming in to our jurisdiction and seeking to operate his rights under this Bill.  In fact, I am advised that this is a standard provision in international agreements for the reciprocal enforcement of judgments and that it is in fact, a provision of the EEC Judgments Convention to which we hope to accede in due course.  That is the reason for the provision in section 12.  The rules of our superior courts Order 29, rules 3 and 4, give the courts discretion to order security for costs from foreign residents.  In effect this is removed by section 12 in regard to proceedings under this Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DavidAndrews" hpid="Mr. Andrews Mr. Andrews">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Andrews</NameTxt>
      <P>Does that mean that a person applying for an enforceable maintenance order here has to give security for costs here?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMarkCooney" hpid="Mr. Cooney Mr. Cooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cooney</NameTxt>
      <P>No.  It means that a British citizen coming to this country to ask us to enforce an order against an Irish citizen could not be asked for security costs by our courts on grounds of non-residence.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Col N="257" />
    <Speaker pid="DavidAndrews" hpid="Mr. Andrews Mr. Andrews">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Andrews</NameTxt>
      <P>What about an Irish citizen?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMarkCooney" hpid="Mr. Cooney Mr. Cooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cooney</NameTxt>
      <P>Precisely the same would apply to the Irish citizen applying to a British court.  There would be complete reciprocity.  The other point which Deputy Andrews raised was with regard to section 13 (1) (d), where one of the documents to be furnished to the appropriate officials&mdash;in this case the Master of the High Court in this jurisdiction&mdash;was a document showing that the maintenance creditor was receiving legal aid in the other jurisdiction.  This is perhaps anticipating the advent of civil legal aid in this country.  If the person seeking relief in our courts is a recipient of legal aid in her home court then it would be a fair indication to the courts here that the person was entitled to and should receive legal aid.  That is why it is necessary, if legal aid be in question in the home jurisdiction, that that to be documented in the application here to give a line to the court here that the person appears to be entitled to legal aid.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidAndrews" hpid="Mr. Andrews Mr. Andrews">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Andrews</NameTxt>
      <P>Before civil legal aid becomes operative, on the subject matter of section 12, does a maintenance creditor, immediately the Bill becomes operative, have to give security for costs here?  In other words, does she have to have money to go to court to obtain an enforceable maintenance order&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMarkCooney" hpid="Mr. Cooney Mr. Cooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cooney</NameTxt>
      <P>As far as we are concerned, the person the Deputy speaks of would be a wife residing in the UK and she would be seeking aid through the courts here.  Pending the instruction of civil legal aid she would have to seek it through her own resources.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidAndrews" hpid="Mr. Andrews Mr. Andrews">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Andrews</NameTxt>
      <P>What about the wife seeking an enforceable court order in the UK?  In other words, from <Col N="258" /> here.  She wants to get her absconding husband.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMarkCooney" hpid="Mr. Cooney Mr. Cooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cooney</NameTxt>
      <P>She would be entitled to the benefit of the legal aid provisions presently existing in Britain. So, indeed, to have full reciprocation we have to match up to that provision. That is one of the things that concerned me in setting up the working party to advise me on legal aid. I would be anxious that they would report quickly so that in this area we would be as good as our neighbours.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidAndrews" hpid="Mr. Andrews Mr. Andrews">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Andrews</NameTxt>
      <P>If the wife has no money and is living in Ireland and wants to obtain a maintenance order to become enforceable in the UK is she prevented on the grounds of having no money from seeking that maintenance order?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMarkCooney" hpid="Mr. Cooney Mr. Cooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cooney</NameTxt>
      <P>No.  She can seek her maintenance order here in the ordinary way and seek to have it enforced in the UK and the debtor in the UK cannot by virtue of the fact that she resides in another jurisdiction seek security for costs.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidAndrews" hpid="Mr. Andrews Mr. Andrews">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Andrews</NameTxt>
      <P>It is important that we make that point clear from this side.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMarkCooney" hpid="Mr. Cooney Mr. Cooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cooney</NameTxt>
      <P>There will be no inhibition placed in either jurisdiction by seeking security for costs.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidAndrews" hpid="Mr. Andrews Mr. Andrews">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Andrews</NameTxt>
      <P>No inhibition for want of money?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMarkCooney" hpid="Mr. Cooney Mr. Cooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cooney</NameTxt>
      <P>No.  The other matter raised was the question of attachment of wages.  Again there will be differing procedures in the two jurisdictions and our procedure, I have to confess, will be inferior because we have no law at the moment to allow the attachment of wages in the case of deserted wives.  This is one of the matters dealt with in the 19th Interim Report to which Deputy Andrews referred and which I have already indicated in reply to parliamentary questions is under active examination with a view to early legislation.  Thus, in the case of an order being enforced in this country at the suit of a deserted <Col N="259" /> wife residing in the UK, she cannot ask the court here to go to her husband's employer and attach his wages.  She has to rely on the present legal machinery for recovering that debt and that machinery at the moment is execution or attachment of the person by imprisonment if the other means of execution against his goods fails.  On the other hand, if the deserted wife is an Irish resident and the husband is in England and the order is enforced in England under this reciprocal measure, she then can take advantage of the English legislation to enable wages earned in England by the husband to be attached.  This is another area in which we have to catch up and I hope we will catch up fairly quickly.</P>
      <P>They are the points that were raised in the debate.  The only other point I want to make is in regard to a point that Deputy Andrews made about interested parties getting notice of this debate.  They will of course read all the debate but in addition the Deputies will be glad to know that I have sent copies of the Bill and memorandum to the bodies which he actually named here and I would welcome their views.  I would welcome their views, as he has indicated he would welcome their views, to assist us on Committee Stage.  However, it is important to point out that their views may be concerned mainly with the basic problem raised in the debate and that is how to trace the deserting husband.  The Bill is essentially a technical legal one to provide for the machinery of reciprocal enforcement if and when the deserting husband or putative father has been traced. Nevertheless, views would be welcome because the procedural difficulties of gathering information to enable the machinery to be effective are formidable and the more people who give attention to solving them the better.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is not much more for me to say except to thank Deputies for their contributions.  The Bill is obviously desirable if it is going to close a loophole which some irresponsible people availed of.  We have to be grateful to the authorities on the other side for their co-operation in getting it through <Col N="260" /> because essentially it is a reciprocal measure and I think it will be of more benefit to this jurisdiction than to the other because unfortunately the traffic in deserting husbands is, to all intents and purposes one way.  We have to say this and have to say it with regret.  It is a very useful measure to have on our Statute Book if it in any way curbs or inhibits that traffic.  I am grateful for the way in which it has been received by the House.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JosephMcLoughlin" hpid="Mr. McLaughlin Mr. McLaughlin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McLaughlin</NameTxt>
      <P>Since speaking yesterday evening I had some time to look over the Parliamentary Secretary's speech and I must again congratulate him on the way he has distributed the money at his disposal. I see that a sum of £368,000 is being provided for works for the Department of Justice, mainly for the erection of new Garda stations.  That is a generous sum.  I noticed that there is only about £1,000 for married quarters for the Garda Síochána but we must be fair to the Parliamentary Secretary.  He must bide his time until he gets money.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Parliamentary Secretary said that expenditure on the building and improvement of primary schools last year was approximately £6,600,000 which represented an average expenditure of approximately £550,000 per month.  When we find a Parliamentary Secretary spending well over half a million pounds per month he <Col N="262" /> is doing very well.  No matter where it is being spent it is being spent for the betterment of our schools and our children.  He also said:</P>
    <P>The amount included for school building and improvement in the estimate for the current period of nine months is £5,030,000 and this will enable the monthly expenditure rate of last year to be maintained. A large proportion of the money will again be spent on the erection of schools in newly developing areas of towns and cities.</P>
    <P>That is very encouraging.  While in some areas we may be a little discouraged by the slow progress that is being made we must remember that it takes time to get around to all improvements. They cannot all be carried out at the one time.</P>
    <P>The Parliamentary Secretary also said:</P>
    <P>The provision of special schools for physically and mentally handicapped children is continuing. Works were completed last year on six new schools.  Works are at present in progress in 14 such schools and 11 projects are at various stages of preparation.</P>
    <P>Again the Government must be proud of such an achievement.  This is one thing for which we have been asking. The schools for handicapped children are ones we are particularly anxious to see provided because it is very discouraging to have people who have a young boy or girl who is handicapped and are most anxious to get him or her placed in a school, coming to one seeking help in this regard.  In one year alone the Parliamentary Secretary can say that six new schools were built and that there are 14 projects on hands.  That is very encouraging. Our people will have no need to worry about progress if we can continue on those lines.</P>
    <P>The Parliamentary Secretary said:</P>
    <P>In addition to the works covered by the Estimate, the Office of Public Works will carry out for the Department of Posts and Telegraphs works in conjunction with the telephone services estimated to cost <Col N="263" /> about £1,200,000, which will be met from the telephone capital account.</P>
    <P>That is something else that will be very much welcomed by the people because we often have chaos in the country because of telephones.  When we have to use the telephone we become very annoyed at the long delays we experience. Most people are in a hurry nowadays and they use telephones frequently.  We should certainly be able to make progress in providing a better telephone service with the expenditure of £1,200,000. Most Deputies get requests from their constituents about the provision of telephones.  We now hope that many of them will be provided with them in the very near future.</P>
    <P>I hope the Board of Works can allocate increased expenditure for the improvement of some of our schools. If water and sewerage were laid on it would make a great difference to existing schools while they are waiting for new schools to be built.  When a new school is planned it takes a few years before it is provided.  I know of a case where a school was in very poor condition and the parents were worried about the conditions their children had to work in.  There were bad feelings between the parents and the school manager.  A small temporary job costing £700 sorted out the problem in that school and it was used for a further four years.  The Board of Works should ensure that many more old schools are repaired on a temporary basis.</P>
    <P>I had a deputation yesterday in relation to a school where the contribution cannot be collected.  The Board of Works cannot begin erection of a new school until the Department of Education state the allocation they will give. Before this can be done the local people have to provide their allocation but this very often takes time.  The delay caused by the contribution question in the school I mention will cost up to £10,000 over a period of four years on a £40,000 building.  If a quick decision were given it would save thousands of pounds on the erection of many of those schools.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="264" /> I should like to mention tourism.  I put a few proposals to the Board of Works in relation to tourism and asked if a small grant could be allocated for the erection of a road from Dromahair to Sligo which would give access to Lough Gill.  This would bring extra tourists to the area during the summer months.  So far nothing has been done about this.  I have been asked by many of my constituents why this access road to Lough Gill has not been provided. I would like the Parliamentary Secretary to do something about it.</P>
    <P>The cost of fuel has increased considerably in recent years.  Many homes have central heating but the vast majority of them still have to burn coal, timber and turf.  A cwt. of coal today costs £2.  This is a very great burden on many people.  Wages and transport costs are increasing so naturally the price of coal will go up further.  We have an amount of good bogland in this country and we often ask about having it drained and having access roads provided.  Some years ago we had bog development schemes and minor employment schemes.  When Deputy J. Gibbons was Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Finance he stated he was getting rid of the bog development schemes and the minor employment schemes.  I said at that time it was a sad day when no money was allocated for the development of bog roads.  When you leave it to the public to maintain and repair those roads the work is not done.</P>

      <P>I would like to remind the Parliamentary Secretary that I regard drainage as one of the most important matters relating to his Department because we have many rivers in my constituency doing untold damage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="265" /> In conclusion, I would appeal to the Parliamentary Secretary to arrange to have notices erected warning people of those parts of rivers which are dangerous.  Only recently two young people were drowned.  This accident might not have happened had there been a notice warning them of the danger at that point on the river.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesLeonard" hpid="Mr. Leonard Mr. Leonard">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Leonard</NameTxt>
      <P>There are some matters in this Estimate that I welcome and there are others in regard to which I am disappointed.  I welcome the provision of a new customs station to be erected this year in Monaghan.  The present building on the main Dublin-Derry road is a traffic hazard because of the large articulated lorries and tanker trucks parked on each side of the road.  High ranking officers of the Garda Síochána and district justices have commented on this hazard.  I would ask the Parliamentary Secretary to ensure there will be adequate parking facilities when the new building is erected.  A growing volume of merchandise is crossing the Border daily and it looks as if it will continue to grow.</P>
      <P>The disappointing aspect of the Estimate is the amount provided for drainage, a mere £1,035,000.  This money is provided for work actually in progress.  There is no provision for new schemes this year.  Many of us thought that, with our entry into the EEC, more money would have been provided for drainage.  It is part of rural development and we had pinned our hopes on money being provided. Whether our representatives did not make a hard enough fight I do not know.  Possibly at some time in the future some funds will be made available for drainage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In my constituency most drainage schemes would have to be worked in conjunction and co-operation with the Northern authorities because quite a number of rivers in my constituency&mdash;the Forde, the Finn, the Dromore and the Blackwater&mdash;flow into Northern Ireland.  In reply to a Parliamentary Question recently the Parliamentary Secretary said that <Col N="266" /> 12,000 acres were affected by two rivers.  He had the figures for these but he did not have the figures for others.  That will give the House an indication of how serious the problem is.  A farmer may try to drain and fertilise his land but he can do nothing with land that is liable to flooding.  We have heard a good deal about this cost/benefit analysis done by the Board of Works some years ago.  One wonders now whether that analysis was not carried out too early remembering how costs have increased since then, to say nothing of the fall in the value of money.</P>
    <P>The possibility is that, no matter how commendable arterial drainage may be, in the future drainage schemes will have to be done by local effort. I believe that if money were provided at county level or under the land project scheme some very necessary drainage jobs could be done.  On the Dromore river in the Ballybay-Cootehill area the river bed consists of rock. Blasting this rock would probably relieve a good deal of flooding.  It might not completely eliminate it, but it would reduce it and leave more land available for agricultural development. There are also blockages caused by silting or fallen trees.</P>
    <P>Again, there are a number of bridges badly in need of repair.  As a result of correspondence I have discovered that the Board of Works are not responsible for either the repair or maintenance of these bridges.  They have recommended in some cases that those concerned should apply for a farm improvements grant.  Repairing these bridges could involve much expense and a great deal of work.  If there was a county drainage committee these problems could be tackled at local level.  I raise this because of a reply to a Parliamentary Question in this House.  The Parliamentary Secretary said that he could not say when the drainage of the Finn river would be carried out.  He said that a joint survey of the river by the Office of Public Works and the Northern Ministry of Finance had been completed but that the design of the scheme awaits receipt of further information which had been requested from the Northern Ireland <Col N="267" /> Authorities.  There was a reply in the Northern Assembly to the effect that the Office of Public Works had put forward certain proposals for consideration but that it had not been possible, for security reasons, for the Northern Ministry of Finance to carry out the necessary detailed survey.  It was said that as soon as the security situation permitted, the survey would be carried out.</P>
    <P>From these replies indications are that it will be a long time before the drainage of this river can be undertaken and I would ask the Parliamentary Secretary to provide money at county level or through the land project to have schemes carried out on tributaries of those rivers so as to provide partial elimination of flooding.</P>
    <P>As well as dredging such rivers, later maintenance is extremely important. One river comes to mind.  It was dredged in the early thirties, there was a charge on the farmers concerned for its maintenance and this was carried out by Monaghan County Council.  It is still being carried out. The amount of work is small&mdash;cutting scrub and throwing out silt.  It was done manually but in recent years it has been done by diggers.  That river never got into bad repair. Another river was dredged under Marshall Aid about 1948-49, during the term of the first Coalition Government. However, there is no maintenance done on that river, even the silt was not cleared, and the result is that it has become completely overgrown. As I have said, maintenance is most important and the Parliamentary Secretary should ensure that money is provided for it from the World Bank, for some form of EEC funds, or from taxation.  If money were spent even at county level it would relieve a lot of flooding.</P>
    <P>Another matter to which I should like to draw attention is the erection and repair of Garda barracks.  In this Estimate £368,000 has been provided for this work.  During the debate on the Estimate for the Department of Justice I spoke on the need for new Garda stations in Monaghan town <Col N="268" /> and Castleblayney.  I told the Minister for Justice that the Monaghan barracks is the headquarters for the Monaghan-Cavan division and their area of jurisdiction along the Border stretches almost from the Irish sea to the Atlantic.  Since then, events have made it important that these barracks should be able to provide accommodation for the extra gardaí who have been drafted into the area. Indeed, more gardaí may be added.</P>
    <P>In that debate I mentioned also that in 1973 of the ten new stations completed only one was in the Border area, in Belturbet, and that of the seven in the course of erection only one was in a Border area.  More new barracks are needed, particularly in Border areas, considering the number of extra gardaí now at work there.  In this connection I would also ask that extra recreational facilities be provided for the young gardaí who have to work there.</P>
    <P>On schools, prefabricated buildings are being provided and they seem to be very short-lived.  As well, when they are erected close to existing schools they are very unsightly.  The Office of Public Works should press for more solid structures.  I have a complaint as well in regard to some of the schools built in recent years.  I had occasion to call at a school built only eight or ten years ago.  It was a fine building at the time and it had a large amount of glass but now the framework has completely decayed making it look as if the materials used were not top quality.  Care should be taken in this regard and there should be strict examination of materials.</P>
    <P>While on the subject of schools I have another complaint.  A number of contractors, one a main contractor and one a sub-contractor, have told me about delays in payments by the Board of Works.  One of them informed me he has been almost two years awaiting full payment.  This is much too long. When a contractor completes his work to the satisfaction of the Board of Works he should be paid the contract price.</P>
    <P>I should like to deal briefly with public buildings.  Many quarters and public buildings, the responsibility of <Col N="269" /> the Board of Works, are below accepted modern standards.  While I appreciate that money is a factor here, efforts should be made to make them as presentable as possible.</P>
    <P>National parks were mentioned also in the Estimate and it was stated that the commissioners have no compulsory powers for the acquisition of properties. Many estates which came on the market were acquired by the Land Commission and these should, if at all possible, have been taken over by the Board of Works and preserved, especially those situated convenient to towns.</P>
    <P>Those are all the points I wish to make except to stress on the Parliamentary Secretary the need to secure more money for drainage especially in the Border counties.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FrancisTaylor" hpid="Mr. Taylor Mr. Taylor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>This is an important Estimate because, generally speaking, the Board of Works is the agency for Government Departments and the work carried out by them is widespread. I notice under subhead E,&mdash; Houses of the Oireachtas&mdash;Leinster House&mdash;installation of stand-by generators, and so on.  Of course, that is necessary because we have had to carry on the business of this House in candlelight on more than one occasion.  There is no reason why provision should not be made for proper lighting here at all times.  This brings me to the question of the heating system in Leinster House which, for most people who work here&mdash;and that includes Civil Service staff as well as Deputies and Senators&mdash;is most unsatisfactory.  In my opinion the heating has not been properly controlled.  It is either too hot when the weather is hot and vice versa.  Something should be done at this stage to ensure proper control of the heat.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I find there is provision made for development work at Mountshannon, County Clare, which we welcome in that eastern part of the county.  I am referring to the extension of the pier at Mountshannon.  We hope that other necessary works will be undertaken as they arise.  Then there is the Shannon navigation, for which there has been an estimate; an extension of <Col N="270" /> the quay at Rossmore and so on, all of which are very necessary.</P>
    <P>In rural areas we hear many complaints because the Board of Works, which in the past undertook development work in areas where peat bogs were under-developed and where roads and drainage were necessary, no longer accept responsibility for this work.  I can foresee this leading to a serious situation.  Neither do the Land Commission accept responsibility for the provision of new roads or the maintenance of existing ones and that is a serious matter particularly at a time when the provision of energy to keep essential supplies of fuel going is so important.  Despite the excellent image the Parliamentary Secretary has given to this office, I should like him to be given greater responsibility and more scope to develop his talents.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DenisJones" hpid="An Leas-Cheann Comhairle Denis Francis Jones">
      <NameTxt>An Leas-Cheann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>That would need legislation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrancisTaylor" hpid="Mr. Taylor Mr. Taylor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>Legislation could be considered if it was in the interests of the people who need the particular service.  I am speaking for a people in a rural area who are without this service.  I should like to see the Board of Works having responsibility to do the job of which I think they are well capable.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DenisJones" hpid="An Leas-Cheann Comhairle Denis Francis Jones">
      <NameTxt>An Leas-Cheann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>The point the Chair is making is that on an Estimate one cannot advocate legislation.  The Deputy may do so at some other stage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrancisTaylor" hpid="Mr. Taylor Mr. Taylor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>I accept the ruling of the Chair in this matter.  I was merely referring to the inadequacy of a service which would provide adequate fuel in an emergency period to so many people in towns and rural areas.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In referring to road making, I regret the provision which gave the Board of Works authority to do drainage work.  It seems to have been passed on to the local authority but, when that was done, unfortunately, adequate provision was not made to give those local authorities adequate funds with which to administer the schemes properly.  That was a rather <Col N="271" /> skimpy approach to this service.  At that time, when the Board of Works knew the costs involved, adequate funds should have been allocated to local authorities all over the country with which to provide this service which they are now undertaking and which the ratepayers are subsidising.</P>
    <P>I am not criticising the Board of Works or the Parliamentary Secretary but there seems to be discontent about catchment areas and particular areas where drainage is necessary.  Judging from replies given to questions over a number of years, it will take too long before the necessary drainage is undertaken.  Here I refer in particular to the many rivers needing urgent attention in County Clare, which can be described as a rather flat county with many tributaries running into the Shannon and out to the Atlantic.  I refer particularly to the river Fergus, near Ennis, and the thousands of acres adjoining the Fergus, north of that town, right to the area where it flows into the Shannon, where there is such an urgent need for proper drainage.  This has been the subject of controversy for a long period and I should like the Parliamentary Secretary to focus his attention on this matter.</P>
    <P>Time and again, members of Clare County Council have commented on the many rivers in the county for which the Office of Public Works will not accept responsibility.  Anyone who appreciates the work of the small farmer will understand the importance of the loss of land to the owner.  Nowadays farmers have to pay high rates and must meet the increased cost of living; consequently it is vital that a national drainage scheme be introduced to ensure that all the measures may be implemented in full.  During the years this matter has been neglected and the farmers have had to suffer a serious loss of income.</P>
    <P>Consideration should be given to the provision of proper living accommodation in Garda stations and to any necessary work of decoration. Even in this city, going back to the days of the British, certain police stations were condemned.  However, <Col N="272" /> despite the fact that plans are ready, work has not been undertaken.  I am not blaming the Parliamentary Secretary who has been in office for only a short period.  He has shown an interest in dealing with these problems.</P>
    <P>In County Clare there are many Garda stations where the necessary facilities have not been provided; these are in areas from Loop Head to Killaloe in the east.  The Parliamentary Secretary and his staff should consider the question of reconstruction and decoration of Garda stations. We must provide the best accommodation for the gardaí, to whom we owe so much and on whom we must depend in the future.</P>
    <P>A policy has been introduced with regard to national schools which does not seem to be sensible &mdash; I am referring to the closure of schools where there is a small attendance of pupils. When pupils are transferred to a larger school, it is frequently found that there is not adequate accommodation for them, nor is a bus service provided.  There should be greater understanding between the Department of Education and the Office of Public Works before schools are closed.  In my own parish in the past week I have found a tender has been accepted for a school.  In future the necessary buildings should be erected before schools are closed.</P>
    <P>In County Clare young energetic fishermen are purchasing boats in greater numbers but it will be necessary for the Office of Public Works to show their interest and make adequate provision for the potential increase in fish catches.  I refer in particular to harbours along the west coast.  A survey has been carried out by An Bórd Iascaigh Mhara and the Department's officials at Dunbeg; progress has been made in Quilty but in Liscannor and Bell Harbour there is demand for better landing facilities. I do not know if the Office of Public Works have responsibility for clearing the muddy deposits that are evident in our harbours.  If they have, they should arrange to have this cleaning done annually so that the engines and propellers of the boats will not get fouled.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="273" /> The service the Office of Public Works provide is countrywide.  I realise that it may be difficult to acquire property in order to have buildings erected and consequently the period of time that elapses before work commences on a project may be long.  I compliment the Parliamentary Secretary on the bright new image he has introduced in the Board of Works, and wish him many years to develop his latent talent.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TomJFitzpatrick" hpid="Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick (Dublin Central) Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick (Dublin Central)">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Dublin Central):</i> I do not intend to delay the House very long at this late stage of the debate, because there is very little I can say that has not already been said.  However, I am concerned about the future of the Grand Canal.  Two-and-a-half years ago the then Minister for Transport and Power, Deputy Brian Lenihan, informed me that the Grand Canal would be transferred to the Board of Works and that certain legislation was being processed in the Department of Transport and Power. I would like to know from the Parliamentary Secretary if he can say when this legislation will come to us because, in my opinion, the Board of Works is the proper body to take control of the Grand Canal.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am particularly concerned about that part of the Grand Canal from South Circular Road, on to Inchicore and further out the country.  I have another interest in this matter, because in the process of this legislation part of the canal was to be transferred to Dublin Corporation.  There was one particular section, at James's Harbour, which the then Minister for Transport and Power indicated they would allow Dublin Corporation to take over.  It was hoped that this part would be closed, because anyone with any knowledge of this part of the canal realises that it is a big hazard where children are concerned.  It runs through a very densely populated part of the city and it could be put to much better use if it were converted into an open park.  For practically three years now I have been promised this legislation.  I put down a question to the Minister for Transport and Power some 12 months ago and, if my memory serves me right, the answer <Col N="274" /> was that the matter was under investigation. I hope the Parliamentary Secretary will make some effort to influence his colleague, the Minister for Transport and Power, to do something about bringing this legislation before the House soon.</P>
    <P>Other Deputies have spoken at some length about the Phoenix Park. I would just make the point that, when originally I came to know the Phoenix Park it was a recreational centre where you could take your children in the afternoon or on Sunday.  I find recently that the Phoenix Park is becoming one of the main thoroughfares of Dublin.  The planning authorities should make some move to see that less use is made of Castlenock Gate.  From the Phoenix Park to Castleknock is now one of the main thoroughfares out of Dublin.  The Phoenix Park was never intended for this purpose.  There are other ways out of Dublin such as the Navan Road.  Obviously there is now no difference between the main Naas Road and the main road through the Phoenix Park.  Deputy Wilson might think it would cause a little more inconvenience, but we must preserve the Phoenix Park and its amenities, for the purpose for which it was originally intended.</P>
    <P>As regards the Houses of the Oireachtas, we originally had an interviewing room, but during the term of Office of the Parliamentary Secretary's predecessor, a change was made.  In my opinion the present interviewing room in Leinster House is completely unsuitable.  I said this when it was changed, and I have not altered my opinion.  An interviewing room which caters for three different political parties must be completely unsuitable.  There is no privacy there. It is particularly embarrassing for Dublin Deputies who bring their constituents into the House to interview them.  I would prefer the previous arrangement when there were cubicles.  At least you could interview your constituents without being overheard or seen by other Deputies.  I think that is how Deputies, especially Dublin Deputies, would like it.  I <Col N="275" /> would ask the Parliamentary Secretary to see if better interviewing facilities could be provided.</P>
    <P>Dublin Castle is one of our principal buildings in Dublin which is not signposted.  Indeed, many of the other historical buildings in Dublin are not signposted.  When tourists come to our city they have no idea where to find these historical monuments or houses.  There must be an attraction in every city and by and large you will find that it is the older parts of the city to which people will gravitate.  I would refer particularly to that part of our city known as The Liberties.  Some of the most historical buildings in Dublin are there: St. Audeon's, Christchurch, St. Patrick's Cathedral, Marsh's Library &mdash; I could go on and on.  I do not think these have been properly publicised down through the years.  I doubt very much if any effort has been made to protect them.  Were it not for the efforts of voluntary organisations, many of these old historical buildings would have been destroyed or pulled down. There is no proper legislation that I know of to protect old buildings or archaeological finds.  There is no liaison between the various Departments. If Dublin Corporation make a decision to develop a certain part of the city, especially the older part, is there any archaeological research team that would go ahead of the corporation's planning and say: &ldquo;We beleive there are certain things there and we must excavate it first&rdquo;?  I do not believe there is.  I think once there is planning permission, which they can secure themselves, they can walk in there without any regard at all to the historical background of that part of the city.</P>
    <P>In regard to the urban parts of the city, there should be experts in the field, whether they are employed by the Department of Local Government or the Board of Works, to ensure that timely notice will be given, that at least the corporation will give 12 months' notice of their intention to redevelop a part of the city.  Then experts could study the position and <Col N="276" /> carry out research.  It was only by accident that the archaeological remains of Winetavern Street were discovered.  It was only by accident that the old walls of the city were preserved.  It would be a great pity if developments were allowed to take place in old parts of cities and towns without research into their historical background.  If office blocks are allowed to go up without proper research then ancient remains will be left undiscovered.</P>
    <P>I should like a section to be set up in the Office of Public Works which would work in close co-operation with the Department of Local Government in regard to the examination of sites on which it was proposed to build so that building would not take place without prior investigation of the area from the point of view of the possibility of there being items of historical interest underground.  This is particularly important having regard to the emphasis being given to urban renewal.  There is a danger that the older parts of cities and towns will be redeveloped by local authorities without reference to the preservation of archaeological remains.  This danger has been brought to my attention in my constituency which takes in the older part of Dublin.  If redevelopment continues at the present rate the possibility of excavating will be ignored.  In the past we have depended on voluntary organisations to preserve ancient monuments.</P>
    <P>There is the case of the Tailors' Hall in my constituency.  If the local authority had had their way that would have been demolished.  This is a building of historical interest and is a tourist attraction.  There was a great deal of agitation on the part of voluntary organisations as a result of which the Tailors' Hall was allowed to remain.  Funds were raised for the improvement of the building and it is now one of Dublin's attractions. People should study the history of this building.  Great names are associated with it &mdash; Tone, Emmet and other great Irishmen had their meetings there.</P>
    <P>I am not talking only about local authorities.  There are private  <Col N="277" /> developers clearing sites in the city.  Where urban renewal is taking place a special unit of the Office of Public Works should carry out research in the area for a period of at least 12 months before site clearance is allowed.  If it is discovered that it would be worth-while preserving the remains in that area that should be done.  Otherwise, the redevelopment could take place.</P>
    <P>There is overcrowding in the National Library.  The map collection has suffered as a result.  This collection is of vital importance to students of archaeology and other subjects. These people are being deprived of access to the map collection.  I understand that the collection has been transferred to the basement in Earls-fort Terrace where students have not access to it.  A matter of concern to interested persons is the safe keeping and preservation of the collection. These maps are irreplaceable.  It is important that they should be suitably housed in the National Library or some other appropriate place.  I would ask the Parliamentary Secretary to tell us if it is the intention to bring the map collection back to the National Library where students may have access to them.</P>

        <i>(Dublin Central):</i> We are aware of the lack of recreational facilities in Dublin.  When Deputy Noel Lemass was Parliamentary Secretary a decision was taken with regard to the creation of a golf course in the Phoenix Park extension. I understood at that time that the land had been acquired and that an expert was being commissioned to lay out the golf course.  That was two years ago.  I drive along that part of the Liffey quite often and I am awaiting the development of the golf course.  This golf course would be available to the ordinary people of Dublin.  Golf is quite an expensive game in this city and, apart from the expense, it is impossible to gain admission to a club.  There are many working people in this city who would be glad of the opportunity to play golf.  A golf course on that part of the Liffey would provide a beautiful recreational facility.  I would ask the Parliamentary Secretary if he can have the provision of the golf course expedited.  I do not have to tell the Parliamentary Secretary if he can open space available in the city is very limited.  This part of the city is suitable for nothing else.  It certainly is not suitable for development.  It could be utilised as a golf course.  I should like to hear something positive about it in the near future.  It has been promised for a long time and it <Col N="279" /> would be a wonderful asset and very much appreciated by the people of Dublin.</P>
      <P>We have a new office block development in Kildare Street.  The question of whether we should rent office accommodation or build it has often been raised.  With the exorbitant rents being charged today I consider the decision to build this block in Kildare Street was the correct one. There is now to be a five-year review of rent charges.  Although I know the availability of money was questioned at the time the decision was taken I am convinced that building was the correct thing.  At one time it was a ten-year review; then they reduced it to a seven-year review.  Now we are down to a five-year review.  Perhaps in a few years' time we will be down to a one-year review of rents.  Even though money is scarce and dear I believe building was the correct decision.</P>
      <P>We do not seem to be fully utilising the old Royal Hospital building in Kilmainham.  I know it is in a bad state of repair but it is a magnificent building and it would be a pity to allow it to fall into decay.  It is situated on lovely grounds.  I am sure it could be utilised as some sort of public building.</P>
      <P>Decentralisation of Government Departments has been talked about for a long time.  I believe buildings are in course of construction for this purpose.  I know it is not the Parliamentary Secretary's responsibility but I hope that when the time to transfer staff comes, due consideration will be given to families and how they are situated as regards schools and colleges and that transfers will be on a voluntary basis.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should like the Parliamentary Secretary to ask his colleague, the Minister for Education, to make provision for the map collection, to ask the Minister for Transport and Power to do something about the Grand Canal, which has been promised for the last three or four years, and to ask his own colleagues, the Deputies, <Col N="280" /> whether they consider the present interview rooms suitable.</P>

      <NameTxt>Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Finance (Mr. Kenny)</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like first to express my thanks and appreciation to all the Deputies who contributed so well and so earnestly to this debate.  I do not like to single out any particular person but each and every Deputy gave full vent to his feelings and gave the House an idea of what his constituents think.</P>
      <P>This Estimate has always been an interesting one and could not at any time be described as a controversial one.  It has as its object the dispensation of benefits right across the board of our society.  There is not a single parish that does not have some involvement within this Estimate.  The only criticism which might be made of it is that it is not big enough.  The amount of money provided in this Estimate is never big enough to satisfy the demands of Deputies.  I would like to see much bigger provisions for arterial drainage, national schools, Garda stations, Government offices, national parks and national monuments, but the fact must be faced that the size of the national cake is limited and we can demand entitlement to only a fair portion of it.</P>
      <P>I should like to pay tribute to the staff of the Office of Public Works for their hard work and dedication to duty.  They carry a very heavy burden and every one of them, from the highest to the lowest, gives of his best as a member of the team.  That has always been the tradition of the office and I have no doubt that it always will be.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I shall endeavour to deal with the subjects of debate as they came up.  I think that is less difficult than dealing with the alphabetical subheads. Deputy MacSharry, Deputy Lemass and Deputy McDonald mentioned office accommodation for Deputies in Leinster House.  I often wonder how the Deputies who came here before us, or during my time, before the new extension was built, managed at all because we built 29,000 square feet of extra accommodation within the last five or seven years.  I often wonder <Col N="281" /> how the same number of Deputies ever even existed and did their work when these 29,000 square feet were not available.  However, I know that with the passage of time and with the extra burdens imposed on Deputies by their constituents, by visitors coming here and by our entry to the EEC, much more accommodation must be provided.  I have had the architects and the engineers of the Office of Public Works travel all over Leinster House and its precincts and we have examined every space that is available. We find that we are bottled up within the precincts of the walls.  There is only one solution and that is the nearby College of Science at the back of the restaurant.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JosephBrennan" hpid="Mr. Brennan Mr. Brennan">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Kenny Mr. Kenny">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kenny</NameTxt>
      <P>We will have to drop that subject as well.  According to the experts the only solution we have is extra accommodation in the nearby College of Science or the engineers college.  The building has not yet been vacated and the people who are working there are carrying on most urgent business.  The State Analyst's office is there, his workshop is there and the most fragile machinery and instruments are located there.  There is another portion of that building occupied by the seed testing department and there is another part of it on the same floor occupied by a group of engineering students.  Until such time as we can accommodate these people in another location we cannot get rid of them.  You cannot put them out on the street; they cannot be evicted.  Until such time as they can be accommodated in Belfield or elsewhere we cannot claim possession of that place.  Therefore, we cannot, within a year or two, attempt to get accommodation in the building we want to get it in.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Kenny Mr. Kenny">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kenny</NameTxt>
      <P>No, it is not 12 years. We had a deputation from the Committee on Procedure and Privileges yesterday when the whole case was laid before them.  They understood it perfectly well.  There is a minor solution.  We can build an addition to the extension already built, an elongation of this building, a narrow building the same height as the present one which will give us something like 2,000 square feet extra and will be some help in this matter of inadequate accommodation.</P>
      <P>Deputy McDonald spoke about this and, coming from Brussels, with parliamentarians from the EEC, he finds he wants a communal room but we have none.  We cannot get adequate space to meet his demands either.  It is a matter for the Deputies but they must have forbearance in this matter.  Until we can get accommodation in another location we cannot provide it.</P>
      <P>Another heated matter mentioned by Deputies Tunney, Wilson, Taylor and various other Deputies during the course of the debate is the heating in the new extension.  When that building was first erected the Office of Public Works and their engineers did not want the air conditioning as it is now.  The system would have been far better if it was an open and shut method by which you could open the windows and cool the inside but you would have heat inside just as it is in this part of the building.  The air conditioning is wrong and you cannot govern the heating in one room compared with another.  It must be the same temperature all through the building.  We are not alone in this. I came across an extract from <i>The Irish Independent</i> pertaining to the British House of Commons.  This is what it says about their heating:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Many of the &ldquo;irritable and angry outbursts&rdquo; by MPs in the British <Col N="283" /> Commons were blamed yesterday on the Palace of Westminister's central heating system.  &ldquo;Most people find the place uncomfortably warm,&rdquo; said Mr. Wilfred Proudfoot, Conservative MP for Brighouse and Spenborough.  &ldquo;The number of MPs who sleep or drop off during a debate is plain for all to see&rdquo;.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Kenny</NameTxt>
      <P>If the heating is turned down in one room it will inevitably result in raising the temperature in other rooms.  When this air conditioning was first introduced into the House it was really against the wishes of the experts.  It has its aftermath because nobody is satisfied, especially those people who are prone to get overheated.  They are overheated when they go to the extension and then they come along here and vent their spleen on the other decent Deputies.</P>

      <P>Deputies Lemass and Crinion raised the question of the stand-by generator.  This has become <Col N="284" /> a very urgent matter.  I remember the Captain holding up a torchlight for Deputy Oliver Flanagan to deliver a speech here.  This went on during the time when there was either a strike or scarcity of fuel in the ESB.  Some people worked by candlelight and some worked by flashlight.  The staff, the ushers, the captain and the superintendent bent their energies to give us facilities which we never thought were here because candles were produced in haste and lights were procured where I thought they could not possibly be got.  We are now waiting for instructions from the Committee on Procedure and Privileges to have this generator installed as a stand-by. I trust it will never happen again that people will eat, drink and work by candlelight.  Of course, it is very romantic in some places but not here in this place of hard work and very little&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>Thanks for it.  Deputies White, Callanan, MacSharry, O'Brien and Crinion, who seems to have mentioned everything so far, raised the question of office accommodation and the desirability of the State erecting its own offices.  The only man who used his head was Deputy Crinion. He thought we should rent offices instead of building them.  In my opening statement I referred to the progress made in the planning of a number of projects.  When these projects, which are in the pipeline, materialise they should result in a substantial improvement in the position. Deputy Callanan suggested that all sections of the Department should be put together for the convenience of Members and the public.  This is clearly desirable and is being done as far as possible.</P>
