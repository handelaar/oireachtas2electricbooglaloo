      <P>asked the Taoiseach if he will list the items included in the consumer price index which increased in price in the 12-month period to mid-May, 1974; and if he will state the percentage increases in each case, the total number of increases, the average percentage increase and the weight given to each item in the index.</P>

      <P>With the permission of the Ceann Comhairle, I propose to circulate in the Official Report a statement giving the percentage change between mid-May, 1973 and mid-May, 1974, in the prices of the items covered by the consumer price index.  Of the 367 items listed 357 showed an increase.  The overall increase in the index during this period was 16.2 per cent.</P>
      <P>The percentage expenditure weight for each item covered by the consumer price index is given in a detailed article on the index published in the March, 1969 issue, page 27, of the <i>Irish Statistical Bulletin.</i></P>
      <P>Following is the statement:</P>
      <P>Percentage change in prices of items entering into the consumer price index between mid-May, 1973 and mid-May, 1974.</P>

      <NameTxt>Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries (Mr. M.P. Murphy)</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M.P. Murphy</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="JosephBrennan" hpid="Mr. Brennan Mr. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>In view of the belated discovery that those grants were available for fishing boats, would the Parliamentary Secretary ask An Bord Iascaigh Mhara to give special preference to those who lost their boats or had them damaged in the storms last January and who received no assistance?  I would ask him to do the same in respect of harbours which are still in a wrecked condition.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M.P. Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>That information has been given to the House already in reply to a previous question. The Deputy will find the required <Col N="1282" /> information in the appropriate volume of the Official Report.  I am sorry I have not the relevant number of the volume.</P>

    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Parliamentary Secretary satisfied that all the fishermen are members of suitable producer organisations that would qualify for these grants?  If they are not, what percentage of fishermen are so organised into producer groups?  What steps have been taken to promote the formation and development of such suitable producer organisations?</P>
    </Speaker>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M.P. Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>The Department have endeavoured in every way possible to try to get fishermen to form producer organisations.  I have met representatives of fishermen and representatives of the IAOS and the BIM who are jointly working on the formation of producer groups.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>Can the Parliamentary Secretary state the percentage of fishermen who are organised into producer groups that would enable them to qualify for these grants?  Can he state the proportion involved?</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelPatMurphy" hpid="Mr. M.P. Murphy Mr. M.P. Murphy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M.P. Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>Unfortunately, the number is not great.  Despite our repeated requests, it is difficult to get fishermen to form producer organisations. In recent weeks some headway has been made.  I am not too satisfied with the progress made; I have expressed the view privately in the course of conversations with fishermen that they are not alive to the question of the formation of producer groups.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Fahey</NameTxt>
      <P>Of the 24 applications received, how many does the Parliamentary Secretary anticipate will qualify for the grants?</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelPatMurphy" hpid="Mr. M.P. Murphy Mr. M.P. Murphy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M.P. Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>I cannot state how many applications will qualify for the grants.  That would be a matter for the Commission.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackieFahey" hpid="Mr. Fahey Mr. Fahey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fahey</NameTxt>
      <P>Surely it will be necessary for the Parliamentary Secretary to know whether they meet the requirements of the EEC?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelPatMurphy" hpid="Mr. M.P. Murphy Mr. M.P. Murphy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M.P. Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>In our view the 24 applications meet the requirements. They are all in respect of vessels 50 feet or over in length; apparently vessels of less than this length will not qualify and consequently there is no point in submitting applications for them.</P>

    <Speaker pid="LiamCunningham" hpid="Mr. Cunningham Mr. Cunningham">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cunningham</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries the reason for the refusal to grant a salmon fishing licence by the Foyle Fisheries Commission to a person (name supplied) in County Donegal.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelPatMurphy" hpid="Mr. M.P. Murphy Mr. M.P. Murphy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M.P. Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>I have ascertained from the Foyle Fisheries Commission which is responsible for the issue of salmon fishing licences in the Foyle area that the application in question was fully considered by them. In view, however, of a decline in the salmon stocks of the Foyle and of the urgent need for conservation the commission decided not to grant any new licences this year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LiamCunningham" hpid="Mr. Cunningham Mr. Cunningham">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cunningham</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Parliamentary Secretary aware that extra licences were granted this year?  Is he also <Col N="1284" /> aware that drop-outs have not been replaced?  Could he say, as a result, how will young fishermen such as this man, qualify in future for a licence?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelPatMurphy" hpid="Mr. M.P. Murphy Mr. M.P. Murphy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M.P. Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>The Control of Fishing for Salmon Order, 1973 does not apply to the Foyle Fisheries.  The applications are determined by the commission.  They issued 217 draught net licences and approximately 100 drift net licences.  That is the number that are issued each year.</P>

      <P>The Deputy has made representations to the commission on the basis that the applicant in whom he is particularly interested is more deserving than some of the applicants who got licences.  He has referred to particular groups of people who got licences and who, apparently in the Deputy's opinion, should not have got licences.  However, the commission did not accept the Deputy's recommendation so far as the particular person in question is concerned.  But, in the light of the representations made by him on the groups who have got licences and who should not get them, they are reviewing the position for the coming year.</P>

      <P>With the permission of the Ceann Comhairle, I propose to take Questions Nos. 10 and 11 together.</P>
      <P>Additional industrial training facilities will be provided in Dublin, Cork and the Midlands.  Studies on the feasibility of locating training centres in other areas are proceeding.  As I have already indicated, it is my intention to increase fourfold by 1978 the number of training places available.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Adult training courses are normally confined to persons over 18 years of age and there is no upper age limit.  Unemployed school-leavers <Col N="1293" /> between the age of 16 and 18 who have been registered for a period of three months with the National Manpower Service for employment and who have not been successful in obtaining employment during this period are considered for training as well.</P>
    <P>The starting age for apprentices is normally 15 years and upwards.  Off-the-job training courses are also provided for apprentices in their first year of apprenticeship.</P>
    <P>A start has also been made to training unemployed school leavers. Industrial induction courses of four weeks' duration are held in various centres throughout the country during the summer months.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOLeary" hpid="Mr. M. O'Leary Mr. M. O'Leary">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>With the permission of the Ceann Comhairle, I propose to take Question Nos. 12, 13 and 14 together.</P>
      <P>I am of course concerned about the increase in the number of man-days lost due to industrial disputes in the first six months of this year.  An analysis of the situation shows that the bulk of the losses were due to four or five key disputes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have asked both sides in industry to ensure that their negotiations are conducted seriously so as to avoid industrial breakdown.  Our structure of industrial relations is quite adequate for dealing with disputes.  What does seem to be lacking on some occasions <Col N="1295" /> recently is a willingness to use available machinery for reconciling differences.</P>
    <P>In consultation between the Irish Congress of Trade Unions, the employer organisations and the Government, services necessary for providing solutions to industrial disputes of all kinds have been developed and are available to the parties to disputes. The vast bulk of disputes dealt with are settled under the system.</P>
    <P>The various arrangements are kept under review and whenever changes are called for, these are made, in consultation with the representatives of unions and employers, as appropriate.</P>
    <P>Our system is a voluntary one, without any element of compulsion and this implies that it can be effective only where parties to disputes are willing to work it.  Where one or more parties to a dispute refuse to negotiate or conciliate and persist in a dispute situation, no system in a democratic state, no matter how efficient, can produce a settlement.</P>
    <P>With regard to the question of my intervention in a particular dispute, it will be appreciated that this must remain a matter for personal judgment, to be taken in the light of knowledge of the situation as it develops.  In particular, I must make a judgment as to whether an initiative by me at any time will help towards a solution of the dispute or not, and whether it will strengthen or weaken arrangements which must operate not only for the dispute in question but for disputes generally.</P>
    <P>From the experience of a number of disputes, I have come to the conclusion that the machinery for keeping me in touch with anticipated industrial breakdowns could be improved. Accordingly, I am recruiting a small number of persons with experience in the field of monitor developments.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. G. Fitzgerald Mr. G. Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>Arising out of the Minister's lengthy reply, which was hard to take all together, in view of the fact that he has intimated that the existing machinery is adequate and that his intervention in any dispute is a matter for judgment affecting the state of the negotiations at that time, <Col N="1296" /> would he not now agree that his interventions in recent disputes were badly timed, ill-advised and completely ineffective?  In view of that would he not agree that some measures are necessary whereby the Minister for Labour, if it is his function, would be ready to intervene in disputes that are seriously affecting our economy?</P>

      <P>It is important to set the record straight.  I have recently been pointing out to the employers and the unions the serious increase in the number of disputes, as I said in the answer to the question, mainly due to two or three major disputes. We have not yet lapsed back to that disastrous pattern of industrial relations which was the rule in most of the years up to 1970.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. MacSharry</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy will appreciate that there are difficulties in a voluntary system and unofficial disputes are even more difficult.  In a voluntary system we require the goodwill of both sides to ensure that a settlement comes about.  I am generally confident that our structure is a good one.  Where a need is seen by both sides for an improvement we are willing to make that improvement.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>In the countries where a cooling-off period has been tried it has been found that at the end of the cooling-off period you have a concentration of disputes.

    <Speaker pid="MichaelOLeary" hpid="Mr. M. O'Leary Mr. M. O'Leary">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>That, in the first instance, would be a matter for the Irish Congress of Trade Unions.  Their machinery, it must be pointed out, has been of great assistance in, for example, settling materially the recent inter-union dispute which has caused such a great deal of trouble throughout the country between the local authority engineers and the other union.  They have succeeded, under their machinery, in settling that matter.  The question raised by the Deputy is, in the first place, a question for the Irish Congress of Trade Unions.  From our information that ruling is generally abided by.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>In view of the protracted length of the key strike the Minister mentioned would he not agree that a bit more is required at this stage regarding these protracted strikes, which can have such a serious effect?  Could I ask him to ask his Department to consider ways and means by which machinery can be set up to provide the cooling-off period and at the end of that some system whereby at least consultations can be carried on and strike notice prevented until a proper solution is reached?</P>

      <P>I think what we should be after is to get a position obtaining between employers and unions whereby they conduct their <Col N="1299" /> negotiations as seriously before the disruption of a strike as afterwards. In the recent Dublin bus dispute negotiations continued throughout the period of cessation of work.  If we could get this agreement before the strike we would be doing a good job. This agreement and this dedication to negotiation did not exist before the breakdown.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>The incidence of inter-union disputes is a cause of concern.  The Irish Congress of Trade Unions have established a committee specifically for the purpose of resolving such disputes.  The published reports of the congress show that numerous inter-union disputes have been settled through the use of this machinery.</P>
      <P>As the Deputy will be aware, I have already introduced the Trade Union (Amalgamations) Bill, 1974, and I am hopeful that this measure, when enacted, will help stimulate trade unions to amalgamate.</P>

      <P>As I remarked in reply to Questions 12, 13 and 14, I think that more could be done about ensuring that the agencies responsible for industrial relations in this country were informed before a dispute actually broke out.

      <NameTxt>Mr. M. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>No.  I think there is a fair case to be made that a weakness at present exists that while the structures we have, the Labour Court and conciliation service, all work satisfactorily, we do not have any grouping in the State service that could examine possible disruption cases in the future.  With such an agency established we might have some idea of trouble breaking out in a particular sector in some period in the future. By this information being available to the existing agencies, we might be in a position to avert that future cause of dissension.</P>

      <P>Yes, the unofficial strike is extremely difficult to handle because you have the unions denying its legitimacy.  However, over this whole area of industrial relations there is no short cut and no magic wand that will bring about industrial peace. There has been an improvement in recent years.  The first six months of this year shows a tendency to lapse back to what was the unfortunate situation before 1970.</P>

        <i>Cavan):</i> It is assumed that the Deputy is referring to a fire which occurred on 21st March, 1973, at Killavullen Forest in the course of protective burning which was being carried out by personnel of the Forest and Wildlife Service of my Department. The fire damaged 89 acres of forest the value of which, including planting, maintenance and other costs, was estimated at £2,929.</P>
      <P>The cost of replanting the area is about £2,000.</P>

        <i>(Cavan):</i> Proceedings for the compulsory acquisition of the property referred to have reached the stage where the lands have actually vested in the Land Commission and the land bonds representing the purchase money have been placed to credit.  The Land Commission <Col N="1309" /> have however been unable to obtain possession of the lands and they are now considering what further steps they will take to finalise the matter.  The proceedings were delayed initially by an application to have the building excluded and later by a complication which arose in regard to the ownership of part of the property.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Callanan</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Cavan):</i> I am aware that there has been very considerable delay in this case.  Proceedings started in 1967 and then there was an application by the owner to exclude some small portion of that land.  After that was done, a brother of the owner claimed that part of the land which would have been acquired was his and it was agreed to exclude that without any reduction in price. Eventually the Land Commission vested the lands in themselves and placed the bonds to credit, but the owner failed to give up possession. The owner died about a year ago and the Land Commission will have to resort to court proceedings to get possession of the land.  It is one of these cases where there was a chapter of accidents.</P>

      <NameTxt>Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries (Mr. M.P. Murphy)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move:</P>
      <P>That the Bill be now read a Second Time.</P>
      <P>This is a short Bill the object of which is to prolong the period of office of the elected members of boards of conservators to October 1975 i.e. by one year.  Under the Fisheries (Consolidation) Act, 1959 elections to boards of conservators are due to be held every five years and the next elections are due in October 1974.</P>
      <P>Deputies will be aware that for some time I have been considering what improvements could be made in the constitution of board of conservators. Indeed I had hoped that prior to the elections due to take place in October this year, I would have been in a position to bring before the Oireachtas the necessary legislation to effect the revisions I had in mind.</P>
      <P>However following a recent discussion which I had with the Chairman and members of the Inland Fisheries Commission I understand that the Commission will have recommendations which would call for extensive amendment of the fisheries legislation on many aspects of conservation including, therefore, constitution of the boards.  I have come to the conclusion, therefore, that it would be inappropriate for me to proceed with my proposals as a separate matter but that they should be considered in conjunction with recommendations of the Inland Fisheries Commission following which it is intended that comprehensive legislative proposals relating to the constitution of boards of conservators will be brought before the House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is proposed, in the circumstances, to extend the period of office of the elected members of the current Boards of Conservators by one year by postponing until 1975 the elections due to be held in October 1974. It is hoped that the extension will give time for the finalisation of the recommendations of the Inland Fisheries Commission as <Col N="1316" /> well as the full examination of these recommendations in my Department and the framing of any necessary amending legislation.  However to provide against any unforeseen delays, a provision is included in the Bill enabling the Minister by order to postpone the elections for a further period beyond 1975 but at this stage I do not anticipate that such further postponement will be required.</P>
    <P>When I speak of changing the constitution of boards of conservators I want to emphasise and acknowledge the wonderful service that has been given by the members of boards of conservators over the years.  These members have devoted much of their time to solving fishery problems and attending meetings of the boards in the interests of conservation of our fisheries.  I think they deserve our gratitude and appreciation.  I am confident that they will rise to the task I am putting to them of giving their services for an extra year beyond the five year term which would have ended in October 1974.</P>
    <P>The boards of conservators were set up under a Fisheries Act of 1848. While a number of amendments affecting the boards' functions have been made over the years, generally speaking it could be said that their basic constitution has remained almost unaltered for over a century.  Obviously under present day conditions the whole matter of the conditions of the appointment of members to boards of conservators, the boards' functions and powers could benefit from an examination in the context of modern conditions and in the interest of further development of our inland fisheries.  As I have said the matter will be examined in depth as soon as the recommendations of the Inland Fisheries Commission are available.</P>
    <P>Before closing I feel that I should also pay tribute to the Chairman and members of the Inland Fisheries Commission. They have been engaged in arduous work over a long period in dealing with very complicated problems and their Report is now awaited with great interest.</P>
    <P>I recommend this short Bill to the House.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Kenneally</NameTxt>
      <P>When the Minister introduced this Bill in the House yesterday week and requested that it be taken immediately, let me say, with respect, that I was sceptical about it being rushed through the House.  On its face value it appears to be a reasonable request, if we can be assured that the Bill is put before the House in good faith.  Other Bills such as this have been brought forward by successive Ministers for Local Government to extend the lives of local authorities.  Consequently, it is not the intention on this side of the House to oppose this Bill.  But we should like to get some of the points in the Bill clarified.  We hope this Bill has not been brought forward or intended to save the Parliamentary Secretary from any embarrassment by holding the elections in October 1974 due specifically to his mismanagement of the fisheries industry and the abolition particularly of the Cork Board last year.</P>
      <P>We are really disappointed that this long delay has been taken forward in this Bill.  If I could refer to a Parliamentary Question put down by Deputy Daly on Thursday, 2nd May 1974, when he asked the Parliamentary Secretary if he proposed to change the system of election for membership of boards of conservators and, if so, the changes he proposed to make.  The Parliamentary Secretary's reply to that question was:</P>
      <P>The system of election of boards of fishery conservators is at present being reviewed in my Department. I have not as yet finalised any proposals in the matter.</P>
      <P>An interjection from Deputy Molloy read:</P>
      <P>Will the decision be made within a short time.</P>
      <P>And the Parliamentary Secretary's reply was that it would be made very shortly and that he hoped&mdash;his exact words were:</P>
      <P>I expect to have it before the next elections which are to take place in October.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is almost ten or 11 weeks ago since <Col N="1318" /> that question was put down by Deputy Daly.  It is quite evident that very little has been done within the Department of Agriculture and Fisheries to try to get those new regulations brought forward to hold the elections in 1974.</P>
    <P>The Minister, when introducing the Bill, did refer to what is in the Parliamentary Secretary's introductory speech&mdash;that the report of the Inland Fisheries Commission has not, as yet, been brought forward.  We are disappointed in this respect and I think we should go back and take a look at the Orders made.</P>
    <P>When I say that I intend to refer to the Order made by the previous holder of the office as the Fahey Order and the Order made by the present Parliamentary Secretary as the Murphy Order, I hope they will not take umbrage or that the Chair will not think I am being in any way disrespectful to the Deputies concerned when I refer to them as the Fahey and Murphy Orders.  Deputy Fahey made an order in December, 1972.  In our opinion, this was a very responsible Order.  Like all legislation brought into this House by Fianna Fáil Ministers it was a responsible Order, an Order that specified exactly what was required for the conservation of salmon in the country.  At that time it may have been considered a rather harsh Order but all people interviewed&mdash;and I am sure that Deputies representing maritime constituencies had many approaches made to them then about the Order&mdash;were of the opinion that the conservation of salmon was something that should be done and that the then Parliamentary Secretary was in order in requesting the boards of conservators throughout the country to issue licences on a specific basis only.  At that time there were people who were annoyed with the Order, but those who howled loudest when the Fahey Order was introduced to curb the number of licences were only part-time fishermen or perhaps professional men; some of them&mdash;professional men particularly&mdash;applied for licences in the names of local men and, if caught fishing illegally, their <Col N="1319" /> own names never became public.  If any court proceedings had to be taken against them, they were hiding under the name of a local man.</P>
    <P>Then on Deputy Murphy's appointment as Parliamentary Secretary, the Order made was the one that messed up the whole operation of conservation of salmon in this country.  Perhaps Deputy Murphy, the Parliamentary Secretary, was not fully responsible for opening the floodgates in regard to the issuing of salmon licences.  Members of the Coalition Parties during the 1973 election campaign freely said throughout the country that if their candidates were voted for the Fahey Order would be revoked the moment they went into power.  This is what happened.  Perhaps Deputy Murphy was not in agreement, but the promise had been made.</P>
    <P>I can say, without fear of contradiction, that the Tánaiste, the Leader of Deputy Murphy's party, in my constituency stated that the Fahey Order would be revoked if the Labour candidate in the Waterford constituency was voted for.  Licences were issued <i>ad lib</i> after that.  There is no need for me to read Statutory Instrument No. 33 of 1973.  The floodgates were opened and everybody who wanted a licence got one.  It got so bad that the Parliamentary Secretary had to hold investigations and inquiries into the way his liberally-worded Order was interpreted by the boards of conservators throughout the country.</P>
    <P>In fact, to his embarrasment, he had to abolish the No. 5 board, the one for the Cork area, which had 26 elected members.  We hope this is not a smokescreen to keep those 26 elected members out of office for another 12 months.  This board was abolished because the Parliamentary Secretary requested them to withdraw licences which they issued.  After telling them to issue the licences he came back and wanted them to withdraw them. Are we being a bit harsh on him in thinking that he hopes that by October, 1975, when the next election to the boards of conservators will take <Col N="1320" /> place, he will have the members of the No. 5 area board placated?  We hope this is not what the Bill is for.  We hope that when making an Order this year he will eliminate all the anomalies that at present exist.  Licences have been issued to all and sundry. Some of the licences that were issued for the present season are not being used, some of them are being abused and lots of them unfortunately are being horse-traded by individuals and given to those who may have money to get licences.</P>
    <P>The Parliamentary Secretary stated that we have not yet got the report of the Inland Fisheries Commission. We sincerely hope that when it comes this report will eliminate the anomalies that have existed in the issuing of licences.  When a rod licence is issued, the person's name appears on the licence, but when net licences are issued I understand it is only the gear that is licensed.  This creates a big problem for water-keepers and game-keepers in establishing who owns the gear.</P>
    <P>Another question we must ask is whether this report will be accepted by the Parliamentary Secretary.  Will he do the same thing with the final report of the Inland Fisheries Commission as he did with their interim report which dealt exclusively with the conservation of salmon?  That report was accepted by Deputy Fahey when in office.  Deputy Fahey, in good faith, made his Order, on the advice of his experts and on the advice contained in the interim report.  Deputy Murphy took no notice whatever of the interim report and the Order he made created the problems we have. Deputy Daly tabled a Parliamentary Question ten or 11 weeks ago and even today the Parliamentary Secretary has given us no indication that the advice of the elected members of the board of conservators will be taken in the years ahead.  We sincerely hope that changes will be made. The Parliamentary Secretary made no reference to the recommendation that was made some time ago by the Joint Council of Conservators who are anxious that a rationalisation of the boards of conservators should be carried <Col N="1321" /> out.  Some boards are huge and others very small.  Let us hope the Parliamentary Secretary will take all those things into account when he is replying.  The area of the Limerick board stretches from the mouth of the Shannon to Ballyshannon and touches about 13 counties.  That is a huge area to be covered.  Will we have a rationalisation programme of the Boards?</P>
    <P>Perhaps on the Committee Stage we can deal with the ESB nominees and the other nominees on the various boards.  I do not want anyone to get the impression that I have any objection to the ESB.  The ESB should be complimented on the great work they are doing for the fishing industry.</P>
    <P>The Parliamentary Secretary said there is provision in the Bill to extend it by a further period.  I sincerely hope it will not be necessary to extend it beyond 1975.  We want the changes in regulations brought forward as quickly as possible.  As the Parliamentary Secretary said the Boards were set up under the Fisheries Act of 1848. That is proof enough that changes must be made.  I was inclined to be a little critical of the fact that the Inland Fisheries Commission have been sitting for a period of 130 years one realises that many changes must be made.  I wish them well in their task. Let us hope that as soon as possible the protection we need and the changes that are required in the boards of conservators will be brought forward so that our lordly salmon can be protected.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JackieFahey" hpid="Mr. Fahey Mr. Fahey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fahey</NameTxt>
      <P>This is a short Bill postponing the elections to the boards of conservators for one year.  I should like to express the hope, already expressed by my colleague, that it will only be necessary to postpone them for one year.  I would like to see it go beyond that.  In fact, I am disappointed that it is necessary to do this.  I believe our inland and sea fisheries have been neglected for far too long and that the present position should have been changed many years ago.  The boards of conservators were set up by an Act of 1848 and there has been very little <Col N="1322" /> change in their constitution since then.  This is a clear indication that we have neglected to bring about the changes which are necessary for the full exploitation of our inland fisheries.</P>
      <P>I am disappointed that the proposed changes are again being postponed.  I appreciate what the Parliamentary Secretary has stated in his brief, that we are waiting for the final report of the Inland Fisheries Commission, which was set up in 1970.  I know they are covering a very wide field in regard to fisheries and that it is a large commission. It is made up of 26 members covering all aspects of inland fisheries. It is understandable, therefore, that there is considerable delay in having a final report available.</P>
      <P>I am also disappointed that in his brief the Parliamentary Secretary did not mention a date when they are likely to make their final report.  I take it from this that he is not sure if it will take another year or two years to produce this final report.  This is a pity because I know from my own experience that the Inland Fisheries Commission have taken their work very seriously and the many sub-committees they have set up are going into the various aspects of the inland fishing industry in great detail. When the final report is available it will merit the greatest consideration by the Parliamentary Secretary and the Government.  I hope they will be in a position to treat seriously those recommendations and, if they see fit, to implement them.</P>
      <P>Our inland fisheries have been neglected for far too long.  In saying this I am fully aware of the progress that has been made, but it is very limited when one thinks of the great potential that is there.  It is not the fault of anybody in particular that they have been neglected for so long, and neither am I criticising the boards of conservators.  They have been very limited in regard to finance and the method of election to the boards leaves a lot to be desired.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We should ensure that the method of election will be as democratic as we can possibly make it.  Everybody having a vote in the elections should <Col N="1323" /> have equal voting strength.  We should not have the position that this can be monopolised by the bigger people in the fishing industry.  No one should be automatically elected to the boards because he holds a fishing valuation of £50 and over.  It is wrong to have 88 such people elected to the boards.  This is something like what we had in regard to election to county councils in the old days.  It must also become a thing of the past as far as election to the boards of conservators is concerned.  We must make it democratic.</P>
    <P>I do not know what the report of the Inland Fisheries Commission will contain, but if the Parliamentary Secretary is setting up bodies other than boards of conservators, if he is abolishing the boards and putting some other bodies in their place, I ask him to ensure that the method of election to such bodies is carried out in the most democratic way posible. The whole operation should be carried out on a rational and more positive basis.  The Department of Fisheries should be geared to implement, where they see it necessary, the recommendations of the Inland Fisheries Commission.  From my experience of being in the Department for almost three years the Parliamentary Secretary has not got sufficient staff in his Department.  He has excellent staff, and I must pay tribute to them for the co-operation I got from them while I was there.  If we are to treat the fishing industry in this country in the manner in which it should be treated more staff will have to be provided.</P>
    <P>The Fisheries Department should be taken away from being attached to another Department, especially to one as big as agriculture.  While that position obtains fisheries will never get the priority they deserve.  We have at the present time over 150,000 acres of lakes, every one of them suitable for development.  We also have over 1,000 miles of rivers, every one of them crying out for development and management.  The Department of Fisheries will have to be geared to deal with this situation.  This Department <Col N="1324" /> can no longer be taken as the hind tit of any other department, whether it be agriculture or lands, because it often turns out not alone to be the hind tit but left as a blind tit as well.  We will have to get away from this situation and treat the matter seriously.</P>
    <P>As far as I am aware the last time we had a commission dealing with inland fisheries was in 1935.  Very little happened to the recommendations that were made then.  I hope the same fate will not meet the present commission when it reports because the people on that commission deserve better for the work they are doing.  I know their recommendations will be well worth serious consideration. I hope the Parliamentary Secretary and the staff of the Department of Fisheries will be in a position to treat the recommendations in the serious manner in which they deserve to be treated.</P>
    <P>With the amount of leisure time people have now and with that leisure time increasing, more and more people are taking up angling as a pastime.  We should facilitate them as far as possible, and I am afraid we are only scratching the surface in this regard at present.  There is also the great potential for tourism in this.  We have failed to develop it, and we should not allow this situation to continue for one moment longer if we can avoid doing so.  As I mentioned already, with 150,000 acres of lakes and 1,000 miles of river crying out for development it is time we geared ourselves to do the job.</P>
    <P>I have dealt already with the method of election of the boards of conservators and I have advocated that there be a radical change in the method and that it be made more democratic.  This is essential for the good operation of the boards.  Next we should deal with the staffs of the boards and see that they are recruited through the proper channels.  I think the Parliamentary Secretary will agree with me that the recruitment of staff leaves a lot to be desired.  The treatment of staff in the employment of the boards is unsatisfactory, again through no fault of the boards.  It is ridiculous <Col N="1325" /> that they are not permanent and pensionable staff and that they are badly paid.</P>
    <P>If we are to have a proper staff they must be properly recruited; their position must be made permanent and pensionable, and they must be paid a satisfactory wage or salary, as the case may be.  The work they are asked to do demands great attention and must be carried out in an impartial manner.  It demands that they carry out their duties without undue influence from any source whatever. I suggest that recruitment should be through the Local Appointments Commission or some such body.  By offering satisfactory terms of employment we would attract the best people possible to do this work.  As I said, this situation is not the fault of the boards.  Because of the manner in which they are constituted and because of lack of finance they are not able to carry out the work they were set up to do.</P>
    <P>Therefore, when the final report of this commission is received, I hope the Parliamentary Secretary and his officials will be able to deal with it as quickly as possible.  In order to be able to implement the recommendations&mdash; and we know there will be many and we hope good recommendations&mdash;the Parliamentary Secretary and his staff would now want to be gearing themselves for that work so that we would not have to wait another year or two to implement the recommendations. That would be unfair to the whole industry.</P>
    <P>It is my considered opinion, having looked at it from the inside and the outside, that fisheries demand that there be a Ministry of Fisheries.  I do not say it should deal with fisheries alone; I would include in that the environment and perhaps some marine works as well, which are all touching on the whole operation of fisheries. I want to make it quite clear that in saying that I am not reflecting in any way on the Parliamentary Secretary's capacity to look after fisheries. I am putting it forward as an objective point of view.  I would include the environment in that because pollution is becoming a tremendous problem. <Col N="1326" /> Perhaps it is not a great problem as yet.  We have the advantage of seeing what has happened in other parts of the world.  It is up to us to take steps to prevent that happening here.  The Parliamentary Secretary has a special interest in pollution because of the effect it can have on fish life.  I do not think it should be dealt with by the Department of Local Government or any other such Department, because we all know that the Department of Local Government is one of the biggest polluters in the country.  Therefore, I think we have arrived at the stage, if we are serious about this question at all, where it is necessary to have a Minister for Fisheries.  We are dealing here today with inland fisheries, but we have sea fisheries to deal with as well.</P>
    <P>Another problem in fisheries to which I should like to refer is the number of fisheries in the country which are not being worked at all at present because, perhaps, their owners cannot be traced; perhaps they are living in some foreign country.  Where a fishery is not worked it should be taken over by the State and handed over to somebody to see that it is worked properly.  I do not advocate the nationalising of inland fisheries.  I do not mind whether the fishery is privately or publicly owned provided it is worked in the best possible way in the interests of the greatest number of people.  It is up to the Parliamentary Secretary to ensure that all our fisheries are properly utilised to the advantage of the majority of our people.  This is essential.  I hope the whole question of inland fisheries will be dealt with in a serious manner.  I wish the Parliamentary Secretary well in the task he has before him.  It is a big task.  It is not an easy task.  I assure him that in advancing fisheries he will have my co-operation at all times.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DenisGallagher" hpid="Mr. Gallagher Mr. Gallagher">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gallagher</NameTxt>
      <P>As a Deputy who lives close to the sea I am very disappointed that this is the first time in my 17 months in this House that we have had an opportunity of discussing fisheries.  Our fisheries should be treated in a more serious way by the Government.  It would appear that anything <Col N="1327" /> connected with fisheries is regarded as being of a rather trivial nature, something that bears little relationship to the fishing industry.</P>
      <P>I hope this is the last occasion that it will be found necessary to introduce such a Bill as this.  The role of boards of conservators, the methods employed in their election and everything surrounding the boards should be abolished and something positive should be done to develop rather than conserve fisheries.  The emphasis has been on conservation.  There has been very little emphasis on development.</P>
      <P>One may ask what the conservation is for, what it is all about.  If one examines the constitution of the boards and the membership of the boards it is quite easy to understand what conservation means.  It means conservation of stocks of salmon and trout for the aristocracy, for the people who brought in the Acts originally and who have lived by them.  Anybody will agree that it is not a satisfactory situation that a man whose valuation is £50 or more is entitled to four votes in the election of a board of conservators.</P>
      <P>Emphasis has been laid on the damage being done by drift net fishermen. I do not agree with the Act introduced by Deputy Fahey when he was Parliamentary Secretary and I think less of the Bill being piloted through the House by the present Parliamentary Secretary with regard to the issue of drift net licences.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There has been a hue and cry about the damage which is being done by drift net fishermen along the coast.  In an answer to a Dáil question which I put down recently to the Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries I received proof that the number of salmon caught on the river Moy, which is supposed to be seriously affected by drift net fishing, for the last year for which records are available, was the highest over a long period.  I put down the question with regard to a ten year period.  The last year showed the highest number of salmon caught over the period.  That proves without any shadow of doubt that drift net fishing is not having <Col N="1328" /> the effect on stocks which people like to think it has.</P>
    <P>One studies what is taking place in the rivers and one finds that in one river it is possible for a company to take as many as 700 fish in one haul.  I am informed that this has happened this year.  Traps and other devices are used and the fish have no chance of escape.  It is in this way that the damage is being done to stocks.  Notice must be taken of this matter.</P>
    <P>As I have said in other places, when people along the west coast, the south coast and the north-west coast go out to catch salmon they have to fish during the hours of darkness.  This gives them approximately four hours to fish.  That means that the salmon can run freely for 20 hours.  Having regard to the weather and other conditions prevailing on the west coast it means that if a fisherman manages to have 80 hours during a season he is doing quite well.  In other words, if he has 20 fishing nights from 8th June to the end of July he is doing well.  He is allowed to fish only five nights in the week.  Weather conditions have a big bearing on drift net fishing.  On a calm night the salmon do not mesh and it would be just as well for the fisherman to stay at home on such a night.</P>
    <P>The best time for drift net fishing is when there is a fairly stiff breeze, possibly a force four to six wind.  Because of conditions along the west coast, I hope the Parliamentary Secretary will review this question in his 1975 order and try to ensure that the social and economic conditions of the west are considered.  I hope he will find it possible to make more licences available to those engaged in this kind of fishing.  It is rather difficult to understand the situation where An Bord Iascaigh Mhara give grants for boats and expect the fishermen to make regular repayments while, at the same time, the Department are restricting the amount of fishing that may be carried out.  There is an anomaly here which must be corrected.</P>
    <P>The Inland Fisheries Commission are going to produce a document that <Col N="1329" /> will be objective and which, if implemented, will have far-reaching effects on the entire matter of fisheries. As was pointed out by Deputy Fahey, there are many rivers and lakes that could be developed.  They would be of great value to local people and would also be an amenity from the point of view of tourism.  It is a shame that they are neglected, that we have a situation where fish cannot go up river, where spawning beds are not cleaned and no effort is made to do something positive about improving stocks.  I am certain the Inland Fisheries Commission will have many recommendations on this matter.</P>
    <P>Serious consideration must be given to the problem of pollution.  At the moment it does not seem to be a matter for the Parliamentary Secretary or the Department of Agriculture and Fisheries.  We might consider what is happening in Britain, where a river authority has been established.  They are responsible for everything connected with rivers and waterways and naturally fisheries are included in their work.  The Government would do well to have a look at the work being done by this authority in the hope that we might follow what they have been doing.  We might learn from mistakes made by people in Britain and in other countries who have had to cope with the problem of pollution.  It is beginning to manifest itself here and in many instances it will have serious consequences.</P>
    <P>I agree with Deputy Fahey that the Inland Fisheries Commission have worked very hard to produce a report. I had the honour of serving on that commission but unfortunately since I became a Member of this House I have not had time to attend meetings. From my experience of the members of the commission, I know it would be difficult to find a group who have worked so earnestly and who have put so much effort into the development of our fisheries.  When the report is available I hope it will be seriously considered by the House and the Government and that it will not be shelved.  I hope that the recommendations will be acted upon.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1330" /> The boards of conservators had been working with very limited funds.  I am sure they would have liked to do many things but they found it impossible to carry them out.  In the development of our fisheries we must have officers who are properly trained, who work on a full-time basis, who are employed by the State and are in a position to understand the entire development of this industry.  They must get away from the present idea of merely conserving stocks without placing any emphasis on the question of real development.</P>
    <P>I hope this is the last occasion we will have to deal with a matter of this kind.  We should consider the establishment of a development authority of some kind to improve this valuable industry.  I agree entirely with Deputy Fahey when he said that fisheries are important enough to have a specific Ministry allocated to deal with the matter.</P>
    <P>When the State was established, the importance of fisheries was recognised. In the first Dáil there was a Minister for Fisheries, and it was a pity we departed from this practice. This important industry has been put in with various Departments in the last few years.  At present it is with the Department of Agriculture; at one time it was with the Department of the Gaeltacht, and then it was with the Department of Lands.  This shows that we have not taken the matter of fisheries very seriously.  We do not seem to realise how important it could be to the economy of the country. When we see what has happened in countries such as Norway, a nation with a population similar in size to ours, when we consider the vast development that has taken place, and the benefits that have come to the economy of the country, it is a lesson for us, one we should examine carefully and about which we should try to get down to doing something serious.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Mr. Molloy Mr. Molloy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to express my deep regret at the necessity for this extension, my regret at the Parliamentary Secretary having to come to the House to seek our authority to extend the election date for the board of conservators.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1331" /> I would remind the Parliamentary Secretary that on the 2nd May, 1974, in answer to a Parliamentary Question from Deputy Daly, in Volume 272 of the Official Report, at column 729 he was asked if he proposed to change the system of election of membership of boards of conservators; and, if so, the changes he proposed to make.  The Parliamentary Secretary's reply read:</P>
    <P>The system of election of boards of fishery conservators is at present being reviewed in my Department. I have not as yet finalised any proposals in the matter.</P>
    <P>I intervened to ask:</P>
    <P>Will the decision be made within a short time?</P>
    <P>And the Parliamentary Secretary replied: &ldquo;Yes&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I pointed out that we had waited a long time for action on this matter from the Parliamentary Secretary but that nothing had happened yet and the Parliamentary Secretary then replied:</P>
    <P>I expect to have it before the next elections which are to take place in October.</P>
    <P>All this was said on the 2nd May this year.  I should like to ask the Parliamentary Secretary if the position then was that he had the whole matter of this question of the system of election to the board of conservators under review; what has happened the review which was being carried out in his Department and why has he not arrived at a decision and brought forward the legislation&mdash;as he promised to do&mdash;in time to have this new legislation, implementing a new system of election to these boards, in operation for the elections which were due next October.  I am not satisfied with the explanation that the Parliamentary Secretary has given in the document he has circulated where he states that he has had discussions with the Chairman and members of the Inland Fisheries Commission and particularly where he says:</P>
    <P>... I understand that the Commission will have recommendations which would call for extensive <Col N="1332" /> amendments of the fisheries legislation</P>
    <P>That, we expect.  Then he goes on to say:</P>
    <P>on many aspects of conservation including the constitution of the boards.</P>
    <P>These gentlemen's views on the constitution of the board might be validly taken into consideration in arriving at a decision but I fail to understand why their views should influence the Parliamentary Secretary so completely that he decides to postpone the elections for a full 12 months period and implies, in this postponement, that whatever views these gentlemen will bring forward are more or less going to be the bones of the new system.  As one of the Deputies who influenced the establishment of that Commission at the time Mr. Blaney was Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries&mdash;and I can rightly claim to have influenced the decision to establish that Commission through representations I had been making continuously before that period&mdash;I should like to express here&mdash;this is the first opportunity I have taken to express it publicly in the House&mdash;my complete dissatisfaction at the persons who constitute membership of this Commission.</P>
    <P>I do not feel they are representative of the Irish community or of the Irish fisheries interest.  I think that these boards&mdash;as are the boards of conservators which have existed up to the present time&mdash;are overloaded with a vested interest, that interest being the ownership of private fisheries.  I think that such persons who have this interest should not have been appointed in such large numbers to the Commission.  This is the very system about which we are complaining, which operate in the election to the boards of conservators up to now&mdash; that this vested interest group holds the sway and determines what happens. We know that they have proved to have been ultra-conservative in all the actions they have taken in relation to fishery matters throughout the years.</P>
    <P>In my view, these boards of conservators have very little of which to <Col N="1333" /> be proud, and I am entitled to offer my opinion here.  I have very good reason for expressing that view.  I have had experience of how they operate. I have had experience of the resistance which they have presented against the legitimate claims of fishermen in my own area where, thanks to the then Minister, a public inquiry was held despite their protests.  The inquiry, thanks be to God, came down on the side of the fishermen.  My experience of how they operated then, before then and indeed since, leads me to have very little regard for the manner in which they carry out their business.</P>
    <P>Because of that, I deem it a matter of very great regret that the Parliamentary Secretary has come to the House and asked for this extension. He is allowing these people to control the whole fishery conservation work for another 12 months, a group of conservative people who, in the main, represent their own private interests only.  This, I think, is not good for fisheries.  I do not think it is a good principle on which to establish any committee or commission.  I would go so far as to say that, in my view, fisheries in this country in the hands of private owners should be acquired by the State.  Many of the titles are questionable and many of the owners have never resided in this country; some of the owners cannot even be traced.  I would urge the Parliamentary Secretary to consider very seriously setting into motion some process under which the State could acquire gradually private fisheries, when they become available; in cases where they are being neglected totally by the owners, he should acquire unto himself power&mdash;in the new legislation coming forward later on&mdash;to acquire such fisheries, and that a policy should be adopted by the State of phasing out, over a period, the private ownership of any fisheries in this country.</P>
    <P>The old argument which has been used successfully up to now in resisting my type of proposal has been the constitutional protection of the rights of private ownership, therefore, the obligation on the State to <Col N="1334" /> pay compensation and that the amount of compensation so required would be so enormous that the State could not justify the expenditure of such large amounts of money in acquiring such fisheries, especially when the State at any particular time would always have pressing demands on its resources.  Knowing that argument and feeling if it is going to be used continuously against a policy of acquisition of private fisheries by the State, we will never arrive at a situation where the State comes into control. Therefore, we are adhering to a policy of private ownership and agreeing with it.  We know that much of the title to these is doubtful; many of the ownerships which now exist were acquired by the sword in days gone by and by doubtful gifts from the king and queen of our neighbouring country.  I would have no sympathy with the owners.  I would accept their rights to some degree of compensation. I would not be frightened by the huge sums involved.  I would set about a process of acquisition bit by bit&mdash;as they become available and the ones that have been neglected&mdash;and I would set aside each year a certain sum of money devoted solely to the acquisition of fisheries.</P>
    <P>We have a structure in this country well capable of controlling and managing such private fisheries for the State.  The Inland Fisheries Trust is there, operates very successfully, has all the machinery, technique, expertise, owns fisheries at this moment on behalf of the State.  It would be no burden on the Inland Fisheries Trust to assume the management of further large tracts of fisheries which are at present held in private ownership. I have always argued that the Inland Fisheries Trust should receive substantially increased financial support from the State year by year.  I am pleased to record that over the years the allocation granted to them to carry out their very valuable and successful work has been increased. The State has recognised the value of the work they have been doing.</P>
    <P>I do not know whether the Parliamentary Secretary has any independent views at all on the question of <Col N="1335" /> private ownership or the composition of the boards of conservators because he has not expressed himself very often on these matters though they are his responsibility.  A little enlightenment at the end of this debate might be helpful to those of us who have always taken a special interest in fishery matters.  The fact that the Parliamentary Secretary had already under review the system of election to those boards and has not decided to implement the proposals which he was considering but has postponed his decision to enable him to consider the views of this commission is something I regret.  It implies that the Parliamentary Secretary is not his own man in this matter.</P>
    <P>Fisheries, no more than any other aspect of our economy, should not be left on the long finger.  When he does come to make his decision I know that he will take into consideration the views expressed by Deputies in this House.  I hope that in whatever new system emerges only a democratic system of election will be applied and that the idea of a special number of votes for the owners of fisheries over a certain valuation will be abolished. All that must be abolished.  There are genuine members of the community as concerned about the development of fisheries and the conservation of stock as any private owner, and much more so in many cases.  If the Parliamentary Secretary looks around and consults in each local area he can gather together a very high level of representation of fishery interests, very dedicated people who could give very valuable service to the promotion of Irish inland fisheries. We are not dependent on the brains and the so-called knowledge of those who own fisheries.  Their right to ownership in some cases is doubtful and in others their only right has been the size of their bank account. They look upon their stretch of private fishing as a status symbol.  I am not saying all of them do.  There is a danger, when making global statements, of accusing everybody.  I am not, but I am saying that such people exist.  They have very little interest <Col N="1336" /> in fisheries apart from a week-end down in the west to fish the old private stretch.  Many of them get great delight from owning such stretches of water so that they can give free fishing to their big business friends.  The whole thing stinks of status symbols and big money.  I do not think any legislation should be designed to cater especially for such people, and that is what has happened. We know that the basis of it in 1848 came from a Government and a people who lived in that environment and who thrived in it, but we are a democratic State, established now for over 50 years.  It is a sad fact and it is a reflection on those of us who supported a party in government here before the Parliamentary Secretary's party came in.  The only credit I can claim for the Fianna Fáil Party is that at least in our time we did set about dismantling all those structures by the creation of commissions to go into all fishery legislation with a view to modernising it and to removing the stigma of British imperialism which runs rife through all fisheries legislation. Much was done in 1959 and great credit is due to the then Minister, but much of the basic legislation still remains in operation and this is the cause of my complaint today.</P>
    <P>I want to refer to the power of the boards of conservators at present to issue drift net licences to fishermen. Quite rightly in recent times restrictions have been introduced on the number of licences to be granted and on the category of persons entitled to such licences.  Accepting those two basic principles does not imply a complete ban on every individual seeking a licence.  I think there has been a restrictive attitude adopted by the boards of conservators who were only too delighted to get those new regulations into their hands and to wield them as stringently and in as restrictive a manner as possible.  They have never shown any concern for or any interest in the welfare of people who derive their livelihood from fishing for salmon at sea with drift nets. To give them, who are in the majority on those boards in the main, certainly on the west coast, the power to issue <Col N="1337" /> licences, has introduced an element of Tammany Hall.  I am aware of persons who were genuinely refused licences, who had alternative sources of income but who could make a case, granted a weak one, and who were refused on their original applications. Means were employed to soften certain individuals on the boards and licences were subsequently issued for very wrong reasons.  I am concerned about the genuine people who are now shut out.</P>
    <P>An inquiry was held in the fishery districts off the Galway coast.  There are three fishery districts there where drift netting for salmon had been debarred by law for 40 or 50 years or more, up to the time of that inquiry.  The result of the inquiry was the removal of the ban.  The Parliamentary Secretary knows that drift netting for salmon off the Galway coast is a new thing, that there were not any drift netters there before 1969, when the Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries gave his decision bearing in mind the report of the three inquiries.  Many fishermen did not know anything about drift netting for salmon off the Galway coast.  They knew it was something that was carried on in Donegal, that there was a little of it off the Mayo coast, that there was some in the south of Ireland. They had no experience of it. They did not even know what kind of nets were needed, what hours one fished or what kind of boats were suitable.  I know this for a fact. Nobody came to help them or to inform them on how to acquire the skill of drift netting.  One can waste a lot of money on buying nets and boats and spend a lot of money on petrol for expensive engines if one does not have the necessary basic information.  They visited other areas and spoke to fishermen but it was not a popular operation.  Anyone who undertook it in the early years when the licence was available found it very hard.  Only a handful of fishermen availed of the licence.</P>
    <P>I had to encourage certain fishermen to apply because they thought it was a waste of time.  There was a very strong belief among the fishermen <Col N="1338" /> in the Aran Islands that there was no salmon to be caught off the Aran Islands.  The first Aran Island fishermen who applied for licences brought their boats into Spiddal and fished from there.  They left their own fishing grounds because they believed no salmon could be obtained off the Aran Islands.  I say this to demonstrate to the Parliamentary Secretary that any system of allocating drift net licences, which is dependent on the number of years in which you held a licence previous to your application, is a wrong system, because there are genuine fishermen, people who spend most of their time fishing for lobster, whose trade has been falling steadily.  It has become more and more difficult to eke a living out of lobster fishing in the summer months in recent years.  The answer to the drop in the number of lobster being caught is to increase the number of pots they put into the sea.  They had to invest in new pots and have had to do twice the amount of dropping and hauling of pots as they were doing 5 or 6 years ago.  All of this is done to try to acquire the same income from it.</P>
    <P>The Parlimentary Secretary knows that fishing is a hazardous business, especially on the west coast of Ireland. These men, whose income was reduced year by year from lobster and cray fish, could have turned to drift netting for salmon if they believed there was salmon there.  Last year an attempt was made by a small number to drift for salmon off the Aran Islands.  In certain parts some fish were caught.  This year, for the very first time, full-time drift net fishing for salmon in the legal period, which only lasts for a few weeks, was undertaken by some of the fishermen there who have been fairly successful.</P>
    <P>The Parliamentary Secretary today, in answer to a question by Deputy Crowley asking that special consideration be given to island fishermen in their application, gave a very negative reply.  I am sure he will remember that I asked a very similar question not so long ago when I also got a very negative and unhelpful reply.  I asked that special consideration be given to the Aran fishermen because they had a <Col N="1339" /> special case.  If they apply now they are told they did not hold a licence for two out of the previous three years, and they will not be given a licence.  The Parliamentary Secretary has the reputation, which some people believe, of being a reasonable man.  He can prove to me he is a reasonable man if he will reconsider the decision about the application of these new regulations to the Aran Island fishermen.  It is distressing to think that so much opposition and lack of co-operation is coming from the Department when one considers that only a handful of fishermen are involved.  It is a sad reflection on the Parlimentary Secretary, and on the officials of his Department, and it is also a very poor reflection on the boards of conservators in our area.  They may claim their hands are tied by the regulations drawn up by the Parliamentary Secretary.</P>
    <P>I started out by saying there was a need for a restriction.  I believe in conservation but I also believe in the development of fisheries.  I believe it should be applied fairly, that the means used to apply it should be reasonable and that the regulations should apply in a fair manner, taking into consideration the circumstances of the applicant.  A rigid application can cause great hardship in certain areas and to certain families who are affected.  I agree with bringing in some level of control.</P>
    <P>Deputy Jackie Fahey introduced the first attempt in this country to operate a successful conservation policy for salmon.  It was a brave thing to attempt to do because it was not popular with the people who would be affected.  We did not hear the boards of conservators clapping loudly about this work of conservation undertaken by the Government at that time.  The present Parliamentary Secretary came into office some months later at an opportune time to receive all the complaints. He made some adjustment to the regulations.  Now, I believe there is a need to review the operation of these regulations <i>in toto</i>.  It is wrong thinking to feel, because the Parliamentary Secretary made a regulation, he should not change it.  I would <Col N="1340" /> agree he is a reasonable and sensible man if he would undertake, before next year's salmon season starts, to review completely, with the assistance of local knowledge, local circumstances and having invited those who feel they have a grievance to write to him and explain their grievances, these regulations.  I do not believe the boards of conservators have their hearts in the right places as far as the poor people of this country are concerned. They have no idea of the difference between casting a salmon rod on a stretch of river on a cool summer evening and going out in a small boat in a rough sea, throwing out a long net which will drift and waiting for many hours, watching your net, making sure it is drifting in the right line and patrolling your net to make sure you get your salmon before the seals do.</P>
    <P>The Parliamentary Secretary is aware of all these problems.  It is a hard life, and weather can be so bad on occasions that it is impossible to go out.  If there are three working a boat that means there are three people whose incomes depend on what they get.  If they are in for four days out of the week there will not be much to divide at the end of the week.  We all hear of the trip when they come in with 40, 50 or 60 salmon. They get more in Donegal, but they certainly do not get large catches off the Galway coast.  A catch of 45 salmon is a redletter day for the drift netters off the Galway coast.  In Donegal they come in with hundreds.  These men lead a very hard life.  They are taking a risk and they cannot get into the business without heavy capital expenditure.  Their boats cost from £2,000 to £20,000.  The lobster boats which some of them use for drift netting are bigger and more expensive.</P>
    <P>The nets costs hundreds of pounds and they can be lost at sea.  They can be torn to ribbons, and if the British mine sweepers are around they can be cut in two as well.  They are very often lost.  Sometimes a fisherman buys a net which is not suitable for the sea conditions off his coast and this is a useless net to him.  The fishermen on <Col N="1341" /> the Galway coast had to import nets from Japan.  Somebody said one of those was successful last year so they all switched to them.  They have to leave the nets which they had last year in the sheds.  The fishermen have to use heavy engines which consume petrol all the time, because if you tie up for long periods you will find your salmon has been taken by seals or you have lost your net.  There are tricks of patrolling the net and in that way confusing the salmon, which get enmeshed.  If the weather is bad the fisherman's income can be very small.</P>
    <P>I am putting these facts before the Parliamentary Secretary in the hope that he will agree to review the operation of these regulations since he changed them on coming into office. I am asking him to give very special consideration to the few fishermen in the Aran Islands who have been denied licences on the grounds of a rigid interpretation and application of the condition of having to have held a licence for two years previously. This was not possible in that area because there was no tradition of salmon fishing there; people were sceptical of the possibility of catching them and did not have the capital to acquire the boats and nets and to go out there fully equipped on a chance.  It has been shown that it can be done in a small way for a few weeks very successfully.  None of them will make any great amount of money. If the Parliamentary Secretary continues his attitude of refusing to allow these people ever to hold a licence, then he will only encourage poaching or illegal fishing.  It is not fair to a small man that he should have to be watching over his shoulder all the time for a patrol boat or for an employee of the board of conservators or the Garda to catch him.  They do not want to break the law, but they have to make a living.  If the living is outside the door and the only thing that is stopping them is the Parlimentary Secretary, Deputy Pat Murphy, and his regulations, then I do not think you could blame them if they feel he has not acted reasonably with them.</P>
    <P>Deputy Gallagher made the point <Col N="1342" /> that the emphasis in the statement of the Parliamentary Secretary in relation to these boards was on conservation. Maybe the title of these boards would imply that.  I think we are all interested in the development of our fisheries, not just in trying to conserve the stocks that are there.  I personally would refuse to accept the stated view of the owners of private fisheries that the biggest danger to the preservation of the salmon species in this country is the drift netting fishermen.  We have a private fishery in the Moy in Ballina, County Mayo, where Deputy Gallagher has informed us 700 salmon were taken in one haul, and they keep hauling that river hour after hour.  It is unknown to me at this moment how many thousands of salmon have been taken out of the Moy this year, last year, or the year before.  No restriction whatever is applied to the numbers of fish that these private fisheries can take.  I can never understand how any person attempts to speak with authority on the conservation of salmon in Ireland and leaves the blame on the drift netting fishermen while making no reference to the vast quantities of salmon that are being taken out of the private fisheries in the summer months.  The same applies in the town of Galway where they can close off the river and take everything they want out of it.</P>
    <P>What has been done in relation to restricting licences for drift netting was good thinking, but the application of it must be kept under continual review in order to ensure that there is no genuine hardship, and there has been, as I pointed out, and there may be in other areas that the Parliamentary Secretary may know of himself. That was good, but there should be some limit on the number of fish that can be taken from the private fisheries. If the fear is that so many fish are going to be taken before they get to the river, that they will not get up to spawn and that the species will die out, then the biggest fishing of all is taking place in the estuaries of these rivers where netting and other forms of fishing are allowed legally, smiled on by officialdom and the boards of conservators and which in the main, <Col N="1343" /> are owned by the boards of conservators. There was a minor restriction included in the new regulations, but it is having no real effect.  I can assure the Parliamentary Secretary that in introducing some real restriction on these people he would have my support and that of the majority of my colleagues who have given any thought to this.</P>
    <P>These are the very people who when it came to considering whether drift netting should be allowed off the Galway coast organised themselves and had a collection headed by a director of Guinnesses, Sir Richard Levine, who put up £500 as the first contribution to start a fund to fight the fishermen off the Galway coast in the fishing inquiry that was to be held. These were the monied people, and they employed the best legal brains in the country to attend at a little hall down in Letterfrack on one day, in Carna on the next day, and in the court house in Galway on the third day.  We were confronted&mdash;the fishermen and those who were there speaking with them&mdash;by the best legal brains in the country representing the vested interest, the Sir Richard Levines, and the owners of the private fisheries.  No mention was made in their argument about the overfishing they were doing themselves.  Very little reference was made to any contribution they were making towards the development of fisheries.  I will give credit to the Guinness organisation, who did seem to have a genuine enough interest and who have invested in salmon research; so well they might.  The ESB were present on that occasion, and my memory is that they were not very helpful either.</P>
    <P>Therefore I would ask the Parliamentary Secretary that, in considering all these laws and the powers and functions of the boards of conservators and the purpose for which they will make these decisions in the application of the Parliamentary Secretary's regulations, he would bear in mind the necessity to apply the restrictions on both sides of the fence, not just on the drift netter who has all the hazards of the sea to confront <Col N="1344" /> and who takes so many chances with the weather.  He is the man who needs the Parliamentary Secretary's sympathy, not the man who owns the private fishery.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. White</NameTxt>
      <P>This is a very simple Bill and the kernel of the amendment is the imporvement that can be made in the constitution of the boards of conservators.  The Parliamentary Secretary is quite right to await the report from the Inland Fisheries Commission before he decides on the new constitution, which is now overdue.  He has always asked the fishermen and the people with fishing interests for their advice before he has taken any steps, and I think this is the right thing to do.</P>
      <P>Some previous speakers have mentioned the difference between the 1972 Control of Fishing for Salmon Order and the 1973 Control of Fishing for Salmon (Amendment) Order.  I can remember Deputies from the Opposition stating in this House when they brought in this 1973 amendment that hundreds and hundreds more people would get fishing licences than were getting them in 1972.  That is not the case.  The fact of the matter is that in 1972 the total fishing licences issued were 1,982, in 1973 the total fishing licences issued were 1,987, and in 1974, the total fishing licences issued were 1,987.  In other words these licence numbers have stayed practically static.  Previous speakers referred to drift net licences.  In 1972 there were 1,086 issued; in 1973 there were 1,042 issued and in 1974, 1,005 were issued&mdash;a decrease in the number issued.</P>

      <P>I was not here to hear the Deputy.  As Deputy Crowley said, he wants more people to get licences. He can remember that under his amendment only those who held three would get one.  In other words, people who held three licences in the period 1968-72 were in 1972 entitled to a licence.  Is the Deputy going to tell me that our amendment in 1973 was not better?  We categorically stated that anybody who got the major portion of his income from fishing was entitled to a licence.</P>

The facts speak for themselves.</P>

      <P>The fishermen seem to be very happy at the present time. Today fishing is big business.  It is our third major industry.  There have been tremendous developments, especially in areas of Donegal, in particular Killybegs, where fishing is developing at a fast rate.  Regard must be had to the need for restocking and for research in the fishing industry. It would be well worth while waiting 12 months to get proper advice.  It is sad to think that in Ballyshannon only 400 fish had gone up the estuary up to last week.  This demonstrates the need for research into our major fishing rivers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Molloy spoke about the <Col N="1346" /> drift net fishermen.  The drift net fishermen should be asked to pull their boats out by about half a mile from the present post.  Our fishery limits generally speaking should be extended.  The Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries is at present in Brussels endeavouring to have the fishing limits extended.</P>
    <P>I must agree with Deputy Molloy when he talks about the need to examine the private fishing enterprise and the private monopoly that some people seem to have in private rivers. The private rivers should be nationalised. I agree with Deputy Molloy when he says that money should be forthcoming from the State to take over private rivers.</P>
    <P>I should like to compliment the Parliamentary Secretary on the businesslike way in which he is tackling his responsibilities.  He has shown his willingness to meet any deputation that may come to him and to consult with the fishermen.  The Parliamentary Secretary is thanked by the fishermen most for his co-operation with those who should know and from whom he should take advice.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanDaly" hpid="Mr. Daly Mr. Daly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Daly</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to make a few points on the proposal to defer elections for 12 months.  I would not have any great objection to the deferment but I am in difficulty as to the way this Bill could be used to defer elections from year to year.  As a result of this Bill you could have a situation that there might not be an election for the next five years.  If I could get some assurance from the Parliamentary Secretary that the order would not be used for more than one year I would be quite happy about that part of the Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I agree with what the Parliamentary Secretary said about the fishery boards.  They have been criticised, I think unfairly, by a great many people who do not understand the type of work they do.  Much of the criticism has been of the way in which they allocated drift net licences, especially in the last few years.  The allocation of licences is a very minor part of the work of these boards.  If the allocation of drift net licences were removed from the boards and <Col N="1347" /> if that duty were given to a special commission set up by the Minister, that would be a far better method and would remove a great deal of the criticism that is levelled at the boards. Some of the criticism has stemmed from the fact that some members of boards were themselves licence holders.  These people were in a position to adjudicate on applications for drift net licences.  It is very unfair that that should be the case.  The Parliamentary Secretary should examine this matter which has given rise to criticism of the boards.  If the method of allocation were changed much of the criticism would disappear.</P>
    <P>The boards have done tremendous work in the protection of fisheries. They have not always received sufficient financial support from the State. Estimates are sent up to the Department. The boards are in the best position to know the local problems and to assess financial need.  The estimates have been cut by the Department year after year.  As a result, serious pollution problems have developed which would not have occurred if the necessary finance had been available to the boards.  I am very concerned about this aspect of the matter.</P>
    <P>Great work has been carried out by the boards.  The staffs of the boards have worked tremendously well.  There are no proper working conditions for the staff.  They work on a day to day basis.  They are appointed from year to year.  They have no pension scheme, no rights.  They can be dismissed at the whim of a member of the board.  For instance, if a relative of a member of the staff had been convicted for some minor offence, the member of the staff could be dismissed by the head waterkeeper.  In some areas members of boards have used their influence to get rid of waterkeepers and other staff.  This is very unfair.  I hope legislation will be introduced for the purpose of restructuring fishery boards and providing proper conditions of service for their staffs.  This applies even to senior executives of the fishery boards.  They have no salary scale or superannuation <Col N="1348" /> scheme.  I hope the Parliamentary Secretary will consider these matters and use his influence to rectify them.</P>
    <P>He told us he has had consultations with the Inland Fisheries Commission. I should like him to consult with the joint council to see what can be done about the amalgamation of boards and the streamlining of the general structure of boards throughout the country.  I know that some of the large boards are working satisfactorily but there are many small boards also involved.  The general structure should be examined to see how these problems can be sorted out.</P>
    <P>I am concerned that the postponment of elections will hinder the work of the fishery boards, that the members may fall down on their jobs, especially during this busy season.  The Parliamentary Secretary might consider the conditions under which the members of the boards have been working.  They have given their time voluntarily but they are not allowed travelling expenses to attend meetings. It is difficult to expect voluntary boards such as these, who have an important job to do to function properly in such circumstances.</P>
    <P>The Parliamentary Secretary should consider these matters urgently. Some of the problems in connection with salmon and inland fisheries have been regarded as less urgent and have been put on the long finger, with the result that the problem has got worse. The Parliamentary Secretary has an obligation to all fishermen to regulate these matters without any delay. I do not have any objection to postponing the elections for a year but I would have serious objections to this Order especially if the Parliamentary Secretary would postpone elections indefinitely simply by way of Order.  If I could get some guarantee from him that this Order will not be used except for one or two years I would have no objection to it.</P>

      <P>I am pleased the House has generally approved of this measure.  I can assure Deputies I <Col N="1349" /> sought the best advice available. With the Minister I met the chairman and members of the commission a few months ago because I was rather worried at the time that their report was not forthcoming.  I realise that it is a difficult task and that such a report needs a great deal of preparation. I am satisfied they are reporting on a comprehensive scale.  I considered it reasonable to ask the House to agree that the present system be continued for a further year.  I can assure Deputy Daly and the other speakers who referred to this point that it is my hope that the section that gives authority to prolong the period beyond 12 months will not be invoked.</P>
      <P>When I answered Deputy Molloy and told him I was reviewing the question of election to boards I had advice available to me from departmental and other sources.  I knew the review should be made without delay if it was to operate by next October when the elections were due.  I could do that, but that would be dealing only with the system of election to boards.  A better way would be to introduce this measure, get a further period of 12 months and, in the menatime, have additional information available from all sources, not least the fishermen themselves.</P>
      <P>Possibly it would be unfair of me to go ahead with a Bill dealing with fisheries without having the advice of the commission.  The previous Government set up the commission in 1970.  In the course of his contribution, Deputy Molloy indicated he was not too pleased with some of the members of the board.  That is his view.  The board were appointed by the previous Government and it would be out of place for me to comment on a suggestion like that.  Even though I am personally disappointed about the delay in submitting the report.  I think the board are reviewing the question in a comprehensive way and I am hopeful that when the report is available within the next five or six months it will prove to have been worth waiting for.  It is certainly my hope that it will be available in that time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1350" /> Deputy Daly referred to reflections made on members of boards.  I do not think it is fair or just to reflect in a general way on members of boards in this House.  I agree that many members of the 17 boards acted conscientiously.  They put a great deal of industry into trying to develop the fisheries and in formulating policies with little financial reward for themselves. As Deputy Molloy mentioned, some of them may have vested interests but it is unfair to generalise in that way.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M.P. Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>Generalising is bad.  In the course of my introductory statement, I acknowledged the work of the boards and I have no hesitation in adhering to that acknowledgement. When I took office in March of last year and when this question of election of members of the boards came up for consideration&mdash;under the system that obtained then&mdash;I could not approve of an election under that system. I am not blaming the members of the boards for that system; they are not responsible for it; it is this House which is responsible because we make laws and, if we did not change the system that has been in operation, with little alteration, since 1848, it is we who are to blame.  We have to take the blame for the fact that the system was not changed in the past 50 years.  Members were elected under the system laid down by law and it is no reflection on them that they were so elected.  Looking back over the years, the amazing feature of it is how it was allowed to continue; how it was that year after year when the question of fisheries was discussed in the House here, we did not try to get that system changed, a system under which, if one had a certain valuation, one was appointed <i>ex officio</i> a member of a board with no support at all. Other classifications of voters have four votes; others two; some others, then, one only, a plurality of votes.  I am sure Deputies here will accept from <Col N="1351" /> me that I could not countenance such a system and that as far as I am concerned&mdash;and indeed as far as the Government are concerned&mdash;that system should die and die as quickly as possible, as I hope it will within the next year.</P>
      <P>There are several other features of this industry which must be taken into account, and this is another reason for the deferment of the elections. I should like to be in a position to have a comprehensive measure covering not alone this item&mdash;this election to boards&mdash;but also the question of whether a change in the system is desirable; whether, in the intervening period before legislation is brought before the House, some other suggestions may be thrown up by the commission; by people other than those in the commission; by Deputies in this House&mdash;and nobody will get a better hearing than the elected representatives of the people, irrespective of what side of the House they may be on.  Any Deputy who has a view to express on this or on any other question&mdash;he is here by virtue of having been elected by a section of the people of this country&mdash;is entitled to be heard; his views are entitled to be analysed by whatever Minister or Parliamentary Secretary is dealing with the matter under discussion. I can assure all Deputies that their contributions today&mdash;and they were wide and varied&mdash;will be analysed and taken into account when it comes to the time to draw up and formulate policies.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Before coming to the divergence of views, I should like to mention this in relation to the hearing of views: I do repeat&mdash;and I would emphasise it &mdash;that the views of the people engaged in the industry must receive special consideration; whether they be the small men or the big men; whether they are the crew men earning a few pounds a day&mdash;many of them earn small weekly sums on average&mdash;or whether they be the bigger skippers. Every man, irrespective of the rung of the ladder on which he stands and particularly those on the lower rungs &mdash;by that I mean the lower income <Col N="1352" /> groups&mdash;is entitled to have his views considered.  From my experience of meeting them and particularly my experience locally of meeting fishermen living near the sea, in a fishing town, I believe they can offer valuable and useful suggestions.</P>
    <P>But there was a divergence of opinion that emanated from the discussion today amongst members of the Opposition party.  I have no doubt but that all of the views were sincerely expressed.  The salmon question arose and was referred to by almost all of the Deputies who contributed to the debate.  At this stage I should like to refer to figures given by Deputy White.  The figures were actual and factual.  We are dealing now with the main question of salmon licences&mdash;in 1972 the number of drift net licences issued&mdash;the ones which are the main bone of contention&mdash;was 1,086; in 1973 the figure was 1,042, as indicated by Deputy White and, this year, it is 1,025.  Had Fianna Fáil continued in office the 1972 figure would have been reduced to something in the region of 700 by virtue of the Order made in the latter part of 1972 which was to come into force forthwith.  When there was the change of Government, we varied that Order.  We tried to get as much as possible, first of all, from the officials within the Department who, as indicated in the course of the discussion by my predecessor, Deputy Fahey, are very capable men, men dedicated to designing the best policies possible for our fisheries.  We had, first of all, the advantage of their advice and help and the advice and help also of the Commission and other fishery bodies.  There was as well my own personal knowledge and the knowledge of some of my colleagues who made representation on this question.  In that short period also I had the benefit of meeting a number of Deputies from different parts of the country.</P>
    <P>Having got together and assembled all that information and analysed it in a relatively short time I came up with this Order of 1973.  Deputy Gallagher said that Deputy Fahey's Order was bad but that the Order <Col N="1353" /> made by the present Government was worse.  I cannot understand that type of statement coming from Deputy Gallagher because I know Deputy Gallagher's views differ from those of Deputy Kenneally.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DenisGallagher" hpid="Mr. Gallagher Mr. Gallagher">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gallagher</NameTxt>
      <P>May I explain?  The new Order does not make any allowance for a new person coming into fishing.  The old Order did.  Under the old Order if a fisherman had been a crew member for a certain period that would entitle him to get a licence, but under the Order made by the Parliamentary Secretary one would have had to have held the licence in the years previous to 1973.  That is why I say it is worse.  It prevents people who are crew members already from coming in.</P>

      <P>Deputy Gallagher was much more liberal so far as drift net licence applications are concerned than were Deputies Kenneally or Fahey.  As Deputy Gallagher is no doubt aware the number of licences that would be issued in 1973 if the Order of 1972 continued in operation would be in the region of 700.</P>

      <P>The Chair has taken a very lenient view here today, Deputy Daly.  He has allowed a very wide ranging discussion on this short Bill.  It is not for me to comment on the Chair's ruling, the Chair is the sole authority in the House, but I agree with the ruling because unfortunately the Government, because of a shortage of time, had to pass without discussion, with the agreement of this House, certain Estimates, including the Estimate for Fisheries, with the stipulation, of course, that a discussion would arise within a short period.  It is only right that this major industry should come up for discussion here annually and that where an Estimate has to be passed by a certain date there should be a Token Estimate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1354" /> Under the Order made by the previous Government one of the main requirements was that one should be the holder of a licence for three of the past five years, that is from 1968 to 1972, inclusive.  Unless one held a licence in three of those five years one would not qualify.  As Deputy Molloy said, several people in County Galway did not measure up to that requirement because they had not started salmon fishing even during that period.  Under the Order which was made by the present Government, a licence was granted to any person who held a licence in any one of those five years and who could satisfy the board, and in the case of County Cork could satisfy the administrator, that he or she derived his or her livelihood mainly from salmon fishing. Deputy Gallagher referred to the regulations relating to the eligibility of crewmen.  This still stands but unfortunately it cannot be applied to any great extent because the number had to be limited and this year's Order limited the number of licences that could be granted by boards to the number granted last year.  The number cannot exceed the number granted in 1972.  That seemed to be necessary having regard to all the advice available to me.</P>
    <P>The question of conservation is a big one and I am mindful of the fact that it is a big one but I do not like to deprive any person, particularly any traditional fisherman, of the opportunity of earning his livelihood and continuing to earn it.  Deputy Kenneally said that as soon as the Government changed the floodgates opened for issuing salmon licences. I wrote down what he said.</P>

      <P>The Aran Islands were well represented.  The spokesmen from the islands, without reflecting on the other contributors to the debate, excelled themselves.  The island view was not lost sight of at that meeting.  I am sure Deputy Gallagher would agree with me in that assertion.  He possibly claims to be an island man and he could make a good case for them.</P>
      <P>This is the position as far as Orders are concerned.  We are for the time being making an Order covering only one season.  Because of possible fluctuations or variations in our reports or in the figures that are made available of our stocks and other considerations it is something you cannot legislate for a period of years. Some people may not like the present system because they say: &ldquo;We cannot buy gear; we cannot buy boats; we cannot lay out money in the purchase of gear because next year a change may come about and we would not qualify for a licence at all&rdquo;.  I appreciate such views and I know there are good grounds for them.  No matter who might be in my place he would most likely act in a similar way.  We can only draw up Orders covering one season.  The advantages of so doing outweight the disadvantages, and I am well aware of the disadvantages.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is no doubt that many deserving applicants from different parts of the country, from the islands and from the mainland, were rejected by <Col N="1356" /> the boards of conservators and in the case of Cork by the administrator.  I do not blame the boards of conservators because their regulations were laid down and they had to comply with the terms of the Orders made. The Orders limit the number of licences which can be issued.  I have no doubt that many applicants, such as those mentioned by Deputy Molloy, especially those from islands, and fishermen engaged in other types of fishing all their lives who are now moving over to salmon fishing, were refused licences.</P>
    <P>I believe every fisherman should, as far as possible, be entitled legally to fish for whatever kind of fish is most remunerative to him.  People have to change from plaice to salmon, shellfish and other types of fish.  Fishermen have to get money and many of them get it the hard way but we must have a ceiling.  We must take note of the people on the other side of the fence, those crying out about conservation, that our salmon stocks are disappearing, that the drift netters have ruined the inland fisheries and that our tourist trade will suffer immeasurably. We hear a lot of talk about one salmon caught in a river by a person who comes here on a holiday being worth £100 to the nation.</P>
    <P>Every person is entitled to express a view, but I do not hold with that type of view.  My first consideration, when I was put in charge of the Fishery Department, was to try and bring about an easement of the regulation which existed, to try and help as many people as possible who depended on salmon fishing for their livelihood.  Before I came into office the regulations specifically referred to &ldquo;salmon fishing&rdquo;.  I removed the word &ldquo;salmon&rdquo; from the regulation. Fishermen fish for any type of fish that is available.</P>
    <P>I must express my appreciation and the appreciation of the Department to the many deputations we met and to Members of this House who discussed the position with us, for their approach to this problem.  All such deputations were constructive.  Many people who held liberal views accepted that limitations had to be imposed. <Col N="1357" /> If we left the question open that all crewmen would get licences, that all those termed fishermen all over the country from Donegal to Cape Clear could get licences we estimated that the number of such applications which could be deemed fair and reasonable would be in the neighboarhood of 5,000.  I would like to be able to grant licences to such people, but the cake is not big enough.  We have not enough licences to go round, and the national aspect demands that we cut down the number of licences.  Unfortunately, the pessimistic nature of reports which we receive far outweighs the optimistic nature of those which are favourable, but we have to weigh one with the other.  We have to weigh all the advice of the scientific people in our Department and the advice we receive from other people.</P>
    <P>I do not think it is necessary to delay the House further on the question of the salmon licences, which came into the debate in a very big way, other than to say that there will be a further review for next year and care will be taken to ensure that the Order drawn up for 1975 will be as easy as possible on our genuine fishermen, those who depend on the Atlantic Ocean for their livelihood and who come from stock who were dependant on it down through the years. If there was any possible way I could say to Deputy Crowley or Deputy Molloy that island people should get preferential treatment I would be very much inclined to do so.  I went into this question fully.  There is no secret about it with the Department or with the other relevant parties.  I got legal advice and, unfortunately, found I could not draw an Order&mdash;&mdash;</P>

Deputy Gallagher mentioned that Achill was an island although we were told at school that an island is a piece of land entirely surrounded by water.

      <P>I am grateful to the Chair for an opportunity of answering the questions raised particularly so far as the control of salmon orders, the development of our salmon fishing industry and the need for conservation are concerned.  The point was made by a Deputy that we did not have an opportunity in recent times of discussing fisheries, but this opportunity was availed of, to some extent, to cover a wider range than would normally be the case had the Fisheries Estimate been introduced.</P>

      <P>The only statement I read in the papers that was supposed to have been made in Waterford during that critical period around 20th to 23rd February in the year of grace 1973, was one made by the former Taoiseach.  The former Taoiseach told the fishermen of Ring, and this was boxed in all of our newspapers, that there was a great deal of discrimination in his Government's handling of the issuing of licences. He said he would see to it that a change would be brought about. There was nothing in any official document that there was any brief issued to the then Taoiseach advising him that discrimination existed.  In my view Deputy Kenneally's references to election statements can be taken with a pinch of salt.  I am doubtful if it is fair to the House to take up time referring to such matters.  So far as this Government are concerned they approached this question without any fetters at all. There was a free hand to devise, draw up and formulate the policy that would be beneficial to our people, particularly our fishermen, and also beneficial to our nation.</P>
      <P>We have also the inland fisheries. Reference was made to the desirability of facilitating anglers, the elimination of pollution and the need for a better system of protection for our rivers.  I agree that all such suggestions are deserving of attention.  It is the aim of the Department to facilitate anglers, our own and those visiting from other countries.  We appreciate that in an island country such as ours we must be particularly mindful of our fisheries, sea fishery or inland fishery.  We must be mindful of our lakes and rivers and ensure as far as possible that our stocks will be developed, that the lakes and rivers will be fished in an orderly fashion and that illegal fishing will be eliminated.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1360" /> Any Department, or any State board, cannot countenance illegal fishing.  The laws are laid down by the Government of the day and until they are changed by a future Government there is an obligation on our people to honour them.  We are making our own laws now and if people are in conflict with the law of the land as laid down by this House and enforced by our enforcement staff&mdash; in the case of fisheries by our water-keepers and in other cases by the gardaí&mdash;then they deserve to be punished.  There is no use in saying otherwise.  So far as fisheries are concerned we must be mindful of the harm that can be done by illegal fishing and we must endeavour to ensure that it is eliminated to the greatest degree possible.</P>
    <P>Mention was made of our private fisheries and the desirability of making some changes.  I am in agreement with those sentiments and I am hopeful that some commission, maybe the present commission, will help us, by their advice, in changing the system.  In my view our public fisheries, our rivers and lakes, as far as possible, should be available to our people and to our guests and visitors to be fished in an orderly fashion in accordance with the laws and regulations laid down by the State.  I know that initially many of our fisheries got into the hands of people who should not hold them.</P>
    <P>Our history books tell us that many of our fisheries were handed over some 300 years ago in the reign of King Charles and the reign of King James.  There is no need for me to comment on the justification for handing over our fisheries, or on some person outside this country handing over our fisheries under the laws that existed at that time.  They were handed over and this was given legal enforcement by virtue of the then existing laws.</P>
    <P>Many such fisheries have since changed hands.  They were saleable the same as a piece of land, or a house, or a business.  The descendants of the families who got these fisheries 300 years ago from the then rulers of this country are no longer here <Col N="1361" /> and, if they were, I would not want to reflect on them.  No Member of this House would like to do so.  We just have to make this reference in order to get to the roots of this big question.  Deputy Molloy and Deputy White referred to phasing out such fishery rights and taking them into our own possession, and giving reasonable compensation to the owners. There is no question of confiscation or of catching some person by the throat and saying: &ldquo;Out you go. We intend to pass a law here.&rdquo;  I know this Government will not do that, and I am sure no alternative Government would do it.</P>
    <P>We should address ourselves to this question on both sides of the House.  To my mind, it is not a political question as to whether the Government should bring in a phasing out measure and be told to scrap it because it did not fulfil the requirements of the Opposition for the time being.  If at all possible, I should like to make a start on this work, to give an earnest of our good faith, and to show that we believe that the fisheries of Ireland which are in private hands should be purchased&mdash;that is a nice term&mdash;at a reasonable price and should come back to the ownership of the Irish people.  Perhaps a committee could be set up with that aim in view.</P>
    <P>This will take a very long time. Possibly many of us will have left the scene before it is completed.  Without a start there is no end.  I have expressed this view here down through the years and, now that I am in my present position, I should like to express it in more forceful terms.  It will take a great deal of time, perhaps years and years.  You could not possibly hazard a guess as to the number of years it will take.  I agree with the idea of making a start and phasing out private fisheries.  I agree with the term used by Deputy Molloy.  We should take over this river today if we can, that lake next year, and that stretch in some following year, and we should devise some fair system of paying compensation.</P>
    <P>In expressing that view I have no <Col N="1362" /> hesitation in making this addendum. I find that many of our people have a marked disrespect for our fishery laws because of the existence of these private fisheries in their districts.  They have a feeling, rightly or wrongly, that such should not be the case.  I am positive&mdash;and I have held this view firmly down through the years&mdash;that, if our fisheries were owned by Ireland and her people, there would be much more respect for our fishery laws in some areas where poaching is, to use a mild term, rampant at present.</P>
    <P>I want to make my own position clear on fisheries.  I should like to see a start being made, if at all possible, in my term of office, no matter how small that start might be.  If you like, this is only a viewpoint but this question will have to be dealt with and I hope the Government will do so. Money will have to be found to offer as compensation.  It is no harm for Deputies who hold certain views on this question to express them here.  There was nothing out of place, nothing unfair, nothing unjustified in the remarks made in this House this evening on this subject.  The system will have to be based on fair and reasonable compensation being paid.  I am not offering an opinion as to how the compensation will be assessed, but I have no doubt that a system can be devised.  Many of the people concerned would be only too willing to co-operate.  The State would be in a better position to develop such fisheries and to ensure that the fishing would be carried out in a reasonable and rational way and in accordance with the regulations governing fisheries.</P>

      <P>All citizens will have the same rights, irrespective of class, creed or vocation.  There will be no such thing as privileged or under-privileged.</P>
      <P>Pollution was mentioned by some Deputies.  This is a very important question.  Every other day we read in the papers about pollution.  It was mentioned in the Dáil today and I am sure it will be mentioned next week. It is a very big question.  Possibly the present agencies for dealing with it are not adequate or the present system is not reasonable.  There should be some central agency dealing with pollution.  The previous Government said that the Department of Local Government would do this job effectively.  One Deputy making a contribution here this evening said that the Department of Local Government were the biggest offenders.  What do they say: How can you turn a poacher into a gamekeeper?</P>
      <P>We need some regionalisation.  Perhaps we could get a committee of a county council working with a central agency here in Dublin.  I am particularly aware of pollution because it strikes nowhere harder than it strikes the fisheries industry.  Undoubtedly pollution is a dangerous enemy of ours and there is an obligation on us to try to provide ways and means of meeting that enemy and eliminating it if at all possible.  I am mindful of the fact that planning authorities are taking serious and justifiable cognisance of this question and that planning applications are closely scrutinised to ensure as far as possible that our rivers and lakes will not be polluted unnecessarily.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If there are some items that have been mentioned in connection with this measure that I have not referred <Col N="1364" /> to, we shall have an opportunity of reading them in the Official Report.  I am grateful to the Deputies who contributed to this debate.  By and large, their contributions were reasonable and constructive.  I know that all Deputies who contributed to this debate were endeavouring to advance views which in their opinion are sound and reasonable.  Of course, there is great variation in the views expressed.  There are inland Deputies and seaside Deputies.  We have to take cognisance of all the views expressed. People do not like the term &ldquo;compromise&rdquo; but in drawing up orders you have to compromise between the two extremes.</P>
    <P>I am asking the House to accept the provision in this Bill which gives the Minister power to extend it further should the occasion arise.  It is only being put in as a safeguard and&mdash;I want to say this deliberately so that my words will be recorded&mdash;it is most unlikely that it will be necessary to invoke it.  However, supposing we overstepped the period by a fortnight or a month, we would not want to trouble the House again by bringing in legislation. It is the normal procedure when introducing this type of legislation to put such a subsection into the Bill.  As I say, it is most unlikely that we shall have to avail of the provision unless a delay occurs which cannot be foreseen at present.</P>

      <P>May I ask the Parliamentary Secretary what is the position of a widow of a holder of a fisherman's licence whose livelihood was fishing?</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelPatMurphy" hpid="Mr. M.P. Murphy Mr. M.P. Murphy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M.P. Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>That is covered. If the holder of a drift net licence dies his widow can apply to the board for transfer of that licence.  I cannot direct the board&mdash;the 1959 Act precludes me from doing so&mdash;to grant such a widow a licence.  The board has the sole responsibility for doing so, and if they are satisfied that the application is well founded, that the widow is capable of using the licence or can get some help to fish, if fishing was the livelihood of the family, I have no doubt that in such cases the board would grant a licence.  In any case they are empowered to do so, and it is for <Col N="1365" /> the board to determine each individual case on its merits.</P>

      <P>2.  &mdash;(1)  Notwithstanding anything contained in the Fisheries Acts, 1959 to 1964, the following provisions shall have effect:</P>
      <P>(a)  the elections of conservators pursuant to sections 22 and 27 of the Principal Act which, apart from this section, would fall to be held in the year 1974 shall be held instead either in the year 1975 or in such later year as the Minister, if he thinks fit, by order fixes.</P>
      <P>The objective of this section is to postpone the elections for one year, thus prolonging the period in office of the elected conservators.  As I said earlier, the extension beyond 1975 is a safeguard in case any delays should arise in regard to the comprehensive revision of the constitution of the boards of conservators following the reports which are to be received.

      <NameTxt>Mr. M.P. Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>It relates only to elected members.  I am assuming that the other members under existing legislation are <i>ex officio</i> members.  If the board continues, then by virtue of being <i>ex officio</i> members, in accordance with our laws, their membership must continue.  They need not be singled out in a subsection here because as the law stands at present a member is <i>ex officio</i> because he measures up to certain qualifications which entitle him to be an <i>ex officio</i> member of a board.  So, it is not necessary, once the lifetime of the board is extended, to make a stipulation here covering the <i>ex officio</i> members.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Mr. Molloy Mr. Molloy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>How does the Parliamentary Secretary arrive at that conclusion? To preface one's remarks with the word &ldquo;assume&rdquo; does not seem to be a very satisfactory way to deal with it on a Committee Stage.  The 1959 Act lays down the statutory period of five years as the life of a board.  Some members are elected, some are nominated and some are members <i>ex officio</i>.  The Parliamentary Secretary has brought before the House a Bill <Col N="1369" /> only to postpone the elections.  One could interpret that as meaning that those members of boards who have been elected would have their membership extended for a further year beyond the fifth year but no reference has been made to the membership of those persons who are appointed for a five-year statutory period only.  The statutory period is extended by this Bill for a further year or subsequent years.  The reference is only to those members who are elected.</P>

      <P>In any case, my view is that nominated members can vary from time to time but if <i>ex officio</i> members cease to qualify, automatically they are disqualified from membership.  Once an elected member secures election, like Deputies he continues until the next election, but an <i>ex officio</i> member can continue for as long as he is qualified.  If by some remarkable coincidence all of the 88 <i>ex officio</i> members became disqualified next month by virtue of losing the rights which qualified them in the first instance they would cease membership.  I do not know how there could be a subsection in a Bill like this to continue a group of people as members of a board who may be disqualified in the course of the period of office.  At any rate, that is my interpretation.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Kenneally</NameTxt>
      <P>We appear to be on the wrong wavelength on this matter. We are not disputing the question of elected members who are covered by section 2 of the Bill.  We are talking about <i>ex officio</i> and nominated members.  My reading of the matter is <Col N="1371" /> that section 34 of the 1959 Act covers <i>ex officio</i> members.  Such a person is a member of the board for a statutory period of five years.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamKenneally" hpid="Mr. Kenneally Mr. Kenneally">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kenneally</NameTxt>
      <P>Provided he is nominated and that his valuation is more than £50, he is a nominated member for the statutory period of the life of that board of conservators &mdash;namely, five years.  The five years expire in October, 1974, and by this Bill we are extending the life of the boards for a further year.  I do not think <i>ex officio</i> members are covered.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M.P. Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>As I have explained already that an <i>ex officio</i> member retains membership only for as long as he is qualified.  Once he loses qualification he loses membership. Under the system that operates at the moment, if we had the kind of election that was held for fishery elections, <i>ex officio</i> members would continue on the next board.  It is by their personal qualification they retain membership.  They need not be mentioned in this section.  If an<i>ex officio</i> member disposes of his fishery, he disposes also of his membership of the board.</P>

      <P>I should like to be clear on this point.  May I take it that <Col N="1372" /><i>ex officio</i> members are entitled to membership of the boards of conservators continuously so long as they qualify to be <i>ex officio</i> members, irrespective of how many election years may occur?  Does their membership stand for as long as they have ownership of fisheries with valuations in excess of £50?  The Bill as presented deals with the election of certain conservators.  The Parliamentary Secretary has only himself to blame for our asking these questions. In section 2 there is the heading: &ldquo;Elections of certain conservators postponed.&rdquo;  Why is a distinction being made in this case of &ldquo;certain&rdquo; conservators?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelPatMurphy" hpid="Mr. M.P. Murphy Mr. M.P. Murphy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M.P. Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>Because the <i>ex officio</i> members by virtue of their ownership do not need election.  Their continuance in office depends on their holding certain qualifications and once they lose those they are out.  Had I put in a section stating that 88 <i>ex officio</i> members should continue as well as the elected members, it would not be correct from the legal point of view and it would not be approved by the parliamentary draftsman.  Had I done this I would be saying the 88 members should be continued in office even though some of them may lose their qualifications in the next or subsequent months.  That kind of system&mdash;it is one I do not like&mdash;prevailed, whereby such a person could be on the board with the same voting rights as an elected member.  However I am going to change that now and the question will not arise again. I can tell the House that whatever boards exist or whatever system applies, it will not contain any stipulation that because a person has fishing property with a certain valuation he may become an <i>ex officio</i> member.</P>

      <P>That may be, but the Parliamentary Secretary has not managed to quote any section of the <Col N="1373" /> 1959 Act, or any other Act controlling the operation of boards of conservators, to justify his statement. The provision here is for an extension of a 12-month period for elected members. He is telling us that we can assume that <i>ex officio</i> members have a right to continue to sit on the boards for this extra year even though the Bill as it stands does not make any reference to them.  His explanation for the <i>ex officio</i> members cannot be deemed to apply to members of boards of conservators who are nominated members.  If the board of the ESB&mdash;who have certain rights under section 36 to nominate people &mdash;appoint Mr. X for a five-year period which will end next October, there is no reference in the Parliamentary Secretary's Bill showing that the membership of such a person will continue for a further 12-month period.  It is not good enough to say that we can assume that his membership continues.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One would expect that a Bill should deal in a comprehensive way with the matter entailed in it.  This Bill deals only with the elected members.  It makes no reference to the position of the <i>ex officio</i> or nominated members. One of the important jobs that falls to be done by nominated members is the allocation of drift net licences, which has given the members of these boards a special status in recent years because of the Parliamentary Secretary's Order.  Membership of these boards can become a very cherished position and one of great influence in a locality or community. Therefore the right to sit and vote on these matters will be a matter that could be challenged in the future. Because of the consequences of decisions of boards of conservators a man could lose his whole livelihood or could have presented to him an opportunity to make a livelihood from drift net fishing of salmon if he obtained a licence from the board. There is greater importance now in making sure that whatever legislation governs their operations is watertight; that the fellow sitting there in November is entitled to be there and that it is clearly seen in the fisheries legislation that he is entitled to be there <Col N="1374" /> and not just because Deputy Michael Pat Murphy told us when the Bill was going through the Dáil that he assumed that they had an entitlement, even though he made no reference to them in his Bill.</P>
    <P>We know that Bills have been deemed to be unconstitutional and have been thrown out before.  Possibly I am exaggerating now, but a situation could arise where somebody could decide to challenge a decision if he lost by one vote.  If he took it to court the first thing the judge would ask would be to see the Bill and, having examined that, he would see immediately that there was no reference in it to the nominated or <i>ex officio</i> members.  It would have been a very simple thing to have included a subsection in section 2 stating quite clearly the entitlement of <i>ex officio</i> and nominated members to continue as proper, full members of boards of conservators for this extended 12-month period which the Parliamentary Secretary is giving to the elected members.</P>

      <P>If there are members nominated by, say, the ESB, does the fact that there is no provision for this in the Bill mean that at any time the ESB can nominate new members? In other words, what the Parliamentary Secretary is doing is extending elected membership but can there be changes in nominated membership? There will be no changes in elected members but can there be changes by some people like the ESB who will nominate new members before the period of expiry of this Bill?</P>

      <P>The ESB are empowered, in accordance with the previous legislation, to nominate members.  That right will continue so long as the present board continues. That is quite definite.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Going back again to the question of <i>ex officio</i> members, the difference between an <i>ex officio</i> member and an elected member is that, obviously one is there by a system of election and the other because he is qualified&mdash;he holds a certain qualification which gives him the right to <i>ex officio</i> membership. If he loses that qualification, <Col N="1375" /> he loses his right to membership.  The boards are made up of elected members; <i>ex officio</i> members and the ESB have special rights to nominate members.  The make-up of the fisheries boards is laid down in section 21 of the Act.  As I have said already, we would have no right to say in this subsection that we proposed to continue the 88 <i>ex officio</i> members for the lifetime of the board because, as I have mentioned again and again, possibly next month or in subsequent months some of the <i>ex officio</i> members will lose their right to membership by virtue of a change in their position or circumstances, such as the sale of the fisheries which entitles them to <i>ex officio</i> membership of a particular board.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LiamCunningham" hpid="Mr. Cunningham Mr. Cunningham">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cunningham</NameTxt>
      <P>That does not answer my question.  The Parliamentary Secretary thinks that he is prolonging the life of boards plus their membership.  My net question was: supposing the ESB decide in two months' time to nominate a brand new team of nominated members, is there any provision for that in the Bill?  In other words, they can change the personnel of the boards despite the fact that the Parliamentary Secretary is making provision for no change.</P>

      <P>The point we are making is that the statutory position of nominated persons seems to cover them for the statutory five-year period as laid down.  We are not referring to the actual individual who is nominated; we are referring to the right of the nominating body to have a nominated person act as a member of a board of conservators.  It is quite clear that they have this right to nominate any person they like for the five-year period.  We do not mind if they have changed the individual five times in the five-year period.  It is quite clear that they have the right to have a nominated person there for the five years. What we are saying is not clear is that this right continues into the extension year, the sixth year&mdash;the year the Parliamentary Secretary is seeking in the Bill&mdash;because the Parliamentary Secretary's Bill makes reference to the elected members only.  It makes no reference to the right of the nominating bodies for the extra year.  The only point we are making is that we cannot see&mdash;and we are asking the Parliamentary Secretary to show us&mdash;where it states that the nominated bodies have the right to representation on the <Col N="1377" /> board of conservators whose life is extended beyond the five years.  We also question the fact that there is no reference to the position of <i>ex officio</i> members.  Where is it stated?</P>

They are given that power by this House.  They do not have to participate, and neither do the <i>ex officio</i> members, in the election.  Under Section 34 of that Act they have a right to be members of the Board as soon as the election is over.  These are rights.  We are trying to do away with this system particularly in relation to <i>ex officio</i> members.  The <i>ex officio</i> members does not have to go for election.  He continues to be a member of the board and in the case of the ESB they continue to have the right of nomination to the board.  This is the position so long as the present system obtains.

      <P>For elected members.  <i>Ex officio</i> members continue to be entitled to sit on the board as long as the system continues.  The board ceases after five years and the <i>ex officio</i> members are back again on the next board.  They are in a somewhat similar position to the Ceann Comhairle of this House, deemed to be elected to the ensuing board.  The names of nominated members are submitted again by the appropriate authority, the ESB, and we accept them and the Limerick board accept them.  That has been the procedure.  If they want to change their nominee they are entitled to state who will represent them for the forthcoming period.  That is their entitlement.  That is what has been happening since 1959.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Mr. Molloy Mr. Molloy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>The only reference to the life of a board is the five-year <Col N="1380" /> statutory period.  The 1959 Act lays down how certain persons shall be elected for that period, how certain persons shall be nominated, how certain persons shall be <i>ex officio</i> members. The 1959 Act makes no reference to any period shorter or longer than five years.  It does not state that if an amending Bill is brought in continuing the elected members as members for longer than five years that the nominated and <i>ex officio</i> members shall be entitled also to act on the board for that period.  Their entitlement to act on the board, I say, is for the statutory period of five years. The Parliamentary Secretary is now introducing a new period of one year and he is making no reference to their entitlement to be members.  He is not saying that the on-going entitlement of <i>ex officio</i> and nominated members, laid down in the 1959 Act, also applies for the period of extension granted under this Bill.</P>
      <P>The Parliamentary Secretary's argument is based on many assumptions. He is basing it on the assumption that because it is <i>ex officio</i> it is on-going and does not refer to any specific period and that the specific period only relates to those elected for that period.  He has not convinced me that that is so.  I do not want to repeat myself but the only period in the main Act is a five-year period. People are elected to it for five years; they are nominated to it for five years; they are <i>ex officio</i> for five years.  There is no place in the new Bill or in the main Act where their entitlement extends beyond the statutory five-year period.  The Parliamentary Secretary is introducing a new thing here, a six-year period.  We are quite entitled to question whether or not they are legally covered in continuing as members during that additional year.  This could be the cause of a lot of litigation later on.  Answers should not be based on assumptions. There is no use telling the judge: &ldquo;Michael Pat told us the day this came before the Dáil that he assumed they would be OK.&rdquo;  I do not think that would stand up in the District Court.</P>

      <P>The Principal Act and this Act shall be construed together as one.</P>

      <P>If and so long as the said Board is the owner, lessee, or occupier of two or more such fisheries situate in the same fishery district each of which was, on the 1st day of January, 1931, a several fishery, the following provisions shall apply and have effect, that is to say, whenever on the date on which the fishery rate for any fishery year is struck by the board of conservators for the said fishery district, such fisheries are valued under the Valuation Acts at valuations amounting in the aggregate to not less than fifty pounds, the said Board shall be entitled to nominate one person to be, until the next fishery rate is so struck, an <i>ex officio</i> member, in respect of such fisheries, of the board of conservators of the district in which such fisheries are situate.</P>

      <P>We would be prepared to accept it from the Parliamentary Secretary if he would state chapter and verse rather than telling us his answer is based on an assumption.  We expect him to fulfil his obligations here as the person responsible for trying to get this legislation through the House by giving reasonable explanations and quoting his source for interpretations which he places on the Bill. The membership of a board of conservators has become a very important position in the communities where they exist.  The powers of the members, as already stated, can affect the <Col N="1383" /> livelihood of a lot of people when they come to decide who shall and who shall not get a drift net licence.  The composition of the board is a matter of very grave importance.  If we are interfering with the structure of the board through legislation we would like some guarantees, which can be verified, that what the Parliamentary Secretary is doing is adequate to meet the situation.</P>
      <P>We accept that any person who is entitled to membership of a board through election shall continue as a member for another 12 months.  We assume it will be for a period of 12 months because this Bill authorises the Parliamentary Secretary to make an order.  Section 2 (2) states:</P>
      <P>When an order under this section is proposed to be made, the Minister shall cause a draft of the order to be laid before each House of the Oireachtas and the order shall not be made until a resolution approving of the draft has been passed by each such House.</P>
      <P>In fact it is clear that the Parliamentary Secretary is asking for powers not alone to extend the life of a board of conservators by one year but to extend it for any number of years.  It is not a very good thing to leave it so open in that way. The only good thing about it is that it has to be approved by a resolution passed in this House and in the Seanad.  Therefore, it must be debated, but there is no statutory time limit on the timing of that debate.  The Parliamentary Secretary, by making an order under this Bill, can extend the life of a board of conservators by as many years as he wishes.  To use his own words:</P>
      <P>or in such later year as the Minister, if he thinks fit, by order fixes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That is a very wide sweep.  The Parliamentary Secretary could continue them in office for ten years if he so wished.  We understand that the elected members of existing boards of conservators will stay in existence until October this year and that they shall continue as members for a further 12 months if the Parliamentary Secretary decides.  We are not satisfied as to the <Col N="1384" /> position of nominees and <i>ex officio</i> members to act on that board for a period other than the statutory five-year period referred to in the principal Act.  We would like an assurance or reference to some section in the principal Act pointing out to us that the right and the entitlements of <i>ex officio</i> and nominated members shall continue for the period mentioned in the Minister's order.</P>
    <P>We have no authority which we can refer to to discover their entitlements in a period which shall be referred to in an Order.  There is no reference in the 1959 Act.  The only reference to an Order is in this Bill.  We are questioning the position of nominated members and the <i>ex officio</i> members to act on the boards of conservators in a period which shall be determined by an Order under this Bill if it becomes an Act.  We claim that there is a serious omission in the Bill, that it is a defective Bill because it leaves the authority of nominated and <i>ex officio</i> members to act on boards of conservators in serious doubt.  We fully realise the important position a conservator now holds and the important decisions which he will be involved in.  We want an absolute assurance and guarantee that nominated and <i>ex officio</i> members acting on boards of conservators in the period mentioned in the Minister's Order have the right to act in that period and that their right cannot be challenged by anybody.</P>
    <P>The simplest way out of this position is to include another subsection in section 2 which would adequately cover the rights of such persons to continue to act during the life of the board in the period determined by an order which shall be made under this Bill.  This is a very serious matter, and we appeal to the Parliamentary Secretary to give us an indication that he will consider our proposal or that he will agree to include such a subsection to clear away the doubt.  We have highlighted a great weakness in this piece of legislation.</P>

      <P>At first we asked the question about nominated members and we followed this up by inquiring about the position of <i>ex officio</i> members.  We have been told, more or less, that <i>ex officio</i> members are continuing members.  The extension of the life of the boards for elected members is covered in this Bill, but will those nominated members on the occasion of the annual general meeting of the boards be entitled to attend that meeting? That is the only question we want the Parliamentary Secretary to give a specific answer to.  The Parliamentary Secretary has told us that he assumes that they will carry on and that the ESB can nominate the members they wish.  All we seek from the Parliamentary Secretary is the legal authority on which they can do this.</P>

      <P>I expressed my reservations about extending the life of the boards from year to year.  The Parliamentary Secretary said that one of the reasons for postponing the election was because he was awaiting final recommendations from the Inland Fisheries Commission.  He said he was looking at the system of election to the boards to see what improvements can be brought about and what necessary legislation needs to be framed.  If the final recommendations of this commission are not published for five years what will the position be?  There is nothing in the regulations setting up the commission to the effect that they must report within a certain period.  Will this order be used from year to year until such time as the Inland Fisheries Commission decide to bring in their report?</P>

      <P>I wish to draw the attention of the House to the extraordinary situation which has developed. We have been making valid points in discussing this Bill on Committee Stage on which the normal debating procedure is a two-way flow.  We assume that the Parliamentary Secretary is here to give information to the House on the measure he is asking for.  I put it to him that he has prefaced his remarks with the words that he assumes that such and such is the position.  We are asking for clarification of the basis upon which he is making the assumptions. We would only accept such clarification if we could be assured that these assumptions are based on legislation which has already been enacted in this House, or on legislation which he is asking us to enact now in this Bill.</P>
      <P>For the Parliamentary Secretary to get into a huff and to play silent and refuse to offer any further clarification or explanation of the points being questioned here which are worrying us&mdash;we did not expect that type of treatment from him, a rural Deputy.  If he does not know the legal basis for his assumptions let him be man enough to admit that to the House and we will accept it from him, but we would expect that he would withdraw the Bill and bring forward amendments which would give legal standing to the persons in question under any Order made by him.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am greatly surprised that the Parliamentary Secretary has decided to sit there and say nothing and to act dumb.  It is not what we expected from him.  I do not think he is being <Col N="1387" /> true to himself.  He is putting himself slightly out of character because he is not that kind of person.  He may not have much experience of dealing with the Committee Stage of a Bill.  I do not know whether he has.  From the seat he is sitting in now, he probably has not.  This is fair cut and thrust and I would ask the Parliamentary Secretary not to get huffed and think that, if he says an assumption of his is such and such, we must accept it.</P>
    <P>I put it to him that in his long years in the House he has never accepted an explanation couched in such terms.  He would demand from any Minister, or Parliamentary Secretary, coming before the House with legislation, a full explanation and a reference to the legislation upon which his argument was based.  We are disturbed at his attitude.  We are concerned about the effects on the Bill if this point is not cleared up. We suggest a simple solution: a small subsection covering the persons in question and making sure that they also will be included in the life of boards of conservators as extended by an Order under this Bill.  It is unfair of you to expect us to accept an assumption from you which is not based on any facts that you can refer to.</P>

These are exactly the same requests.  There is nothing political in the Bill.  I am surprised that the Parliamentary Secretary should adopt such a dog in the manger attitude. As the Opposition we have an obligation to ensure that the legislation we pass through the House is unambiguous and protects the people who need to be protected.</P>
      <P>The elected representatives are protected in this Bill.  There is no doubt about that.  We are worried about the position of nominated members and <i>ex officio</i> members.

Therefore I do not think these accusations by the Parliamentary Secretary hold water.</P>

      <P>One can only come to the one conclusion, that the Parliamentary Secretary sees the loophole in this Bill.  I know he is not a fool.  I happen to represent the same constituency as he does and he does not take long to twig on to any point.  The only conclusion one can draw from this is that he is deliberately leaving this loophole in the Bill for some reason.  It is bad legislation to leave a loophole in any Bill, and he is doing a disservice to the Department or indeed to the people we represent by condoning that type of activity. We will continue to pursue it here in this House until such time as the Parliamentary Secretary sees our point of view or acknowledges that we may have a point of view and a very valid one at that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The accusation that we are filibustering is a ridiculous one.  What is to be gained politically from filibustering on a Bill such as this, which is only a technical Bill really.  I know the Parliamentary Secretary has probably been under a great deal of pressure in relation to the Department, but that is no excuse for wanting to buzz out of this House as quickly as he can and leave behind him a Bill <Col N="1392" /> that is incomplete.  That is wrong, and we would be erring very seriously if we allowed it to happen.</P>
    <P>It is extraordinary for the Parliamentary Secretary to expect us to take a vague generality of a statement like &ldquo;I assume&rdquo; as being gospel and that therefore everything is all right. If at a later stage we are found to be right in this, the Parliamentary Secretary can always say: &ldquo;I only said &lsquo;I assume&rsquo;.  I did not say it was so&rdquo;.  We are asking him to say it is so, and that is not an unreasonable request to make.  It is time we were finished with this tomfoolery by the Parliamentary Secretary and that he treated the House with the respect it deserves.  All he has to do is to tell us that if there is a loophole he will introduce a subsection to close it.</P>

I have never before experienced such treatment where a Minister or Parliamentary Secretary was asked a question on Committee Stage, a legitimate question which I do not need to repeat because the Parliamentary Secretary knows the question we are asking.  He states that he assumes these people would be entitled to continue as members of boards of conservators for the period mentioned in an order to be made under this Bill.  We are protesting at his refusal to give any explanation as to the grounds upon which he is making this assumption.  We are amazed that we have got stuck on this section in a three-section Bill.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes.  I put it to you, a Cheann Comhairle, how can we be expected to accept an explanation based on an assumption?</P>
      <P>During the debate on the Second Stage I made my position quite clear as to my feelings, in the main, about persons who are members of boards of conservators by reason of the valuation of the fisheries which they own.  The House is aware that under a section of the 1959 Act persons owning fisheries of £50 valuation and over are entitled <i>ex officio</i> to be members of boards of conservators. I hold no brief for those people and it would suit me and my point of view if it could be shown that if this Bill passes as it stands such persons had no entitlement to remain as members of boards of conservators for the period to be mentioned in an order to be made under this Bill when it becomes an Act.  I would shed no tears if it could be shown that they had no right to continue as members for this new period.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We are making a legitimate point. We are greatly disappointed at the attitude displayed here.  The nominees <Col N="1394" /> are not mentioned in the Bill.  The <i>ex officio</i> members are not mentioned in the Bill.  Yet the Bill allows the Minister to make an order.  The third parties who make up the boards of conservators, the elected members, are mentioned in the Bill and the order will affect them.  No reference is made to the position of the other two groups who with the elected members will make up the boards of conservators after October, 1974.</P>
    <P>If the Parliamentary Secretary is not anxious to repeat what he said I would suggest to him that he has a very easy way out.  If he would give us an assurance that such persons' entitlement to continue as members of boards is a legal entitlement and that it is not based on any assumption that he is making, we will accept it and move on to section 3.  We will do that if he will give us that assurance and not preface his remarks with the phrase that he is assuming that they are entitled to be members.</P>
    <P>The Principal Act refers to periods of time in which the boards of conservators shall be in existence and shall carry out their functions under the Act.  The Principal Act contains no provisions referring to an order to be made by a Minister or Parliamentary Secretary.  We feel that we have highlighted a major defect in the Bill.  We feel it incumbent upon us to highlight that fact here.  We would be failing in our duty and responsibility as Parliamentarians were we meekly to accept and allow this Bill to continue, believing as we do that there is a loophole in the Bill, believing as we do that two categories of persons who form membership of boards of conservators have been omitted from the Bill.</P>
    <P>A Cheann Comhairle, we are suggesting that the Parliamentary Secretary should consider including a new subsection providing for continued membership by these two categories during the period mentioned in the order which he can make if this Bill is passed.  It is the most reasonable request.  I am trying to put it in the simplest possible terms, in the clearest possible way and in as few words as I can.  I would ask the Parliamentary <Col N="1395" /> Secretary now either to agree to the inclusion of a new subsection making provision for such people or else to tell us categorically with the full authority of his position as Parliamentary Secretary acting here for a Minister with the backing of three officials he has accompanying him in the House&mdash;&mdash;</P>

If he gives us that assurance that they have full legal entitlement and if we have his guarantee with the weight of his office and his knowledge supplied and obtained, we will pass on. He should not preface his explanation with the word &ldquo;assume&rdquo;.  We cannot be expected to accept an explanation couched in such terms.  We can finish this subsection and we probably will not spend much time on section 3 and we can finish the Bill and get on to the next business if the Parliamentary Secretary will give us that categorical assurance.</P>

      <P>It is normal practice on the Committee Stage of any Bill to debate each section or subsection line by line, to go through it, accept what we consider is all right, pick out the flaws and try to rectify them.  I am looking for the guidance of the Chair in this matter.  Is there any way open to us of getting information from the Parliamentary Secretary that would make it easier for us to allow this Bill through?</P>
      <P>So far as we can interpret the Bill, there is a flaw in it.  If our reading of it is right, it is a pretty big flaw.  The Chair has served in this House for a considerable number of years and he knows that bad legislation reflects not only on the Parliamentary Secretary or the Minister concerned or on the Government, but also on the entire House.  We have been accused by the Parliamentary Secretary of filibustering.  Why should we filibuster? There is absolutely nothing to be gained by doing that.  Some people have just come into the House and have made humbug speeches.  They have not been here all the time but they accuse Members on this side of the House.  We are conscientiously carrying out our duties but that is the kind of treatment we are getting from the Parliamentary Secretary and the Members behind him who were forced into the House by the quorum bells.</P>
      <P>We are entitled to our point of view.  We are entitled to ask the Parliamentary Secretary for certain categorical statements about the effectiveness of the Bill.  If we do not get them or the assurances we need, we have no alternative but to pursue the matter in the hope that eventually we may get the assurances we are seeking.</P>

However the Parliamentary Secretary is not prepared to do that.  On at least six occasions this evening we have asked him to give us that assurance but without success.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Crowley</NameTxt>
      <P>If the Parliamentary Secretary is prepared to treat us in a proper fashion and to give us the assurances we are seeking, we will not delay him.  We are merely looking for proper legislation.  It makes us highly suspicious when we cannot get a simple categorical statement from the Parliamentary Secretary about the <Col N="1399" /> issues we have raised.  Is he deliberately leaving this loophole for some obscure reason known only to himself? Perhaps it has something to do with the <i>ex officio</i> members he has in mind?  I do not know but, so far as I am concerned, legislation passing through this House and having our <i>imprimatur</i>, must be good legislation. I was asking the advice and protection of the Chair on the matter.</P>
      <P>As the Parliamentary Secretary has made such an issue of this matter, it is vital that we have assurances from somebody that nominated and <i>ex officio</i> members are protected and that they will have the rights to which they are entitled.  I do not think that is an abnormal request.  In fact it is a very ordinary one, but yet the Parliamentary Secretary refuses to give these assurances for some reason best known to him.  We would not be acting in the best interests of those we represent if we did not demand those assurances.  Even at this late stage, if he tells us that the interests of these people are protected, or if they are not protected that he will take steps to remedy the matter, we will be prepared to give him the section.</P>

      <P>In regard to nominated members this Bill does nothing.  When the five years are up&mdash; in November or October&mdash;what happens to a nominated member?  Does he go gaily on for another five years or does his membership of the board cease in October?  Where in the old Act is there provision for him to continue for another year?  What would happen if the Parliamentary Secretary decided to abolish all boards? What happens to a person who is a nominated member?  What section of the 1959 Act would the Parliamentary Secretary have to abolish in the new legislation he says he has in mind&mdash; and the purpose of this Bill is to make way for new legislation.  I do not want to go into associate members but the Parliamentary Secretary made a very interesting statement in respect of associate members.  The gist of what he said&mdash;as I understand it&mdash;is that he will deal with these boys in new legislation.  Has he put the new <Col N="1400" /> legislation before the Cabinet?  Have the Cabinet agreed to new legislation which will deal with those associate members about whom he spoke?  Is he just thinking out loud or have the Government taken some decision prior to the publication of the Report of the Fisheries Commission, the report he is awaiting and which will not be ready?  What authority has he to say that he will take this action in respect of associate members whose fisheries valuations are over £50?  I gather from what he said that he is going to wipe them out.  Have the Government agreed on this?  Have all the parties in the Government agreed on it?  Do they all support this view of the Parliamentary Secretary or is this view his only?  We should like to know.  We are all looking forward to the Report of the Fisheries Commission which the Parliamentary Secretary is awaiting.  But he is able to tell this House&mdash;and has so told this House some half an hour ago&mdash;what his actions are going to be.  We should like to know if all of the Cabinet will agree with him or have they agreed already?  Or is this a piece of wishful thinking on the part of the Parliamentary Secretary?</P>
      <P>Perhaps he would give us some information on those two points: firstly, with what section of the old Act will he have to deal which will terminate the lifetime of a nominated member; in other words, what amendment or deletion will he have to make in the 1959 Act which will terminate the lifetime of a nominated member who will be a member after October? Secondly, what authority had he, as Parliamentary Secretary, to pontificate on the actions which he would take in respect of fishery owners of over £50 valuation?</P>

If he does not want to clarify it for us on this side of the House, as legislators, in the interests of those people who will be nominated to the old board, would he clarify the legal position for them? These are the people of whom he spoke so highly when he said:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1401" /> When I speak of changing the constitution of boards of conservators I want to emphasise and acknowledge the wonderful service that has been given by the members of boards of conservators over the years.  These members have worked on a voluntary basis and have devoted much of their time to solving fishery problems and attending meetings of the boards in the interests of conservation of our fisheries. I think they deserve our gratitude and appreciation.  I am confident that they will rise to the task I am putting to them of giving their services for an extra year beyond the five-year term which would have ended in October, 1974.</P>
    <P>In their interests will he say to us categorically that they are legally entitled to be members of boards of conservators throughout the country for the next 12 months and we will move on and get away from this spoiled child attitude?</P>

      <P>Under the Fisheries (Consolidation) Act, 1959, elections to boards of conservators are due to be held every five years and the next elections are due in October, 1974.</P>
      <P>I have been searching the Consolidation Act of 1959 for the section which lays down the five-year period.  Perhaps the Parliamentary Secretary can help me; the only thing I came across was a reference to the election year and the explanation of that is that the expression &ldquo;the election year&rdquo; means the year 1961 and every third successive year thereafter.  The references in the Act are all to three-year terms, not to five-year terms&mdash;triennial periods.</P>

    <Title>Exchange Control (Continuance) Bill, 1974: Second Stage</Title>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Minister for Finance (Mr. R. Ryan) Richie Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. R. Ryan)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>The only purpose of the Bill is to continue in operation the Exchange Control Act, 1954, for a further period of four years.  That Act is due to expire on 31st December, 1974.</P>
      <P>Historically exchange control originated in the emergency conditions of 1939 when it became necessary for us, in common with other sterling area countries, to help safeguard the foreign exchange reserves of the area to which we had access for our requirements of foreign currencies.  Exchange control was first operated under emergency legislation.  This was replaced in 1954 by the present Exchange Control Act. The Act was expressed to expire four years later.  However it has not proved possible to dispense completely with exchange control and the operation of the Act has therefore been extended at four year intervals ever since.</P>
      <P>The 1954 Act gives power to control:&mdash;</P>
      <P>payments to and on behalf of persons resident outside the scheduled territories&mdash;at present, the State, Northern Ireland, Great Britain, the Channel Islands, the Isle of Man and Gibraltar;</P>
      <P>dealings in gold and foreign exchange;</P>
      <P>dealings in and the export of foreign currency securities and unregistered sterling securities;</P>
      <P>dealings in sterling securities on behalf of persons resident outside the scheduled territories;</P>
      <P>the export of currency notes and the manner of payment for goods exported outside the scheduled territories.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Act empowers the Minister for Finance to specify foreign currencies <Col N="1407" /> which must be sold to a bank so that they may come into the common pool. It further contains power to require the deposit of foreign currency securities and unregistered sterling securities with an authorised depositary, but it has not been found necessary to bring these latter provisions into operation.</P>
    <P>The Act provides for the grant of exemptions by regulations from compliance with requirements of the Act and for the giving of general or limited permissions to carry out transactions.  These provisions are being operated so that foreign exchange is readily available to Irish residents for all <i>bona fide</i> current payments in accordance with our obligations to the IMF.  Such supervision as is applied is designed to ensure that current transactions are not used as a cover for unauthorised capital movements.</P>
    <P>Control of capital transfers continues to be necessary.  Persons wishing to make direct or portfolio investments outside the scheduled territories are not generally permitted to transfer capital for this purpose at the official rate of exchange.  Investment currency may be purchased for the purpose but this usually stands at a substantial premium over the official exchange rate or it may be financed by foreign borrowing.  Sales of foreign currency securities are subject to certain conditions on the disposal of the proceeds of the sale.</P>
    <P>The day-to-day administration of exchange control is in the hands of the Central Bank of Ireland, to which it was delegated in 1965.</P>
    <P>The Treaty of Rome requires member states to abolish progressively restrictions on capital movements between themselves to the extent necessary to ensure the smooth functioning of the Common Market.</P>
    <P>So far two directives have been adopted by the Community requiring the liberalisation of particular categories of capital movements.</P>
    <P>The principal transactions involved are direct investment in business undertakings and the purchase of publicly quoted securities.  During the <Col N="1408" /> negotiations for accession to the Community, we sought and obtained arrangements under which the removal of restrictions on these transactions would be implemented gradually over a transitional period. A substantial relaxation on direct investment was however implemented on entry, under which official exchange is allowed up to a limit of £250,000 per project per year for all new approved direct investments by Irish residents in EEC countries other than the UK.  Applications to transfer larger amounts at the official rate of exchange are considered on their merits.  Relaxations were also made in relation to capital transfers by Irish residents taking up employment in other EEC countries.</P>
    <P>The existing exchange control legislation is adequate to enable us to meet our EEC obligations as they now stand.  This can be done by making suitable amending regulations and giving necessary permissions.</P>
    <P>It is not easy to foresee what developments may occur in coming years in relation to foreign exchange transactions.  There is no immediate prospect however that sterling will become freely convertible on capital account.  It is necessary therefore to retain the 1954 Exchange Control Act in operation.  I ask the House to agree to its extension for a further period of four years and I recommend the Bill for approval on this basis.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>In an ideal world one would not need legislation of this type.  Unfortunately, we are not living in an ideal world and, indeed, in so far as the international monetary scene is concerned, the situation appears to me to be becoming more chaotic by the year, if not by the month.  Approximately two years ago the situation was unsatisfactory but there were a number of moves made to bring about a stabilisation of the international monetary scene.  It seems to me now the situation is considerably worse and that prospects of bringing about stabilisation are even further in the future.  That being so, it is, of course, necessary in our own national interest, to continue in operation legislation of this kind.  I say <Col N="1409" /> in our own national interest because, while it might appear on the face of it that what we are doing is simply protecting the sterling area, we are by so doing protecting our own national interest so long as the Irish £ is related on an exact equivalent basis to the £ sterling.</P>
      <P>As we know that is a situation which heretofore has certainly been to our advantage, weighing up the advantages and disadvantages against each other.  I believe it is still to our advantage to maintain this parity, but it is quite clear that the balance of advantage is reducing and it may well be that we will in the quite foreseeable future reach a stage where the balance will lie rather on the other side and that the disadvantages will outweigh the advantages.  If that time comes for us there will not be any hesitation on our part in breaking the link with sterling.  As long as that link exists legislation of this kind is, of course, necessary.</P>
      <P>The Minister has outlined the manner in which we operate it and I must say it has not come to my knowledge that any people genuinely engaged in business operations, the transfer of their homes or any non-speculative kind of transaction had any difficulty whatever in operating under these regulations.  Therefore I do not think by extending this legislation we are creating any difficulties for the citizens of this country.</P>
      <P>There is only one matter I want to ask the Minister about.  He refers to the two directives adopted by the European Community requiring the liberalisation of particular categories of capital movements.  Later on he says:</P>
      <P>The existing exchange control legislation is adequate to enable us to meet our EEC obligations as they now stand.  This can be done by making suitable amending regulations and giving necessary permissions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The &ldquo;necessary permissions&rdquo; is clear enough but I wonder, in relation to the &ldquo;amending regulations&rdquo;, if the Minister could indicate when it is <Col N="1410" /> expected such regulations will be made, when it is expected it will be necessary to make them.  I do not want any great detail but I should like the Minister to outline the nature of the regulations that will be made in order to enable us to comply fully with the EEC directives.</P>
    <P>That is the only question I wish to ask the Minister.  I subscribe fully to the necessity to extend the existing exchange control regulations.  I repeat they are in the national interest and therefore, as far as I am concerned and we on this side of the House are concerned we place no obstacle at all in the way of the passage of this Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Minister for Finance (Mr. R. Ryan) Richie Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. R. Ryan)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am grateful to Deputy Colley for his reception of this Bill.  He is correct in saying that the international money market is very unstable at the present time.  That is, if anything, an understatement. It is, unfortunately, chaotic. There has been no time since the 1930s that the international monetary scene has been so unstable as it is at present.  I can assure him once again, as I have already assured the House, that if the balance of advantage tips over in favour of our departing from the par link with sterling we will be ready to take a look at the possibility of severing that link; but as long as our trade is weighted so heavily in relation to the United Kingdom it is unlikely we will sever this link.  At the same time people should understand that the link is maintained because it is to our advantage to maintain it.  We are free to break it if we so wish, but it assists trade with our chief trading partner and it also eases investments from abroad in Ireland.  These are two major factors that cannot be lightly thrown aside.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As regards the EEC, since our entry in January, 1973, exchange control measures formerly applying to EEC countries as non-scheduled territories have been relaxed in two ways.  Exchange control permission is still required for direct investment in EEC countries.  The use of official exchange is however allowed for all <Col N="1411" /> new investments, subject to the limit of £250,000 annually for new projects which I have mentioned.  Applications to transfer larger amounts at the official rates are examined on the merits of each application.</P>
    <P>Applications from emigrants to transfer funds in excess of the non-scheduled territory limit of £20,000 are authorised if they are judged to be necessary to ensure the applicant's freedom to take up his employment in the country concerned.  The transfer of funds by reference to this criterion is allowed to residents taking up temporary employment.</P>
    <P>On the question of the kind of regulations which might be necessary the position is that regulations will be necessary to deal with portfolio investment and these would operate from a period of five years after our accession.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Local Government (Mr. Tully)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move:</P>
      <P>That a sum not exceeding £36,970,000 be granted to defray the charge which will come in course of payment during the period commencing on the 1st day of April, 1974 and ending on the 31st day of December, 1974, for the salaries and expenses of the office of the Minister for Local Government, including grants to Local Authorities, grants and other expenses in connection with housing, and miscellaneous schemes and grants including a grant-in-aid.</P>
      <P>The net Estimate of £36,970,000 is in respect of the nine-month period from the 1st April to the 31st December, 1974.  The Estimate corresponds to a 12 month figure of £42,890,000 or £9,566,000 more than the total net Estimate, including supplementaries for 1973-74, and is more than double the net Estimate of £21,246,000 in respect of 1972-73.  The biggest increase over the 1973-74 provision is in respect of subhead E.1.  This is the subhead under which provision is made for the payment of subsidy towards the loss arising on local authority housing.  The subhead shows an increase from £11,401,000 in 1973-74 to £16,415,000 in respect of the 12 months to the 31st March, 1975.  This increase reflects the continued implementation of the Government's policy of relieving local rates by a phased transfer to the Exchequer of the amount levied in rates in 1972-73 to meet the loss on local authority housing, and by absorbing in full the increase in that amount which would otherwise have fallen on local rates.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Another substantial increase is in subhead N&mdash;grant to the Road Fund. <Col N="1413" /> The provision for the nine months is £6,615,000 corresponding to £8,820,000 for 12 months or over £3 million more than the amount provided in 1973-74. The amount provided in the subhead supplements the amount made available from the Road Fund for road grants.</P>
    <P>Other significant increases over 1973-74 on the basis of the 12 month period to the 31st March, 1975, include an extra £907,500 in subhead F, mainly in respect of subsidy towards loan charges on water and sewerage schemes; an extra £276,000 in subhead A for salaries and wages; an extra £160,000 in Subhead G for amenity schemes, and an extra £91,500 in subhead M, miscellaneous services, mainly in respect of itinerant resettlement and library subsidy.</P>
    <P>The Estimate includes provision for maintaining housing grants at a figure equivalent to the high level of £8,000,000 reached last year, and for the continuance of the subsidy to building societies to enable them to keep down interest rates on house mortgages.</P>
    <P>Deputies will be aware that a separate supplementary sum of £1,000,000 was agreed to by the House on the 6th June in respect of the recoupment of expenditure by local authorities on certain malicious injuries in the period up to 31st December, 1974.  When account is taken of the moneys provided from the Local Loans Fund and the Road Fund and of the expenditure financed by local authorities from other sources, the total public expenditure on local government will total approximately £300 million in 1974-75.  The size of this expenditure and the increase of approximately £35 million over the high level reached last year illustrates the importance, and the Government's recognition of the importance, of services such as housing, roads, water supplies and sewerage and the multiplicity of other services with which local government is concerned.</P>
    <P>Deputies will have noted that nearly half of the Vote proposed for my Department is in respect of housing subsidies, payable to local authorities <Col N="1414" /> under subhead E.1.  The estimated requirement of £17,564,000 for the nine months to 31st December next compares with a total expenditure under this subhead of only £5,827,000 in the financial year 1972-73.  There are three reasons for the massive increase in financial assistance for local authorities&mdash;the steady expansion in the Government's programme of social housing and the improved quality of that housing, their decision to transfer, on a phased basis, the net running costs of that service from local authorities to the Exchequer and the introduction last year of a fair system of differential rents for local authority dwellings.</P>
    <P>Ratepayers and tenants are benefiting substantially from these policies. For example, the local rates will meet just over £2.5 million for housing subsidies in the nine-month period ending 31st December next, compared with the rates contribution of almost £7 million in 1972-73.</P>
    <P>The Vote includes a capital provision of £6 million under subhead E.2. to finance housing grants.  This, of course, is only one element in the Government's capital investment in housing.  In the nine months to 31st December, 1974, we will spend more than £60 million capital on housing&mdash; equivalent to £80 million over a full year.  This compares with £46 million allocated under Fianna Fáil's last budget and is needed to deal with the lamentable legacy of bad housing conditions which we inherited from the previous administration.</P>

      <P>One of our main commitments when we took up Government last year was to increase housing output to 25,000 dwellings a year, compared to an average of 15,600 dwellings a year over the previous five years.  I am happy to say that in my first full year in office as Minister for Local Government the number of dwellings completed exceeded the 25,000 target.  In particular, we realised that the local authorities' programme was wholly inadequate and that emergency action was necessary to deal with the situation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A special programme of 10,000 dwellings <Col N="1415" /> over a five-year period has been got under way with the co-operation of the National Building Agency to supplement the maximum output which could otherwise be achieved by housing authorities.  It is my intention to expand local authority housing output to at least 8,000 dwellings a year as soon as possible.  This compares with an average of 4,800 dwellings annually under the last five years of Fianna Fáil Government.  I am glad to record that the interim target of 6,500 houses set for 1973-74 was achieved&mdash;indeed exceeded, because 6,539 dwellings were completed in the year, despite serious difficulties resulting from the energy crisis and shortages of some building materials.</P>
    <P>Our new policies have made an impact on every aspect of the local authorities housing programmes.  To begin 6,539 dwellings were completed in the year to 31st March last, as compared with 5,784 in 1972-73. Dwellings in progress rose from 9,009 at 31st March, 1973, to 10,474 at the end of 1973-74; those at tender rose from 4,348 to 4,738 over the year. Dwellings for which plans were approved or were being prepared totalled 16,101 at the end of last March, an increase of nearly 20 per cent on the 13,472 being planned a year before.  Nearly 62,000 additional sites were in the possession of local authorities or were in process of acquisition last March as against 50,000 when we took office last year.</P>
    <P>The Government's emergency supplementary housing programme&mdash;intended as a practical expression of our determination to treat the housing situation as an emergency&mdash;is well under way, with the considerable achievement by the National Building Agency of having work started, within nine months, on over 1,600 houses, and having plans in preparation for another 3,000 houses.  The quality of construction, accommodation and environmental amenity of local authority housing gave me cause for concern when I took up office last year.  Frankly, I have been appalled by some of the major housing schemes built in recent years.  In fairness to designers I lay most of the <Col N="1416" /> blame on the low-cost mentality of the last Government which permeated every aspect of the local authority housing programme.  It conditioned architects in presenting design proposals, administrators in examining cost implication, contractors in preparing their &ldquo;package deals&rdquo;, and supervising staff in the standard of finish they accepted from contractors.</P>
    <P>It is my policy that public housing should be of a uniformly high standard. Successive Fianna Fáil Cabinets since 1957 &ldquo;penny pinched&rdquo; on the capital allocations for local authority housing.  Tenders for urgent schemes were held up for months, while families languished in bad housing.  The approach to schemes was to save every possible pound so that more dwelling units of a lower standard could be got from the limited capital provided.  We must now face the practical consequences of that policy.  This can best be done by securing the full co-operation of housing authorities and tenants in special programmes of maintenance, and by rectifying, as far as is possible at this stage, structural defects.</P>
    <P>As to future housing, I am looking for bigger houses, with the emphasis on traditional construction and layout. I do not want to interfere with the creative designer, but I insist that designers must have regard to what local authority tenants want.  Central heating is a recent innovation in local authority housing and, in so far as it helps in the fight against air pollution and gives additional comfort to the tenant at reasonable cost, it is to be welcomed.  But, in my opinion, developments have raised serious doubts about its practicality in our conditions, with in particular our temperate climate.  We have the example, in the Cork NBA housing project, of the serious condensation and mould growth which can arise when the effects of inadequate heating are exacerbated by other factors such as poor ventilation and cold bridges.  Increasing costs for the fuels used in central heating discourage tenants from using installations.  In my opinion, we should now review our whole policy about the provision of <Col N="1417" /> central heating.  The general issue of thermal efficiency is being considered at international level and, as an immediate practical step, I have asked for solid fuel fireplaces or appliances in all houses, centrally heated or otherwise, and I may say also that I have indicated my strong preference for enclosed gardens and rear access ways to all terraced houses.</P>
    <P>Another serious problem resulting from lack of foresight in past planning is the need to revitalise central city areas which have gradually become derelict as families have moved from them to the huge housing estates in the suburbs.  Past housing policies have eroded the central city areas to the point where their renewal will be a very costly business.  Nonetheless I intend that steps will be taken to restore the life and community spirit of Central Dublin.  The most urgent task is the restoration of confidence in the remaining residents and the business community in these areas. A major step forward was taken by Dublin City Commissioners when they adopted the central city housing development programme.  This visualises the initial acquisition of 15 sites totalling over 80 acres in the city for housing development.</P>
    <P>Satisfactory progress has been made in the expansion of the local authority housing construction programmes in the Dublin area.  At 31st March last, in the combined programme of the three housing authorities, there were nearly 5,000 houses in progress or at tender, 9,000 at planning stage and over 25,000 additional sites acquired or being acquired.</P>
    <P>Dublin Corporation had work in progress or ready to be started on 1,616 dwellings, and were preparing plans for nearly 5,600 dwellings&mdash; representing an increase at planning stage of 80 per cent compared to the position at 30th September, 1973.  The overall programme of Dublin Corporation at the end of March last comprised 19,403 dwellings compared with 16,868 six months earlier.</P>
    <P>Dublin County Council's programme has shown a welcome upsurge, with 1,761 houses in progress or at tender <Col N="1418" /> at the end of last March compared to 613 houses at 31st March, 1973. I am glad that the National Building Agency, by means of the Government's special emergency supplementary programme, has played a big part in achieving this expansion.  The Agency is providing 1,735 local authority houses, and 384 sites for private housing on behalf of the Dublin County Council.</P>
    <P>The development of Dún Laoghaire Corporation's housing construction programme was inhibited by difficulties in obtaining suitable land.  I am glad to say that this land deficiency has now been made good and Dún Laoghaire Corporation now hold or are in process of acquiring sites which will meet the needs of their construction programme for some years to come.</P>
    <P>Deputies will share with me a special interest in the provision of suitable housing for aged and disabled persons.  I have asked housing authorities to organise a new and vigorous campaign to give a proper housing and follow-up community service to these deprived members of society.  Special working parties should be established to secure co-operation between housing, health and welfare authorities and voluntary organisations.  Progress reports which I have been receiving give ground for much hope in what has been done. Almost half of the county councils have adopted my suggestions or have taken equivalent measures.  I ask those authorities who have not yet reported progress or who have adopted a negative attitude to my appeal to review their position.</P>
    <P>In July, 1973, the Government fulfilled their election promise to remove the unjust aspects of the differential rent schemes which apply to the big majority of local authority dwellings.  The new national scheme, which applies uniformally to local authority dwellings throughout the country, is particularly beneficial to tenants on low incomes and to those who work long hours and whose income contains a large overtime element. Further improvements in the <Col N="1419" /> operation of the national scheme have been introduced, whereby the income to be taken into account for the purposes of the graded scale is not the household income but the basic income of the principal bread-winner, less income tax on basic income and less social welfare contributions. The scheme has been widely welcomed and appears to be working satisfactorily.</P>
    <P>While the primary aim of local authorities is to provide dwellings on a renting basis for persons who cannot afford to house themselves, a subsidiary aim is to encourage persons in a position to do so to become owner occupiers.  Schemes prepared under the new terms of sale for existing rented dwellings, which I announced last year, are now in operation in most local authority areas and many applications to purchase are being received all over the country.  Due to delays which have arisen in certain areas in the preparation of new schemes, I have extended to 31st December, 1974, the period within which tenants may be allowed to purchase under the existing schemes.  This is also the final date for application to purchase under the first schemes prepared under the new terms of sale.</P>
    <P>I have dealt at some length with various aspects of local authority housing because I realise that, in the past, social housing did not get the attention and the level of investment which it merited and I want to leave no doubt that different policies now apply.  At the same time, I do not underestimate the importance of the contribution to be made by the private housing sector in achieving the Government's target of 25,000 new houses annually.  There are a number of statistical indicators which give a reliable picture of the state of the private house-building industry. Purchase loans applied for and grants allocated show the volume of work which can be anticipated in the year ahead.  Loans approved and instalments of grants paid, reflect the extent of work currently in progress. Loans and grants paid are a measure <Col N="1420" /> of the rate of completions over a given period.  All these indicators show the rapid expansion in output which has taken place.</P>
    <P>Grants allocated in 1973-74 for new houses totalled 14,476 against 24,423 in 1972-73.  The latter total was completely freakish, however, as 10,626 grants were allocated in the quarter ended 31st March, 1973&mdash; about two-and-a-half times the average of 4,400 during the previous three quarters.  This resulted from builders endeavouring to get grants allocated on as many houses as possible before house price controls were introduced early in 1973.  Outside the Dublin area, 11,967 grants were allocated last year as compared with 11,234 in 1972-73. The general situation is improving and 4,246 allocations were made in the quarter ended 30th June, 1974, as compared with 2,505 in the corresponding quarter last year.  Applications for house-purchase loans for new dwellings being considered by all lending agencies totalled 16,654 at the end of last March, as against 14,077 a year earlier.  The number of loans approved during 1973-74 by building societies, local authorities and assurance companies for the purchase of new houses was 16,477&mdash;a 20 per cent increase on the 13,706 approvals in 1972-73.</P>
    <P>Payments of grants and loans last year were all-time records.  Grants were paid on 17,380 new houses, compared with 14,615 in 1972-73.  Loans paid out by all lending agencies for new houses totalled £57.28 million last year&mdash;a 40 per cent jump on the £40.79 million paid in 1972-73.</P>
    <P>There has been a marked increase in loans by local authorities&mdash;from 5,087 loans valued £15.13 million in 1972-73 to 10,408 loans valued £39.71 million in 1973-74.  I should point out that the big expansion in operations under the loans scheme is a good indication that it is still maintaining a fair relationship with the current levels both of house costs and borrower's incomes.  The provision for the local authorities' loans and supplementary grants schemes in the 1974 Public Capital Programme is £20.85 million, which is equivalent to £27.80 <Col N="1421" /> million for a full year and is an increase of £2.31 million on the allocation for the full financial year 1973-74.</P>
    <P>As regards building societies, I should mention the special subsidy that I introduced last year.  An important feature of this subsidy was the way in which it has been used to promote the development of Government policy relating to the societies.  Specific conditions attached to the subsidy include an embargo on loans for non-housing purposes, an upper limit on the amount of individual loans, the giving of precedence to loans for new houses, and the imposition in the interests of house purchasers of a maximum mortgage rate.  The subsidy which is unprecedented and which could not have been given under the policies to which the last Fianna Fáil Government were firmly committed and which they set out clearly in their 1969 White Paper on housing, saves every borrower from a building society 1¼ per cent in annual interest charges by enabling the societies to offer a rate of 8 per cent paid, to their investors while maintaining the mortgage rate at 11¼ per cent.  If the subsidy were not available, the societies would have been operating a mortgage rate of 12½ per cent for the past six to nine months.  This, in fact, is the rate that borrowers would have been paying if Fianna Fáil policies in relation to building societies had been continued.</P>
    <P>I should also mention the special arrangements which were made at my suggestion in October last whereby special loan facilities were provided for the building societies to enable them to expand their loan commitments quickly.  A fall-back loan facility, amounting to £6 million, was made available by the Associated Banks and guaranteed by the Minister for Finance through the Building Societies Act, 1974.  The initiative which I took in this matter helped the societies and the housing programme at a time when the societies were apprehensive about the flow of new money to them and were reluctant to commit themselves heavily.  I am glad to say that the availability <Col N="1422" /> of the back-up facility, arranged with the banks, enabled the societies to embark immediately on an extended programme of forward approvals and had the effect of relieving a backlog of unsold houses which some builders in the Dublin area had on their hands. I am maintaining close liaison with the societies on the current situation and I can only reiterate here what I have said before&mdash;that arrangements will be made if necessary to provide additional finance.</P>
    <P>In connection with the special subsidy, to which I have already referred, I intend at a later date to move a supplementary estimate to meet claims in respect of the period subsequent to 14th March, 1974.  The amount included in the Estimate under Subhead O, £400,000, covers the period from 1st January, 1974, to 13th March, 1974.</P>
    <P>Life assurance companies are another important source of finance for house-purchase loans and in 1973-74, they made a welcome investment of £10.54 million for the purpose. In the same period, they approved a total of 2,069 loans, compared with 1,534 a year earlier.  These figures must, of course, be related to total premium income and, in this respect, they show no actual improvement in the proportion of premium income used for house purchase loans.</P>
    <P>I am concerned about this situation, because it is estimated that a return by life assurance companies to the proportionate investment of premium income in housing which obtained some five years back would provide in 1974 an additional £5 million approximately in house-purchase loans. Discussions between representatives of the Life Offices Association and officials of my Department and of the Department of Industry and Commerce have been taking place with the purpose of encouraging the companies to allocate additional funds to finance housing.</P>
    <P>At a time when house prices are rising at an unprecedentedly fast rate, it is essential that the person of modest means purchasing a house should feel that the price demanded <Col N="1423" /> is not excessively high and that the quality of construction is reasonable.</P>
    <P>The scheme under which builders must obtain a certificate of reasonable value in respect of every grant-aided new house included in a scheme of four or more houses built for sale, provides a measure of protection for the purchaser.  Up to 31st May last, applications for certificates were submitted in respect of 14,143 houses. Of these applications, certificates covering 11,084 houses were issued, 81 applications in respect of 1,413 houses were rejected and the remainder were at various stages of consideration at 31st May.  The scheme is under continuous review in the light of changing costs for labour and materials in the building industry.  Applications for certificates are dealt with speedily: the average time taken to issue decisions has been 16 days in cases where certificates could be granted and 18 days where certificates were refused.</P>
    <P>On the question of standards of construction, consultations are taking place with the Construction Industry Federation in relation to a new house purchasers' guarantee which it is hoped to introduce next year.  This will be a structural guarantee given by builder members of the Federation to the purchaser of each new house provided by them.  The scheme should go a long way towards resolving complaints made by purchasers in relation to defects in their new houses.</P>
    <P>During the past year, I have continued to encourage the development of the co-operative movement in housing.  In particular, I am anxious to ensure that groups of people who combine to provide their own houses on a co-operative basis are given the fullest support by local authorities. The good response by local authorities is evidenced by the fact that negotiations are in progress throughout the country for the allocation by the authorities of about 1,000 subsidised and developed sites to co-operative groups.  This is one of the interesting details which have emerged from a <Col N="1424" /> survey of co-operative activity which I have been conducting.  The objective of the survey is to consider what further measures of assistance are desirable to enable the movement to develop.</P>
    <P>I may say that I have met a number of groups and have seen at first hand the quality of the work which they have been doing.  I feel that this is a sector of housing activity which is commendable from a national and social viewpoint and is directly rewarding to the group members.</P>
    <P>The continued good work being done by voluntary housing organisations also deserves our appreciation.  It is important that these groups should be aided by local authorities which are empowered to give assistance by way of loan, loan guarantee, or periodic contributions.  I would urge local authorities to give every help and encouragement to organisations which are active in providing accommodation to supplement the direct construction work of the authorities themselves.</P>
    <P>While I have laid emphasis on the provision of new houses, I fully realise the national importance of preserving the existing housing stock and of adding the facilities and amenities which are necessary to bring old dwellings up to the standard which is now regarded as normal in the case of modern houses.  I am glad to record, therefore, that my Department paid 8,962 reconstruction grants last year&mdash;a total that was bettered only once in the past 12 years.</P>
    <P>Last year 10,979 grants were allocated for reconstruction&mdash;a substantial increase on the 9,445 allocations in 1972-73 and the 9,594 in the preceding year.  This is a welcome trend.</P>
    <P>I am anxious to ensure that the grants and loans from public funds to assist reconstruction work should be applied in a more rational and selective way than heretofore so that comparatively greater assistance should be given in respect of works considered to be essential or highly desirable than to work mainly amenity in character. Accordingly, I am having the existing <Col N="1425" /> grants scheme reviewed in the light of experience in other countries and with regard to the findings of the National Survey of the Housing Stock, carried out jointly by my Department and An Foras Forbartha, the reports on housing obtained in the 1971 Census and other information.  I might mention at this point that I am arranging to pay reconstruction grants where solid fuel fireplaces or appliances are installed in centrally heated houses even though a statutory minimum period has not elapsed since a previous housing grant was paid. Provision dealing with the matter by way of an amendment to the Housing Act, 1966, will be included in the next Housing Bill.  I am sure that the House will endorse this action.</P>
    <P>In view of the importance of the building industry in the national economy, it is essential that a high level of efficiency be maintained in the industry.  Measures are taken to encourage this with the willing assistance of An Foras Forbartha&mdash;for example, by conversion to a metric system of measurement, modular coordination, rationalisation of building components, the preparation of building regulations and a technical assistance grants scheme.</P>
    <P>The change to metric in the building industry made considerable progress during the past year.  The most recent survey of change in the design and construction sectors showed a significant commitment to metric working and about two-thirds of all work being carried out is now in metric units.  In the building materials sector, similar progress is reported and the basic materials are all now available in metric terms.  It is now more convenient to use metric in design and construction than to use the traditional measurements.</P>
    <P>Work in my Department on the preparation of a final draft of a comprehensive code of building regulations under section 86 of the Local Government (Planning and Development) Act, 1963, has reached an advanced stage.  When completed, the draft will be made available for public comment, before the regulations are formally made.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1426" /> It is essential that people engaged in the construction industry should keep abreast of new techniques and developments.  The technical assistance grants scheme operated by my Department assists activities to increase efficiency.  Under the scheme, grants are made towards the cost of attendance at training courses by managerial, supervisory or technical personnel engaged in the building industry as well as certain trade union officials and representatives.  The grants may also be made towards the cost of study visits abroad by representatives of management and labour to study specific aspects of the building industry.  Grants are made also for the engagement of consultants by builders or contractors to advise on matters directed to the improvement of their efficiency.  Expenditure on the grants under subhead L, is estimated to be £18,000 in the nine-month period to 31st December next.</P>
    <P>I met a deputation from the Construction Industry Federation on the 12th June.  The questions of employment in the house building industry and the sales of building materials were discussed.  I informed the deputation that what had been said by them had been noted and I gave an assurance that the industry would be kept going.</P>
    <P>References have been made in the press and other news media as to numbers of dwellings left vacant because of the inability of intending purchasers to obtain housing loans to meet their commitments.  I have already pointed out that the Government have taken positive measures to provide finance for houses through an increased public capital programme and by means of positive assistance to the building societies. I have indicated that if extra money is required it will be made available. I repeat that assurance now.</P>
    <P>People who should know better&mdash; indeed whose job it is to know better &mdash;are misinterpreting statistics connected with housing.  A glaring example is the misinterpretation in this House and outside it of figures for new housing grant allocations.  It <Col N="1427" /> has been alleged that there was a 60 per cent drop in the number of housing starts in the first quarter of this year as compared with the same period last year.  This is entirely false. The drop was not in housing starts but in new house grant allocations.</P>
    <P>The reason for the drop was as mentioned previously, the very high volume of applications for grants which was made in anticipation of house price control being introduced in February, 1973.  The extent of the distortion can be seen by a comparison of the figures for previous quarters.</P>
    <P>This misinterpretation of important statistics is part of the campaign which has been mounted to denigrate the Government's impressive housing record.  Figures have been quoted also about unemployment in the building industry.  The available statistics do not support any grounds for scaremongering in this matter.  The Government are committed to a programme of 25,000 houses per year and the resources to meet this commitment will be made available.</P>
    <P>Provision is made this year for a further increase in the Exchequer contribution to the Road Fund.  The provision of £6.6 million for the nine-month transitional period is equivalent to over £8 million for twelve months or over £3 million more than the 1973-74 figure.  This has enabled me to raise the total allocation of grants from the Road Fund to £16 million for the nine-month period.</P>
    <P>The introduction last year of the block-grant system for roads other than national roads was an important step in the devolution to local authorities of responsibility for determining their own priorities of planning and expenditure in relation to local needs.  I have extended the principle this year by abolishing the 50 per cent limit on expenditure from grant moneys on the cost of upkeep of main roads.  I have also accepted as a 100 per cent charge on grants the cost of upkeep of national secondary roads.  Up to this, local authorities had to find 50 per cent of the cost of the <Col N="1428" /> latter service from rates, involving a local charge of about £660,000.</P>
    <P>They can now decide to omit any such charge from rates or, if they wish to make equivalent provision for another service.  I have also removed the obligation from local authorities of advance submission to the Department of proposals for urban road works.  Urban authorities can now decide in their own wisdom how best to use their grant allocations in the local interest.  Of course, as long as the State is providing grants from public revenues, it is obliged to see that the money is spent to proper advantage and my Department through its inspectorate will keep in touch with the development and carrying out of local programmes.</P>
    <P>The whole question of financing road construction and related services such as safety, research and enforcement, is a complex one.  We have moved into a new era in roads programming in recent years.  With the assistance of An Foras Forbartha, a detailed study has just been completed of the future needs of the national primary roads system, and its cost implications are being considered. The very high cost of roads improvement, including land acquisition, prompts the question whether it will continue to be practical to finance such capital works from current revenues.  This and other aspects of road financing are being studied. The solutions are not necessarily easy.</P>
    <P>Since the recent Act dealing with national roads and motorways was passed I have noticed a certain amount of critical public comment in anticipation of certain possible motorway schemes.  I welcome the healthy and growing interest in environmental issues by local bodies and community groups.  I do not accept, however, that a serious clash of interests need develop on roads issues. I expect the fullest public consultation by local authorities on their proposals before any scheme is formally submitted to me.  I hope to see enlightened criticism emerging as a beneficial influence on the preparation <Col N="1429" /> of final proposals by a local authority.  What I would deplore at this stage is the drawing up in advance of unnecessarily rigid positions either by local authorities or by people whom they are elected to represent, the consequence of which can produce a great deal of public misunderstanding, and frustration and disillusionment on one side or the other, with perhaps the unnecessary deferment of civic works for which there is a clearly established need.</P>
    <P>The pattern of road accidents continues to be one of very great concern to me.  The National Road Safety Association has now been given corporate status and a grant of £140,000 is available to it for the current year.  I expect the association to get the dynamic going which will bring home to everyone the importance of the behaviour of drivers and of preventive measures which are designed to obviate the tragic and costly results of road accidents.</P>
    <P>I have received a thought-provoking report as a result of a research project carried out at my Department's request into the safety condition of vehicles on the road.  The object of the study was to measure the nature of defects in vehicles which might be contributory factors in road accidents, so that I might assess the merits and appropriate procedure of introducing a national system of vehicle inspection. In the Dublin area alone, 51 per cent of cars inspected had misaimed headlamps, 36 per cent had tyre tread below the minimum requirement, 30 per cent had faulty steering linkage. These are only examples of the findings in Dublin, where over 85 per cent of cars inspected had one or more defects of significance for safety.  The findings show up even more unfavourably those cars inspected outside the Dublin area.</P>
    <P>I accept that it is not possible to measure scientifically the relationship between the general condition of cars and the rate of road accidents, but it should be of deep concern to all car owners that so many vehicles have particular defects which can contribute to accidents in times of stress, <Col N="1430" /> in bad weather or in periods of darkness. I hope we can secure an urgent public response to the problem which the survey has revealed. At the same time, I propose to consider what steps might now be taken, commensurate with costs and anticipated effects, of devising a general scheme of vehicle inspection for which statutory provision was made in the Road Traffic Act of 1968.</P>
    <P>Notwithstanding the desire of the EEC for progress in the harmonisation of transportation requirements in member states, many issues which were alive when Ireland became a member remain unresolved.  The policy of members on the standardisation of weights and dimensions of vehicles is still divided.  Major details of the concept of harmonisation of the tax structure for commercial vehicles continue to be developed, as does the idea of an infrastructure tax, a concept designed to replace the existing pattern of road and freight taxation. Policy is also being developed on the standardisation of driver licensing and vehicle testing.  While we have not so far found it necessary to change our domestic law by virtue of our membership, the interplay of ideas and the constant exchange of information at all levels is useful to us and, in so far as international agreements may in particular help to reduce road accidents here and throughout Europe, we will be very glad to co-operate in the furtherance of the aims of the EEC Common Transport Policy.</P>
    <P>The provision for the Local Improvement Schemes is being maintained at the same rate as for last year, that is, £1 million for a full year or £750,000 for the nine-months' period.  Demand for grants under the scheme continues to be heavy, and no doubt in the view of many Deputies calls for a bigger provision.  However the demand in this area must be balanced against the needs of other services.  I am satisfied that in present circumstances the proposed provision represents a reasonable contribution towards the cost of these works.</P>
    <P>Few developments in my Department in 1973-74 were more important than the increase in the capital procep <Col N="1431" /> vision for public water and sewerage schemes to £12.95 million from £8.23 million in 1972-73.  This helped these programmes to get out of the doldrums they had been in for a number of years due to underfinancing.  As a result of this increased capital provision, I am glad to report that I was able to approve schemes to a total value of £18.0 million for commencement in 1973-74 compared with £10.9 million in 1972-73.  For the current nine-month period the provision for public water and sewerage schemes at £11.45 million is equivalent to an allocation of £15.26 million on a 12-months' basis.  In other words, in a period of less than two years, the amount of capital expenditure on sanitary services will have been increased by more than 85 per cent.</P>
    <P>My Department are urging local authorities to push ahead with the planning of a number of priority sanitary services schemes so that, when fully planned, they can be considered for financing in conjunction with similar schemes from other areas.  In this way I intend to ensure that all areas in the country will be able to develop their water and sewerage services in order that full advantage can be taken of any and every opportunity which presents itself for the economic improvement of their area.</P>
    <P>The provision of extra money for the sanitary services programme will not, in itself, yield satisfactory results unless schemes are planned, approved and executed with the minimum of delay.  To my mind the involvement of the Department in the planning of these schemes has been far too great in the past.  I decided to place the responsibility for the detailed planning of water and sewerage schemes squarely on the shoulders of local sanitary authorities&mdash;where it belongs &mdash;and I have informed the sanitary authorities of the new procedures which will ensure this.  A similar look is being had at the miscellaneous environmental services, which I deal with elsewhere.</P>
    <P>The 1971 census results indicate that 40 per cent of rural houses still lack a piped water supply.  This means <Col N="1432" /> that thousands of rural families are daily faced with the drudgery of drawing water from wells, pumps and other sources which may be located some distance away from their homes. I am determined that this position will be rectified in the shortest possible time.</P>
    <P>Under revised arrangements for group water supply schemes commencing on or after 1st April, 1974, all State grants will be calculated and paid by my Department.  Grants paid by them on behalf of Roinn na Gaeltachta and the Department of Agriculture and Fisheries will be recouped by those Departments.  This will speed the payment of grants and reduce paperwork for group promoters who will, in future, be able to address all correspondence about their schemes to a single Department.</P>
    <P>Local authorities must continue to play a key role in helping and encouraging the development of group schemes in their areas.  I have asked them to include in their priorities schemes of headworks, trunk mains and reservoirs needed to enable group schemes to develop in areas where reliable sources of potable water would not otherwise be available. Some local authorities provide a range of technical services for groups including well boring, testing of potential sources, the design of schemes and, in a few counties, the supervision of schemes in progress.  I should like all local authorities to consider providing these and any other technical services needed to facilitate groups.</P>
    <P>The experiment which I initiated last year under which group schemes work previously done by my Department has been devolved to a number of counties is continuing and the result will be evaluated in due course.</P>
    <P>A key element at an early stage in the programmes of local authorities is the land necessary for their operations. Land acquisition policies of local authorities now cover more than the traditional objective of providing just the land necessary for the houses, roads and other works of the <Col N="1433" /> local authorities themselves.  The development and the redevelopment of areas must be considered in a comprehensive way and if plans for these areas are to be effectively realised the local authorities may find it necessary to acquire land on a more extensive scale than hitherto.</P>
    <P>This poses a serious financial problem for local authorities who have to balance their programmes of land acquisition with other urgent programmes.  The financial burden would not be made any lighter if the kind of operation described in the Kenny Committee Report were allowed to spiral up the price of land.</P>
    <P>The central issue which the Kenny Committee considered was the control of building land prices.  As the report indicates, the problem is indeed a complex one and the solution not an easy one.  But the Government have grasped the nettle and have indicated their option.  In their statement of the 26th January, 1974, they indicated that they favoured the approach enunciated in the majority report of the Kenny Committee but, before taking final decisions on many of the important matters of detail involved, they would take into account the views of interested members of the public and local authorities.  Views from a number of bodies have been received and others are still coming in.  It is likely to be some time before the drafting of the necessary legislation can be finalised.  The complexities of the matter are such that all the views submitted will need to be sorted out and carefully considered before a scheme can be worked out.  When legislation has been prepared and passed by both Houses of the Oireachtas, the Government have decided that the opinion of the Supreme Court should be obtained in order to remove any possible doubts as to the constitutionality of the provisions.</P>
    <P>In the meantime, the Government have not entered into any commitment in relation to the amount of compensation which will be payable for land in a &ldquo;designated area&rdquo; but have given notice that account will not be taken of the price obtained in <Col N="1434" /> any sale subsequent to the 26th January, 1974.  It is hoped that the effect will be to discourage further escalation in the price of land.</P>
    <P>Apart from the major recommendation in the Kenny Report, the committee made some other valuable recommendations, including those for the amendment of the normal law on compulsory acquisition which will still be required.  Work is in hand in my Department on preparing legislation accordingly.</P>
    <P>Pending new legislation, the work of processing compulsory purchase orders under the existing law must go on at local authority and Departmental levels.  I have taken all possible administrative steps to improve the flow of work, but it must be accepted that the process of a compulsory acquisition has to take time, because of the legal and other safeguards that have to be built into the system.</P>
    <P>At the 1st April, 1973, there were under consideration 82 orders for the acquisition of 2,969 acres of land required by local authorities for their powers, functions and duties relating to housing, sanitary services, roads and so on.</P>
    <P>During the year ended 31st March, 1974, 91 compulsory purchase orders for the acquisition of 1,517 acres were submitted.  In this period 81 orders comprising 2,636 acres were confirmed and six orders comprising 39 acres were annulled.  At 31st March, 1974, there were 86 orders comprising 1,811 acres under consideration, but 12 compulsory purchase orders which had been confirmed were the subject of proceedings in the courts and were therefore suspended until final determination of the proceedings. There are about 2,550 acres of land included in these orders.</P>
    <P>An important Supreme Court decision was made on 5th April, 1974, in relation to the Poppintree-Balbutcher-Santry Area Compulsory Purchase Order, 1967.  This judgment was to the effect that a local authority may make a compulsory purchase order on lands outside their functional <Col N="1435" /> area without entering into a formal agreement with the local authority in whose area the lands are situated, provided of course that the Minister is satisfied they have produced the necessary evidence at the public local inquiry to show that they require the lands for the fulfilment of their statutory functions.  The development of such lands if the CPO is confirmed will still require planning permission from the planning authority in whose area the lands are situated.</P>
    <P>A related matter is that of water rights.  At 1st April, 1973, there were six applications for the taking of supplies of water under consideration. During the year ended 31st March, 1974, four applications were received, four provisional orders were granted, one application was refused and four provisional orders previously granted were confirmed.  At 31st March, 1974, there were five applications under consideration.</P>
    <P>The debate on the Planning Bill is probably the most appropriate forum at the moment for a discussion on planning, but when looking at the work generally of my Department and the local authorities, it is inevitable that I should stress the importance of planning in our programmes and its impact on the public generally.</P>
    <P>At regional level it lays the basis for a policy of settlement location and growth and so is a main determinant in the plans for location and nature of infrastructure.  At local authority level it lays down the basis on which the local authority see their area developing and it affects all the important individual decisions of private and public interests to develop land in any way.</P>
    <P>It has been my concern since I took up office to consider how best planning can serve the people and how it can be operated most effectively.  I shall give some examples.</P>
    <P>I indicated in my last Estimates speech what was my approach to planning control and in particular planning appeals, since it is in the exercise of that function that I can indicate my policy most effectively.  I stressed that I wanted the most flexible possible <Col N="1436" /> approach, eliminating unnecessary restrictions on people, particularly in regard to housing, and reserving the force of planning for the most important problems.  I can say that, on the whole, my approach has been heartily welcomed, especially by those who appreciate most the inhibiting effect of negative and unduly restrictive policies.  The elected members of local authorities have warmly approved of my line as have many of the members of the public who have been affected by excessive planning control.  There have been some criticisms. It would be strange if there were not.  But I am convinced that my policy is right and has overall approval.</P>
    <P>With the continuing growth of the economy, the number of planning applications has continued to grow, and as a consequence the number of planning appeals has increased to 4,000 in 1973-74, over 800 more than in the previous year.  I am happy to say that in 1973-74 3,891 were disposed of, 900 more than in the previous year.  The Planning Bill before the House contains the Government's proposals for improving planning control, not merely by the establishment of the new appeals board.  It also proposes a comprehensive strengthening in enforcement powers and has other valuable provisions.</P>
    <P>One could consider regional planning as at the other end of the planning spectrum.  It can be a powerful weapon to implement Government policy.  The Government are firmly committed to a policy of improving the standard of living of all our people by providing sufficient employment where this is not already available. This does not mean providing employment just in the larger towns, some of which already experience the problems associated with rapid development. As Minister for Local Government my main concern is to ensure that the infrastructure necessary to support the increased number of jobs is provided by making sufficient money available to local authorities to enable them to do this.</P>
    <P>This country is now undergoing a <Col N="1437" /> process of urbanisation.  In the past, urban growth has been associated with the drift from rural areas and the natural increase of town population. However, with the decline in emigration, present indications are that our national population will continue to increase and that the increase will have to be accommodated to a considerable extent in our towns.  To meet the challenge of population expansion, increased and sustained programmes of infrastructure provision will be required.  The orderly planing of land use and the environment must as far as is possible keep ahead of development trends and pressures. Demands will more than strain our resources, hence the need for careful choice of priorities for investment and the co-ordination of various development programmes.  While each local authority is responsible primarily for the development of its own area it recognises that this is tied up closely with the development of adjoining areas and that an integrated and coordinated approach to development planning is necessary.  The vehicle for this co-ordination exists in the regional planning organisations which have been doing much work in the nine planning regions.  The organisations are a blend of elected representatives and officials, and all agencies concerned with development are represented on the boards and committees.  I think that these organisations, without in any way taking from the functions of the local authorities represented on them, can play an even more active role in the co-ordination of plans and in the working out of development programmes and priorities for infrastructural investment.</P>
    <P>Very much related to planning is the group of miscellaneous services which local authorities operate and which can lead to a general improvement in the whole environment of an area and the quality of life of the people.  I shall deal with a number of these.</P>
    <P>An obvious one is the scheme of amenity grants.  Under subhead G there is provision for grants to assist local authorities to provide a wide range of improvements in their area. <Col N="1438" /> The allocation for the current year&mdash; 1st April to 31st December, 1974&mdash; is £300,000.  This is equivalent to £400,000 for a full year, a substantial increase on the previous year's allocation of £240,000.  The amount of the provision, taken with the expenditure by the local authorities from local funds on amenities and the contributions of voluntary groups, represents a substantial investment in the improvement of the environment and the provision of recreational facilities. The interest shown by voluntary groups and their co-operation with the local authority which the scheme has generated is a most desirable trend and one which I hope will continue.</P>
    <P>Under this local authorities may themselves provide pools or assist voluntary bodies and my Department make a generous subsidy to the local authorities.</P>
    <P>The programme continues and I recently approved in principle of five pools at Cavan, Dungarvan, Kells, Roscrea and Trim and of contributions by Dublin County Council towards the cost of pools at Tallaght and Blanchardstown community schools.</P>
    <P>I am at the same time concerned to ensure that the maximum benefit is derived from all pools, those already provided as well as those now on the way.  I have therefore instituted a full review by an informal working group of all the problems involved in the operation of swimming pools.  Alive to the difficulties created for pool operators by the recent increase in fuel costs, I have arranged, as part of the group's work, for a study to be carried out by the Institute for Industrial Research and Standards of the efficient production, use and conservation of heat in swimming pools and I intend to make the findings available to local authorities and other interested groups.</P>
    <P>I would also like to refer to local authority libraries.  I am glad to say that, last year, the Department sanctioned loans totalling £427,000 which was more than double the total in any previous year.  I am anxious that proposals for capital library projects should be processed as quickly as possible, <Col N="1439" /> and in this connection consideration is being given to the question of developing more responsibilities to local authorities for these projects, on the basis of detailed guidelines issued by An Chomhairle Leabharianna.  A special examination is also being made of staff training and development in the local authority library service. The provision in subhead M for payments to An Chomhairle Leabharlanna, which is mainly in respect of subsidy towards loan charges on local authority library projects, is £65,000 for the nine months.  This is also a record figure.</P>
    <P>In this context I may refer to our contribution to the Council of Europe campaign for European Architectural Heritage Year, 1975.  I have the honour to be chairman of the National Committee for the Year, and I am happy to record that the President has been kind enough to act as patron for the Year.  As chairman of the National Committee, I would also like to express my appreciation of the dedicated work of the members of the committee, representative as they are both of public and private bodies, and of the many individuals and organisations who have pledged their support to the campaign for Architectural Heritage Year.</P>
    <P>Highlighting the National Committee's programme are the two projects &mdash;at Holycross, County Tipperary and St. John's Square, Limerick, which have been accepted as part of the Council of Europe's programme of pilot projects in connection with the Year.  However it has also been a satisfying feature of the Irish Campaign that the National Committee have succeeded in securing the involvement of local authorities and of other bodies in a wide range of local projects.  These may not all be monumental in scale but they are valuable both as local contributions and as a means of interesting the general public in the problems and benefits of conserving our architectural heritage. The National Committee have planned a number of promotional activities&mdash; competitions, exhibitions and educational programmes, for 1975 and I am <Col N="1440" /> confident that their efforts will ensure that European Architectural Heritage Year is marked appropriately.</P>
    <P>Directly associated with the more positive development side of local government is its protective role in relation to the environment.  Indeed it is accepted that pollution problems and environmental problems generally, are side effects of development.  If we are to have the benefits of faster growth without, at the same time, suffering serious environmental damage, certain implications have to be faced.  A fundamental one is that environmental considerations must be built into our development programmes generally.  The environmental implications of a development, public or private, must be taken into account from the beginning, and the necessary safeguards provided for in planning and observed in execution. While the Planning and Development Act, 1963, affords a fundamentally sound system for this kind of environmental planning, it does require improvement, and the Bill at present before the House includes a number of provisions which will strengthen the physical planning system as a means of environmental protection.</P>
    <P>I go on to refer to measures which are in hand to deal with existing pollution problems.  I believe, however, the main need is to guard our natural resources against the much greater threats which can arise in the future as national development proceeds.  This gives rise to various legislative and organisational needs which must be provided for.  It also calls for a sense of environmental responsibility&mdash;individual and corporate, private and public&mdash;which has not always been evident in the past.  At all stages of development and in all kinds of planning, there will have to be acceptance of the need to take account of possible adverse side effects of development proposals and to build into the planning control whatever measures may be necessary to avoid or minimise such damage.  Increasing attention is being given by my Department to measures to protect the environment. These include measures <Col N="1441" /> to control water and air pollution, to deal with waste and with the dangers of oil pollution on the coasts.</P>
    <P>The making of suitable arrangements for control of water pollution is one of my urgent priorities and I am pressing ahead with the preparation of comprehensive legislation on the subject.  A Bill to provide for an adequate legislative framework for dealing with the problem is at present being drafted and I intend to have it brought before the Dáil as soon as possible.  Pending enactment of such legislation I am actively encouraging local authorities to take such interim action as is possible, including full use of their powers under planning legislation, to prevent and abate water pollution.</P>
    <P>The Water Resources Division of An Foras Forbartha continues to play a very important role in providing information and advice in relation to the quality and quantity aspects of our water resources.  With regard to the quality aspect the Division has carried out further chemical investigations into the quality of stretches of some 30 rivers which were found to be unsatisfactory in an earlier survey carried out in 1971.  The results of these further investigations have now been published.  They show that the chemical investigations indicate 14 of the rivers as reasonably satisfactory, 15 as satisfactory part of the time and seven as unsatisfactory.  An Foras have also commenced a preliminary survey of 59 lakes in order to build up a baseline of data on the condition of the more important and representative lakes in the country with a view to carrying out more detailed studies on selected lakes.</P>
    <P>I referred in my Estimate speech last year to a meeting I held in October, 1973 with representatives of voluntary and other bodies concerned with the water pollution problem. Arising out of the views expressed at that meeting I have decided to set up, on an informal basis in advance of legislation, a National Water Pollution Advisory Council to advise on water pollution matters generally.  I intend that all relevant interests, including <Col N="1442" /> industrial, agricultural, fishery, professional, scientific, voluntary and local authority interests, in addition to Government Departments and semi-State bodies concerned, will be represented on this council.  I expect to be in a position to make a further announcement on this matter shortly.</P>
    <P>A provision of £15,000 is included in the Estimate for clearance of oil pollution.  The preparation by maritime local authorities of contingency plans for clearance of oil pollution is generally well advanced.  In addition most local authorities concerned have purchased, or are in course of purchasing, spraying equipment and supplies of dispersant.  In view of the threat of oil pollution to our coasts it is imperative that all maritime areas be fully prepared to deal with oil spillages. Local authorities are assisted by a State subsidy of 50 per cent in meeting the cost of oil pollution clearance work, subject to a limit on local authority expenditure of the produce of a rate of 2½p in the £ in any year.  Any expenditure over and above this limit is met in full by the State.</P>
    <P>The monitoring of air pollution by local authorities is gradually being extended in the main urban centres. Existing monitoring relates mainly to smoke and sulphur dioxide.  The need for further extension of the system, or for the monitoring of other pollutants in the ambient air is being kept under review.  This monitoring is important. It is important that we should know what existing conditions are, what the trends are, so that there may be advance warning of any conditions which may indicate a need for action under existing control or for new controls.</P>
    <P>I am glad to say that it has been possible to intensify my Department's activity under the Alkali etc..  Works Regulations Act, 1906, in relation to certain industries, mainly the chemical industries.  It is, of course, particularly important that there should be effective control in relation to these particular industries and the increased activity will be maintained, and if necessary, developed further to achieve this objective.  It is also being considered <Col N="1443" /> whether it is necessary or desirable that the kind of control exercised under the Alkali Act should be extended to types of industry not at present covered by the Act.  There is a notable increase in awareness of an interest in air pollution on the part of the public.  This is a very healthy development.  It should encourage the local authorities to develop further their activity (not always sufficiently recognised) in enforcing the Control of Atmospheric Pollution Regulations, 1970.  These regulations restrict heavy smoke emissions and the excessive emission of smoke, dust, grit, gas or fumes.  I believe that this system is working reasonably well but it will be developed and improved as the need arises.</P>
    <P>The volume of waste of all kinds is increasing and there have been important changes in the composition of waste.  These developments underline the importance of the quality of the waste collection and disposal service provided by local authorities.  In order to promote higher standards and generally to improve the efficiency of the dumping and waste disposal service, I have issued guidelines and detailed advice to local authorities as to how their systems might be reorganised on a countywide basis and modern methods of collection and disposal adopted.  I believe that measures of this kind can lead to a substantial improvement in the standards provided and will enable the growing demands on this essential service to be met effectively.</P>
    <P>With the rapid increase in industrialisation and in mining activity, the disposal of solid toxic wastes may present formidable problems in the future.  I intend that we should be prepared for this and I am having this situation examined to see whether any special control measures, or any special advice to local authorities, should be arranged now.  The problems of toxic waste disposal are under special study in the EEC.  We will have the benefit of that work and must, of course, take account of any proposals that might emerge in the Community.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1444" /> In replying to the debate on the Second Stage of the Planning and Development (Amendment) Bill I informed Deputies that it was my intention to again remind local authorities of their responsibility for the control of litter.  As a follow up to the detailed circular issued in August last a further circular has been issued together with a letter addressed personally to all City and Country Managers requesting them to take an active interest in combating the problem and to avail themselves of every opportunity to encourage civic pride in their areas by providing an adequate and efficient refuse disposal service.</P>
    <P>Environmental and pollution problems are world-wide and all countries are grappling with them.  There are certain common patterns but, in general, the more highly developed the economy, the stronger the pressures on the environment.  Furthermore, pollution originating in one country can affect others.  Not surprisingly, therefore, there is a definite quickening of interest in action at international level to deal with environmental matters.</P>
    <P>A new environment programme is being launched under the United Nations promoting co-operation, exchanges and assistance at the international level.  New initiatives are also being taken in a number of other international bodies.  Of most immediate concern to us are the happenings in the EEC where work is progressing under an enviornment programme which was approved in July, 1973 and formally adopted in November last.  This programme provides for three types of activity-projects aimed at reducing and preventing pollution and nuisances; projects intended to improve the environment and the quality of life; and joint action by the member states in international organisations dealing with environmental questions.  In promoting these objectives it has become evident that there are considerable gaps in scientific and technical information about pollutants and their effects as well as varying opinions as to appropriate control objectives and methods.  Much of the early work under the environment <Col N="1445" /> programme will be concerned with the filling of information gaps and the development of a basis for a common approach to the assessment and control of pollutants, including where appropriate the adoption of common standards or other control devices.  A number of specialists groups have been established to advance this work.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>Tá mé buíoch as ucht an seans a thug tú dhom an cheist seo a phlé.  Mar is eol don Teach, chuir mé síos ceist chun Aire na Gaeltachta inniu, Uimhir a 17 ar an gclár, fiafraí dhe an bhfuil scéim ar láimh aige le scoláireachtaí a thabhairt do mhic léinn a bheadh ag freastal ar chúrsa tré Ghaeilge i gColáistí Réigiúnacha.  Fuair mé freagra ón Aire ag rá &ldquo;Tá scoláireachtaí áirithe dá leithéid sin á dtabhairt ag mo Roinnse: íocadh iad i Mí Márta seo caite don scoilbhliain 1973-74.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>Dúirt mé inniu nach raibh mé sásta leis an bhfreagra sin mar, sa chaoi a fheicimse é, ní freagra ceart é ar an gceist a chuir mé síos.  D'iarr mé ar an Aire an bhfuil scéim ar láimh aige chun na scoláireachtaí seo a thabhairt.  Bhí mé ag labhairt faoi seacht scoláireachtaí a híocadh i nGaillimh do scoláirí a bhí ag freastal ar an gColáiste Réigiúnach i nGaillimh i Mí Márta seo caite.  Bhí eolas agam faoi na seacht scoláireachtaí seo sara chuir mé síos an cheist.  Séard atá ag cur as do údaráis an choláiste agus do na scoláirí féin ná nach raibh aon scéal fáighte acu ón Aire go mbeadh na scoláireachtaí seo ar fáil arís an bhliain seo chugainn, nó fiú go mbeadh na scoláireachtaí seo ar fáil ins na blianta amach romhainn&mdash;gur scéim seasta a bhí i gceist aige.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Chuir sé féin in iúl don Dáil ar an <Col N="1446" /> 12ú lá de Mhárta seo caite go raibh scéim ar láimh aige le scoláireachtaí a thabhairt do mhic léinn a bheadh ag freastal ar chúrsaí tré Ghaeilge i gcoláiste réigiúnach.  Ar an 20ú lá de Mhárta sa Dáil agus é ag labhairt ar rún a bhí ós ár gcomhair ag an Teachta Tunney, dúirt sé an rud céanna.  Cheap mé nuair a chuir mé síos an cheist seo ag iarraidh air an raibh scéim ar láimh aige go bhfaighinn eolas faoin scéim uaidh, mar is rud tábhachtach é do na scoláirí óga seo agus do dhaoine eile go háirithe an dream atá ina gcónaí sa Ghaeltacht a bheadh ag súil go mbeadh siad in ann freastal ar chúrsaí tré Ghaeilge.</P>
    <P>Mar is eol don Aire, tá cúrsa dhá bhliain i gnó staidéar sa Choláiste Réigiúnach i nGaillimh.  Chuir Gaeltarra Éireann ocht scoláireachtaí ar bun, £700 do gach scoláire ar feadh dhá bhliain.  Chuir RTE dhá scoláireachtaí ar bun le haghaidh an chúrsa dhá bhliain&mdash;£300 sa bhliain a cuireadh in iúl domsa.  Bhí 17 scoláirí ag freastal ar an gcúrsa seo.  Dá bhrí sin seachtar ar an gcúrsa nach raibh aon íocaíocht dhá fháil acu ó aon áit.  Ní raibh aon scoláireacht ar fáil dóibh agus i Mí Márta rinne Roinn na Gaeltachta íocaíocht dóibh.  Níl mé cinnte cé mhéad a thug siad ach cuirtear in iúl dom gur £350 an iomlán. B'fhéidir go gcuireadh an tAire in iúl dom ina dhiaidh seo an é sin an figiúir nó nach é.  Rinneadh aniarracht a fháil amach ó Aire na Gaeltachta, óna Roinn, ón Roinn Oideachais comh maith an mbeadh na scoláireachtaí seo ar fáil do na scoláirí seo an bhliain seo chugainn.  Níl fhios agam cén fá nach raibh an Roinn sásta an freagra a thabhairt dóibh, go háithrid nuair a chuir an tAire in iúl don Dáil i Mí Márta seo caite go raibh scéim ar lámha aige&mdash;ach ní bhfuair aon duine sa Choláiste Réigiúnach i nGaillimh ar aon nós aon scéal faoin scéim sin.  Tá trí nó ceithre mhí caite ó chuir tú seo in iúl don Dáil agus is aisteach liomsa agus leis na húdaráis i mbun an choláiste seo agus na scoláirí an mhoill leis an eolas a chur ar fáil.</P>
    <P>Tá laetheannta saoire ag na scoláirí faoi láthair agus tá na húdaráis sa choláiste ag iarraidh réiteach a <Col N="1447" /> dhéanamh maidir leis na gcúrsai a bhéas ar siúl sa choláiste sin an bhliain seo chugainn.  Ach níl siad in ann aon eolas a thabhairt d'aon scoláire a mbeadh suim aige freastal ar na cúrsaí seo tré Ghaeilge mar ní raibh aon eolas fáighte acu go dtí seo ó Roinn na Gaeltachta, a thug an gheallúint seo sa Dáil agus in áiteacha eile, no ón Roinn Oideachais, a bhfuil cúram an choláiste seo orthu.</P>
    <P>Cuirtear in iúl domsa go rinneadh an-iarracht an t-eolas seo a fháil agus nach raibh an t-eolas le fáil mar fhreagra ar na ceisteanna agus na litreacha agus na glaoanna ar an telefóin don dá Roinn, Roinn na Gaeltachta agus an Roinn Oideachais agus fiú litir a chuir an tAire féin amach do Theachta eile níor thug sé dó ach an t-eolas céanna a thug sé domsa mar fhreagra inniu, eolas a bhí agam sar a chuir mé síos an cheist ar chor ar bith.</P>
    <P>Tuigeann an tAire nach bhfuil aon chúrsa eile sa tír cosúil leis an gcúrsa seo, cúrsa gnó 'na bhéadh go haithrid leads óg ón Ghaeltacht in ann freastal ar chúrsa árd-chaighdeánach comh maith le cúrsa gnó in aon áit eile sa tír ach an difríocht seo go bhféadann siad an cúrsa a dhéanamh 'na teanga fhéin.  Cuireadh an cúrsa ar bun de bharr scéal a bhfuair siad ó Chonnradh na Gaeilge agus cumainn eile a bhfuil suim acu sa Ghaeilge, agus de bharr na iarrataisí sin a bhfuair siad chuir siad an cúrsa speisíalta seo ar bun.  Dúirt an Roinn Oideachais ag an am nach mbeadh aon mhaitheas sa chúrsa, nach mbeadh aon tsuim ag aon scoláire ann nach dtiocfadh siad chun freastal air.  Tháinig 17 scoláirí ach an seachtar seo den 17 ní rabhadar cinnte go dtí innui go mbeadh an íocaíocht sin ar fáil dóibh ó Roinn na Gaeltachta don bhliain so chughainn.</P>
    <P>D'fhéadfainnse bheith sásta leis an freagra a thug an tAire dom tráthóna mar freagra ar cheisteanna eile a chuir mé air i ndiaidh an freagra sin a thug sé dom tráthnóna, freagra a lé sé amach ach sé an cúis gur iarr mé air teacht ar ais anseo anocht chun an cheist seo a phlé liom ná chun go dtabharfainn seans don Aire eolas <Col N="1448" /> cruinn ceart a thabhairt don Teach so anocht faoin scéim seo agus faoin polasaí atá ag a Roinn i leith na gcúrsaí tré Gaeilge ins na coláistí reigiunacha agus chun deireadh a chur leis an dallamullóg atá ag dul ar aghaidh nó a bhí ag dul ar aghaidh go dtí seo faoin scéim seo.</P>
    <P>Tá fearg mhór ar na múinteoirí agus ar na scoláirí faoin cheist seo ar fad go dtí seo agus ní dhéanfaidh sé aon mhaitheas don Ghaeilge, do chúis na Gaeilge nó don Ghaeltacht. Tuigim go bhfuil an tAire daíríre ina iarrachtaí chun feabhas a chur ar an scéal san Ghaeltacht agus chun an Ghaeilge a chur ar aghaidh.  Is ionadh liomsa nach raibh sé in ann an t-eolas seo a chur ar fáil nuair a h-iarradh uaidh é,</P>
    <P>Tá súil agam go bhfaighimid eolas faoin scéim, scéim a luadh i Mí Marta seo caite sa Dáil, scéim nach bhfuil aon eolas tugtha fós ag an Aire don choláiste seo nó d'aon choláiste eile b'fhéidir a bhéadh sásta cúrsa mar é nó cúrsa tré Ghaeilge ar aon nós a chur ar bun.  Iarraim anois ar an Aire an t-eolas san a chur ar fáil dúinn agus deireadh a chur leis na deachrachtaí a bhí ag múinteoirí agus na húdaráis i mbun gnó ins na coláistí Reigiúnacha go dtí seo mar gheall ar an scéim seo.  Ní cheapaim-se go mba chóir go mbéadh na deacrachtaí ann ar chor ar bith.  Ní cóir go mbeadh aon deacrachtaí curtha sa bhealach dóibh siúd atá ag iarraidh an Ghaeilge a chur ar aghaidh i nGaillimh ins an scoil bhreá seo agus tá an-obair á déanamh acu ins an scoil.</P>
    <P>Mar sin, tá súil agam go dtógfaidh an tAire an tseans seo atá mé ag tabhairt dó anois chun an scéal ar fad a mhíniú agus go haithríd, comh maith le eolas ar an scéal a thabhairt, a dheimniú go mbeidh na scoláireachtaí seo ar fáil don bhliain seo chugainn agus go mbeidh siad ann na blianta amach uaidh sin, gur scéim seasamhach a bhéas ann.</P>
    <P>Chomh maith leis sin ba mhaith liom iarraidh air a bhfuil fhios aige go gcosnaíonn sé suas le £12 nó £14 sa tseachtain ar na scoláirí seo fanacht i nGaillimh an fhaid is a bhíonn siad ag freastal ar an scoil le haghaidh 30 <Col N="1449" /> nó 33 seachtain sa bhliain nuair a bhíonn an coláiste oscailte agus go gcosnaíonn sé sin níos mó ná £400 orthu agus más £50 an méid a íocadh do na scoláirí go dtí seo is deacair a fheiceáil cén caoi a bhféadfadh siad maireachtáil i nGaillimh ar scoláireacht chomh beag leis sin, ar shuim chomh lú leis sin.  Cén fá go bhfuil an difríocht chomh mór san idir méid na scoláireachtaí atá Gaeltarra Éireann ag cur ar fáil, ar £700 sa bhliain, de réir an t-eolas atá faighte agamsa, cén fá go bhfuil an difríocht chomh mór san idir na scoláireachtaí atá Gaeltarra Éireann sásta íoc don ochtar a bhain iad amach agus an seachtar a bhfuair scoláireachtaí ó Roinn na Gaeltachta?  Tá difríocht de £350 idir an dá íocaíocht.  Tá an ceann ó Radio Telefís Éireann níos lú fós.</P>
    <P>Iarraim ar an Aire nach gceapann sé go mbeadh sé i bhfad níos fearr an tsuim céanna airgid a thabhairt do chuile duine acu atá ag freastal ar an gcúrsa, abair £700 don 17 scoláirí atá ag freastal ar an scoil.</P>
    <P>Sin iad na ceisteanna a theastaigh uaim a chur ar an Aire agus tá súil agam go dtabharfaidh sé eolas cruinn ceart dúinn anocht.</P>

      <P>Ba mhaith liom a rá ar dtús nach dtuigim cén fá go bhfuil an Teachta Molloy ag iarraidh rud mór a dhéanamh den scéal seo agus cén fá gur iarr sé cead an cheist a árdú ar athló na Dála mar do thug mé freagraí iomlán inniu agus ní raibh fonn ar an Teachta inniu éisteacht liom mar bhí sé ag cur isteach nuair bhí mé ag iarraidh eolas iomlán a thabhairt, ach mar sin féin tá an scéal á phlé againne anois.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Ar dtús ba mhaith liom a rá go bhfuil fonn mór ormsa mar Aire na Gaeltachta áiseanna árd oideachais a chur ar fail do mhuintir na Gaeltachta agus tá fonn mór ormsa cabhrú leo chun na háiseanna san a chur ar fáil agus chun scoláireachtaí a chur ar fáil do mhuintir na Gaeltachta. Maidir leis an gcúrsa i staidéar gnó i gCeard Coláiste Reigiún na Gaillimhe, cuireadh tús leis an gcúrsa san Fhómhair 1973 agus, mar a dúirt <Col N="1450" /> an Teachta, do thug Gaeltarra Éireann ocht scoláireachtaí.  Nuair a bhí mé ag freagairt innui cheapas agus dúirt gur sé a bhí ann ach tá an tuarascáil ó choiste an choláiste anseo agam agus feicim gur thug Gaeltarra Éireann, agus le airgead ón Roinnse, ocht scoláireachtaí ar £700 faoin bhliain.  Chomh maith leis sin bhí coinníollacha eile ann go dtabharfadh Gaeltarra Éireann post sa Ghaeltacht do sealbhóirí na scoláireachtaí sin ag deireadh a gcúrsa agus chomh maith leis sin go mbeadh obair le Gaeltarra le linn a laetheanta saoire sa tsamhraidh ag na mic léinn san.  Sin ocht scoláireachtaí ar £700.</P>
    <P>Nuair cuireadh tús leis an gcúrsa san sa scoilbhliain agus nuair a bhí téarma na scoláireachtaí sin ó Ghaeltarra Éireann socraithe, d'iarr coiste an choláiste ar mo Roinnse scoláireachtaí breise a chur ar fail.  Mar a dúras inniu, do cuireadh seacht scoláireachtaí ar fáil agus iocadh an t-airgead, £282 an ceann, i mí na Márta so caite.  Tá scoláireachtaí ó Roinn na Gaeltachta ar aon dul le scoláireachtaí na Roinne Oideachais. Bhí na socraithe sin i rith na bliana caite mar <i>ad hoc</i> nó sealadach.</P>
    <P>Mar a dúras inniu, chuireamar 12 scoláireachtaí ar fáil, ach ni raibh gá ach le seacht.  D'íocamar an t-airgead i Mí Márta, agus nuair a bhíomar ag plé cúrsaí Gaeilge agus cúrsaí Gaeltachta chuir mé in iúl don Dáil go raibh mé ag obair chun scéim nua do chúrsaí tré Ghaeilge ní amháin do Choláiste Réigiúnach na Gaillimhe ach do gach coláiste réigiúnach a bhéadh sásta cúrsaí tré Ghaeilge a chur ar fáil.</P>
    <P>Mar is eol don Teachta mar iar Aire, maidir le aon scéim nua, go háirithe nuair a bhaineann an scéim sin le Ranna agus le hAirí eile&mdash; bhain an scéim seo leis an Aire Airgeadais agus leis an Aire Oideachais &mdash;caithfear dul i gcomhairle leis na hAirí sin.  Sin mar a dheineas sa chás seo.  Bhí mé ag iarraigh scéim sásúil seasmhach a chur ar fáil do na coláistí reigiúnacha do chursaí tré Ghaeilge.  Do thóg sin tamall maith. Bhí comhfhreagras agus idirbheartíocht ar siúl.  Tá dul chun chinn déanta, ach ag ullmhú scéim mar seo <Col N="1451" /> bhíos ag súil b'fhéidir go mbeadh cúrsaí tré Ghaeilge ar siúl ins na coláistí réigiúnacha eile agus b'fhéidir go mbeadh cúrsaí eile tré Ghaeilge ar siúl i gColáiste Réigiúnach na Gaillimhe. Ach tuigim anois ón eolas atá ag mo Roinnse nach mbeidh aon chúrsaí eile tré Ghaeilge le fáil sa bhliain seo chugainn&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>&mdash;&mdash;ach amháin an cúrsa gnó stáidéar i gColáiste Reigiúnach na Gaillimhe.  Tá an chéad bhliain críochnaithe ag an seachtar scoláirí ansin agus ag an ochtar atá ar scoláireachtaí ó Ghaeltarra Éireann.  Tá súil agam gur éirigh leis na mic léinn sin sna scrúducháin ag deireadh na bliana.  Beidh na scoláireachtaí ar fáil don 15 mic léinn sin don bhliain 1974-75.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Chomh maith le sin, mar a dúras inniu tá mé ag ullmhú scéim ginearálta seasmhach agus beidh fógra ag dul amach do na coláistí réigiúnacha go léir i gceann coicíse.  Bíonn fonn ormsa admháil i gcónaí nuair a bhíonn deacrachtaí ann.  Admháim go mbeadh sé níos sásúla dá mbeadh ar mo chumas an scéim sin a bheith ullamh roimhe seo.  Admháim go raibh deacrachtaí ann os rud é gur scéim nua í agus gurb é seo an chéad chúrsa dá leithéid seo a bhí ar fáil riamh.  Tá <Col N="1452" /> súil agam go mbeidh cúrsaí tré Ghaeilge ar siúl ní amháin i gColáiste Réigiúnach na Gaillimhe ach sna coláistí réigiúnacha eile, go háirithe na coláistí atá ar imeall cheanntair na Gaeltachta cosúil le Coláiste Réigiúnach na Gaillimhe.  Sa tuarascáil is déanaí atá curtha amach ag Coiste Choláiste Teicneolaíochta Réigiúnach na Gaillimhe tugtar líon na n-iarratasóirí don chúrsa gnó staidéar.  Ó Ghaeltacht na Gaillimhe bhí 31; ó Mhuigheó bhí 14; ó Ghaeltacht Chiarraí bhí naonúr; ó Ghaeltacht Dhún na nGall ní raibh ach ochtar, agus ó Ghaeltacht Chorcaí ní raibh ach duine amháin.</P>
    <P>B'fhéidir go mbeidh na coláistí réigiúnacha eile in ann cúrsaí tré Ghaeilge a chur ar fáil, go háirithe cúrsaí a bheidh oiriúnach do mhic léinn a bheadh ag filleadh ar ais go dtí an Ghaeltacht chun postanna a thógaint ins na monarcain agus ins na tionscail eile atá ar siúl ar fud na Gaeltachta.  Tá géar-ghá le daoine go bhfuil cáilíocht acu i gnó stáidear agus bainistíocht.  Tá fonn ormsa gach rud is féidir liom a dhéanamh a chur i gcrích chun cúrsaí oiriúnacha a chur ar fáil.  Admháin go raibh moill leis an scéim nua ar na fáthanna a luaih mé, ach beidh an fógra ag dul amach i gceann coicíse.</P>

      <P>Gortbofearna NS is a small two-teacher school, in poor condition and with inadequate sanitary facilities. It is proposed to amalgamate the school with Inagh NS early in the coming school year and the provision of additional accommodation for this purpose at Inagh is being authorised. The amalgamated school will have a staff of five teachers and this will enable an improved educational programme to be provided for all the children.</P>
