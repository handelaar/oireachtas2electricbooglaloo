      <P>The original net Estimate for the period 1st April, 1974, to 31st December, 1974, was £14,981,000. The Supplementary Estimate now required is £3,060,000 and is necessary to meet increases in the cost of the services rendered by the Office of Public Works.</P>
      <P>The gross additional amount required, £3,549,000, is offset partly by an estimated increase in Appropriations-in-Aid and partly by estimated savings on certain subheads of the Vote, leaving a net requirement of £3,060,000.</P>
      <P>The main item in the Supplementary Estimate is the additional sum of £2,470,000 required under subhead E for the building of national schools.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On 5th November, 1974, when I was concluding the debate on the original Estimate for Public Works <Col N="195" /> and Buildings, I said that expenditure from State funds in the current nine months would be in excess of £6,500,000.  I am happy to say now that it has been found possible to allocate a further £1 million to maintain the rapid rate of progress with this very important programme. Since I came into office, progress on this service has accelerated; expenditure for the nine months, April to December, 1972, was £2,776,000 and for the same period in 1973 it was £4,838,000.  The £7,500,000 being provided for the current nine months, therefore, represents a vast increase on previous rates of expenditure, even when allowance is made for higher building costs, and it shows the level of commitment to the programme for the provision of special schools for the handicapped, the speedy provision of schools in new housing areas and the improvement of accommodation in other areas where existing schools are below modern standards.</P>
    <P>Other increases under this subhead, amounting to £91,000, are due mainly to faster progress by contractors than had been expected.  I might mention two projects in particular &mdash; the restoration of the picture gallery wing at Kilkenny Castle and the provision of a visitor centre at Dunmore Cave. I am very glad to report also that good progress is being made with the new offices for the Department of Lands as Castlebar.  More money is needed for the provision of multipurpose ship facilities at Dún Laoghaire harbour.  This work was expected to commence last year but had to be deferred to fit in with British Railways' arrangements at Holyhead. Consequently, a greater portion of the work than had been envisaged had to be done this year.</P>
    <P>The other subheads for which additional amounts are required are B, Travelling and Incidental Expenses, £15,000; F.1, Maintenance and Supplies, £133,000; F.2, Furniture <i>et cetera</i>, £166,000; F.3, Rents, Rates <i>et cetera</i>, £350,000; F.4, Fuel, Light <i>et cetera</i>, £270,000; F.5, Compensation in respect of damage to property of external Governments, £30,000; H, <Col N="196" /> Purchase and maintenance of engineering plant, machinery and stores, £9,000 and J.2, conservation and Restoration of Holycross Abbey &mdash;Grant-in-Aid, £15,000.</P>
    <P>Increased costs have made their impact on most of these subheads but there are a number of other factors contributing to the additional expenditure which I shall mention briefly.</P>
    <P>The increase under subhead B is due partly to an increase in the rates payable for travelling and subsistence and partly to the increased amount of travelling abroad necessary in connection with new embassy premises.</P>
    <P>Subhead F.1 covers the cost of maintaining State property and better progress than had been expected has been achieved in the current nine months.</P>
    <P>In the case of subhead F.2 heavier expenditure than had been expected was incurred due to increased demands which had to be met.</P>
    <P>The additional sum required for subhead F.3 is due partly to the need to rent additional accommodation to house staff in this country and for embassies abroad where another factor has been the changes in the value of sterling in relation to other currencies.</P>
    <P>The increase under subhead F.5 is due to the fact that rehabilitation work on the former British Embassy building is proceeding more rapidly and is proving more costly than expected and that bomb damage to French Government property in Kildare Street in May, 1974, has to be made good.</P>
    <P>Additional receipts of £260,000 are forecast under subhead K, Appropriations-in-Aid, due to increased buoyancy under a number of headings.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RaymondMacSharry" hpid="Mr. MacSharry Mr. MacSharry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacSharry</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with this additional Supplementary Estimate but there are a few questions that I would like to put to the Parliamentary Secretary.  First, can he say how many new schools will be provided as a result of this extra allocation of money or is the increase merely to cover inflation?  Also, what progress has been made to date on the offices <Col N="197" /> in Castlebar and how soon may we expect these premises to be occupied by personnel from the Department of Lands?</P>
      <P>The Parliamentary Secretary says that an additional sum of £2,470,000 is being made available for the building of national schools but later he says that a further £1 million is being allocated to maintain the rapid rate of progress in this very important programme. What is the other £1,470,000 for?</P>
      <P>When additional moneys are being made available for the Office of Public Works one is disappointed to find that no additional funds are being made available for some very important works carried out by that office.  Many Deputies, including myself, asked the Parliamentary Secretary to make more funds available this year for arterial drainage, coastal protection and other important work.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Kenny Mr. Kenny">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kenny</NameTxt>
      <P>The first matter that comes to mind is that which, for me, is nearer home.  I refer to the buildings at Castlebar which are to be used for the accommodation of personnel from the Department of Lands.  A fortnight ago I visited the site in question accompanied by some of the engineers concerned.  Work is progressing rapidly but on the day of my visit the place looked rather muddy as would any building site on what was very wet day.  I have been informed that it will be about a year before the premises will be occupied.</P>
      <P>I have not got the information as to the number of schools that will be built during the coming year but I shall let the Deputy have the information as soon as it is available to me.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RaymondMacSharry" hpid="Mr. MacSharry Mr. MacSharry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacSharry</NameTxt>
      <P>Will there be any additional schools built with the extra money?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Kenny Mr. Kenny">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kenny</NameTxt>
      <P>The extra money would not be given for that section.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>What about Beaumont?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Kenny Mr. Kenny">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kenny</NameTxt>
      <P>I shall talk with the Deputy in a moment.  Let Dublin wait while we, from the west, have our conversation.  I could not tell Deputy <Col N="198" /> MacSharry yet how many new schools will be built during the coming year but if an extra £1 million is allocated it should be spent for the purpose for which it is allocated&mdash;the building of national schools and of special schools for retarded children.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>The Parliamentary Secretary will appreciate that the additional money being provided here for schools could be absorbed in the main on the existing programme.  It is important to know whether this money will provide an additional number of schools.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Kenny Mr. Kenny">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kenny</NameTxt>
      <P>That is a question that I could not possibly answer yet because we do not know what increases there will be in costs.  If the money must be spent in covering increased building costs, no new extra schools can be built unless I can get another allocation of money.</P>
      <P>Regarding the Beaumont school, I told Deputy Haughey yesterday what he should do in that regard.  Time can be wasted by the contractor at the beginning of the period in the same way as it can be wasted at the end by him.  I shall ask the contractor to have the work executed as expeditiously as possible.  However, the matter is in the hands of the manager and of the three Deputies from the area.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">

  <MainHeading Type="GD" LHead="Local Loans Fund (Amendment) Bill, 1974:" RHead="Second and Subsequent Stages">
    <Title>Local Loans Fund (Amendment) Bill, 1974: Second and Subsequent Stages.</Title>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Minister for Finance (Mr. R. Ryan) Richie Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. R. Ryan)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="200" /> The purpose of this Bill is to increase, from £600 million to £1,000 million, the statutory limit on issues from the Local Loans Fund through which Exchequer loans are made available to local authorities to finance essential capital services.</P>
    <P>When the Local Loans Fund was established in 1935, a statutory limit of £5 million was set on issues from the fund.  The limit has had to be increased periodically over the years by successive enactments.  The present figure of £600 million was fixed in 1972.</P>
    <P>For many years the local authorities, including regional health boards, vocational educational committees and harbour authorities, have been heavily dependent on this fund to finance their capital projects.  In 1973-74, over 90 per cent of the authorities' capital expenditure was met from the fund. At 31st March, 1974, total issues from the fund amounted to £498 million, of which £383 million, or 77 per cent of the total, was provided for housing, including £245 million for the building of local authority dwellings, £109 million for private house purchase loans and over £28 million for supplementary housing grants.  Water supply and sewerage schemes accounted for a further £69 million, while the balance of £46 million was provided for hospitals, vocational schools, harbour works, libraries, fire stations, swimming pools and other amenities.</P>
    <P>Issues from the fund have increased dramatically in recent years, due partly to the expanded capital programme carried out by the local authorities and partly to rising costs. The annual total has risen from £49 million in 1972-3 to an estimated £98 million in 1974-5.  In that period annual advances from the fund for local authority dwellings have risen million, largely reflecting the progress being made towards achieving the Government's target of 8,000 local authority dwellings per year.  Issues for house purchase loans have risen even more rapidly in the same period, that is, from £8 million to £34 million. A significant rise in the demand for these loans was to be expected following <Col N="201" /> the stepping-up of the national housing programme to 25,000 dwellings a year; the demand has been accentuated by the increases approved in 1973 in the maximum loans and income limits for borrowers and by the unwelcome downturn in the availability of mortgage finance from the building societies which had become the major source of house purchase loans in recent years.  Annual issues for water and sewerage schemes have risen in the two years from £8 million to an estimated £15 million to meet the expanded needs of both housing and industry.</P>
    <P>An estimated £75 million is to be provided from the fund in the current nine-month financial period, bringing total issues to over £570 million by 31st December, 1974.  Since the annual rate of issues is now about £100 million, the present limit of £600 million is expected to be reached in the early part of next year.  It will be necessary to raise the limit substantially to provide for the estimated capital requirements of the local authorities over the next few years.  Accordingly a new limit of £1,000 million is proposed in the Bill which I commend to the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>We support this measure.  I suppose it is an indication of the extent to which inflation has gripped our economy that after two years the Minister is obliged to come here with a proposal to increase the maximum figure allowable by £400 million, whereas the previous increase after a period of four years raised the maximum limit by £200 million.  Some of the increase, of course, is explained by increased activity but there is no doubt that the bulk of the very substantial increase involved is explained by inflation and anticipated inflation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The bulk of the money involved here, approximately 75 per cent, is devoted to housing requirements in one form or another as the Minister indicated.  In particular, the provision of money for SDA loans is involved here and I would again urge the Minister to look again at the limits applied.  I say &ldquo;again&rdquo; because members of my party from time to time have urged the Minister and his colleagues <Col N="202" /> to review the limits being applied in the case of SDA loans.  The existing limits are £2,350 as an upper income limit and £4,500 as an upper loan limit.  These were set in September, 1973 and it is clear to most people that these limits are now unrealistic.</P>
    <P>The Minister may say that the number of applications has increased and this is true but he has given the explanation in what he has just told us.  Quoting from memory, he mentioned the unwelcome decline in the moneys available from building societies which had been the main source of supply of money for housing loans.  I do not want to discuss why this is so but it is a fact acknowledged all round and acknowledged by the Minister today that there has been a drop in the availability of money from building societies.  That being so, the demand for SDA loans is increasing. In practice, because this is the only source from which people can get loans in many cases, people are applying for them, getting the maximum loan and finding that it does not go anywhere near the amount they require and they are having to borrow in addition from other sources, usually at quite high rates of interest.</P>
    <P>The position is becoming quite impossible for a number of would-be house purchasers.  Not alone is hardship being imposed on them but the consequential effect on employment in the building industry is quite noticeable.  The Minister and his colleagues&mdash;particularly recently in the White Paper&mdash;have proclaimed that one of the primary objectives of Government policy at this time is the maintenance of employment.  I urge very strongly that if there is to be any substance in that aim, if it is to be any more than empty phrases, he must take action to ensure in conjunction with his colleague, the Minister for Local Government, that these limits I have mentioned are increased. We strongly urge that the income limit be raised to £3,000 and the loan limit to £6,000.  This is not unreasonable in present circumstances.  I would strongly urge the Minister to consider <Col N="203" /> this action and to consider it quickly if he wants to take one practical step towards trying to maintain employment.</P>
    <P>Perhaps the Minister would give me a little information on the following matter.  I see in table 5 of the capital budget for 1974 that the estimate of the amount to be provided for the Local Loans Fund from capital repayments and Exchequer advances for 1974-75 is £86.55 million and for the nine-months' period April to December, 1974, it is estimated at £66.13 million.  Could the Minister inform us whether those estimated limits are being increased or reduced and whether the authorisation sought in this Bill for increasing the overall limit on the Local Loans Fund will contribute to making available more money for the Local Loans Fund than was provided for in the estimates I have referred to?  I imagine the Minister will have that information offhand.  If not, I would ask that he furnish it to me in due course.</P>
    <P>Subject to the remarks I have made, to which I hope the Minister will pay some attention, we have no objection to and, in fact, support strongly this measure.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TomEnright" hpid="Mr. Enright Mr. Enright">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Enright</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to welcome this Bill.  The work being done by local authorities in providing loans for people to build their own houses is highly important.  I compliment the Minister for providing the necessary finance to the local authorities to enable this work to be carried out.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The present limit of £4,500 could be increased but I would take this opportunity of saying here, as somebody with some practical experience, that people are able to build bungalows and two-storey houses, but especially bungalows, either by employing local small building contractors or through direct labour with the loan of £4,500. While it is not over-generous, it is certainly sufficient to enable the work to be carried out.  It is important that this should be said in this House. <Col N="204" /> Good small building contractors&mdash;and there are a great many of them throughout the country&mdash;are able to provide good substantial bungalows, excellent houses, for young married couples who avail of the local authority loans.  My reason for saying this is that many large builders in this city and throughout the country are saying that the loans are not sufficient.  I believe that if a builder is prepared to take a reasonable margin of profit this loan, together with the grants, is sufficient to provide a good substantial house for a young married couple.</P>
    <P>There has been a lot of criticism of the amount of the loan.  I believe it is reasonable and fair.  With prices increasing as they are, the loans may have to be looked at and the Minister should consider looking at them now to see whether they can be increased. However, good houses are being built at present with this loan of £4,500, together with the grants that are available.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>

    <P>I would ask the Minister to communicate with local authorities and encourage them to allocate a certain amount of money each year to enable people with an income of under £2,350 to purchase secondhand houses. At present a person who is under this <Col N="205" /> limit may find a house going at a reasonable price and would be in a position to pay a small deposit.  He may not have money invested and so will not be considered by a building society.  Such a person would be anxious to obtain a county council loan because of the attractive interest rates.  The Minister should set aside a certain amount to each county council for this purpose.  I am not even looking for a large amount.  If the Minister wishes to have a stipulation that such people obtaining loans should be married with a family I would go along with it, but it is essential that local authorities should have some power to enable secondhand houses to be bought.</P>

      <P>I am pleased to see that large amounts of money continue to be provided for water and sewerage facilities. It is absolutely essential that the Government ensure that water supplies are improved.  In many of our larger towns there are serious water supply problems and as large an amount of money as possible should be provided for water supply, because this will have beneficial effects on many different aspects of our life&mdash;housing, schools, industries and so on.</P>
      <P>Our main roads are excellent but there should be increased allocations for secondary routes and smaller roads. Very good work is being carried out by the local authorities but extra money is needed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MylesStaunton" hpid="Mr. Staunton Mr. Staunton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Staunton</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister's speech and the new limit of £1,000 million which he is introducing in it.  It should give increased confidence to local authorities in regard to the availability of finance in these times of rampant inflation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are some aspects of local authority developments to which I <Col N="206" /> would like to refer.  I refer particularly, as Deputy Colley and Deputy Enright did, to the question of housing, house purchase loans and income levels. Reading the Minister's speech one gathers that the most dramatic increase has been in the area of house purchase loans.  Between 1972-73 and 1974-75, a brief spell of two years, the increase in house purchase loans was from £8 million to £34 million.  I welcome this particularly.  Indeed, it has been my experience as a member of the local authority that until relatively recently there were a great many people who were not even aware of the fact that such loans were available from the local authorities.  There is much greater appreciation of this at present as these figures illustrate.</P>
    <P>However, consideration must be given to the possibility of increasing the limit which at present stands at £4,500.  Compared with what the position was two years ago, it may seem a considerable amount of money, but taking the present rate of inflation into account, particularly in the building industry, which is affected by timber and labour costs, a case can be made for increasing this sum past this point.  I can agree with Deputy Enright's point about the cheaper building costs in certain areas.  This I found to be absolutely true, but I take Deputy Colley's point that in the cities there is an entirely different situation.  It is true that it is in the smaller areas one gets vast differences in costs and in contract prices between the smaller country builders and many of the larger companies, and I have seen houses built quite cheaply in these times and under the circumstances which he described.</P>
    <P>The house purchase loans scheme is vitally necessary in rural districts.  The Minister referred to the building society problem and the restraints and restrictions that have existed in that area.  There is another problem as well, and it is tied up with the income limits of local authorities for housing loans.  I would welcome an increase here, too, for a particular reason: it is possible that taking the present income limit into account people earning above that limit may <Col N="207" /> in theory be in a position to obtain loans from building societies, but you find in rural Ireland that outside urban areas of certain population sizes building societies will not lend money to applicants regardless of income level and regardless of the capacity to repay loans.  Therefore that factor should be taken into account, and I would welcome an increase in the income limit in addition to an increase in the amount of capital which might be made available to individual applicants.</P>
    <P>There are one or two points regarding the administration of the fund to which I would like to refer briefly, in the areas mentioned by the Minister, the areas of housing loans, water and sewerage schemes.  There has been much comment about what is termed undue centralisation, with which I agree completely.  But it has been my experience that this is nowhere more evident than in the simplest administrative details of housing, water and sewerage loans where we get the most appalling bureaucracy, where the tiniest loans amounting to £150 and up to £300 go through a mass of documentation, a great deal of which is entirely unnecessary.  A farmer requiring a water and sewerage loan for, say, £150 must apply to the Department in Dublin to send him an application form, which he completes and returns to that Department.  The Department, in turn, communicate with their inspector to call to look at the scheme.  The inspector recommunicates with his Department. The applicant, when the job is partly completed, informs the Department who again communicate with the inspector, who inspects the first stage of the operation, for example, in a new house situation, and recommunicates with his Department, when the applicant gets the first stage of the local authority grant from the Department. The Department, in turn, notify the local authority that the first stage of the grant has been paid, and the local authority then pays the applicant the supplementary section of the grant. All of this operation is duplicated at the final stage of work, leading to the most appalling amount of bureaucracy.</P>

      <P>I take your point and I apologise if I have digressed. Might I finally add that all the administration concerned with the mundane matters I have described could be carried out entirely within the local authorities?  There is not much more I wish to say other than, broadly speaking, that our county councils have increased functions.  This increase in the availability of capital should give encouragement in this area.  The traditional role of our county councils has been fairly negative, and it was only the implementation of the Local Government (Planning and Development) Act of five or six years ago which gave local authorities, if they chose to be enlightened and positive in approach, the opportunity of playing a fundamental role, a role they simply did not have the opportunity of playing up to that point.  Some of our county councils had been fairly enlightened in taking a positive role within a particular area.  County Mayo, due to enlightened manage-ment among other things, assumed powers beyond the traditional and fairly negative role.  This new concept of a county council as a development corporation with all the problems that exist throughout the country because of dramatic developments necessitating a change into urban centres from what were traditionally rural societies is posting problems and the confidence which should be instilled into local authorities as a result of this particular fund increase is most welcome.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the House for the manner in which they have received this Bill.  I appreciate that people are, of course, all too anxious that the State would maintain the supply of money for essential purposes. They may be assured of this Government's determination to provide money for the very necessary expenditures financed from the Local Loans Fund.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="209" /> I can sympathise with those who have asked for increases in the income limits for housing purposes.  That is something at which we shall continue to take an on-going sympathetic look, but it must be realized that, if the limits rise, the State will be required to pay more money from this fund and, as the fund is very heavily subsidised by the Exchequer, which naturally means the general body of taxpayers, it is only right that we should ensure that money advanced for housing purposes should go to the most necessitous in the community.  A system which would make money available from this fund&mdash;a system I believe which would be quite wrong and one which nobody here would favour&mdash;which has to be subsidised so heavily by the general body of tax-payers could not be countenanced.</P>
    <P>An indication of the size of the subsidy can be seen from the figures.  The rate of interest charged by the State on advances from the fund is 10 per cent and 10 per cent is well below the rate of interest the State has to pay on money it borrows.  That rate may vary from 12½ per cent to 16 per cent depending upon the length of the period for which the money is lent. It will be seen from this that there is a very massive subsidy given to those who borrow from this fund when the State is re-lending the money it borrows so dearly.  Local authorities invariably re-lend the money for housing purposes at 1/2 per cent higher than the rate at which they borrow it.  That means the borrowing rate is 10½ per cent, which is extraordinarily generous having regard to current interest rates here and generally throughout the world.</P>
    <P>In respect of interest rates, it is very important that we should appreciate that the prime lending rate here is the lowest in Europe.  The cost of money is determined not by any domestic situation operating in a local environment but rather by the situation in the open market and it is in our interest to borrow in that open market.  The rate of interest is determined by world trends in the markets in which we ordinarily deal.  The prime lending rate here is 11¾ per <Col N="210" /> cent against a rate of 13 per cent and 14 per cent in Britain, 12 per cent in Denmark, 14½ per cent in France, 12 per cent in Germany, 18½ per cent in Italy and 12 per cent in the Netherlands. In the USA the prime lending rate is beginning to fall, but it rose at an exceptionally rapid rate over the last few years, during which time the lending rate from the Local Loans Fund was kept comparatively stable.</P>
    <P>In 1972, when the prime lending rate here was 7½ per cent, the interest rate charged on advances from the fund was 1 per cent higher, namely 8½ per cent.  In December, 1973, when the prime lending rate was 12½ per cent, the rate at which money was available to the Local Loans Fund was 9 per cent.  Today it is 11¾ per cent; the rate of interest charged on money from the fund is only 10 per cent.  Subsidies are extremely costly and, as I have emphasised, they can only be paid for by the community at large.  We have, therefore, to reserve the funds for those people who require maximum help.  That has been the policy of this Government.  It will continue to be our policy.</P>
    <P>Having said that, I reiterate that we will of course continue to consider sympathetically the need to increase the income limit but, as things stand, we have to bear in mind that increasing the income limit may increase the demand upon funds which are both very scarce and very dear.</P>
    <P>Deputy Colley suggested that the principal reason for the increased allocations from the fund was inflation. That is not so.  Certainly inflation is having some effect because it requires a greater amount of money to produce the same quantity of houses and sanitary services, vocational schools and so on; but the principal reason for our having to come back to Dáil Éireann shortly over two years since the last occasion has been the massive increase in the number of houses now being financed from the Local Loans Fund and the very significant increases in the amount of money made available for the necessary infrastructure.  One of the reasons why housing sites have been so dear and why the cost of sites has escalated far beyond rises in living <Col N="211" /> costs and construction costs has been due to the gross neglect for many years of the necessary infrastructure.  We have changed that policy.  We have accepted the absolute necessity of providing very substantial improvements in water supplies and sanitary services. The reflection of that can be found in the increases given for sanitary services. In 1972-1973 the allocation was £7.71 million.  For the current year it is £14.6 million.  That is a most significant increase. Had it not been granted many of our housing problems would remain unsolved and housing development would be delayed in the way in which the construction of houses used be delayed because of lack of essential facilities.</P>
    <P>When we were in Opposition we severely criticised the Government for their failure to provide the funds necessary for local authority housing, housing essential for the least advantaged people in our community.  That Government deliberately reduced the volume of local authority housing, leaving the main burden of providing new dwellings on the private sector. We appreciate the importance of the private sector in housing and we have shown our appreciation by the very substantial assistance we have given to the private sector.  We have, however, accepted as an obligation the need to provide additional money for local authority housing.  The result is that, in a two-year period, the allocation for local authority housing has risen from £25 million in 1972-73 to just £40 million in the current year.  This, of course, has produced a substantial number of local authority houses.</P>
    <P>On the house purchase loans front for a variety of reasons, not all associated with the temporary difficulties of societies, the allocation for house purchase loans under the local authority SDA schemes has risen from £8 million in 1972-73 to almost £34 million in the current year.  These figures are much greater than any increased costs in the construction industry and are clear evidence of the Government's determination to use the funds at their disposal to assist the community in the provision of necessary housing.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="212" /> In the period I talk about, the number of new dwellings being built has risen from 15,000 to 25,000 houses per annum.  This, in itself, has meant that, while in 1972 the Government of the day expected that it would be four years before it would be necessary to return to the Dáil for an increase in the Local Loans Fund, we have used up the money which was then expected to last a four-year period in two years, and that is why we are back now looking for this substantial increase.</P>
    <P>We consider it to be warranted and, if the Bill were not to pass, there would be difficulties early in 1975 in providing the necessary houses for the ongoing programme of massive capital investment for very necessary social and economic purposes.  Not only are we providing houses because of the social and humanitarian obligation of doing so but because they are a very necessary part of the industrial development which is critically important for the maintenance of employment and also, of course, for the increase in the number of jobs which we must have if unemployment is not to grow.</P>
    <P>Deputy Colley asked me about the capital budget.  Subject to verification &mdash;and I am sure he will accept that it is not always possible to produce the instant answer&mdash;the figures, I understand, are as follows: for the 1974-75 12-months' period, the allocation is £98.55 million which includes an increase of £12 million for the small dwellings.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Enright mentioned the water supply position.  I have already given the figures which show a very substantial increase in the allocation from the fund for water supplies and sewerage services from £7.71 million in 1972-73 to £14.6 million in 1974-75. Deputy Enright also mentioned the <Col N="213" /> question of the provision of the necessary funds for road and local improvement schemes.  I appreciate his desire for increased allocations for these items.  The Government have increased very substantially the allocations for these items but the allocations are not made from the Local Loans Fund.  He may be assured that we will be very anxious to maintain the improvement in these sectors as well as in the ones which are financed from the Local Loans Fund.</P>
    <P>I hope that deals with most of the questions which were raised.  I have some figures which may be of interest to Deputy Staunton.  The demand for SDA loans in June last year was £29 million and currently it is £56 million. Deputy Staunton and others complained about the delay in the processing of applications for loans.  As the Ceann Comhairle pointed out, the processing of these matters is the responsibility of other Ministers.</P>

      <P>I take the Deputy's point.  It is frustrating but, as the Deputy is aware, in Government we have been anxious to devolve responsibility to local authorities.  The Minister for Local Government has done this in quite a number of sectors.  This is highly desirable.  I am not at all satisfied that much of the duplication has resulted in savings.  In fact, sometimes some of these delays have inflated costs because costs have risen during the period of delay.  We are very anxious indeed to avoid many of these delays in future.  The responsibility of the Department of Finance arises only when the details have been ironed out.  We can well understand the annoyance and frustration which must arise along the line.  I had the privilege of being a member of a local authority for many years and I was at the receiving end of the frustrations for a long time.  Deputies may be assured of my personal commitment <Col N="214" /> to eradicate as far as possible administrative frustrations and delay.</P>

      <P>It is necessary, I should explain, to move this motion, because the amendments I am putting forward on Committee Stage depart somewhat from the original legislation put before the House in that they specifically deal with the problems of a transfer of engagements and amalgamations relating to the unions which are controlled or have executives outside the country.  That is why the motion is necessary.  It is to ensure that the 18 foreign-based unions with executive control outside the country, fulfil the requirement of having a controlling executive situated within any of the 32 counties.  Our legislation is now directed to ensure that this, in fact, comes about.  We must pass legislation to deal with this new dimension.

It might strike Deputies as odd that the trade unions should find it difficult to know who were members but there are differing rules and different interpretations in various unions about the standing of particular members. To date there has been more litigation than is desirable to determine who had the standing of a member of a trade union.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It was indicated during these discussions that union rules provided for a continuation of membership even though the member concerned had, perhaps, failed to pay his dues for a period and had become what is known <Col N="218" /> as a non-benefit member or a member in arrears.  In some cases, the exclusion of a member in arrears requires under union rules a notification to be sent to that member by registered post.  This has already given rise to a number of difficulties where the address of a member was not known to those who were anxious to communicate with him or her.  To overcome these difficulties this amendment provides that for the purposes of sections 3 and 4 a &ldquo;member&rdquo; will be defined as a member in good standing with his union and that where the rules of a trade union specify the persons entitled to vote on a question, members means those persons.</P>
    <P>In other words, it was to rid the ensuing legislation of ambiguity about the status of a member that this amendment was considered necessary. The existing situation is one that is liable to give rise to a good deal of dissension in terms of the later provisions of this legislation for amalgamation or a transfer of engagements, if there was this fundamental confusion about who was entitled to vote or what was the standing of a trade union member.  In such circumstances we could foresee extraordinary legal difficulties, defeating the whole purpose of the legislation.</P>
    <P>In discussions with the trade unions we arrived at this definition of who was a member and to clear the way for the further action contemplated in the legislation this was necessary.</P>

      <P>Did the Minister consider the question of dual membership, a person being a member of two unions?  There are people who are members of two unions and I should like to know if they would be entitled to participate both ways.  Would they be entitled to participate at meetings of the two unions?  There is a weakness at a later stage in relation to voting procedure which could mean that a simple majority, as indicated by the Minister as being desirable in section 5, might not be all that satisfactory if those with dual membership were allowed to participate. There is also the question of out of trade members.  In some unions such <Col N="219" /> members are allowed to participate in voting procedures while in others they are not.</P>

      <P>If the union in its rules, and these differ according to various unions, states what is a &ldquo;member in good standing&rdquo; that should be the definition of a &ldquo;member in good standing&rdquo;.  That seems to be the simplest and best way to get out of the ruck of controversy and dissension there is in this field.  That is what we have done in this amendment.</P>

      <P>I am sure the Minister can recall the court case involving two unions some years ago.  In that case a man sought election to a post in a union but the union informed him that he was not a member. From memory the unions involved were the Seamen's Union and the Marine Port and General Workers' Union.  The court ruled that this man was not eligible to stand for election.  Had there been a simple definition there it would have saved the unions a lot of time and money.  Generally speaking, if one is eight weeks in arrears of payment of union dues one is debarred from membership.</P>

      <P>I am sure the Deputy can see that this is an area in which one could be in difficulties forever in deciding the qualities of a good member and the criteria.  The amendment leaves this definition to the union rules.  We are concerned with the amalgamation and transfer of engagements, how to get different unions to come together, how to remove legal difficulties from the path of those who wish to come together and that is why we put in that the definition of a &ldquo;member of good standing&rdquo; be that of the union concerned.</P>

      <P>I see a weakness here. &ldquo;Good standing&rdquo; is very broad.  If a member of a union objected to another member on the grounds of &ldquo;good standing&rdquo; what evidence has to be produced by the member before he can vote?</P>

      <P>That would be a matter between the member and the executive or the ruling committee. The purpose in dealing with unions which up to now have had no executive functioning is to bring in such a functioning executive, to ensure that it comes in by order.  Obviously, a &ldquo;member of good standing&rdquo; would be a person who was so in the opinion of the governing executive or committee of the organisation he belonged to.  It would be very rash of this Legislature to think that we can go into such a detailed and contentious area and set down in statute form our opinion about the constituent parts of a &ldquo;member of good standing&rdquo;.  We have tried to let the rules of the organisation itself determine who is &ldquo;of good standing&rdquo;.</P>

      <P>The power is in the union rules.  The executives of unions do not see the necessity for any strength to be added to their own authority in this area.  This legislation gives the power, and the precedents, to the union rules concerned.  That is all we sought to do and in my view it is a common-sense approach.  The power mentioned by the Deputy is not sought by the executives.</P>

      <P>If we did as Deputy Wyse suggested we would be running into trouble on legal principles.  This is rather like club law and we have to be very careful.  This legislation does one wise thing; it recognises where there are &ldquo;property rights&rdquo;.  A member may not necessarily have a vote but he has &ldquo;a property right&rdquo; to the funds of the union.  That is a very important fundamental principle.</P>

      <P>I have sympathy with the Minister in relation to the amendment. A &ldquo;member of good standing&rdquo; is generally taken as a person in benefit or who has been in benefit for eight or ten weeks.  The question of flexibility <Col N="222" /> within the union and of an executive being able to make a decision to debar arises.  If there is no union rule covering this aspect then the executive can debar a large number of people at their own discretion by indicating what in their opinion is a &ldquo;member of good standing&rdquo;. Where this discretion or flexibility is given it can be dangerous, particularly in the case of a merger.  The Minister might consider this point later.  He should ensure that members have in their rule book a definition of a &ldquo;member of good standing&rdquo;.  Branch committees or national executives can decide and can debar people, depending on their interpretation at the time, and taking into consideration the personnel who might or might not be in difficulties with the union in relation to arrears.</P>

      <P>After subsection (2) to insert the following subsection:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(3) Two or more trade unions-shall not amalgamate unless the union with the greater or greatest number of members has a decision making executive in Ireland&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister has met this amendment <Col N="223" /> to a large extent.  I am glad he has changed his mind because on a previous occasion when we mentioned this, he did not think it likely that that aspect of the situation would evolve.  We feel it necessary that we have institutional as well as political freedom.  The attitude of trade unions on the continent, in Great Britain and elsewhere may differ very much from those here and conditions that may be acceptable to continental workers may not be acceptable to Irish workers.  We are concerned also that congresses abroad would be in no way able to dictate to trade unions here, or to executives here, as to what is best for Irish workers.  There are cases at present where foreign-based executives do dictate and have done so in the past.  We want to ensure that we have entire freedom here.  We want to ensure also that, where changes have to be made, we will not be sacrificing our trade union officials for others in London, Paris or Rome.</P>
    <P>I am glad the Minister has given an assurance which clears the air to a large extent.  I am indeed, glad he has conceded to our request.  Our amendment has been down for quite a considerable time past.  It was heartening to see the amendments put forward by the Minister taking into consideration the aspect to which I have referred.  I am certain Irish workers will be satisfied that a positive step has now been taken.  Our motion was framed in order to have a decision-making executive in Ireland, the entire island, much on the same basis as that indicated by the Minister.  We have no desire to see people being shifted from one trade union to another.  It was mentioned to me at one time that people who were members of foreign-based unions would have to join an Irish union because of the limitation of unions here catering for particular trades. There is no desire on my part&mdash;nor, I am sure, on the part of the Minister &mdash;to see a direction of trade union personnel towards completely Irish-based trade unions as against those with a decision-making executive here.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="224" /> On that basis, we welcome the Minister's assurance that the way is now clear for ensuring that we attain the institutional freedom so necessary and desirable for Irish workers, so that they may cope with their own problems and make decisions without any outside interference.</P>
    <P>The point made by Deputy Moore was in relation to the EEC.  Perhaps the Minister will touch on this when replying and let us know if there is any restriction laid down in our membership of the EEC which would in any way water down our motion or that of the Minister.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMoore" hpid="Mr. Moore Mr. Moore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moore</NameTxt>
      <P>We are back to an aspect of membership.  As the Minister is aware, at present in England there is a quarrel in a union in a certain nationalised industry where an offer of a wage increase was rejected.  The TUC in England are querying the numbers who voted in that ballot.  They point out that there were more votes cast than there were members.  The person who has been criticised for the alleged over-voting said: &ldquo;Of course, what happened was that, since we took the last roll of members, I have been very active and there are a lot of new members.&rdquo; The same thing could happen here.  Suppose that in one part of the country there were, say, a thousand members on the first of January and there was a move to amalgamate later in that year, could there be a specified date on which the membership be declared&mdash;each section of the union inside or outside the State?  For example, on such date, it would have to be declared that a union had X number of members.  We would have to ensure that that number would not suddenly increase to, say, double in an endeavour to influence a decision as to where that union should be domiciled. Could we say: &ldquo;You declare your membership as of today and that obtains for a year or two years for voting purposes.&rdquo;  For example, at an annual congress here, there might be a union which, by the card vote was entitled to so many votes but when, for example, does one alter that?  When does it increase or decrease?  Let us say that this year the transport union has a card vote of 5,000 members.  When <Col N="225" /> does that change?  Would that union be able to cast a bigger vote next year?</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnGrattanEsmonde" hpid="Mr. Esmonde Mr. Esmonde">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMoore" hpid="Mr. Moore Mr. Moore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moore</NameTxt>
      <P>No before amalgamation transpires.  Amalgamation is in sight.  Certain people might have a desire to have the union office situated in a certain place.  Could those people increase their membership and establish that they had a majority to ensure that the office was sited in Limerick, Cork, Galway, Belfast or somewhere else?</P>

      <P>It is the actual vote recorded.  For example, the union wishes to transfer its engagements.  The vote takes place there by a majority. Whether the majority is ten or 100,000 does not alter the situation we are after in this legislation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMoore" hpid="Mr. Moore Mr. Moore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moore</NameTxt>
      <P>If it was a card vote and if it was decided today for union A to have 10,000 members, how could that be altered up or down?

      <P>I know the Deputy is talking about a general difficulty often referred to in union votes when there have been queries raised about the actual accuracy of a union where the vote takes place under the auspices of a union.  But in regard to the question we are discussing here criteria are laid down both for membership and procedure of voting in this legislation.  There is ample provision also for any complaints advanced by any member who does not believe that the procedures were carried out.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are built-in guarantees in this measure on the job and function of the legislation which is to ensure that <Col N="226" /> it facilitates those organisations and unions who wish to come together.

      <NameTxt>Mr. M. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>The major portion of amendments Nos. 16 and 17 are technical consequences of amendment No. 13.  The purpose of amendment No. 13 is to provide that British based unions&mdash;the unions we are discussing&mdash;may not hold or be granted negotiation licences unless there is an executive resident in this State or in Northern Ireland with power to make decisions of an industrial or political nature arising out of the economic and political conditions of this State or Northern Ireland which do not affect members resident outside.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Dowling said he was anxious that there would be such a provision in the legislation and that is true.  I do not think that anyone who has looked at the situation in recent years has been happy with it.  Most people have expressed a desire that we should have greater control within Ireland, either North or South, of <Col N="227" /> trade union affairs by Irishmen.  This legislation is a first and necessary step in that direction.  I am glad to say it has had the assent and agreement of the trade unions in its formulation. We have sought to put in legislative form the provision of Article 2 (b) (ii) of the Constitution of the Irish Congress of Trade Unions.  That provision requires in respect of foreign-based unions that are affiliated to the congress that:</P>
    <P>The Trade Union shall provide that decisions on matters of an industrial or political nature which arise out of and are in connection with the internal economic and political conditions in Ireland and are of direct concern to Irish members only shall be considered and decided upon by Irish members provided that the decisions shall have due regard to and shall not prejudice the position of members outside Ireland.  A delegate Conference of Irish members or an Irish Committee elected by the Irish membership shall make such decisions.</P>
    <P>When this legislation was before the House on a previous occasion I remarked on the general position regarding the multiplicity of unions throughout the country.  We have almost 400,000 workers who are organised in approximately 100 separate trade unions in Ireland in comparison with West Germany, where their trade union conference represents almost 6½ million workers who are organised in 16 large industrial unions; in Denmark, where 56 trade unions cater for nearly 1 million workers; in Holland, where 64 unions represent 1½ million workers.  I pointed out that the multiplicity of unions had contributed to problems in Ireland, that the 1973 report of the ICTU showed that their disputes committees had to deal with 23 inter-union disputes. Obviously the situation needed to be dealt with.  In the past year there have been certain difficult disputes whose resolution was not assisted because the members were in different trade unions.  At the very least one might say there was an inter-union aspect to the difficulties associated with the <Col N="228" /> disputes.  This is why at the heart of this legislation there is the requirement in amendment No. 13 that some executive functions are controlled in Ireland.</P>
    <P>In the 18 foreign-based unions in the Thirty-two Counties there is a combined membership of 170,000 members affiliated to the Irish Congress of Trade Unions; they belong to unions where the executives who have controlling functions are in Britain.  Under existing trade union legislation these unions are merely required for the purposes of holding negotiation licences to:</P>
    <P>have and maintain an office within the State or shall from time to time as occasion requires give notice in writing to the Minister of the name of a person ordinarily resident in the State whom it considers suitable for accepting service of documents on its behalf.</P>
    <P>That is not a satisfactory situation. With regard to all legislation in my area, a great deal of time is consumed in discussions and consultations with the various interests and this legislation was no exception.  I continued the discussions we had been having with the trade unions on the desirability of change in this area and, arising from those many months of discussions, we succeeded in getting together the provisions as set out in amendment No. 13.  During those discussions with the trade unions it was represented that the statutory obligations of foreign-based unions should be extended so that they would be required to have a decision-taking executive resident in the Thirty-two Counties. This is what the amendment provides.</P>
    <P>It is reasonable that British-based unions should have a statutory obligation to have a decision-making executive in Ireland for the following reasons.  Persons who take decisions which affect interests of trade union members in such important areas as negotiations regarding pay and conditions in Ireland should be in close and continuous touch with the Irish situation.  Where it is the case that members of trade unions in Ireland have not a decision-making body in this country and must depend on the <Col N="229" /> decisions of an executive outside Ireland, there is the danger that such an executive deliberating on matters outside the country with responsibility for general membership, not just confined to Irish members, are unlikely to be totally aware of certain circumstances obtaining in our economic situation. The absence of Irish-based executives with power to make decisions can make for difficulties in negotiations involving foreign-based trade unions.</P>
    <P>The change as provided for in amendment No. 13 is not simply something desired by members of this administration.  It has been a long-term objective of parties in this House for many years and it is one shared by all Deputies.  I anticipate it will have the support of Members on the other side.  The amendment in the name of Deputy Dowling would be superseded by amendment No. 13. Amendments Nos. 16 and 17 are consequential on that amendment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JosephDowling" hpid="Mr. Dowling Mr. Dowling">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dowling</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister has referred to foreign-based unions affiliated to congress.  Has he considered the position of workers from Italy, France, or Germany who may come here as a result of our membership of the EEC?  What will be their position?  Will their unions be regarded as having protective rights with regard to their members working here?</P>
      <P>How would those emigrant workers fit into the general picture?  As the Minister is aware, when workers from this country go to England they must relinquish their membership of the Irish unions and accept membership of British unions before they are allowed work.  This is an unsatisfactory situation.  I would like to hear from the Minister whether he has considered the question of emigrant workers.</P>

    <P>We are basically in agreement with the other aspects covered by the Minister.  There is the serious defect concerning British-based unions who might not have a decision-making executive here and who might accept less for British workers in industry while at the same time press for higher wages for their workers here. <Col N="230" /> A concentrated effort to that effect could be made from time to time should this change not have taken place.  I am glad that the change has occurred but I would like to hear from the Minister regarding what would be the position of emigrant workers who were members of unions other than British-based ones.  We are now in a much wider field in so far as workers are concerned and I trust that the Bill will cover this change in an exacting way so as to ensure that we have the type of institutional freedom that is necessary and desirable in relation to our work force.</P>

      <P>Arising from the Minister's last remarks, I would emphasise that this Bill will not result in any rush of amalgamation of trade unions.  It is merely an enabling Bill. If unions wish to amalgamate, they may do so but there is not great encouragement for them in this regard.</P>
      <P>The Minister referred to West German workers having a small number of unions for a vast number of workers but it must be remembered that the percentage of Irish workers having trade union membership is much greater than is the case on the Continent.  This may stem from the fact that we are a nation of individualists. This Bill is some help to trade unions to amalgamate but it is not an encouragement for them to do so.  We are simply saying to them that if they wish to amalgamate the legislation is there but this cannot be regarded as encouraging amalgamation to any great extent.  Some years ago there was a move to amalgamate two of the biggest unions in the country.  I am a member of one of these and the Minister is a member of the other.  However, I have heard nothing about that since.  I understand that a wider trade union Bill will be before the House shortly and I trust that that measure will contain provisions that would encourage amalgamation of trade unions.</P>

      <P>We all appreciate what the Minister is endeavouring to do in this Bill but I do not think he is going far enough.  I maintain that a British-based union can give executive powers to an Irish union while, at the same time, insisting that the Irish union would consult at all times with the British-based union.  In that way they would be complying with the legislation although our people would have to talk with them before any decision was made.  All of us are anxious that our trade unions amalgamate so as to limit the number in so far as possible but as I see it the British-based trade unions will have the last word at all times.  I am sure the Minister can see the weakness in this regard.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Esmonde</NameTxt>
      <P>I have listened carefully to Deputy Wyse but surely we are dealing with the question of amalgamation. If a decision is made to amalgamate, that amalgamation will take place.  Deputy Dowling has mentioned other matters which are not quite relevant to amalgamation.  We cannot force people to come together. It has been a principle of Irish trade union law that everything is done by concensus of agreement.  If we introduce a little of what occurs on the Continent&mdash;a sort of legislative sanction to force people along the way&mdash; we would be acting contrary to the principle of Irish trade union law.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We must remember that this section is an enabling one for the purpose of finding an area of authority for a party that can agree when a decision must be made in relation to amalgamation. That should not be lost sight of.  This is a Bill to facilitate amalgamation not to force mergers or amalgamations. <Col N="232" /> Amalgamations must be voluntary and must emanate from the unions and their members.  The Minister has gone as far as he can in this regard.  Other matters of trade union law are for other types of legislation.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>What one must understand in this whole area is that it is not possible to use force in the interests of bringing about amalgamation. It is a contradiction to think that a unity of association can be achieved by using some kind of coercive legislation.  In the whole area of industrial relations this is one of the difficulties that one encounters in seeking the comprehension of those interests in the area.  It is not possible to use legislation to remove certain unpleasant features in this area.  It is not possible to outlaw strikes.  We have seen that that is neither practical nor desirable.  It is not possible to enact legislation to force unions to come together because, under our Constitution, we are given the right to choose our associates and no one can force us to choose our associates.  If Irishmen prefer to be members of a union no law will force them into association with another group with whom they do not wish to be associated.  Therefore, the Bill has that deficiency as has any legislation in this area in that respect.  All we may do is to encourage and to ensure that the law in itself is not an impediment to greater associaciv <Col N="233" /> tion between disparate groups and groups now in separate organisations.</P>
      <P>I share Deputy Moore's disappointment that there has not been a greater coming together of unions based in Ireland and dealing with the same category of workers.  Despite efforts in the past at achieving common organisation, this has not been achieved.  Is there a lack of encouragement here?  I suggest there is not. In section 14 of the Bill we are providing for full financial aid and consultancy to unions seeking amalgamation. We cover all legal costs.  This is solid encouragement to those unions who might be considering amalgamation or the transfer of engagements but who might lack the financial resources to consider the feasibility of such moves.</P>
      <P>In this legislation we actually underwrite the cost of hiring a consultant to the executive of a union which might be considering the advantages of amalgamation or transfer of functions with another organisation.  There is no cost whatever involved.  We also cover any legal costs and there is an undertaking to cover any residual consequences from such amalgamation or transfer of engagements.</P>
      <P>We cannot pass any legislation here which would drive a wedge between an organisation in Ireland which belongs to an international organisation or one with headquarters covering the entire membership based in Britain and its present body.  All we seek is that there shall be an executive here with decision-making powers on matters concerning the membership in Ireland.  It is not possible for us to drive such a wedge.  Anybody considering it would realise it would have no chance of success and would defeat the whole purpose of seeking a voluntary coming together of unions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Dowling raised the question of workers from other states in the Economic Community coming here to work.  I think Deputy Esmonde made the same point: that if such workers were anxious to work in Ireland they would have to comply with the provisions of legislation here. Also, the trade union centre here is affiliated to the trade union movement <Col N="234" /> in Europe and obviously if there is any development regarding workers coming from abroad the trade union centre here would conform to practices arranged in concert with the other trade union centres in Europe.  It is not visualised that there is anything in this legislation which is in conflict with any obligations arising from EEC membership nor do I foresee any difficulties arising, at least in the short term, on the matters raised by Deputy Dowling.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JosephDowling" hpid="Mr. Dowling Mr. Dowling">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dowling</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to make perfectly clear that there is no desire on our part to force mergers.  This must be a voluntary effort.  The Minister is quite right in saying that we cannot legislate people into mergers.  We desire to ensure that the Minister make means available for mergers to take place because this in itself is an encouragement to mergers.  Funds are available that were not available in the past.  We know of the unhappy state of affairs when mergers did take place in the past, particularly in the case of NEETU when much of the finances were eaten up by court costs. There was no financial incentive for other unions to proceed and this has probably been an impediment to mergers.  There is provision in the Bill for financial assistance.  This makes the situation easier and will give food for thought for those wishing to amalgamate and join larger unions offering greater facilities, educational and otherwise.</P>
      <P>It might have been gathered from the Minister or from Deputy Esmonde that there was a desire on our part to enforce mergers.  There is no such desire but we do desire to have means available to encourage mergers.  Legislation cannot be a means of direction in this field.  I am certain that, with the common sense of workers and union officials and the overall situation regarding availability of services in the future and with the everchanging situation in Europe in regard to working conditions, training, technical and educational facilities, there will be an incentive now that has been lacking for some time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMoore" hpid="Mr. Moore Mr. Moore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moore</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister admits <Col N="235" /> his disappointment that there have been so few mergers.  My belief is that the Bill will help somewhat but it will not be a <i>Mogna Carta</i> for unions willing to amalgamate.  Deputy Dowling is right in saying there can be no suggestion of compulsion in getting unions to amalgamate.  That is neither possible nor desirable.</P>
      <P>Have we gone far enough or as far as we can with inducements to unions to amalgamate.  We accept the principle that amalgamation is good and this Bill provides the framework for a slight degree of encouragement, but we cannot expect workers to see in the Bill a great new instrument for amalgamation.  It is not that, and the workers will see this very quickly and because of the strength of the trade unions they do not fear any effort by the State to do a certain thing.  Any talk of compulsion is just foolish.  We must be fair to the unions and the workers and say: &ldquo;This Bill is a pale instrument which lays down certain basic conditions for amalgamation.&rdquo; Let us accept the Bill and not go on thinking that we are passing momentous legislation when in fact we are not.</P>
      <P>If the results when the Bill becomes an Act are disappointing let us not be despondent because it is a very light Bill and we do not expect it to accomplish what we want to see, the amalgamation of many unions.  The unions themselves desire this but I see little here which would encourage any union to amalgamate.  The Minister is right in saying that the State will bear the cost of an amalgamation on certain lines but let us not suggest or give colour to any talk of compulsion. Anybody with any grey matter will know this is not envisaged and would be undesirable.  At the same time let us be true to ourselves and to the trade unions by not suggesting that this is a fine piece of legislation which will result in a rush of amalgamations. That is not so.  Let us recognise the deficiencies in the Bill and try to improve it as we go along.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>It is not my purpose in regard to legislation of this kind to indulge in back-patting but <Col N="236" /> for the Deputy's information, never in the history of the State have we attempted any legislation in this area. This is the first such piece of legislation. I have been almost ten years in the House and in that time we have not succeeded in putting even what little legislation there is here on the books.  And this is not little in its practical consequences.  I am aware of many unions that up to now have been deterred from amalgamation by the state of the law.  The complications involved prevented action in this direction.</P>
      <P>Far from agreeing with Deputy Moore I would say that the nature of the problem before us does not permit us to pass simple legislation forcing people to come together but I would point out to him, just for the record as a matter of strict historical fact, that it was in 1917 that the last piece of legislation in this area was passed.  No such legislation was passed in the history of this State and certainly in the past ten years there was no successful attempt to move along those lines.  This is the first legislation dealing with the problem and it is not fair of the Deputy to dismiss it as a matter of no consequence. I hope for a good deal of progress in the difficult area of amalgamation and transfer of engagements on the part of unions that I know from discussions with smaller unions anxious to come together&mdash;and I have had many such discussions&mdash;that they will in fact consider the situation and the provisions of this legislation will help them in this matter.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PearseWyse" hpid="Mr. Wyse Mr. Wyse">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wyse</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister knows what prevented amalgamation over the years.  It was the financial aspect. People felt that better pensions and better protection were given from British-based unions but we all know that it was the financial aspect rather than anything else that prevented amalgamation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOLeary" hpid="Mr. M. O'Leary Mr. M. O'Leary">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>We need not go into that.  There were very difficult legal problems involving a great deal of litigation for the union desiring the amalgamation.  If any section or member of the union had a case for <Col N="237" /> the High Court based on the most trivial of reasons the whole matter could be held up and the officers could be held up for damages or any other consequences arising out of it. It would be a very courageous man indeed who could have considered realistically the coming together of two unions up to this legislation.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JosephDowling" hpid="Mr. Dowling Mr. Dowling">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dowling</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister must agree that there has been a change in attitudes in relation to mergers in the reasonably recent past.  The change in materials and the fact that certain trades were regarded as dying trades meant that modification was necessary and changes in union membership were necessary.  It is unfair to go back to 1913 and to 1871 and to say that no legislation was enacted since then.  There has been a change in attitudes in recent times and there is now a more enlightened view of the necessity to merge.  Some of the unions here provide an excellent service for their members because they are large unions and have financial resources which make it possible for them to provide educational, technical and various types of training and facilities.  It is only in recent times they have been able to offer those services.  Perhaps in ten years' time people will say that the Act of 1974 was a useless instrument and that nothing has happened since 1974. There will be a change in the atmosphere in the future that will necessitate the updating of our legislation. Legislation must always keep pace with the change in attitudes in the community.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Blame-placing or suggestion that a prolonged period has passed and there has been no legislation solve nothing. The demand is here now and there will be a demand in the future for a different type of legislation.  When that time comes people will probably say that we were inactive for a considerable period but that is not the case.  We must judge the situation as it is at the moment.  We now have synthetic fibres and other new materials.  We have seen the change from tinsmith to coppersmith to sheet-metal worker.  Various trades have changed over the years.  Unions have <Col N="238" /> changed their names for this reason. Nobody is called a tinsmith any more. They are all sheet-metal workers because a wider range of materials has been developed.  While we welcome this legislation as a step forward it is unfair to suggest that over a long period nothing has been done.  It is when the demand comes that one must meet it.  If the Minister is in government for 20 years, in 20 years' time there will be a demand for the updating of legislation to meet the changes at that time.</P>
    <P>I thought it rather peculiar that the Minister should refer to Deputy Moore's statement in the manner in which he did.  We are all here to assist and to ensure that the legislation is as good as it is possible to make it. Perhaps some of us think it is weak, that there should be more encouragement in it.  Possibly we will have amendments on the Report Stage.  The Minister has given us the views of the trade unions with which he has consulted over a period in relation to the Bill.  On Report Stage we can examine the Bill in greater depth and perhaps provide additional stimulants so that mergers can more freely take place. We must all work together for the betterment of the workers, which is the main factor.  Blame-placing is no solution to the problem.</P>
    <P>The NEETU affair has brought to a head the defects in our legislation. Many other unions who had their eyes on mergers may now be prompted to move forward seeing that there are financial provisions.  The financial aspect was the major impediment in the past.  An immense amount of work must be done before a merger takes place.  Many years of difficult and trying conferences take place. There is great expense involved in travelling to conferences, in having printing done and a variety of other things.  It is weak unions that would tend to merge and they just could not afford it.  I agree with the people who say that finance was the vital factor. If a weaker union feels its resources will be sapped up in trying to amalgamate it is a non-starter.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Esmonde</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Dowling mentioned the expense.  The Minister has referred to section 14.  There is a provision to deal with that so that does not stand in the way.  I know there is a lot of work involved in a merger but there is clear provision for it in section 14.  That is as far as any Minister can be expected to go. I fully appreciate Deputy Dowling's point about the changing circumstances but over 50 years have passed since the last piece of legislation and it did not deal with mergers or amalgamations and it did nothing to make provision to ease the merger or amalgamation.  I can fairly speak having read that Act and having had to consider the problems under a 1917 Act where difficulties have arisen.  The Minister has spoken from the point of view of trade unionism.  I am speaking from a professional point of view.  I have been involved in these problems.</P>
      <P>This is what you might call a practical Bill to get over these difficulties. As Deputy Dowling said, times change and there is a demand for this.  There is an amount of thinking on these lines at the moment because of the involvement of unions in technical work, and the smaller unions are not able to provide the service for their members.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have this difficulty here of possibly an undue number of people who are members of foreign-based unions.  That is natural enough from our past history.  People may have left here as unskilled workers and emigrated to England, got their qualifications in their trade and eventually found their way back here&mdash;thank God for that, it is the ambition of most people leaving the country to come back and earn their livelihood here.  However, they joined a union in England and naturally retain their membership of that union.  The purpose <Col N="240" /> of this Bill is to try to facilitate such unions acting in this country to merge from an Irish point of view, in the Irish context, and I think there is agreement in this House to get on with that and to provide the facilities for it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMoore" hpid="Mr. Moore Mr. Moore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moore</NameTxt>
      <P>We must get it on the record that compulsion was first mentioned by the Minister.  He takes the legislators to task because in 57 years we did not have any legislation on this matter.  Having waited so long, while this Bill is a help, it is not, perhaps, the legislation that was worth waiting 57 years for.  Maybe it was not necessary in previous years because 57 years ago we did not have so many unions or so many industrial or commercial workers.  When the trade unions see this Bill when it is enacted and if it does not result in any great moves towards amalgamation, do not blame the unions for it but blame the Minister as the instrument of this legislature which has not produced effective legislation to encourage more amalgamations of unions.  The whole principle of the Bill is to encourage them to do so.  If it fails we will have to examine where it fails and not blame the unions for being uncooperative. If we make it attractive enough for the unions, they will amalgamate and I hold this Bill is not sufficiently attractive to have them amalgamate in any great numbers.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 4:</P>
      <P>In page 3, subsection (1), between lines 18 and 19, to insert a new paragraph as follows:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(d) voting shall be supervised by an officer from the Office of the Registrar, nominated for that purpose by the Registrar&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This is weak section to which we have put down two amendments and the Minister one.  The section deals with the question of the amalgamation of transfers and the question of a ballot.  If the registrar is to have the powers&mdash;and he has fairly substantial <Col N="241" /> powers&mdash;given to him in the Bill, then we believe the ballot should be supervised by an independent body.  If there is a general desire that the unions should come together, then there can be no objection to an independent body supervising the ballot.</P>
    <P>Deputy Moore has referred to a recent ballot in which the number of votes was greater than anticipated. Possibly the union official supervising the ballot would not be in favour of the merger and might influence the vote to some degree.  This has happened in the past.  At a meeting I attended one of the members was able, by a number of devices, to influence the ballot.  On one occasion when I was contesting a particular post, I was sent to address members at a particular centre at a time when it was known that few of the members would be available.  The other candidate was sent on the day the ballot papers on which members were voting were available.  Therefore, influence can be wielded by officials of the union and it is important that we should take the responsibility for this important decision away and put it in the hands of an independent body. We have an additional amendment here which says:</P>
    <P>Not less than seven days before voting on the resolution begins, the unions shall cause to be published in the daily morning papers notice of the holding of the vote.</P>
    <P>This is desirable particularly in the engineering and maintenance unions where workers might be on duty down the country for periods of three to six weeks.  They might have a direct interest&mdash;&mdash;</P>

I in no way want to take away from the honesty of union officials but there are some union officials just as there are politicians who might seek to use undue influence.  I want to ensure that no finger can be pointed at one section or another, and that is why I ask the Minister to accept this amendment.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>There is no legislation that can prevent people being influenced in how they should vote, It is their democratic right that people should be free to do that.  However, what we sought to do in this legislation is to write in certain criteria which must be complied with in the actual voting.  If they are not complied with there is provision for complaints to be made to the registrar. If the registrar agrees there are grounds for the complaints, then the voting is invalidated.  The present legislation governing amalgamations does not provide for the manner in which votes on amalgamation are to be taken.</P>
      <P>We have laid down clearly defined procedures in section 3 (1).  It sets out the conditions applying to the manner of voting on resolutions to amalgamate or to transfer engagements.  Every member of the union must be entitled to vote without improper pressure or interference from any party.  The voting must be by way of written ballot and the union must take all reasonable steps to ensure that at least seven days before voting every member receives a notice which complies with the conditions set out in subsection (2) of the section.  Subsection (2) sets out the full details of the relevant instrument, where copies of the instrument may be inspected and comply with any regulations under this Act.  All these requirements must be fulfilled and the member voting will be fully informed as to what is involved seven days before the vote takes place.  Everything reasonably possible will be done to ensure that those participating in the vote know all the facts.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With all due respect, I cannot see the need in those circumstances for Deputy Dowling's amendment.  The implication in having an official from the Registry <Col N="243" /> of Friendly Societies present at the vote is that we do not trust those conducting the vote and those voting and that would certainly not be helpful from the point of view of the objectives sought by this legislation, especially when one considers the criteria laid down and the avenues open for complaint by anybody dissatisfied.  In any case, it is not clear what precise action such an official could take.  Presumably all that could be done would be to refuse to register the instrument of amalgamation or transfer.  That would happen in any case if a member of the trade union complained to the Registrar of Friendly Societies that voting had not taken place in accordance with the act.</P>
    <P>Amalgamation or transfer must be by way of written ballot&mdash;I emphasise that&mdash;and, in those circumstances, the possibility of abuse will be considerably reduced.  If Deputy Dowling looks again at his amendment in the light of what I have said I do not think he will find it necessary to push this particular amendment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JosephDowling" hpid="Mr. Dowling Mr. Dowling">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dowling</NameTxt>
      <P>But if the official from the office of the Registrar of Friendly societies were present there would be no need to go back to him and report any abuse because the official would either be satisfied or dissatisfied with the ballot.  The necessity to declare the ballot invalid would not exist and, remember, a second ballot is always much more difficult than the first.</P>

Every voter is a supervisor to ensure the ballot is carried out according to the law.  That is a better procedure because we transform the voters into custodians of the legislation.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 5:</P>
      <P>In page 3, subsection (1), between lines 22 and 23, to insert a new paragraph as follows:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(e)  not less than seven days before voting on the resolution begins, the union shall cause to be published in the daily morning newspapers notice of the holding of the vote&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>This is a very desirable amendment. If people are working away from their homes seven days will not be adequate notice.  Contact may be very difficult.  Maintenance workers and people working on installations are forever moving around from one place to another.  The original letter will go to the recipient's home address from which it will be redirected to his last home address and, from there, it will have to be sent on to a forwarding address.  A considerable period could elapse.  A union which wants to take reasonable steps to ensure each member entitled to vote has a vote will want at least seven days in which to notify members through the medium of the daily newspapers of the holding of the vote. I think the amendment is very reasonable because it will give members an opportunity of learning from the daily newspapers that a merger is taking place and there will be a vote; each member involved could then make the necessary arrangements.  I am sure the Minister is aware of the difficulties involved for people who are out of town.  A union member could be on circuit, as it were, and seven days may not be enough.  It is generally accepted now in trade union circles that they put a notice in the papers indicating that a meeting of such a branch will be held to discuss the national wage agreement or some other wage agreement. There is nothing new in this.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="246" /> The amendment would give that extra amount of assistance to the person who is working out of town and who desires to vote.  If the notice is sent to a forwarding address, it may not arrive until after the ballot is over.  I do not suggest that there would be a desire to ensure that the person would not vote, but we must take all reasonable steps to ensure that he knows what is happening.  A merger is a very important step and his vote might decide the balance one way or the other.  A normal procedure which has been followed in recent times should be adopted and should be written into the Bill so that the notice will appear in the daily papers.</P>

      <P>I believe that the proposals in the Bill are stringent enough to ensure that every member of a trade union who is entitled to vote will receive detailed notice of the ballot under section 3.  That seems to be a pretty secure guarantee that every member will be fully informed before the vote takes place.  As the Deputy <Col N="247" /> rightly says, it is not a matter of any great moment whether we add in the additional precaution of a notice in the papers.  It depends on whether you think people read notices in the papers. I tend to think they do not.  More attention is paid to a letter which sets out all the details of the voting involved.</P>
      <P>There are other considerations also. If the Deputy is absolutely insistent on the necessity for having a notice in the papers, I will give consideration to it on Report Stage.  I believe there are ample guarantees in the Bill but, if the Deputy still feels that a notice in the papers is called for, I will give consideration to that.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 6:</P>
      <P>In page 3, between lines 22 and 23, to insert the following:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;(2)  Before a resolution to approve an instrument of amalgamation <Col N="248" /> or transfer is voted on by the members of a trade union, the trade union shall satisfy the Registrar that the steps it proposes to take comply with subsection (1) (d).&rdquo;</P>
    <P>As originally drafted, the Bill provided in section 3 (1) (d) that the union should take all reasonable steps to ensure that not less than seven days before the voting on an amalgamation or transfer every member of the union received a copy of the notice in writing, complying with subsection (2).  It was represented to us at our meetings with the trade unions that it was possible that those who were, for one reason or another, opposed to the amalgamation and who might, in normal circumstances, be a minority within the union concerned, might take refuge in the vagueness of words &ldquo;all reasonable steps&rdquo; in any later legal objections they had to the process of amalgamation.</P>
    <P>It was also represented to us that there could be protracted court cases based on what constituted &ldquo;all reasonable steps&rdquo;.  This amendment removes that possibility because it provides that reasonable steps will be approved in advance by the registrar. It goes some way towards meeting the point about the powers of the registrar raised by Deputy Dowling on previous amendments.  Once more we are giving the registrar powers before the ballot is taken to arbitrate and decide on what are &ldquo;reasonable steps&rdquo;.  This is a guarantee, so far as the law can provide it, that a just decision will be reached.</P>
    <P>Amendment agreed to.</P>
    <P>Section 3, as amended, agreed to.</P>
    <P>Section 4 agreed to.</P>
    <P Just="Center">SECTION 5.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JosephDowling" hpid="Mr. Dowling Mr. Dowling">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dowling</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 7:</P>
      <P>To add to the section a new subsection as follows:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(2)  Notwithstanding anything in subsection (1), the amalgamating unions shall have the right to agree upon the minimum number of votes which must be recorded to enable a resolution to be passed.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>Section 5 provides:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="249" /> Where a vote is taken by a trade union on a resolution to approve an instrument of amalgamation or transfer, a simple majority of the votes recorded shall be sufficient to pass the resolution notwithstanding anything in the rules of the union.</P>
    <P>We feel this is very weak and could be open to abuse&mdash;&ldquo;a simple majority of the votes recorded&rdquo;.  There should be some minimum vote.  We generally tend to think of all the workers in a factory being available but the availability of personnel is another factor. There should be some means of determining what the majority should be rather than providing for a simple majority.  If other people were absent for one reason or another, three people could make a decision.  That is undesirable.  I do not hold with the previous situation in which 50 per cent had to vote and there had to be a 20 per cent majority.  Somewhere in between there must be a solution to this problem.</P>
    <P>As I said, a merger is probably the most important step that a union can take.  We do not want to give an advantage to small groups who are available.  The availability of personnel to vote is the important thing.  The provision about 50 per cent was more reasonable, unreasonable as it was. The Minister should consider making provision for something more than a simple majority.  There must be some means of determining what is reasonable. Where a situation can be contrived a simple majority is not sufficient. A major step such as a merger requires more than a simple majority. While abuses can take place, and do take place, and probably will take place in the future we must guard against these abuses.</P>
    <P>In the section we must examine in some depth the situations which can and might develop.  Although this may never happen we are leaving it open to a small group of people who may be present when the ballot is taking place and their votes will have greater weight.</P>
    <P>I worked in a workshop where 90 per cent of the personnel would be absent for periods of four, five or six weeks.  At that time, there might be <Col N="250" /> only two or three out of 30 or 40 members available for union meetings. This is undesirable.  Those who are for or against such a proposal would know of the situation and they could contrive to take advantage of the situation. Their votes would then be weighted.  I should like to hear the Minister's views.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOLeary" hpid="Mr. M. O'Leary Mr. M. O'Leary">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>Section 5 provides that a simple majority of the votes recorded shall be sufficient to pass the resolution notwithstanding anything in the rules of the union. Under existing legislation before an amalgamation or transfer can be approved the votes of at least 50 per cent of the members entitled to vote must be recorded.  Those in favour must exceed those against by 20 per cent or more.  Clearly this situation makes amalgamations and transfers exceedingly difficult, particularly in the case of a big union amalgamating with a small union.  This section, without the amendment, will remove this difficulty while at the same time protecting the interest of members by ensuring that they receive adequate and detailed notice of a ballot on amalgamation or transfer.</P>
      <P>Deputy Dowling's amendment would give the trade unions concerned the right to specify a minimum number of people who must actually vote before a resolution approving the amalgamation may be carried.  It does not leave much to the imagination to visualise what difficulties this would involve for the unions wishing to amalgamate.  Where there is a small entrenched minority in any union, they could create a great deal of delay and trouble by insisting on an impractical percentage to carry an agreement about the transfer or amalgamation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I ask Deputy Dowling not to press this amendment.  The Act ensures that every member entitled to vote will receive notice of the vote.  There is always the difficulty in democratic elections that people will not turn up to vote.  That is a continuing difficulty and I do not see any solution to it. We could compel them to vote but that would not be in the traditions of this country.  When looking at voting <Col N="251" /> for amalgamation and transfer, there is a danger that we would confuse the voting procedures on this occasion with voting procedures when it comes to dispute situations.</P>
    <P>It is unlikely that a transfer or amalgamation could be arranged at relatively short notice.  The preparations involved would take many months.  As Deputy Dowling knows, in some cases it has taken too many years.  It is extremely unlikely that members will be unaware of such an event taking place.  It is also unlikely that it will not have been discussed by members at all levels or that anyone who has an interest in such a vote will stay away.  The Bill guarantees that everybody involved will be informed beforehand of the nature of the decisions to be taken.  If, however, we saddle ourselves with extra burdens we will delay the whole process and place a very unwelcome burden on the unions wanting amalgamation or transfer.  A simple majority with a guarantee written in of full information beforehand, and recourse to complain to the registrar where these conditions are not complied with, seems ample assurance that democratic procedures will be carried through.  I ask Deputy Dowling to reconsider his amendment.  I believe the section as it stands meets his requirements.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMoore" hpid="Mr. Moore Mr. Moore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moore</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Dowling put his finger on a very sensitive point, but I appreciate the difficulty facing the Minister.  Let us take the example of the Seamen's Union.  The fortuitous arrival of a ship on voting day could decide which way the ballot would go.  When the Minister is speaking of a simple majority might I suggest that he fix a figure of, say, 50 members who shall vote or else there is no vote.  Then it could be carried by 24 or 26 votes.  That would satisfy the legal requirements of this Act.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Dowling's point needs further consideration.  If for some reason an amalgamation is carried by a very small vote, that amalgamation would not have the backing of the members of either union involved. The Minister might bring in a compromise <Col N="252" /> on the next Stage incorporating Deputy Dowling's point.  I admit I do not know how it can be done, but I am sure there must be some way to do it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOLeary" hpid="Mr. M. O'Leary Mr. M. O'Leary">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>The Bill provides that members must get at least seven days' notice.  A member would have grounds for complaint to the registrar as to the invalidity of the vote which takes place if this requirement is not carried through.  Deputy Moore's example of the Seamen's Union is covered in the legislation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMoore" hpid="Mr. Moore Mr. Moore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moore</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister knows from experience how low a poll may be in a union ballot.  Even for a wage claim a very small proportion of people vote.  This is unfortunate, but it is true.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelOLeary" hpid="Mr. M. O'Leary Mr. M. O'Leary">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>There is no means in law whereby we can legislate into existence interest and commitment if they do not exist.  If there is not the will to come to a meeting, no law passed here will ensure a change in that state of affairs.  We cannot arbitrarily decide that this figure is needed for a decision to have validity in terms of engagement of transfer.  We must abide by the majority criteria, taking into account the requirement of full information being available beforehand to all eligible to take part in the ballot. That covers Deputies' misgivings that an unrepresentative minority could make a decision in a matter of such consequence.</P>
      <P>There is, of course, the actual situation we are dealing with: that of amalgamation or transfer, where a group of people in an association decide to come together with a group in another association.  This is not a matter that could be decided in a relatively short time, unlike the situation that obtains when it comes to disputes or wage negotiations.  It would be a matter for long consideration in most cases and therefore it would be unlikely that those who turned up to the meeting would be unrepresentative of the overall opinion within the association taking the vote.</P>

Seven days' notice will be given to a member and if such a member is not prepared to face up to his obligations I do not think we should compel a union to hold up business.  I am satisfied with the seven days' notice.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dowling</NameTxt>
      <P>If that is so, the whole picture is altered.  In that event seven <Col N="254" /> days' notice is unreasonable.  It should be up to 21 days' notice to give a person an opportunity of applying for a postal vote.  One would not necessarily receive a postal vote within seven days after receiving notice from the union. There is nothing in the Bill that makes provision for the application of a postal vote and in my view the subsection referred to by the Minister concerns those attending the meeting.  It also states that the ballot will be supervised in accordance with the rules laid down by the registrar.</P>
      <P>It would be a very unhappy merger if by some device a merger was carried by a single vote against the wishes of the greater number of personnel who would not have the opportunity of expressing their views through the ballot box.  A postal vote would be a means of eliminating some of the problems that may arise.  I ask the Minister to include postal votes and extend the seven-day period.  If the provision for postal votes was included it would not be possible for some people to cast their votes with the seven-day limit.  I accept that it could not be stretched far enough to suit everyone but some improvement could be made.</P>

If a person can say that he received a notice but that he is constrained, because of his <Col N="255" /> work, from taking part in the ballot he would have a case for the registrar. I hold that the legislation meets the problems posed by the Deputy.  It covers all the cases he has referred to.</P>
    <P>I have already undertaken that in section 3 (1) (c), in case there is any doubt, the word &ldquo;secret&rdquo; will be added on Report Stage.  I am assured that there is no need to add &ldquo;postal&rdquo;. Therefore the necessity does not arise for longer notice in terms of the postal ballot.</P>

      <P>This amendment would not be necessary if it was stated that postal votes were available for personnel working away from home for long periods.  There is no such provision in the Bill, irrespective of what the Minister's legal advisers say. Common sense dictates that there must be a special section dealing with postal votes, which are different from a vote at a union meeting.</P>
      <P>I would go so far as to suggest to the Minister that he should examine this and take into consideration also personnel who might be ill in hospital, so that they could record their vote and have a say in the merger. There might be people in hospital, in convalescent homes and other places who might wish to avail of the opportunity of participating.  In fact there might arise the question of people on holiday if, for some reason, a union decided to hold a ballot during, say, the first or second week of August knowing that a very small number of personnel would be available and when the outcome could be a very unhappy one as a result of a small minority wanting a merger while the majority did not.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We must make special provision in the Bill under which people can apply for a postal vote.  It might well happen that a person would want to record his vote by post for a variety of reasons rather than attend a union meeting and that opportunity should be afforded him.  I do not hold with <Col N="256" /> the views of the legal advisers that there is adequate provision in the Bill for application for a postal vote, as to who would be entitled to a postal vote and the procedure to be adopted in relation to it, because the ballot would be supervised by somebody. That, to me, would mean a ballot at a union meeting unless some other provision is included in the Bill.  If there were provision in the Bill then my amendment would not be necessary because everybody would be afforded the opportunity of voting at a ballot or by postal vote if they so wished.  On an important issue like this, I do not feel a person should be debarred from voting if they do not want to attend a meeting.  If it is a secret vote it should be capable of being done either way.</P>

      <P>I think the Deputy may not be given full weight <Col N="257" /> to the place of the registrar in all of this.  He must be satisfied that all of the provisions of the legislation are carried through.  The Deputy has made the point that his amendment No. 7, coming under section 5, could be looked at again if something was to be done in the case of amendments to section 3.  Because of his anxiety to ensure that there is a genuine majority for amalgamation at any period, Deputy Dowling raises the point of the postal vote.  I have already given a categorical assurance that a postal vote is allowable because the vote must be in writing &mdash;that that can be used.</P>
      <P>I would draw the Deputy's attention also to 3 (1) (b) that every member shall be given a fair opportunity of voting and that the registrar himself&mdash;the registrar whom Deputy Dowling was anxious to bring in to the actual supervision of the vote&mdash;or a person from his office must be convinced that a fair opportunity to vote was given to every member of the trade union concerned.  All of the examples Deputy Dowling gave here of persons who could not be present would not be considered by the registrar or his officials as having been afforded a fair opportunity of voting if such provisions were not implemented. Therefore I would point out to Deputy Dowling that I think amendment No. 7 would not be helpful in reaching the objective I know Deputy Dowling shares with me and with most Deputies&mdash;that there should be a fair verdict recorded in the election, in the decision-making process, of the union concerned.  We have built into the Bill a guarantee that there will be fairness throughout and there is final recourse to the registrar if there is a feeling that an injustice has been perpetrated. These give us, as far as any legislation can, cast iron guarantees against abuse.</P>

The word &ldquo;postal&rdquo; does not appear in the Bill.  Therefore it could well be held by a person wishing to <Col N="258" /> contest a registrar's decision to allow a postal vote that there was no such provision in the Bill.

      <P>The Minister will know that every trade union member has not got a legal adviser accompanying him to union meetings to interpret legislation.  It must be stated in simple language here, understandable both to the unions and their members. I do not believe that the Minister believes that section 3 (1) (c) covers that aspect.  That may be the advice given him by his legal advisers but I think it could be argued both ways, because there is no provision in the Bill for a person wishing to obtain a postal vote.  There would have to be provision somewhere else in the Bill specifying what a person would have to do to obtain a postal vote.  The Minister will agree that it is a little wider than that.</P>

I would ask the Deputy to suspend his reservations on this matter until Report Stage.  I will go back to my advisers to see that this is a castiron part of the legislation.  I am totally satisfied that the requirements in the legislation are secure against any abuse with regard to participation of members in voting.  We have the safety valve of the registrar and we have the criteria laid down here to ensure that everyone is given a fair <Col N="260" /> opportunity of voting.  The requirements are spelled out in section 3.  I am convinced there is nothing in the legislation that is in conflict with the requirements of postal balloting if that is desired.</P>

It is not a question of a section being inserted that was simply devised by officials of my Department.  They are proposals that came from exchanges between people concerned to see improvement in the law in this area and the provisions we have here are a result of those discussions.

      <P>There is a slight disagreement here since I am convinced that the legislation does what the Deputy wishes by way of his amendment. It would be superfluous to add some of the points he has mentioned to the legislation if in fact the legislation as it stands will do what the Deputy has in mind.  I have conceded points to the Deputy where I might have felt undecided or where certain points, though satisfactory, could do with further emphasis.  There were points such as the notice in the newspapers, which I accepted earlier.  It would be a more serious matter to accept amendment No. 7, because that would be a retreat in the direction from which we wish to escape.  It would burden the job of amalgamating with requirements that are unnecessary when one considers all the safeguards written into the legislation to ensure members are given a fair chance of their views being represented when a decision is taken.</P>
      <P>It would be a retrograde step to accept amendment No. 7.  I sympathise with the Deputy in his anxiety to ensure that a genuine verdict is recorded. I have already given him the assurance that section 3 (1) (c) implies a postal ballot.  I hope to be able to reassure him on that on Report Stage. I will look closely at it to see that I have been left under no misapprehension as to the intent of the provision in section 3 (1) (c), although I do not think I have been and I have discussed it with the officials concerned.  Since it is accepted that postal balloting is an integral part of the voting, I would ask Deputy Dowling to withdraw amendment No. 7 in view of the safeguards written into section 3.</P>

      <P>In the previous legislation there was provision that 50 per cent must vote and it was necessary to have a majority of 20 per cent. There must have been some good reason to state the percentages.  While the percentages may be wrong, the collective wisdom of the trade unions is necessary.  As I have pointed out, there could be a very unhappy merger where a situation was brought about by a small group of people forcing the merger against the will of the <Col N="262" /> majority.  I do not see the provision in section 3 (1) (c) for postal voting, but if such a provision is written into the Bill I will withdraw the amendment. It must be one way or the other.  We must get an assurance that the collective wisdom of the trade unions is available in the decision ultimately arrived at.  I do not feel the same way as the Minister.  Irrespective of what the legal advisers say, there must be a special indication with regard to postal voting and there must be provision regarding the necessary steps to apply for a postal vote, whether given to all members or to those who cannot vote because of inability to attend due to reasons of work or illness.</P>

We must write something into the legislation.</P>

      <P>The experience of those involved in amalgamations prior to this has been that the law can do one or two things.  It can either see that justice is done, that the provisions of legislation dealing with the matter protect the rights of individuals taking part in the decision and ensure that the conditions surrounding the decision give each individual a fair chance of contributing to it.  The law may do that, as we do here, with right of appeal where any injustice occurs.  The law can be, as it has been up to now, an impediment to progress in this area.  By progress I mean a process whereby unions come together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If we begin to clutter up this legislation with specific measures that are unnecessary when we consider the larger criteria that must be fulfilled, we begin to defeat the purpose of this legislation, whether we desire to do so or not.  Certainly we do not assist the movement towards amalgamation among unions.  I am quite sure that <Col N="263" /> the provision of section 3 (1) (c) permits of postal voting.</P>
    <P>That, taken in conjunction with the other safety measures to which I have referred at length already, leaves little human possibility of the kind of situation mentioned by Deputy Dowling.  I know that the Deputy is as anxious as the rest of us to facilitate movement in this area, movement in which there is the right of appeal where a person is of the opinion that justice is not complied with.  I would hope that the Deputy would withdraw the amendment because it would not assist us but would tend to nudge this piece of legislation back to what we have tried to rescue this whole area from.  I could not accept the amendment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JosephDowling" hpid="Mr. Dowling Mr. Dowling">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dowling</NameTxt>
      <P>The two most important provisions of this Bill are the ballot and the financial assistance that is to be given to unions.  The Minister is aware that in relation to a previous merger the problem was the question of the ballot.  The manner in which it was conducted and the decision arrived at were contested. The most important matter from the point of view of union members is the merger and the next most important aspect is the assistance given towards amalgamation.  This must be protected to the greatest degree possible.</P>
      <P>I do not see the situation as the Minister sees it in relation to section 3, subsection (1) (c).  The Minister must realise that there is reason in what we are saying in relation to the postal vote.  This provision should be more specific and should be embodied in the Bill.  In that case we would be happy that the collective wisdom of the union members would be brought to bear in relation to decision making. Should members decide not to vote, that would be their affair; but they would have a fair and reasonable opportunity of doing so should they wish.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the absence of such provisions in the Bill a situation could be imagined whereby a smaller union, a minority of people&mdash;for example, people on circuit such as those <Col N="264" /> engaged in the installation of central heating systems, people such as lighthouse keepers or commercial travellers &mdash;would not have that opportunity.  In the case of a union in which only a small number of people was involved, one vote could be weighted so as to equal two or three votes, by the decision of members in relation to the time at which a ballot would take place.</P>
    <P>The Minister must accept it as being fair and reasonable that provision for a postal vote would be embodied in this Bill, not in the manner in which it is proposed, whereby somebody with a legal mind could, perhaps, read into it the provision for a postal vote.  Perhaps I am as reasonable a person as is the Minister or anybody else but I cannot read that into the Bill.  In the first place, there would have to be provision to allow for application for a postal vote, but there is no such provision.  I appreciate that the Minister is endeavouring to protect the ballot in every way possible.  By his amendments and by his attitude here he has done so in a fairly comprehensive way except for the one weakness that I have referred to.  Would the Minister be prepared to give an assurance to the House that on Report Stage he will embody a provision in relation to a postal vote?  Already he has agreed on the question of a secret ballot.  There is no specific assurance in the Bill that everyone will be entitled to vote.  If this provision were specified in the Bill, there would be no need for amendment No. 7.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnGrattanEsmonde" hpid="Mr. Esmonde Mr. Esmonde">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Esmonde</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish, first, to underline a fact here: this Bill is dealing with the property rights of a member of a union.  It is very necessary to bear this in mind.  I am speaking from the legal point of view of the rights of a member such as the one to which Deputy Dowling was referring.  Section 3 provides that the method of voting shall consist of the marking of a ballot paper by the person voting.  There is a duty placed on the registrar to ensure that that is complied with.  The fundamental principle here is that, if a person is a member of union A and is merging <Col N="265" /> with union B, he loses his right as a member of union A and will be merged with union B.  Before that can take place in respect of that member it must be shown that, first, he had the right to vote and, secondly, the opportunity to avail of that vote. That is a fundamental principle of law.</P>
      <P>Therefore if the Act were to be interpreted as Deputy Dowling says, that is, that the right of postal voting is not there and if, say, a member is living in Killorglin or in the Bahamas for that matter, he is precluded from a vote that takes place in Dublin.  In other words he will not be given the rights that are set out in that section and so the ballot is wrong. That is what the Minister is saying and, further, he is saying to Deputy Dowling that he will go back to his legal adviser again to make sure that the advice he has been given so far is correct.</P>
      <P>There might be an alternative way of dealing with this situation&mdash;for instance, under subsection (2) to provide for the making of regulations under the Act.  That might be a better way of dealing with any fears there might be.  These would be regulations to clarify any matters about which there might be doubt because there is always a danger in putting too much into an Act.  As I see it, the Bill gives the right to the postal vote because there is the duty that each member must not only have the ballot paper but must have the right to mark that paper and have it registered as a vote.</P>
      <P>I can understand Deputy Dowling's concern but I am looking at the matter as a lawyer.  I am having regard to the normal principles that apply when one is dealing with personal and property rights.  These are rights that are scrutinised carefully by any court of law in this country.  The courts are very jealous of anything that could detract from these rights.  The registrar knows well that that is the principle that will govern any judge in reaching a decision.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That brings me to section 5 and to Deputy Dowling's amendment.  I can understand what is causing the Deputy concern.  In his opinion, this will not <Col N="266" /> be a genuine 50 per cent of people who are given the offer to vote. Secondly, he is concerned in case they would not have the right to register their votes.  My view is that section 3, subsection (1) (c) gives that right and that section 3, subsection (1) (d) makes certain that the notice in received. Section 9, which deals with the registrar's function in the matter, also enforces the principle that justice be done in relation to a merger or to a transfer of engagements.</P>
    <P>If we were to have a different percentage from the simple majority one would have to engage in very complicated drafting and would have to decide on what principle the voting majority would be decided.  As Deputy Moore rightly said, he does not know how the Minister would go about it. It is a complicated situation.  The Deputy might bear in mind that where no majority is stated it is deemed to be the simple majority.  This is normal procedure.  If we were to go for a higher or more complicated majority in this case we would be doing what every Deputy wants to avoid&mdash;putting a hindrance on mergers where the unions or the majority of the workers want to merge.</P>
    <P>If we have a complicated procedure of assessing the voting I could see considerable difficulty arising if the merged union wanted to deal with its properties or funds later on.  That matter is being simplified under this Bill, but I am personally aware of difficulties having arisen in the past in dealing with trade union property. Therefore I should hate to see anything other than the section as drafted, section 5.  If you had a complicated system in section 5 it would mean that in any future dealings with the union's property, even the lodging of the title deeds of the union's offices or property for the purpose of obtaining funds, as is sometimes done when there is a difficult labour dispute or strike and money is needed, difficulty would arise.  They would be precluded from getting money easily in those circumstances by virtue of the fact that any bank accepting that property as security would have to go right back into the business of the ballot that justified the <Col N="267" /> transfer of the assets in the first instance. If it is a simple majority you will not have that difficulty.  I have had this difficulty with clubs, associations and unions when it comes to dealing with the property of such organisations.</P>
    <P>I suggest to Deputy Dowling and Deputy Moore that the matter be left to the Report Stage.  Then, if it needs clarification, if there is any scintilla of doubt, I am certain the Minister will have a statutory formula setting it out in black and white.  I think it is black and white in the Bill as it stands now.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOLeary" hpid="Mr. M. O'Leary Mr. M. O'Leary">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>One of the essential functions of this legislation is that it rids us of what Deputy Esmonde refers to as hindrances in previous legislation and one of the major&mdash;if not the major one&mdash;hindrances in terms of mergers in the past was the requirement of 50 per cent with a 20 per cent majority.  The law itself is an impediment to unions coming together and there is no formula that would get over this.  That is why we are going for the simple majority.  It clears the path of legal obstacles that existed up to now.  It would not, I am sure, be the purpose of Deputies opposite to reintroduce legal obstacles to future union mergers and that would be the effect of Deputy Dowling's amendment.  I know he would not intend it, but that would certainly be its consequence.  We would have struck at the heart of this legislation because right at its centre we would be leaving an unresolved problem, leaving no possibility to those wishing to amalgamate of coming together, because acceptance of amendment No. 7 would put a full stop to any developments in this area.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I could not therefore under any circumstances accept amendment No. 7.  It would defeat the whole purpose of the legislation whose major beneficial consequences is the scrapping of previous legal obstacles with their requirements to have this or that majority when it came to making a decision, so long as we ensure&mdash;as I think we do in this legislation&mdash;that the principle of fairness is observed throughout and that there is a right <Col N="268" /> of appeal by the aggrieved person, who does not feel the requirements of the legislation were carried out.</P>

      <P>Deputy Esmonde made his case so well that he has made me even more uneasy, which may sound contradictory, but the points he has made convince me that another lawyer in another place might be just as effective in arguing that if a person got a postal vote, in fact he had no right to get it under this Bill and the whole thing could be held to be invalid.</P>

      <P>The Minister probably has very good reason for not using the word &ldquo;postal&rdquo; but yet I feel that Deputy Dowling has a very strong point here.  If the Minister would say &ldquo;voting at a meeting or by post...&rdquo; it would seem reasonable.  The Minister's colleague, the Minister for Local Government introduced a postal vote a few months ago for local elections and, in fact, promised that it would probably be extended to parliamentary elections soon.  The principle of postal voting is being more commonly accepted and we probably will have it for Dáil elections in the near future. I cannot therefore understand why the Minister is resisting the suggestion to <Col N="269" /> spell it out further by adding the word &ldquo;postal&rdquo; to section 3 (I) (c).  Perhaps the Minister and Deputy Esmonde know some good reason why it should not be done.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnGrattanEsmonde" hpid="Mr. Esmonde Mr. Esmonde">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMoore" hpid="Mr. Moore Mr. Moore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moore</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, but in the appropriate legislation there is provision for that.  My point is that there is no such provision here.  If the registrar decides that Mr. X may have a postal vote, somebody on the other side may say Mr. X had no right to a postal vote, that it is not in this Bill.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Moore</NameTxt>

      <P>But it is not there in black and white.  It may therefore become a lawyer's battleground.  We could avoid this by including the word &ldquo;postal&rdquo;.  That is my opinion and I am not a lawyer.  Deputy Esmonde made his case so well that I was rather afraid he might reverse his arguments elsewhere and have this procedure declared invalid.  Perhaps that is not a very good type of compliment but that is how I regarded it.</P>

      <P>The Bill states that there must be a fair opportunity to take part in the vote and there is also written into the Bill a written ballot.  Surely both of those together must add up to the fact that a man <Col N="270" /> who cannot, because of various circumstances, actually vote has his right of appeal written into the Bill.  I will repeat that the fundamental problem faced by this legislation was the problem of too many specific requirements in previous legislation preventing any developments in this area. To clear away those unnecessary legal provisions, unnecessary when you consider the in-built guarantees of justice and fairness to all concerned written into this legislation, is one of the principal functions of this legislation. Deputies opposite will miss the whole point of it if they do not see that that is probably its most important feature.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JosephDowling" hpid="Mr. Dowling Mr. Dowling">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dowling</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to assure the Minister that we are just as anxious as he is to remove impediments such as there were in previous legislation.  We are as anxious as the Minister is to see that there is fair play in relation to voting procedures and to the type of majority.  I would go along with the Minister that section 5 as it stands is sufficient provided the other problem is met.</P>
      <P>Deputy Esmonde, who is speaking as a lawyer, said that you cannot put too much in legislation.  It is just as inadvisable to put in too little.  I was a member of a union that merged so I know the many problems involved. I know that funds of that union ended up in lawyers' pockets.  They were the people who were interpreting the legislation and other matters.  A substantial amount of workers' money, accumulated over years, that could have been devoted to the betterment of members' facilities, ended up in the pockets of lawyers.  We want something more clear-cut than we have here to ensure that the same thing does not happen again.  It may be all right for Deputy Esmonde, a lawyer, to be able to read something into this but it should not be necessary for a member of a union or for the members of the executive of a union to pay a lawyer to interpret a particular line to know whether it means voting by post or not.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Moore has made a good point in relation to local elections. Prior to the Bill introduced by the Minister for Local Government, <Col N="271" /> Deputy Tully, to mark a paper was sufficient but it did not mean voting by post, it meant voting in a polling booth.  The Minister for Local Government had to make special provision in the House to enable people to obtain a postal vote.  That particular Minister thought it was necessary in order to ensure that people would be able to vote by post, to bring in legislation for the purpose.</P>
    <P>The Minister must agree that in a merger there are vested interests.  Jobs are lost by some of the officials and they could influence a ballot in the manner I indicated previously.  The Minister must also agree that the most undesirable result would be for the registrar to nullify a ballot.  The morale of the members of the union would certainly be affected by this.  It would be much better if the position were clear-cut and it would take very little to satisfy us.  It is most unreasonable of the Minister not to ensure at this stage that we have written into the Bill the procedure for a postal vote and the fact that votes can be cast by post.  I see the Minister's problem in relation to the amendment being put forward but it was a protective amendment.  The Minister must realise our anxiety to ensure that all members votes are weighted equally and that one vote will not carry the same weight as two votes. This can well happen where manipulation takes place.</P>
    <P>The Minister has endeavoured to ensure that there will be secrecy of the ballot and that every member will have an equal opportunity to vote.  There is still this one defect.  I would ask the Minister to disregard the advice of the lawyers on this occasion and write this into the Bill to satisfy the ordinary trade unionist so that he will be able to read common sense into the Bill and proceed accordingly without consulting the lawyers.  As I said, the funds of the union to which I belong and which merged, ended up in the pockets of the lawyers who were brought in to interpret the previous legislation.</P>

      <P>I do not want to see this happen again.  I do not want to see my money or other members' money going down the drain.  This is the only defect here.  All we are asking is that it be specified in the Bill that every member has the right to ask for and obtain a postal vote.  I would then withdraw the amendment.  But if the Minister will not write that in we will have to insist on some type of majority being indicated to ensure that the votes will be weighted evenly and that there will be some reason in a ballot decision.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelOLeary" hpid="Mr. M. O'Leary Mr. M. O'Leary">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy is anxious that we should avoid legal fees arising out of any interpretation of section 5.  I see very little possibility of any widely differing interpretation of what is implied by section 5. A simple majority is a matter of arithmetic.</P>
      <P>I would again draw Deputy Dowling's attention to the provisions of section 3.  It reads:</P>
      <P>(a)  every member of the union shall be entitled to vote on the resolution;</P>
      <P>(b)  every member of the union shall be allowed to vote without interference or constraint and, so far as is reasonably possible, shall be given a fair opportunity of voting;</P>
      <P>(c)  the method of voting shall consist of the marking of a voting paper by the person voting;</P>
      <P>(d)  the union shall take all reasonable steps to ensure that, not less than seven days before voting on the resolution begins, every member of the union has received a notice in writing complying with subsection (2).</P>
      <P>I have already made it clear that (1):</P>
      <P>the method of voting shall consist of the marking of a voting paper by the person voting;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>gives the right of postal voting.  In addition, the notice which the member receives seven days before must, according to section 3 (2), set out in full the relevant instrument, or give sufficient account of it to enable a recipient of the notice to form a reasonterferenc <Col N="273" /> able judgment of the main effects of the proposed amalgamation or transfer.</P>
    <P>Deputy Dowling has made a plea for layman's language to be used. Obviously if this notice does not set out in a reasonable way for the benefit of the person who will be voting the main effects of the proposed amalgamation or transfer, the person to whom the notice is addressed has a grievance. If it does not set out the instrument in full, it must declare where copies of the instrument may be inspected. Does Deputy Dowling think the registrar could overlook the appeal of a person who was not given an opportunity to examine copies of the instrument, if he was not given them in clear, layman's language?</P>
    <P>Deputy Dowling's amendment, although he does not intend it in this fashion, strikes at the entire usefulness of the legislation which is before us. Deputy Dowling refers to a case in his own union in which many hours, days, months and a great deal of his union's money were spent in obtaining professional and legal advice as to where right lay in regard to a ballot. Section 5 will obviate that.  It will be a simple requirement of a majority decision.  In coming to that majority decision certain criteria have been laid down to ensure that every member taking part in that decision is in full possession of the facts.  He must know the kind of instrument he is voting on; he must have had reasonable notice. He must have had a reasonable opportunity of voting.  If these provisions are not complied with, he can appeal to the registrar who may declare the whole transaction invalid.</P>
    <P>Deputy Dowling is right in saying this is a very big deterrent.  Of course it is.  What union in its senses, coming up to a vote on a merger, realising that all these provisions must be fulfilled, would attempt to indulge in sharp practice?  What commonsense person on any controlling body of a union could think that there was even a remote prospect of success in undertaking certain of the practices which fill Deputy Dowling with alarm?</P>
    <P>The legislation provides, as far as is humanly possible that those who have to make a decision will be enlightened <Col N="274" /> as to the facts of the case.  Naturally no legislation can force knowledge on any person unwilling to imbibe it, but the legislation ensures that the person making the decision will have the full facts available to him.  Therefore it is absured to suggest that a person could be deprived of his vote if Deputy Dowling's amendment is not carried.</P>
    <P>Deputy Dowling paints the picture of a small group of people who may overturn the majority democratic sentiment of an association by saying that a ballot was to take place on an occasion when a representative number of people could not be present.  All the provisions of this legislation would rule out that possibility.  The registrar will know the provisions of this legislation. He will know all the information that must be put at the disposal of the individual union voter.  If any of these provisions is not carried through to the letter, the aggrieved person may appeal to the registrar.  The union authorities involved will know this and will have to comply with these requirements.</P>
    <P>In the situation that existed before, untold obstacles were put in the way of the desire for amalgamations or mergers.  It was a lawyers' paradise. The law, on the one hand, was vague but, on the other hand was specific about certain undertakings that must be carried through.  Nowhere was it more specific than on this matter of the percentage majority.  It was as though the law did not trust the members of the union or association with the control of their own affairs.  While a majority was good enough to decide the Government of the country, when it came to matters such as unions coming together, the law had no trust in majority rule.</P>
    <P>I abide by majority rule and, more than that, I see the necessity to ensure that the majority are given full protection in relation to the decision to be made.  These provisions will ensure that protection.  People will be given the full information seven days beforehand.  That gives adequate time for anyone to form an opinion.  A decision about a merger or amalgamation would have been considered at all levels of the union or association a great length of time before <Col N="275" /> the actual vote took place.  Of course, no vote on a merger or amalgamation by a union could be compared with the vote that takes place in either the trade dispute situation or the wage negotiation situation.  In these cases decisions must be made relatively rapidly.  This could not hold in the case of an amalgamation.  Before the day arrived for a vote of this kind, presumably decisions would have had to be taken at the annual conference of the union concerned, and there would be this filtering process of discussion at various branches.  All of this could not take place in a span of less than a year.  In the span of a year it is not possible for a small minority group, bearing in mind the provisions of this legislation, to create the kind of situation outlined here by Deputy Dowling.</P>
    <P>The major advantage of this legislation is its removal of previous obstacles, its removal of the many specific provisions relating to voting procedures and especially to numbers involved.</P>
    <P>Deputy Dowling said there must have been good reason for these earlier provisions and he referred to changing opinions in this whole area. True, lawyers change their opinions and legal attitudes have changed over the years.  Some years ago those who considered the matter may have believed that the greater the number of small unions the better.  We now know that there is a better chance of individual members having a better union and better facilities within that union if they are members of a union which can employ specialist staffs and meet Government, employers or representative bodies on a footing of equality.</P>
    <P>We know that trade unions no longer must confine their activities to mere wage negotiations.  Increasingly unions must be able to understand the problems of the economy at large and, in order to do that, they must be able to employ staff, international staff, specialist economic staff, the kind of staff competent to translate their members' aspirations into action.  We met unions at the beginning of the autumn <Col N="276" /> months and we will be meeting them increasingly in the months ahead and it certainly serves the national interest when, meeting these unions, we are faced with representatives and staff backed by adequate service in their head offices.  Where the law previously impeded unions coming together this legislation removes that obstacle.  That is a big advance and it should be a solid encouragement to unions to come together.  The last legislation in this area was sometime around 1970.</P>
    <P>Earlier I told Deputy Moore that we cannot force people in free association to come together.  This is on a piece with all legislation attempted in the area of industrial relations.  Legislation must facilitate and encourage.  It cannot coerce because that would be both undesirable and unsucessful, as we know from the experience of those who attempted that course elsewhere. Deputy Dowling is at one with me in his desire to see unions come together. He is at one with me in agreeing with the provisions of this legislation.  He agrees there must be an executive authority within Ireland to govern the affairs of Irish unions.  In this legislation we are putting an end to the situation in which Irish unions were controlled from outside.  This is a first step in a very complicated area.  Since Deputy Dowling is in agreement with the many changes involved in this legislation I would ask him to withdraw this amendment because I believe its acceptance would take us back to a state of affairs we are now intent on leaving, that state of affairs in which the law was itself an actual impediment to the coming together of unions, a costly situation and a complicated area of warring interpretations as to the legal rights and wrongs of unions coming together.</P>
    <P>In section 3 we discharge adequately our duty to ensure members will take part in a fair ballot.  We provide for the principle of majority decision.  If we can form the Government of the country by a majority vote surely we should accept the same principle when it is a question of unions coming together. It smacks of paternalism to suggest that when it is a question of an association of workers coming together <Col N="277" /> the State should step in and suggest a certain percentage majority before a verdict may be recorded as just and reasonable.  I know that is far from Deputy Dowling's mind.  It is the thinking of a period now past and the fact that it is past is something we should welcome.</P>
    <P>Majority vote is a reliable indication of the validity of any decision. Taken in conjunction with section 3 it ensures the union must take all reasonable steps to ensure that not less than seven days before the voting all those entitled to vote must be in full possession of the facts.  The voter must be given all the relevant information to enable the voter to form a reasonable judgement and, if the union does not set out all the terms of the instrument, it must tell the voter clearly where copies of the instrument may be inspected.  If all these provisions in section 3 are not complied with there is an appeal to the registrar.  The union executive committee will know that there is such an appeal.</P>
    <P>Section 3 transforms every union member into a custodian of justice and fairness.  Deputy Dowling knows the area of industrial relations.  He knows it is not an area susceptible of sweeping gestures.  We cannot coerce solutions.  It is an area in which we must persuade and argue and take modest steps along the road to improving things.  This legislation provides that the executive must reside in Ireland and it is hoped that this will result in nudging those members of unions based outside this country in the direction of taking control of their own affairs.  Deputy Dowling is of the same mind as I am on many of these things.  I would appreciate his support in this.  His amendment would mean a lapse back into a past to which none of us wish to return.  We are clearing away now certain legal impediments. Majority rule is something from which we should not depart.</P>

      <P>I agree with most of what the Minister has said.  As a matter of fact I had already said much of what he has stated.

There is a special register for postal votes for the Garda, for the Army and for other people.  There is a difference between this legislation and the legislation dealing with a parliamentary election.</P>
      <P>The Minister should be a little more reasonable on the point we have made asking him to be specific about the postal vote.  As a layman I would ask him to write into the Bill a section that can be clearly understood by trade unionists who have not got a lawyer at their disposal all the time to interpret the Bill and who would like to read the Bill and see that they have this concession.  The Minister feels it is written into the Bill and I feel it is not.  If it is, it should be more specific and it should be clear to union members.  Section 3 (1) (a) provides that every member of the union shall be entitled to vote on the resolution.  He is entitled to vote, but that is as far as it goes.</P>

      <P>The Minister said he will provide in the section for the question of a secret ballot.  If the secret ballot is embodied in the subsection it refers only to a meeting where a show of hands would take place as against a secret ballot.  That indicates to me that if a person on Fastnet Rock or down in Galway put up his hand, his vote could be recorded if this section were not in the Bill.  That is not enough.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dowling</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister should give an assurance that he will use some phraseology that will be understandable to the normal person rather than to lawyers only.  I was a member of a union that merged and the funds of that union were eaten up by lawyers.  I do not want that to happen again.  I have every respect for the viewpoint of a lawyer and it is necessary that we should get the legal viewpoint when compiling legislation.  It would not take very much for the Minister to say yes.</P>

      <P>I say sincerely that the Deputy may be better than <Col N="281" /> my advisers and me at putting it into the kind of language he desires.  We have made the language as understandable as possible to allow for as many contingencies as possible.  If the Deputy sets down his attempt at simple language in this section for Report Stage I will have a look at it. I cannot accept this amendment which would seriously impair the effectiveness of what I have in mind.  When it came to the actual decision by the union going into a merger or an amalgamation I wanted to get away from the requirement of this kind of majority or that kind of majority and, instead, to accept fully the validity of the majority decision with the inbuilt guarantee that it was a decision based on the knowledge and consent of the members involved.  If the Deputy elaborates on section 3 for Report Stage I will look at it favourably.  I have already accepted any points which I felt legitimately could be added without impairing the spirit or the content of the legislation.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="Mr. J. Lynch Mr. J. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Taoiseach <Col N="282" /> if he will make a comprehensive statement on his recent discussions with the French Prime Minister with particular reference to whether any agreement or proposal was made or undertaking given in relation to the regional fund of the European Economic Community.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LiamCosgrave" hpid="The Taoiseach Liam Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>It would not be in accordance with normal practice to reveal details of my discussions with the French Prime Minister.  As the Deputy will appreciate, much of the value of such meetings depends on their confidentiality.</P>
      <P>However, I may say that we discussed the following subjects&mdash;preparations for a possible conference of heads of Government of the member States of the European Community and the proposals for regular meetings of this kind; the regional policy and proposed regional fund of the Community; energy; oil and natural gas; agriculture, including the common agricultural policy of the EEC and certain bilateral problems in relation to Irish exports of sheep and lamb; the improvement of trade and other economic relations between Ireland and France; the furtherance of cultural and educational relations and of scientific co-operation between the two countries; the transfer of the Presidency in the context of the European Community from France to Ireland as from 1st January, 1975; Northern Ireland; Aer Lingus' wish to transfer its operations at Paris from Le Bourget to Orly Airport, and the delimitation of the continental shelf for the purposes of exploration for and exploitation of natural resources.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The proposed regional fund is a matter of concern to every member State of the EEC.  I can say, without any breach of confidentiality, that Monsieur Chirac stated his conviction that the fund was in line with the spirit and philosophy of the Community and that it should be set up quickly.  He also expressed the view, however, that the establishment of a large regional fund which would be invested generally throughout the Community was not consistent with the fight against inflation which <Col N="283" /> France considered to be the priority problem of the moment.  Monsieur Chirac suggested for consideration, that as a compromise, and as an interim stage to a regional fund proper, open to all member States, a smaller temporary fund should be established, for a period of one, two or three years until certain criteria on, say, rates of inflation had been met&mdash; the fund to be invested only in Italy and Ireland.</P>
    <P>I explained the Government's position on a regional fund, including our reservations on the proposed conference of heads of Government.  I indicated that we had noted his suggestion for the fund with considerable interest.  The matter is the subject of continuing discussions.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="Mr. J. Lynch Mr. J. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>I appreciate the suggestion of the Taoiseach that these talks, if they are to be of any value, must remain confidential. Is he aware that my purpose in tabling this question was, in fact, related to M. Chirac's announcement during the course of an interview about this limited regional fund? Would the Taoiseach indicate if there was any question of an undertaking being given by him or through his appropriate Minister, that he supports the establishment of such a limited fund?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LiamCosgrave" hpid="The Taoiseach Liam Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>This matter is the subject of continuing discussions.  I understand a variation of the proposal was made on Monday to the extent that the amount of the fund would be unspecified.  Included in that unspecified fund, the percentage which Ireland would draw was similar to that referred to earlier.  All these proposals are to be again discussed on Monday next.  That is the situation at the moment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="Mr. J. Lynch Mr. J. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Taoiseach be able to indicate, arising out of the meeting of Foreign Ministers earlier this week if the prospect of holding a summit conference next month appeared any brighter?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LiamCosgrave" hpid="The Taoiseach Liam Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>Again, this will come up for discussion on Monday. <Col N="284" /> The position is that Italy and Ireland both reserve their positions on this and a lot depends on what happens on Monday.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RaymondMacSharry" hpid="Mr. MacSharry Mr. MacSharry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacSharry</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Taoiseach hopeful that a regional fund will be operational early next year?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LiamCosgrave" hpid="The Taoiseach Liam Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>As I said, it all depends on the discussions next week and probably subsequent discussions if there is a meeting of heads of Government.  There is, I think I am correct in saying, some support for the idea of an interim regional fund but it depends not only on France and Ireland and Britain and Italy as two other interested countries but also very much on the German attitude.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Leonard</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister not think it would have been time well spent from other duties to assess this?  Does he not realise that many farmers in the planning situation sold their cattle at £4 and £5 per cwt? Had they known of the availability of feed and had a stock census been taken at harvest time, this might not have been the case.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MarkAClinton" hpid="Mr. Clinton Mr. Clinton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Clinton</NameTxt>
      <P>Most people know the number of livestock in the country. They are also aware that there is insufficient fodder, generally speaking. This is not a new phenomenon incidentally. I never remember a year when farmers had enough fodder for the entire winter.  It is not a practical proposition to suggest that within the time available this survey would be completed by the 375 advisers in the field.  We have in excess of seven <Col N="285" /> million cattle and 160,000 farmers. This is not a possibility.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MarkAClinton" hpid="Mr. Clinton Mr. Clinton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Clinton</NameTxt>
      <P>In some parts of the country, mainly western areas, supplies of fodder are likely to be tight this winter.  In view of this I have arranged for the introduction of special measures to help the smaller farmers concerned.  These comprise <Col N="286" /> loans at reduced interest and a feed voucher scheme under which farmers are assisted to buy grain and concerntrates, of which adequate supplies are available.  Disposal of cattle through slaughterings at meat factories and through exports on the hoof have been at record levels for some time past and this reduction of stocks will also help to reduce fodder difficulties.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GerardCollins" hpid="Mr. G. Collins Mr. G. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>On what is the Minister basing his information with regard to the scarcity of fodder? This also applies to Question No. 2.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister satisfied that the grants and the loans at special interest rates are sufficient to enable those with young stock, particularly those in the west and south-west, to buy fodder for their animals?  Is the Minister aware that there is an extreme scarcity of fodder?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MarkAClinton" hpid="Mr. Clinton Mr. Clinton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Clinton</NameTxt>
      <P>I am satisfied they represent a substantial help to people who are in difficulty about fodder. While the maximum amount issued in the first instance is assistance to buy a ton of fodder&mdash;£30 of a subsidy on a ton of fodder&mdash;I am hoping that the fund will be large enough to continue this for the period the people need it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Collins</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="289" /> As I announced on the 8th November, the meat exporters, at my request, agreed in mid-October to contribute 1p per 1b, up to the end of December, on all beef sold into intervention, the proceeds to be used to assist farmers in difficulty to feed young stock over the winter.  Feed vouchers financed under this arrangement have been made available by the Irish Fresh Meat Exporters Society and these are currently being distributed through the local services of my Department and the county committees of agriculture.</P>
    <P>By the end of last week some 21,000 applications for vouchers had been received.  These are being examined as a matter of urgency and the distribution of vouchers, which applicants will use in part-payment for feed, has now commenced.</P>
    <P>It is not possible at this stage to indicate the extent of the likely demand. The amount of money available will, of course, depend on the quantities of beef sold into intervention up to the end of the year.</P>
    <P>With regard to the new subsidised loan scheme which I also announced on 8th November, the number of applications received to date is 210. Sixteen loans, totalling £5,650, have been granted by the ACC.</P>

This has already resulted in an increase in exports to Italy and third countries.</P>
      <P>At my request also, the EEC Commission last week agreed to propose restitutions for the export to third countries of calves and other cattle which do not qualify for the slaughter premium.  These restitutions should further stimulate the export of calves and help the market situation here, if they are agreed.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Meaney</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries if he is aware that meat factories will not accept cattle which have reacted to the brucellosis or tuberculosis tests until March, 1975; and if his Department will make arrangements with the meat factories to have such cattle accepted as a matter of priority.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MarkAClinton" hpid="Mr. Clinton Mr. Clinton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Clinton</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not so aware. There is no undue delay in the acceptance at meat factories of reactors taken up under my Department's brucellosis and tuberculosis eradication schemes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Deputy may, however, have in mind the pre-intensive brucellosis scheme under which the disposal of reactors to meat factories is a matter for private arrangement by the herd-owner. I am aware, and am concerned, that there are delays on the part of meat factories in accepting these reactor cows due no doubt to the large numbers of cattle being offered to them at present.  The matter is essentially one for the proprietors of the meat factories to decide as to the acceptance or otherwise of animals offered to them for slaughter.  I would suggest that herdowners might <Col N="291" /> enlist the support of their farming organisations in prevailing on meat factories to take up, as quickly as possible, reactors disclosed at tests carried out under the pre-intensive scheme.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJVMeaney" hpid="Mr. Meaney Mr. Meaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Meaney</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware that where there are TB reactors very often his officials do not arrive for four or five weeks after being notified? I can give several instances of that.  Does the Minister think it right for the meat factories to refuse those cattle in the not-too-intensive areas? I should like the Minister to make it incumbent on the meat factories to take such animals in immediately they are notified.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MarkAClinton" hpid="Mr. Clinton Mr. Clinton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Clinton</NameTxt>

I had the processors in some months ago concerning this matter and the position was brought up-to-date.  For that reason I cannot understand the allegation made by the Deputy, but if he has any particular instances of this I would be glad to have details.</P>

      <P>What advice would the Minister give to a farmer whose cattle have gone down on the ring test and whose cards have been taken up?  On that account, he is precluded from selling them on the open market and there is a local law in some of the meat factories that they will not accept cattle that will not kill out at a weight greater than 500 lbs.  What advice would the Minister offer a farmer in that case?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MarkAClinton" hpid="Mr. Clinton Mr. Clinton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Clinton</NameTxt>
      <P>There is no law in relation to the acceptance of cattle under 500 lbs.  The demand for cows killing out under 500 lbs. is very poor.  Consequently, the factories are not anxious to take them.  I know there is a special difficulty with regard to these but there is no way in which I can compel factories to take them.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MarkAClinton" hpid="Mr. Clinton Mr. Clinton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Clinton</NameTxt>
      <P>There has been an unusual increase this year in the incidence of ergot poisoning in cattle. As the factors involved in ergot poisoning are many and complex, my Department's veterinary research laboratories are giving all possible advice and assistance to farmers and their veterinary surgeons where cases are brought to notice.  For the coming year my Department will arrange suitable publicity with a view to helping farmers to identify this dangerous fungus which develops in seed heads and to protect their stock against it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJLalor" hpid="Mr. Lalor Mr. Lalor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lalor</NameTxt>
      <P>I asked the Minister if he had any plans to counter the increase in poisoning this year.  The Minister has indicated that the veterinary people propose taking specific steps next year.  I want to find out from the Minister whether there is anything he can do to help farmers whose cattle have become affected by this poisoning this year because there is no way out for them.  Would the Minister consider, in any shape or form, the possibility of having those cattle taken on to some departmental line in view of the fact that factories will not accept cattle affected or even cattle that might be in the early stages of suffering from this ergot poisoning?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MarkAClinton" hpid="Mr. Clinton Mr. Clinton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Clinton</NameTxt>
      <P>As the Deputy knows, this disease is not peculiar to this country.  It is not covered in other countries by any special assistance.  The feeling in the Department is that the maximum that can be done is to publicise the ways and means of avoiding <Col N="295" /> it.  That is, if one is cutting silage and hay, it should be cut before the seed head stage because it is in the seed head that the fungus develops. Beyond that, not an awful lot can be done because there is no treatment for the disease.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickJLalor" hpid="Mr. Lalor Mr. Lalor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lalor</NameTxt>
      <P>Arising from a similar question some time ago, the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister said that those farmers could apply to the ACC for money to restock.  The problem in this regard is restocking, using the silage already creating the poison and putting cattle out on the land affected. Could the Minister not visualise any way in which his Department could help, or make arrangements to help, by providing some type of alternative feeding or accommodation for affected herds and the farmers owning them?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Clinton</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Clinton</NameTxt>

Even if he were satisfied that sufficient restrictions had been imposed on the sale of it, is he aware that many purchasers insist on dispensing it into smaller containers?  Is he aware also that the county physician for Monaghan stated recently that he was able to purchase a container of paraquat without signing the register and that there was also within easy reach 12 bottles which could be stolen by the most amateur thief?

      <P>The Deputy is probably aware that out of the 44 deaths referred to the information I have at least indicates that no more than seven of these were due to accidental poisoning, mainly suicidal poisonings. Of course it is not the only poison that is on the market, but it is readily to hand.  Then there is also the decanting of it, or the putting of it into smaller bottles, which is completely illegal.

One man, in addition to being a cattle owner, drives the town's school children to school in his own minibus and the other two are farmers. Despite repeated warnings all were frequently absent at markets when they were required for duty.  As the situation steadily worsened, in December, 1973 they were informed they must devote all their time to their duties.  In March, 1974, they were warned in writing that failure to carry out instructions&mdash;namely, to be available for duty when required by the inspector&mdash;would lead to summary dismissal.  In August, 1974, they were given a final warning.  There were frequent complaints from anglers and others that the men were not present to protect the area and some members of the anglers' association expressed satisfaction and pleasure at the dismissal of the men.</P>

      <P>This section provides that the instrument of amalgamation or transfer of engagements shall not take effect until registered by the Registrar of Friendly Societies acting in accordance with the procedures laid down in this Bill.  The registrar may not register an instrument before six weeks at least have elapsed since the application for its registration was lodged with him.  The purpose of the six weeks delay is to permit time for any member of the union concerned who may have a grievance, to lodge an appeal against amalgamation with the registrar.</P>
      <P>Of course, the registration could be delayed for more than six weeks while the registrar was considering any complaints made by members.  Again, this buttresses the procedure whereby the union member is informed fully beforehand of facts and that afterwards sufficient time is given for the registrar to consider the complaint.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JosephDowling" hpid="Mr. Dowling Mr. Dowling">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dowling</NameTxt>
      <P>Many unions have a section that deals with amalgamations. One union made available powers to the executive council to set in motion the necessary procedures to carry out the amalgamations.  It also specifies that at least 60 per cent of the fingamatio <Col N="313" /> ancial members of the union cast their votes and that there must be a majority of at least 20 per cent in favour of the executive council's proposals or such a prescribed majority as laid down by any Act of the Oireachtas.</P>
      <P>The Minister has dealt already with the question of numbers and the elimination of the impediments that were in previous legislation but this empowers a merger to take place irrespective of anything there may be in the rules of the trade unions concerned. There may be some very good reasons for various provisions in the rules of trade unions.  For that reason the complete elimination of these rules to satisfy, possibly, the larger of the two unions, would be a matter requiring considerable thought.  We would like the Minister to elaborate on how he proposes to deal with the problems that might arise as a result of changes in the rules of a trade union.</P>
      <P>Sometimes a rule is implemented for a specific reason.  For instance, when I was contesting a post in the union of which I am a member, there was introduced a rule whereby a Member of the Dáil or Seanad was debarred from holding a full-time appointment in the union and also to debar a full-time official of the union becoming a Member of the Dáil or Seanad.  In the event of an amalgamation it might well be that one side might wish to retain some of their rules.  Could this question not be the subject of discussion between the unions concerned in any merger rather than to eliminate the rules that might be of concern to a few members in the larger unions involved?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOLeary" hpid="Mr. M. O'Leary Mr. M. O'Leary">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>What we are endeavouring to do is to ensure that each person voting is in full possession of the facts, that fair criteria are adopted to ensure that as many people as possible vote and that there is recourse to the registrar should any injustice occur.  As these provisions are laid down in this Bill, we are anxious to streamline the rules relating to amalgamations and mergers. Deputy Dowling is right in saying that there are different rules within the <Col N="314" /> various unions, rules that were not drawn up in anticipation of mergers. The adherence to the requirements of our legislation would ensure justice and fairplay.  Therefore, section 2 to 6 should be the dominant ones to apply in all cases of mergers.</P>
      <P>Talking of the earlier amendments, we see there are safeguards built in to ensure that all can take part in voting in a fair and reasonable manner, that the vote should be secret, that there should be notice beforehand and that there should be recourse to the registrar in the event of there being any ground for complaint that these requirements were not adhered to.</P>
      <P>The unions' rules may not have been very clear.  Deputies are aware that one of the big problems in the area of amalgamation is the vagueness of rules in that area.  If the law has been vague, it has impeded progress in this area of amalgamations and mergers but it can be said that the complications have been compounded by the rules of the unions which have been unfair in some respects on the question of deciding whether to merge. It is in consideration of these facts that we seek to have this section substituted for all existing rules.  I am confident that sections 2 to 6 safeguard the individual and insure justice for all those taking part in a ballot.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JosephDowling" hpid="Mr. Dowling Mr. Dowling">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dowling</NameTxt>
      <P>Some unions have rules which make provision for amalgamation or mergers but they also have a section which deals with the alteration of rules.  This Bill would appear to conflict with the right of a union to alter their rules.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOLeary" hpid="Mr. M. O'Leary Mr. M. O'Leary">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>I must emphasise that this Bill is concerned with one problem only.  The rules of a union face in all directions.  They cover such questions as relations with other unions, with other employers, with the State, with the objectives of the unions with inner rules as to how offices should be decided, with limiting the role of the annual conference and many other questions but this Bill is concerned only with laying the groundwork for amalgamation and mergers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="315" /> The Bill is the product of discussions with unions, with the TUC and the ICTU and with employer interests. It is designed solely to serve the purpose of facilitating those unions and associations who have a desire to merge and amalgamate.  That is why it is considered that sections 2 to 6 are an adequate safeguard against both minority and individual rights in a union and that these provisions should supersede existing union rules where these are vague or where they may impede an honest attempt at merging.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JosephDowling" hpid="Mr. Dowling Mr. Dowling">

      <NameTxt>Mr. M. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>No.  We have been over this ground before.  The provisions of sections 2 to 6 guard against any abuse of power either by the union or the majority in the union.  They guard against all possibilities of abuse&mdash;all that can be humanly conceived.  No legislation can guard against all contingencies.  This Bill solely designed to facilitate mergers and amalgamations, has been drawn up in consultation with the unions and their centre who would be most anxious to avoid the problems mentioned by the Deputy.  I think it gives adequate safeguards to individuals.</P>

      <P Just="Center">SECTION 8.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JosephDowling" hpid="Mr. Dowling Mr. Dowling">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dowling</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 8:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In page 4, subsection (1), line 12, to delete &ldquo;the committee of management or other governing body&rdquo;<Col N="316" /> and substitute &ldquo;a Delegate Conference&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>We think the words &ldquo;the committee of management or other governing body&rdquo; should be deleted and instead that we should substitute &ldquo;delegate conference&rdquo;.  A committee of management or governing body could be a very small body which would have the right to make changes that might not reflect the collective will of the majority of the union members.  It is important that the Minister should try to protect the collective will of the union in regard to decisions.  Here the decision is left to a committee of management or other governing body. These are very vague terms.  Does the Minister mean the national executive of the union or its executive or just an ordinary committee of management selected on an <i>ad hoc</i> basis?  A committee of management can mean many things, even management in relation to union property.  Does it mean a committee of management and the governing body would jointly decide or that either would make the rules?</P>
    <P>In any case, we feel this should be done on a much wider basis, that it should be done by a delegate conference where the collective will of the union as a whole might be more fully expressed.  That would be more in keeping with what is required here when the rules, which are such an important part of a trade union, are being altered.  It is only right that each member should have some say either through a delegate conference or on some wider basis than that indicated in section 8.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOLeary" hpid="Mr. M. O'Leary Mr. M. O'Leary">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>Section 8 is different from section 7.  This refers to rule changes that may be necessary in the union which accepts, the acceptor, in a merger.  &ldquo;The committee of management&rdquo;, if there is a higher authority does not exclude it as the section makes it clear that it is the committee of management or &ldquo;other governing body&rdquo;.  That would not rule out the annual conference if that was the relevant governing body.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JosephDowling" hpid="Mr. Dowling Mr. Dowling">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dowling</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister not think it wiser to include the wider <Col N="317" /> delegate conference instead of &ldquo;committee of management or other governing body&rdquo;?  This would avoid referring back to a delegate conference possibly later and would shorten the period of time spent in deliberating rule changes?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOLeary" hpid="Mr. M. O'Leary Mr. M. O'Leary">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>The standard term used as far back at 1871 is &ldquo;committee of management&rdquo;.  I think it is put in a better form here.  There is no possibility of some executive making a decision without recourse to their annual conference on any particular merger or amalgamation.  Full authority is given to &ldquo;or other governing body&rdquo;.  I think that properly safeguards what the Deputy is worried about.  It does not take away from the right of the governing body at the annual conference.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JosephDowling" hpid="Mr. Dowling Mr. Dowling">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dowling</NameTxt>
      <P>My point is that the basis is not wide enough, that a small group of people could make the changes under this section.  The Minister mentioned the 1871 Act.  This is one of the problems of our legislation; we are referring back to Acts of 1871 whose phraseology is not very acceptable and does not entirely give the interpretation required.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOLeary" hpid="Mr. M. O'Leary Mr. M. O'Leary">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>Perhaps I did not explain sufficiently that we are departing from that formula.  In the 1871 Act they say &ldquo;committee of management&rdquo; only and we add &ldquo;or other governing body&rdquo;.  That broadens the matter and guards against the idea that it is the executive committee alone who make the decision.  We make clear that it is the governing body which would differ from union to union but in most cases would be the annual conference.</P>

A known form of language is used to include the things the Deputy is anxious to include in the decision-making <Col N="318" /> process.  &ldquo;Or other governing body&rdquo; includes the annual conference. There is nothing big at issue here.  The legislation does what the Deputy wishes it to do but perhaps in different language.  I am sure we shall not worry too much about the language.</P>

      <P>It may not be but there is a problem here.  If I looked over the list of 90 or more unions in the country.  I imagine I should find one committee known by a particular name and it would mean I would have to go around all the unions and have a special schedule to the Bill to say that this means x, y, and z.  That is the difficulty when you use formulations that do not have the advantage of past usage to indicate their exact significance. I agree it would be wrong if we simply had &ldquo;committee of management&rdquo; but by adding &ldquo;or other governing body&rdquo; we ensure that it applies to all the cases we know.</P>

      <P>There is a committee of management in my union to deal with the hall or the premises.  Could that committee make a decision?  That is the only committee of management there is.  If the wording was &ldquo;and other governing body&rdquo; or if some wider basis were specified, perhaps it would tend to mean the executive power governing the union, not the delegate conference.  Does the Minister not agree that &ldquo;delegate conference&rdquo; would be the acceptable term?</P>

      <P>This is one of the problems.  The parliamentary draftsman uses standard phraseology going back to 1871.  I agree with the Minister that it is sometimes hard to interpret. We should get away from this <Col N="319" /> type of phraseology and up-date it to conform with present day requirements and what is accepted generally in terms of executives or managements or specify some particular body so that there would be no vagueness in the legislation.</P>

I can assure him it does the things the Deputy wishes it to do. Here we have a difficult task of wedding formulations of past practice with modern ideas.  I hope that is what we do here.  &ldquo;The committee of management&rdquo; is a phrase used as far back as 1871.  We have added to that the concept of a governing body which widens the scope of decision-making in the union.  This becomes as near the universal as it is possible to have in legislation of this kind.</P>

It is the committee that is authorised to sign on behalf of the union, say, when they have decided to merge. &ldquo;Management committee&rdquo; is a well known phrase.

With the in-built guarantees in this legislation there will be no victimisation or injustice for any of those involved.  This section simply enables the union accepting the members to give a decision making their acceptance legal.  The phrase used is &ldquo;committee of management or other governing body&rdquo;. By the addition of &ldquo;governing body&rdquo; we widen the area of decision and yet I would not wish to change the <Col N="322" /> language of it because it has a long history and over the years has meant precise things.

      <P>I move amendment No. 10:&mdash;</P>
      <P>In page 5, between lines 36 and 37, to insert the following:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(2) Where any land of which the ownership is registered under the Registration of Title Act, 1964, becomes vested by virtue of this section, the registering authority under that Act shall, upon payment of the appropriate fee, register the appropriate trustees in the appropriate register maintained under that Act as owner (within the meaning of that Act) of the land.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="328" /> This amendment provides that the property of each of the unions involved shall pass to the new union, without any conveyance, assignment or assignation. The property will vest in the appropriate trustee as defined under section 10 (3) when the instrument of amalgamation or transfer has taken effect or when the trustees have been appointed, whichever is the later.  This is a complicated area of real property legislation and it refers to the question of registering land to ensure minimum difficulty in the transfer of such land. That is why this amendment is necessary, so I am advised, to cover cases where registered land is a factor.</P>

Is there no way in which the Minister for Industry and Commerce could be made completely responsible for carrying this Act into effect?

      <P>The Deputy has raised an interesting point.  To speed the passage of this legislation I thought it better to put this provision in this form because the power to make regulations in regard to friendly societies is vested in the Minister for Industry and Commerce by virtue of section 2 (1) (b) and section 13 (6) of the Trade Union Act of 1871.  This power was not transferred to the Minister for Labour when a former administration set up this Department in 1966.  I agree it would be preferable that there should at least be a division in the Registry of Friendly Societies dealing solely with this.  I shall undertake to bring in at a later stage&mdash;it is not that important now&mdash;an amendment removing these powers from the Ministry for Industry and Commerce to whomsoever will be Minister for Labour, so the Deputy need not worry when he is over here in the years ahead.</P>

      <P>What does the Minister mean by &ldquo;exceptional&rdquo; expenses?  Do these cover the entire area of delegate conferences, legal advice and all the other fairly expensive things involved in a merger?  Exceptional circumstances would be circumstances presumably of a rather exceptional nature to be determined by some legal person.

      <P>I think the Deputy is trying to achieve the same thing as I am attempting to achieve here.  I examined the Deputy's amendment to see if &ldquo;reasonable&rdquo; would be a better word to use, but I am informed that if it were substituted, I would have to satisfy myself that the expenses were in fact, reasonable in the sense of being good value for money.  This is a task upon which I should not care to embark.  Any action on the part of the union exceptionally connected with the merger or amalgamation will be covered by this word &ldquo;exceptional&rdquo;. It will cover legal expenses, printing, postage, legal advice and the compensation of redundant trade union officials, should such redundancy occur, and &ldquo;exceptional&rdquo; is the best way, I am advised, to meet all these particular expenses consequent on merger or amalgamation.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 13:</P>
      <P>In page 7, between lines 15 and 16, to insert the following section:</P>
      <P>(1) Notwithstanding Part II of the Act of 1941 and section 2 of the Act of 1971, a body of persons which is a trade union under the law of another country and has its headquarters control situated in that country shall not hold or be granted a negotiation licence under that Part unless, in addition to fulfilling the relevant conditions specified in section 7 of the Act of 1941 and section 2 of the Act of 1971, it fulfils the condition specified in subsection (2).</P>
      <P>(2) The condition referred to in subsection (1) is that the trade union concerned has a committee of management or other controlling authority every member of which is resident in the State or Northern Ireland and which is empowered by the rules of that trade union to make decisions in matters of an industrial or political nature which arise out of and are in connection with the economic or political condition of the State or Northern Ireland, are of direct concern to members of the trade union resident in the State or Northern Ireland and do not affect members not so resident.</P>

      <P>&ldquo;Any serving trade union official who loses his employment or who suffers a worsening of his terms or conditions of employment as a result of an amalgamation of trade unions under this Act shall be paid compensation.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>This is a fairly straightforward issue. The Minister said earlier that there is adequate provision in section 14 to ensure that reasonable expenses may be paid in the case of people who suffer a worsening of their conditions or become redundant as a result of an amalgamation.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 15:</P>
      <P>Before section 17 to insert a new section as follows:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;The members of an amalgamating trade union, which has not got a political fund, shall, upon becoming members of an amalgamated union with such a fund, be deemed to have opted out of such fund.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This is a most important amendment. It is self-explanatory.  We should not put the onus on a trade union member to declare himself on a political basis. If he is a member of a union which had not got this fund, I believe he <Col N="336" /> should be deemed to have opted out of the fund.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOLeary" hpid="Mr. M. O'Leary Mr. M. O'Leary">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>This Bill contains no specific provision in relation to political objectives or funds of trade unions.  These questions are dealt with in the Trade Union Act, 1913.  The effect of that Act is that, if a member of a trade union does not wish to contribute to the political fund of his union, he has right to contract out or opt out.  The adoption of Deputy Dowling's amendment would involve a reversal of the position obtaining at present and would mean that a member would have to contract into the fund of a new amalgamated union.  I cannot see any good reason for this change in a situation which has been unchanged since 1913.  Therefore, I do not see the point in accepting the amendment.  The union member always has the right under the 1913 Act of opting out of a political fund. I do not think we should reverse that situation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMoore" hpid="Mr. Moore Mr. Moore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moore</NameTxt>
      <P>After 61 years does the Minister not think that we should avail of Deputy Dowling's amendment to alter that situation?  There is something wrong if a person must opt out of a thing rather than opt into it.  While the machinery for opting out is fairly simple, why should a man have to do this irrespective of what his political opinions are?  The Minister should avail of this opportunity to change that Act, or he should promise that in the new comprehensive Trade Union Bill, which we hope will be coming before the House soon, he will delete such a provision so that each trade unionist will not have to opt out and, if he wants to subscribe to the political fund of the union he can opt in.  Not only would this prove his loyalty to his ideals but he would have to go to the trouble of opting in.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If a person wants to opt out at the moment he goes to the Department, asks for a form and fills it in.  If he does not do that, he has to pay money to the political fund.  This is grossly unfair.  Deputy Dowling's amendment should be supported.  It is wrong to say that a man must pay unless he opts out. There may be claims from other <Col N="337" /> organisations who will say: &ldquo;You must pay to our political fund unless you opt out.&rdquo;  This raises the question of how free a man is.</P>
    <P>The Minister said this morning that not since 1917 had legislation to deal with trade unions been introduced here. This archaic Act became law four years earlier.  Each successive British Government has changed their Act several times.  We do not want that.</P>
    <P>The Minister should be reasonable and accept Deputy Dowling's amendment. This would be seen all over the country as a demonstration of the Government's awareness of the need to show that they are impartial in this matter.</P>

      <P>There are only nine trade unions in this country with political funds.  If the Deputies have strong views on this matter, they put down amendments in the general area of trade union legislation rather than this specialised Bill which deals with mergers and amalgamations of unions.  Since it is not appropriate to the present legislation, I appeal to Deputies not to seek to incorporate it in this Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>

      <P>When will the Minister bring in the new Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JosephDowling" hpid="Mr. Dowling Mr. Dowling">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dowling</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not see this the same way as the Minister.  In my view the political fund should be abolished. We know of difficulties experienced in the past by people who did not opt out. It is regarded in some places as protection money.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If a union amalgamating with another which has a political fund felt so strongly in the past that it was necessary to ensure that their union was not associated by means of a political fund with any political organisation, their views should be respected in the merger.  I am a member of a trade union which has no political fund.  If they merged with a larger union which had a political fund it would be an impediment from my point of view in voting support for that merger.  If I were to say I wanted to opt out, I would be exposing myself to some unscrupulous shop steward or section secretary.  There <Col N="338" /> are very genuine trade union officials in many unions with political levies. Nevertheless, those levies have been used as a yardstick to blackmail people to do certain things.  Where mergers are concerned, we should have a positive undertaking from the Minister that if one of the unions has not a political fund they will not be forced into a political fund and then have to opt out.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOLeary" hpid="Mr. M. O'Leary Mr. M. O'Leary">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>That situation does not obtain.  As I said already, there are only nine unions which have political funds.  We are dealing with a problem of 80 or 90 unions.  It is not particularly germane to the objectives of this legislation to consider special legislation to deal with the political funds of unions.  We are dealing here with mergers and amalgamations.</P>
      <P>To reiterate&mdash;the question of the political fund of unions is covered in the 1913 Act.  Under that Act, if a member of a trade union does not wish to contribute to a political fund, he has to contract or opt out.  The Deputy's suggestion would be a reversal of that procedure.  Now we come to the situation where one union without a political fund amalgamates with a union which has such a fund. Under the 1913 Act the members of the amalgamated union of the new totality must be given an opportunity of voting and passing a resolution on the adoption of political objectives and funds by the new amalgamated union.  That surely meets Deputy Dowling's objections.  Where one which has, unites with one which has not, there must be a vote by all concerned to see if they wish to have a political fund.  That obtains now under the law.  I suggest, therefore, that there is not enough substance in this legislation for Deputy Dowling's misgivings.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JosephDowling" hpid="Mr. Dowling Mr. Dowling">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dowling</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not agree.  It is the larger unions which have the political funds.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelOLeary" hpid="Mr. M. O'Leary Mr. M. O'Leary">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. O'Leary</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JosephDowling" hpid="Mr. Dowling Mr. Dowling">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dowling</NameTxt>
      <P>No, we cannot deprive them under this old British Act of 1913.  In my view this is a new ball <Col N="339" /> game.  We have here the situation where people decided over the years against a political fund now merging with a union which has a political fund.  They must accept the rules of the bigger union so far as the political levy is concerned.  They must pay or opt out.  If it is against their principles to pay, during the period which will elapse before they can opt out, they must pay the political levy.  As the Minister knows, they cannot opt out immediately.  This can only happen at certain periods of the year.  Under those circumstances, a person would be forced to pay the levy against his will until such time as he can opt out. Where a political fund is involved in a union merging, they should be deemed to be opting out.  If that were embodied in the Bill it would mean that members' principles would not be damaged by this hurtful situation.</P>
      <P>The Minister should indicate that he is prepared to accept this amendment which will not cause any undue grief to the larger unions.  If there are members of the new union who wish to pay the levy, it will be easy to make the necessary arrangements.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOLeary" hpid="Mr. M. O'Leary Mr. M. O'Leary">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>As I have explained, a vote must take place in existing legislation where members of one association who do not have a political fund have the right to vote in the new amalgamated union about whether they should have a political fund.  That is their right and will not be impaired by this legislation.  In all cases union members, even where political funds exist, have the right to opt out.  There are only nine unions with political funds.  To assist in exorcising any nightmares which Deputy Dowling may have, the amounts of money involved in the political funds at the disposal of candidates standing for election are very small.  I sympathise with the Deputy.  There is a serious situation here whereby private funds can be at the disposal of candidates in elections and this may, in fact, devalue the whole electoral process.  I would remind him that the unions with the political funds under the law under the Registry of Friendly Societies must <Col N="340" /> publish their accounts in that area at least once a year.</P>
      <P>If that example was followed by the many private interests which have supported political candidates over the years to the extent of hundreds and thousands of pounds, sometimes involved in organisations for that purpose, our political life might be healthier and things abroad, such as Watergate, might not have occured. This is quite apart from the legislation before us.  It is an interesting debate but not appropriate to this legislation. I appeal to Deputy Dowling whom I know has strong feelings on this matter to reserve those feelings for a better and more appropriate time.  I would be happy to meet him in an equal spirit of change in this area when we come to, as I think we should, amend all of the mistakes of the Electoral Act, 1963.</P>
      <P>In my opinion that was bad legislation which, unfortunately, was agreed by all Members at that time.  It puts no ceiling on expenditure in elections and that appears to go against the spirit of one man one vote at elections.</P>

      <P>If Deputies opposite are anxious at any time to amend electoral practices I will be the first to join them because I feel they are in need of serious amendment. However, this legislation is not the appropriate vehicle for a discussion of that kind.  Under this legislation members of unions may vote on the desirability of having a political <Col N="341" /> fund and may at all times opt out of a political fund if one exists.  There is nothing to be concerned about in the present situation.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanMoore" hpid="Mr. Moore Mr. Moore">

      <NameTxt>Mr. M. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>This is a two-way process and is a debate for another day.  The political fund of unions is used in open support of political candidates at elections.  There is full disclosure of such accounts and the entire expenditure involved is pretty small by election standards of expenditure. Speaking as a candidate supported by a union at elections I would be prepared to enter into any serious debate leading to a change in the law, a change which would force into the open all subscriptions from all sources at elections.  The entire principle of secret assistance given to candidates from private sources is against the whole spirit of democratic performance at elections.  That is a debate for another time.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dowling</NameTxt>
      <P>Assuming that a merger between a small union and a large union takes place in the middle of January, if that small union opted out would they have to pay, before the end of that year, the political levy?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOLeary" hpid="Mr. M. O'Leary Mr. M. O'Leary">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>I presume the Deputy knows what the average political levy is.  In my own union it is about 1p per month.  It is so small that the paperwork involved in its removal from the union's rules would hardly pay for it.  The levy exists in a number of unions but it is a small sum when compared with what I think is spent by private sources at elections.  It is subject to full disclosure.  The individual who does not wish to participate in the political funds of a union can opt out.  He has that free and democratic choice.  Such a choice is not given to the consumer who must pay private companies for their expenditure at elections.  There is no possibility that the person who buys goods from Mr. X or houses from Mr. Y can prevent money passing from that private source <Col N="342" /> to a political party.  That right is with the individual union member.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>Such a person, if he wishes to opt out, can do so immediately after the merger.  If a fund exists only on one side a vote will have to take place.  If the vote disappointed a member he could withdraw from paying the levy.  I do not see any grounds for worry on this matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JosephDowling" hpid="Mr. Dowling Mr. Dowling">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dowling</NameTxt>
      <P>This is a matter of principle.  The small amount involved might be considered a large price to pay for one's principle.  People who have opted out at any price would consider it a large price to pay.  We could have a union, after prolonged discussion, deciding not to have a political fund but when they merge with a larger group with a political fund the result of the ballot would be a foregone conclusion.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>The associations of people involved in unions who have political funds see the necessity of having a fund to support particular candidates at elections to forward the interests of that particular association or union.  They exist in a situation where there is no investigation of the amount of cash private interests spend at elections in influencing candidates, nor is there any check in this House as to which Deputy is supported by which private company.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dowling</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not satisfied with the explanation given by the <Col N="343" /> Minister.  The Minister has covered a wide field but my point is appropriate to this debate.  There is a principle involved.  There is the question of the wider aspect when the rules change.  The Minister knows that where large unions, with a political levy, merge with a smaller union, without a political levy, the smaller group have to fall into line with the majority decision.  The individual members then have to go to the secretary, complete a form and have it signed.  Such members would have their names posted in the hall to indicate they were opting out.  Such notices are on display to the general membership who would be aware of the political associations of these people.</P>
      <P>The Minister is under an obligation to provide protection for union members who have principles such as I outlined.  I feel strongly about the political fund and I feel that members of unions should have the right to subscribe to any political party. There is no provision made for supporting Fine Gael or Fianna Fáil in the form of a political levy.  This is unjust and in some cases it is regarded as protection money.  I am aware that persons who, when they wished to opt out of paying the political levy, went to their shop stewards were told that in the event of lay-offs or other difficulties they would not have the same protection as the member paying the political levy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That type of approach certainly has soured many people.  It is blackmailing the individual into the retention of the political fund.  When this situation arises I feel we should at least expose it or have it corrected.  As Deputy Moore has said, it may be an impediment to a merger.  We go all the way with the Minister in eliminating all the impediments. Whether they be in relation to the time factor, voting procedure or anything else, we have met them in full.  We do not feel it unreasonable to ask the Minister to meet us on this simple issue, that in the case of two unions amalgamating, the union with no political fund would be deemed to have opted out, because they had not <Col N="344" /> got it at the time of the merger.  They are forced into a situation which means they are now in the fund&mdash;notwithstanding the fact that they did not wish to be&mdash;and they are going to opt out.  Surely this is unreasonable and places a large burden on a group of individuals.  As the Minister has said, the amount they receive is fairly small and the paper work is fairly substantial. Therefore there should be no real reason why the Minister would not agree to this simple amendment of the Bill and I would ask him to reconsider this matter.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOLeary" hpid="Mr. M. O'Leary Mr. M. O'Leary">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>The only point for legislation&mdash;to answer a point made here&mdash;is that where there is need for such a change, one considers it.  But existing legislation gives the individual person who does not agree with a political fund the right of opting out.  He may opt out of his obligation to subscribe to a political fund or levy in his union.  Also, where such does not exist&mdash;and coming within the amalgamations and mergers terms&mdash;he has the right, in a general vote, to determine whether or not a political fund should exist in the situation after amalgamation where one union does not have a political fund.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Both of these are covered in existing legislation.  That is why I cannot see how the point arises.  I sympathise with the Deputy in a common feeling that we should look at the whole area of expenditure in elections.  I have taken part in by-elections in which I have seen on the part of certain political parties&mdash;I am referring now to the past&mdash;as much money spent in the three weeks of a by-election campaign as was in the entire political funds of all the unions of the country for one year.  In principal I am against the idea that the democratic decision of a people in a constituency in a general election should be swaved by funds from private sources.  Our legislation in this area is seriously at fault.  But that is an argument and a battle for another day.  The political fund and levy we have under the unions at present at least has the virtue that its amount is fully disclosed each year, that there is full accountability to the executives and governing bodies, full <Col N="345" /> notification to the Press of those who benefited from the funds of the union. However we cannot in the existing situation ask the unions to abolish their political funds when others are free secretly to support politicians in elections to carry out what they think should be carried out in the economic arena.</P>
    <P>Chiefly my objection is that it is not appropriate to this legislation.  That is why I would ask the Deputy to look at the rights which exist at present under the 1913 Act which amply meet his concern about members being forced to pay into funds to which they feel no loyalty.  There are full rights in the existing situation for them to protect their scruples in this matter.  I do not know of any examples but I would imagine it is a matter for lawyers, certainly a matter for the courts, if the Deputy can substantiate the charges he has made here that it is being used as a form of blackmail, that people who sought to contract and opt out of political funds have been issued with the kinds of threats mentioned by the Deputy.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Moore</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister in his last statement has opened up a whole new dimension in this Bill.  I want to see this Bill go through quickly but I am forced now to take issue with the Minister on his most recent statement.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>First of all, Deputy Dowling and I are not interested in the matters the Minister has just mentioned.  We feel that this political levy&mdash;as it will be operated under the new Bill&mdash;will be a disincentive to amalgamation.  We asked the Minister to remove this in an endeavour to help him.  But the Minister does not see the point that, if he does not accept Deputy Dowling's amendment, we will have the situation of, say, trade union A, wanting to amalgamate with trade union B.  But they see that, if they do so, they will <Col N="346" /> be forced to opt out of a levy.  Therefore, why can the Minister not start off with a clean sheet and say: &ldquo;A and B have amalgamated.  Therefore there is no onus on a man to opt out.  If he wants to support a political levy, let him opt for remaining in?&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Why did the Minister, Deputy Dowling, Deputy Esmonde or I join a party?  Because we believe in these parties and went to the trouble of joining them.  But it would be very peculiar indeed were somebody to say to me: &ldquo;You are a Fine Gael supporter.&rdquo;  Were I to ask: &ldquo;Why?&rdquo;  he might reply: &ldquo;You have not opted out of being a Fine Gael supporter.&rdquo;  That would be altogether ridiculous.  Yet we are going to make these people pay money.  I agree with the Minister that there are about nine unions only who operate these funds. In my own union it amounts to about 40p a year, I think, at present.  I do not pay it; I have been excused from it.</P>

      <P>I went over to the Department of Industry and Commerce at the time and asked for the appropriate form to opt out of a union.  First of all, the official whom I met looked at me strangely.  He then retreated into the archives and produced a yellow-coloured old sheet and said: &ldquo;That is it&rdquo; and flung it there. Having deciphered its contents and signed it, I opted out of the union.  I want to say, in fairness to the union, that nobody took exception to this.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelOLeary" hpid="Mr. M. O'Leary Mr. M. O'Leary">

    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="347" /> The Minister continued then to a discussion of the broad outline of support for political parties at election times.  I am with the Minister&mdash;that we should probe all gifts given to political parties from private individuals and so on.  At the same time the Minister is denying us an opportunity of discussing this by not bringing forward new legislation on which it would be more appropriate so to do. The Minister is doing more harm to his own Bill in that, by not accepting Deputy Dowling's amendment, he is putting up a barrier to possible amalgamations between different unions.  If there are only nine unions having this political levy, and therefore only nine unions out of which one would have to opt, the Minister will see that the other 84 unions may well turn their faces against amalgamation. If the other 84 unions have no political levy at present why should they amalgamate with a union which has, so that their members may be forced to pay this political levy to an organisation in which they do not believe?  The Minister should accept the suggestion of Deputy Dowling here, who has put a lot of thought into this matter, who is very experienced in trade union legislation, who in a big-hearted way is endeavouring to help the Minister's Bill through quickly.  Then in the future, when the Minister introduces his new Trade Union Bill, we will be given an opportunity of discussing the many facets of the financing of political parties, whether it be done through a party affiliated to the trade union movement, affiliated to a certain party, or whether we want to take, say, Fianna Fáil, Fine Gael or other parties of the future.  I am all for the probing of these subscriptions from private individuals or concerns.</P>
    <P>I do not say there is anything wrong with them but the point is that the Minister has raised this so much on this Bill that he must now give us an opportunity to go at length into how a political party may be financed, should a trade union have a political fund, should a member opt out or opt in or is it reasonable that a man should have to go through the exercise <Col N="348" /> of opting out of supporting a political fund in which he does not believe.  These are all questions which need to be answered.  We are dealing with the Bill in relation to the amalgamation of unions and we are not going into the broader aspects of this matter.  I suggest to the Minister, in order to save many more hours of discussion on this Bill, that he accept Deputy Dowling's amendment and then say to his colleagues that he intends to bring in a new Trade Union Bill which will deal very widely with all aspects of the financing of political funds.  He could give this and the other House an opportunity of probing how political parties are financed and if there is anything wrong with the way this is done.  We could then change it.  I suggest the Minister cannot come in here and throw out innuendos about private subscriptions to political parties and not give the House a chance of legislating on the alleged abuse which he has intimated.</P>
    <P>It gives me no pleasure to go on to discuss this very simple and worthy amendment of Deputy Dowling.  This amendment would be acclaimed by trade unions, whether or not they pay a levy.  As the Minister said, the total money from this levy does not amount to much.  We are not arguing that it does.  Deputy Dowling and I feel there is a matter of principle involved here.  Surely legislation must deal first of all in principles.  We also feel that if the Minister does not accept Deputy Dowling's amendment it will harm the Bill and make it a less useful incentive towards the amalgamation of trade unions.</P>
    <P>We have got 93 trade unions and congress and everyone will agree that is too many.  We know we have got to encourage these unions to amalgamate. You cannot expect them to amalgamate unless they are offered good legislation and good incentives. There are a few very good things in this Bill but I suggest that the Oireachtas should be careful to remove something which is not good in it.  Deputy Dowling's amendment is an admirable way for doing this and I cannot see why the Minister will not accept it.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="349" /> I know the Minister sincerely hopes that this Bill will be availed of by the 93 trade unions as a means of coming together and amalgamating.  I do not know what the ideal number of trade unions is.  They have got such a small number in West Germany, Denmark and on the Continent generally that, perhaps, we could study this and even suggest that X number of trade unions would be suitable to look after the interests of half a million industrial workers.  We are not serious about this if we refuse to accept a reasonable proposal like Deputy Dowling's amendment which would take out one of the abrasive matters in the trade union movement, that is, that a person must opt out.</P>
    <P>I do not know why the farmers in the British House of Commons who passed this Act in 1913 had this in. British Governments changed this and there has been a tug of war over there between both sections where one Government changed it and the next one changed it back to its original form.  I believe we can be superior in our deliberations on our legislation in perfecting a Bill so that it will do what the Minister and the Government want it to do.  We, like the Government, want this Bill to be an encouraging instrument in reducing the number of trade unions from 93 to a manageable number.  While the Minister says he wants to encourage trade unions to amalgamate, by retaining the political levy part of the Bill, he will discourage them from amalgamating.</P>
    <P>The Minister in his role of trade union official before he came into the House knows that 93 trade unions do not make for industrial peace.  Some of the strikes we have had in the past have been caused by the multiplication of unions.  Does the Minister intend to give this Bill the full scope to be the effective instrument he wants it to be to encourage the trade union members to say that 93 trade unions are too many, that they must get together?  There are many fields where the trade unions could get together. The slogan of the Minister's own union, of one big union, is an admirable one.  This is an ideal we should <Col N="350" /> seek after but we will not get it if, in fact, the ground for this total amalgamation is so loaded against certain people that they will not amalgamate. We should try to find out what the trade unions will agree on rather than what they will disagree on in order to encourage this new movement of amalgamation.</P>
    <P>I believe if the Bill is to be availed of by the trade unions it may well be a big step on the road towards industrial peace.  I do not believe we have the worst record for industrial strikes but I believe we could improve our standing at the moment.  It is up to us to ensure that the legislation we put forward has all the abrasive ingredients removed and any trade unionist, whatever his political outlook may be, can say, that he totally agrees with the amalgamation of his union with another union or several unions.  He will not say this if before he amalgamates he sees the ground already laid whereby he may have to do something which he had not to do in his own union, that is he may have to go to the Department of Labour and ask for a form that he should opt out of paying a political levy.  I agree with the Minister that the money taken in this way is not very great but this political levy is a matter of principle for many trade unionists and they do not want to pay it.  Why should they have to go to the trouble of opting out?  If a man believes in this thing let him opt in, let him back up his convictions with his actions and say that he believes in paying the political levy, that he will pay it cheerfully.</P>
    <P>I know the Minister wants this Bill to be a contribution towards amalgamation and towards a more well-ordered and peaceful industrial sector but he is only harming his own legislation by being so dogmatic on this point and refusing to accept Deputy Dowling's amendment which would vastly improve the Bill.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>I suggest that we have gone over and over again some of the points raised.  There has been a great deal of repetition, some of it on my part, and I would now ask Deputy Dowling to withdraw the amendment.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnCallanan" hpid="Mr. Callanan Mr. Callanan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Callanan</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not like this provision about opting out.  I have experience in another walk of life where a levy was put on people for the benefit of another organisation, a very worthy one.  I was the one man to object to the stopping of this money because I thought the first thing we should do was to give an option.  It is not very easy for a person to go along and say he will not pay.  It is a thing people do not like to do.  Very recently I met a member of my political organisation who is a member of a trade union and who pays a political levy.  I asked him why he is paying it and he said: &ldquo;You would never know what backlash there might be&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>I am not saying there is a backlash, but some people have the opinion that if a levy is there and if they do not pay it there may be the danger of a backlash.  Collect such a levy by all means, but give the option to a person to pay or not to pay.  I think this is the point of principle that is in Deputy Dowling's amendment&mdash;that a person should opt in instead of having to opt out, having to fill a form and declare openly.  We in politics do not mind declaring openly, standing up and being counted, but there are hundreds of people who do not want to stand up and be counted.  They are paying this levy and they are paying levies to other organisations against their will.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This involves the principle of freedom of the individual.  In this respect I am talking about all payments, all extractions from people throughout the country.  These should be purely optional.  I thoroughly agree with the Minister in regard to companies backing this or that political organisation, but in this matter we are passing legislation. What can one do if a company decide&mdash;it is not likely to happen&mdash;to back the likes of me?  What can you do with them if they gave me £1,000 to fight an election&mdash;what could this Parliament do about it?  However, in this legislation we can lay down the rule that a person has the right, if he wants to pay a levy, to opt in, but in principle it is not right that he should have to sign a form to opt out.  In many organisations throughout the country there are these extractions <Col N="352" /> instead of voluntary contributions. Deputy Dowling's amendment would provide for opting in instead of opting out.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOLeary" hpid="Mr. M. O'Leary Mr. M. O'Leary">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>Very briefly I would say to the Deputy that one cannot prevent companies from paying out certain moneys if they so wish.  One can arrange that there be a ceiling in electoral expenses by law as is provided in other countries.  We departed from that here in 1963 and I think it was a mistake.  That is a debate for another day.  I allow that all of these matters should be looked at in their totality&mdash;how we support political parties, how their expenses are maintained, how elections are run.  That is all of the one piece.</P>
      <P>The legislation before us simply deals with mergers and amalgamations. A person who has a conscientious objection to participating in a fund is already protected by the law.  Deputy Dowling has said there have been instances of blackmail and of threats received by individuals.  If there have been such cases, then he should come forward with them.  I am not aware of any such threats or blackmails.  Deputy Moore's case is not the only one. I know of many people throughout the country who, because of honest disagreements, have withdrawn from political levies and are still good members within those unions, retaining full trust and leadership capacity within those unions.  There are only nine unions having political funds.  For these reasons, for the major reason that this is not a subject matter for this legislation, I suggest Deputy Dowling withdraw that amendment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JosephDowling" hpid="Mr. Dowling Mr. Dowling">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dowling</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Moore pointed out that we wish to eliminate any irritant to people coming together in mergers.  A political fund in our estimation could cause and might cause a considerable problem for people who have fairly strong views. Up to this point in the debate the Minister had been very reasonable, particularly on arguments put forward by this side of the House.  However he has been exceptionally biased on this aspect.  He endeavoured to widen the scope of the debate and to discuss <Col N="353" /> matters far removed from the subject of mergers.</P>
      <P>It is not just good enough to say there are other factors involved in relation to election funds that must be discussed.  There are factors in relation to every aspect of our lives that must be discussed from time to time in the House, that need to be updated.  I will not deal with the broader questions of subscriptions to political parties.  The Minister indicated there are only nine unions involved here.  I will now give statistics in this respect which are very important. Deputy Moore suggested that the number of unions we have here is too great but he was not able to say what would be a reasonable or proper number.</P>
      <P>In his Second Reading speech the Minister told us that the West German Trade Union Federation cater for 6,400,000 people in 16 industrial unions.  Here there are nine unions where there are political levies.  In the ESB there are 21 unions, representing 11,000 employees.  Assuming that the nine unions which pay political levies were in the ESB, there would still be a fair number of unions there who might want to amalgamate and might feel that the political levy was an irritant.  In CIE there are 33 unions representing 21,000 workers, and the same argument applies.  In Guinness's there are 18 unions representing 2,200 employees.</P>
      <P>Assuming that the nine unions were in this group of 18 half of them would be unions with no political funds and, therefore, they might consider this an irritant.  Gouldings have 12 unions representing 700 employees.  One can see that in sectors where there is a substantial number of unions, bodies like CIE, Guinness and the ESB, this might be regarded as an irritant. People may have second thoughts about mergers if they have to bury their principles in order to have such mergers.  In the case of a merger I would want the position clarified to my own satisfaction and that of my union.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister has been very unreasonable and he has shown himself to be absolutely biased against this <Col N="354" /> amendment.  He has thrown in all kinds of red herrings and has endeavoured to widen the debate to include matters far removed from the question of union mergers.  I am quite sure that if we considered other industrial firms we would find that the multiplicity of unions is a matter of grave concern on occasions.  It does not always lead to harmony and there is delay in trying to obtain the views of 18, 21 or 33 unions.  It is our wish that we should have more mergers but our legislation should ensure that with regard to amalgamation the wishes and principles of members are respected.  This is necessary and desirable.</P>
    <P>The Minister has dismissed the matter of the political fund but I cannot do the same.  It may be a small matter but equally it may be an issue that will cause members to have second thoughts about mergers. Where a union is divided on a merger, when it comes to the final ballot people who feel deeply about the principle involved here might sway the union away from a merger.  We cannot look at the general union situation. We must look at the individual situation because, in the last analysis, it is individuals who will vote on whether the union merges.  If one person is aggrieved about the political fund he may be the deciding factor in burying the merger but if the irritant was not there that person might give his blessing to the merger and vote the other way.</P>
    <P>It is much more personal than the Minister thinks.  There is a principle involved, one that some people feel deeply about while others may not be too concerned.  Some may act to suit their own convenience or to keep on the right side of certain personnel in the unions.  On occasions some people have requested the necessary forms to opt out but they did not receive them. When they inquired they were told they would get them the following week but eventually they reached a stage when they got fed up asking for the forms.  It is very easy to divert a person's attention from the political fund to some other aspect but the fact remains that the situation in connection with this matter is distasteful.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="355" /> It has been pointed out that members of unions have a right to subscribe to any political party if they wish to do so.  I do not begrudge the Minister the few shillings he got during the last campaign&mdash;probably he did not get enough&mdash;but nevertheless it is a serious matter where one man can be irritated to such an extent that he alone can prevent a merger.  This might happen in the future.</P>
    <P>I would ask the Minister to accept the amendment so that we may get on with the job.  We have removed various factors that we considered might impede amalgamation of unions.  The matter we are discussing might possibly be regarded as more serious than the questions of voting strength or percentages which we discussed at an earlier stage.  It is the vote of the individual that may be the deciding factor, not the vote of the union as a whole.  If one person is so irritated about the political fund he may be in a position to prevent the merger.  Surely it is reasonable to ask the Minister to accept our amendment and thus remove a factor that might be the cause of preventing a merger taking place.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMoore" hpid="Mr. Moore Mr. Moore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moore</NameTxt>
      <P>I have listened to the Minister and Deputy Dowling and I think I can see a way out of the present <i>impasse.</i>  The Minister has taken exception to the fact that certain private firms give gifts to political parties.  Deputy Dowling and I consider that a man should not have to opt out of paying a political levy. The Minister has suggested he would welcome the opportunity of discussing the broad implications of individuals contributing to political parties.  I am in agreement with him on that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I suggest that the Minister takes Deputy Dowling's amendment as the basis of a larger amendment and that where two, three or four unions have amalgamated and where a political levy fund has not existed one should not be created.  I am sure the Minister will be able to prepare an amendment that would prohibit private firms from contributing to any political funds unless they state publicly what <Col N="356" /> they are doing and give people who wish to contribute the option of doing so.  This may sound complicated but it is not.  All of us want this Bill to be an instrument for the encouragement of the amalgamation of unions. Deputy Dowling, myself and others consider that if the amalgamated unions are allowed to create a political fund that did not exist before the amalgamation this may deter thousands of trade unionists from agreeing to amalgamate.  There is an onus on the Minister to remove this barrier towards amalgamation.  The Minister has the opportunity of doing so by accepting Deputy Dowling's amendment.  He will also be able to put into practice his own suggestions for the prevention of private firms contributing to the election funds of the political parties.</P>

      <P>(c) the updating in more enlightened form of the Children Act, 1908.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This motion has been on the Order Paper for a considerable time but I am grateful to the House for affording me the opportunity of moving it now. The motion is an important one in every respect.  Since the Coalition came to office I have called on them by way <Col N="357" /> of parliamentary question, by way of speeches on the Estimates for the Minister's Department and outside this House also, to realise many of their promises which remain unfulfilled in so far as the whole area of social legislation and of family law reform is concerned. In saying that I have no wish to introduce a note of acrimony.  It would not be my intention to ask for a division on this motion, a motion which it is hoped will indicate the general feeling in the country that there should be an urgent reform of the law in the context of those areas with which the motion deals.</P>
    <P>In effect all we have received from the Minister to-date is an Act in relation to reciprocal enforcement of maintenance orders.  That was a very important piece of legislation.  However at the time it was being debated I expressed the opinion that, while it was a statement of intent, it would be very difficult to implement.  Perhaps the Minister will indicate how effective the Act has been and how it is working.</P>
    <P>There are available a vast number of documents that express the wishes outlined in the terms of this motion. In addition a number of committees are either sitting or are about to sit to discuss the area of family law reform. Among these is the Law Reform Commission and the Committee on Legal Aid and Advice on Civil Matters. There is a continuing Committee on Court Practice and Procedure.  Apart from these commissions and committees there is a plethora of statements from various organisations, indicating a desire for change in the areas mentioned in the motion and also in respect of areas which might not be covered specifically in the motion. There are statements from the Free Legal Advice Centres on legal aid in criminal and civil matters.  There are statements from AIM in the context of wives and children who are deserted. The CARE organisation have produced an extensive booklet setting out their views on the law relating to children generally.  I understand that the Government are doing something in this respect.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Health has indicated <Col N="358" /> that he is about to set up a committee which will combine the functions now being undertaken by the Departments of Justice, Health and Social Welfare in the context of child care.  It is proper that this change should be made so that there would be a unified approach in dealing with these matters.  There are also the statements from CHERISH, an association which the Minister addressed one Saturday morning recently and whose meeting I had the pleasure of chairing in the afternoon of that day. There are also the organisations ADOPT and the National Youth Council.  All of these organisations have expressed a general need for change of the nature that we are seeking.</P>
    <P>I intend setting out the position generally but dealing specifically with a number of points.  There is a tremendous air of public awareness and controversy on many aspects of family law.  This awareness has been prompted in recent years by the groups I have mentioned and there may have been other groups which do not come to mind immediately.  Most of the recommendations for the reform of the law relate to disabilities suffered by wives and children.  A comprehensive family code of law would provide all the desired changes and reforms but, pending the implementation of such an ambitious proposal, urgent attention must be given in the short term to the following matters. First, wives, and under that heading, the question of maintenance.  Ideally there should be legislation providing for family maintenance to replace the unsatisfactory procedure presently in operation.  In the case of deserted wives, reciprocal enforcement of maintenance orders between Britain and Ireland is now law.  However there is a difficulty in relation to the attaching of the defaulting husbands' salaries.  Is there legislation to be introduced to deal with that problem?</P>
    <P>Another subhead I have here under the heading &ldquo;wives&rdquo; is that of matrimonial courts.  Within reason we favour the setting up of a family tribunal composed of one judge, who would be aided by two suitably qualified <Col N="359" /> lay assessors who would deal with all family matters with the exception of juvenile matters which would be dealt with by a new juvenile court. This tribunal would have a reconciliatory function and would be in a position to refer the parties to a family welfare council.  Procedures before the court should be simple and the aim should be to provide speedy and inexpensive relief for the parties resorting to that court, that free legal aid for needy litigants should be available, that the court should sit as a separate and new court in the High Court and also in the District Court, each court retaining its present jurisdiction relating to forms of action.  I would visualise the Circuit Court sitting as a judge alone to determine appeals from the District Courts and that in this new court traditional courtroom trappings would be abolished, that there would be no barristers' wigs or gowns, but of course that the right to representation would remain.</P>
    <P>It is our contention that anomalies in the law unfavourable to women should be abolished.  There should be an examination of the possibility of abolition of the Criminal Conversation Act.  There should be examination and clarification in regard to divorces obtained in England and we believe that the wife's domicile of dependants should be abolished.

I know the Minister is as anxious as we are to bring forward the legislation we are seeking. We are seeking law reform under these headings and we on this side of the House will give every assistance and co-operation when the Minister produces that legislation. <Col N="360" /> Again, without being acrimonious, we are waiting a long time for it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Andrews</NameTxt>
      <P>If the Minister is saying that I shall be beaten at the next election, it sounds as if we shall have to wait for the next election before we get the law reform.  That appears to be the situation.</P>
      <P>Having dealt very briefly in the time available in a general way with the problems of wives, I now turn to what we consider to be the urgent priorities in regard to children.  The first of these &mdash; and the Minister has indicated that he knows this &mdash; concerns the present juvenile court.  We believe an examination should be made of the possibility of abolishing it and replacing it with a new court in which a district justice would sit with two lay assessors.  The main function of the court would be to advise on the treatment of the young offenders.  Such a court would have continuing interest in and responsibility for those sent for treatment or sentenced and there would be regular conferences to review cases.  That is not dissimilar to the Scottish Kilbrandon Committee Report which exists for a number of years.  We would ask the Minister to examine that report in the context of what we are saying here.  A social report on a child's background should be obligatory in every case where a child is to be sentenced and it should be examined by the court before sentence is imposed.  Here, as in the matrimonial court, procedure should be kept as simple as possible without undue emphasis on the rules of evidence. Free legal aid should not only be available but be offered in every case.</P>
      <P>In regard to the Children's Act, 1908, and the Kennedy Report and the long-awaited implementation of the proposals and recommendations in that report.  I believe it celebrated its fourth birthday on 12th or 13th of this month and still many of its recommendations await implementation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That report deals extensively with the Children's Act, 1908, which we believe should be examined critically <Col N="361" /> with the intention of updating it, but principally so as to allow compulsory orders to be made to meet the needs of children under the age of 17 for security, guidance, care and protection. Let me pay tribute to the previous Administration.  We were responsible for the Scoil Árd Mhuire project opened about one year ago.  This represents a great advance in the area of deprived children.  But it is not enough: more requires to be done. Many such schools and additional assessment centres are urgently required. There is much to be said for transferring children needing care from the environment of the juvenile court to locally-based panels of suitably qualified persons.  The age of criminal responsibility, we believe, should be raised from seven to 12. Some people might say it should be 14 years of age.  However, after serious consideration, we consider the age of 12 to be acceptable.  We also believe that the minimum age at which young persons may marry should be raised to 18 years.  There has been some reform in that respect.</P>
    <P>Existing anomalies in the law to the detriment of children should be removed and there is also the matter of the discrimination in the law relating to legitimate and illegitimate children. We believe that a decree of nullity of marriage should not operate retrospectively so as to bastardise children lawfully born of the marriage.  These are some general views in the context of the motion before the House.  We have already expressed at length our views on the matter of legal aid in criminal and civil matters and the need to implement our proposals in that respect and, indeed, the proposals of many of the committees I have mentioned.</P>
    <P>Regarding the question of desertion and harking back once more to the Nineteenth Interim Report of the Committee on Court Practice and Procedure where it dealt with desertion and maintenance, I have a question for the Minister: Is it his intention to request that committee to examine the social problems of battered wives and will he make a statement on the matter?  That question yet remains to be answered.  I would point out to the <Col N="362" /> Minister that paragraph 24 on page 10 of that report states:</P>
    <P>In his oral evidence to the Committee, District Justice Delap, who is the District Justice hearing desertion cases in the Metropolitan District Court Area, submitted an analysis of 179 desertion cases heard by him between 1st March, 1972 (the date on which the 1971 Act came into operation) and 31st October, 1973.  Orders were made in 170 of these cases.  The analysis shows that the events causing desertion could be classified as; violence by the husband, 54; drunkenness by the husband, 35; adultery by the husband, 29; mental trouble, 19; &ldquo;shotgun&rdquo; marriages, 14; financial troubles, 8; gambling by the husband, 5; &ldquo;in-law&rdquo; troubles, 3; sexual incompatibility, 2; religion 1; cases dismissed, 9.</P>
    <P>It is important to note that of the 179 cases dealt with 54 were in the context of violence by the husband.  In other words, the situation which is for some reason becoming more common day by day, the question of battered wives.  We will await the Minister's views on that topic.  Paragraph 25 of the Nineteenth Interim Report reads:</P>
    <P>Justice Delap also furnished the following statistics in respect of maintenance applications made in his Court:</P>

    <P>It will be seen that not only have the number of applications more than doubled, but also that the number of cases in which orders were made increased from 33 per cent to 56 per cent.</P>
    <P>The legal profession and the people who come before him have the highest respect for Justice Delap as a district justice.  Paragraph 26 reads:</P>
    <P>Other details emerging from Justice Delap's evidence are as follows: most of the parties in these cases were in the weekly wage-earning category.  The actual earnings <Col N="363" /> of the husband were rarely volunteered; many wives were quite unaware of their husband's actual earnings and frequently received an inadequate share of those earnings; in cases of violence done to the wife or children, the lack of jurisdiction to exclude the husband from the family home often prevented the effective solution of the case; in many cases a less formal setting than the ordinary District Court might be more satisfactory.</P>
    <P>This harks back to my original proposition. The addendum to the report reads:</P>
    <P>The present recommendations are made to meet the existing situation and are believed to be capable of rapid implementation.  For the long term the Committee is of opinion that it would be more desirable that all orders for maintenance should be met in the first instance by the local authority or the Department of Social Welfare and so relieve the spouse obtaining the order from the worries and uncertainties often associated with the implementation of such orders.  The local authority could look to the defaulting spouse for recoupment and by the information obtainable from Social Welfare and PAYE records would be in a better position to follow a defaulting spouse who changes employment or place of business, etc.</P>
    <P>think the most important and significant sentence in the addendum to this report is:</P>
    <P>The present recommendations are made to meet the existing situation and are believed to be capable of rapid implementation.</P>
    <P>We, on this side, of the House appeal to the Minister to give effect to the rapid implementation called for in that report.</P>
    <P>On the matter of family courts and the abolition of juvenile courts I have an obligation to go into this problem in some depth.  We believe there should be a new division of the High Court which would deal with (a) children's courts and (b) matrimonial courts.  We also believe this division should be <Col N="364" /> taken out of the area of the Four Courts and should be given a special place within the city or county of Dublin, more specifically in the city. There should be three district justices appointed to the new complex and two High Court judges, obviously two newly-appointed High Court judges because at the moment the High Court is chock-a-block with litigation.  We believe also there should be a Circuit Court judge to deal with appeals from the District Court in the event of such appeals forthcoming.  The prime function of any court dealing with children and matrimonial matters should be conciliatory and of course, by definition, judicial.  The Attorney General mentioned some time ago in the context of those courts and the possibility of lay assessors sitting with the justices and the judges that there might be some constitutional difficulty involved, if I understood him correctly.  We do not see any constitutional barriers here at all.  Once there is a judge or justice sitting in the courts there is absolutely no reason why he cannot be assisted by specialists sitting on either side of him or sitting under him in the well of the court in an advisory capacity.  That is basically what we are asking.  It should be done.</P>
    <P>I have already mentioned the seminar which the Minister and I attended dealing with single-parent families and I mentioned the CHERISH seminar. The Minister stated recently that he intended increasing the allowances for the unmarried mother.  That was a very welcome statement indeed. There are five possibilities facing the illegitimate child: (1) he can be kept by his mother, though not by his father, or members of her family; (2) he may be placed for adoption; (3) he may, for whatever reason, be placed in a babies or children's home and remain there indefinitely; (4) he may be placed in foster care and (5) some combination of the preceding two categories may come into operation. Some 70 per cent of all illegitimate children are placed for adoption. Thus in 1953 there were 381 orders made and by 1973 this had increased to 1,402.  Of these 1,402 adoptions, the vast majority&mdash;1,173 or 84 per cent&mdash;<Col N="365" /> were placed by registered adoption societies, 127 were adopted by relatives, 81 were placed by health authorities and 21 were third party adoptions.  Of the majority of the children adopted, that is 842, the Adoption Board state that they have no official analysis available of the circumstances in which their adoption orders are made but they think that the majority of adoption orders, that is the majority of this 1,402, are cases of illegitimacy.  Therefore, the conclusion emerges that the majority of unmarried mothers place their babies for adoption either because that is what they wish to do or because due to lack of available services and support they have no alternative.  This percentage is considerably lower than that pertaining in some other European countries.</P>
    <P>The question of services for the unmarried mother in Ireland have been the subject of a famous conference known as the Kilkenny Conference, the proceedings of which have been published in book form.  The title is &ldquo;The Unmarried Mother in the Irish Community&rdquo; published by the Kilkenny Social Services.  This sets out quite clearly-that there is an almost complete absence of facilities to enable the unmarried mother to keep her child and leaves her with no alternative but adoption.  I am not in any way critical of adoption.  Adoption has worked well in this country and it has been worked well.  It is continuing to work well.  It is an extremely important aspect in the context of our social services.  The point I was making was that one of the most unfortunate gaps in our services is the lack of facilities so that a mother has no alternative but to send her child for adoption.</P>
    <P>The facilities which are almost completely absent ranged from the lack of crèche or day nurseries for her child so that she could go out to work and obtain the money to enable her to keep him.  The almost complete inability of the unmarried mother to obtain housing for herself and her child emerged as the second most vital consideration influencing her to give up her baby.  Material provisions in terms of contributions or payments <Col N="366" /> have of course increased and are set out in a booklet produced by the Social Assistance Services for the year 1974-75.  Let me say that it is a step in the right direction, but we believe it does not go far enough.  The relevant section in the social welfare code is well worth quoting:</P>
    <P>Social assistance allowance for the unmarried mother.  An unmarried mother who keeps her child may qualify for social assistance allowance provided, (a) she is under 68 years of age, (b) is the mother of at least one child under 18 years whom she is keeping, that is, who is residing with her and has not been adopted, (c) she has lived in the State for a period of at least two years before her claim, and (d) she satisfied a means test.  For instance, where the means are £5 or up to £5 she can obtain £9.70 if she has one child, and £12.10 if she has two children and so on up to no allowance when her means are between £13.50 and £14.50.</P>
    <P>There is a clear indication that the State has a function and a duty to make proper provision for the unmarried mother.  The 1908 Children's Act which I have mentioned was introduced in the era of sweated labour. Social thinking in 1908 is not applicable to 1974.  Certainly the people who produced the Act were motivated by good intentions in the context of the social thinking at the time.  If we politicians who attended the CHERISH seminar attended that meeting ten years ago there would have been a public outcry.  In fact if the CHERISH organisation was in existence ten years ago there would have been a public outcry.</P>
    <P>I am sorry I do not have the opportunity to develop these points much further due to the limited time at my disposal.  I have 40 minutes, but one could speak on it for a number of hours to place on the record of the House all the points one wanted to make.</P>
    <P>On the matter of illegitimacy there are two schools for thought on whether the succession laws should recognise the illegitimate child.  There is one school which holds the illegitimate <Col N="367" /> child, where there is a fairly sizeable estate, cannot be responsible for the misdeeds of his father.  I do not intend to moralise on that.  I do not think it is our function as politicians to engage specifically in dissertations on morality.  There is the other school of thought &mdash; that if the father of an illegitimate child leaves a sizeable estate, and has legitimate children be it two, three or four, the legitimate children should have the rights.  However, the illegitimate child did not ask to come into the world and it is unfair to exclude it from its father's estate.  Personally I think it is wrong and will support any reasonable legislation the Minister might introduce abolishing the distinction in the Succession Acts between legitimacy and illegitimacy.</P>
    <P>As I say, the illegitimate child is the <i>filius nullius.</i>  He is, in theory, the child of no one, not having, I believe, at one time&mdash;whether or not it is still in existence I do not know&mdash;even the right to take his mother's name.  His rights in relation to the natural father are minimal, if not non-existent.  The right of support is curtailed by restrictive affiliation legislation, and the rights of succession to the father's property, as I have already said, including those given to a legitimate child under the 1965 Succession Act, do not extend to illegitimate children. The Minister may correct me on that.</P>
    <P>In fairness, we must say that that legislation was introduced in 1965, and we are talking almost ten years later.  Social thinking changes, and we in this House should reflect in legislation new thinking and greater social awareness.  If I may respectfully refer to the 1937 Constitution, that Constitution, as interpreted by the courts, also appears to put the illegitimate beyond the pale by confining the family rights mentioned in Article 41 to the family based on marriage.</P>
    <P>Do not think that in any way I am challenging marriage.  I believe in the sanctity and the absoluteness of marriage.  But those of us who have been privileged to be married or who were fortunate enough not to find themselves in the situation of illegitimacy might remember that we are not <Col N="368" /> legislating in this House for one section of the community to the detriment of another.  We have an obligation to legislate for the whole community. We have an even greater obligation to the less well-off sections of the community than we have to the better-off sections.  If we base the social legislation for which we are calling on this side of the House on that concept, then I do not think we shall have any difficulty at all.  We must give a lead in this House on the social legislation which is required.</P>
    <P>I know I have 15 minutes to reply to the debate and I shall certainly use it, but can the Minister state whether there is in existence within the Department of Justice a unit specifically dealing with the area of legislation required by this motion, and if not would he not think it would be a good idea to gather from within the whole Civil Service a number of people concerned and interested enough within his Department and set up a special law reform unit in the area of child care and family law reform generally and, in addition, induct into that unit highly qualified people expert in the matters we are discussing, giving them a contract on a short-term basis until such time as the legislation is produced?</P>
    <P>Can the Minister say what the Government's intentions are in relation to the production of the kind of legislation indicated by this motion?  What type of legislation has the Minister got within his Department?  What is the form of it and when can we expect the legislation to come before the House?  Those are just some matters with which I would like the Minister to concern himself when he comes to speak.  Can the Minister show his mind on his law reform programme in the context of deserted wives, illegitimate children, child care generally and matrimonial problems?</P>

      <P>The Minister for Health will be speaking <Col N="369" /> later on this motion because some of the matters embodied in the motion come within his jurisdiction&mdash;for example, the Children's Act, 1908&mdash;so I will say a few words on the motion this evening.</P>
      <P>The subject matter of this motion is extremely wide, so wide that the necessarily limited time available in Private Members' Business will not enable any speaker to do justice to the subject or deal with it in other than the most general terms.  This was made clear in Deputy Andrews' opening statement.  He covered a wide range but, because of the limited time, he could only skim the surface of the whole area of social legislation. That is the danger in a debate of this nature.  There are certain very obvious features which lend themselves to easy and facile comment. In a necessarily short debate one has, I suppose, to look for the obvious and comment on it, but the pity is that one is then constrained to a superficial debate.  These are matters requiring much analysis in depth&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMarkCooney" hpid="Mr. Cooney Mr. Cooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cooney</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;in order to ensure that in the solutions of the problems that exist hurt is not done to other sections of the community.  That is the danger in trying to rectify grievances of particular sections without deep study.  I am sure Deputy Andrews made a very deep analytical study of the subject, but the constraints of time necessarily forced him merely to touch on the obvious features in this area.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidAndrews" hpid="Mr. Andrews Mr. Andrews">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Andrews</NameTxt>
      <P>I made that clear at the beginning.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMarkCooney" hpid="Mr. Cooney Mr. Cooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cooney</NameTxt>
      <P>I am merely pointing out that the same constraints will necessarily apply to every speaker in this debate.  There are three broad headings covered in the motion&mdash;the question of the establishment of courts to deal with family problems, the guaranteeing of a proper standard of living for all who have the care of children and the updating of the Children's Act, 1908.  In addition to that, Deputy Andrews ranged over the field of deserted wives, unmarried mothers and <Col N="370" /> children in conflict with the law and with society.</P>
      <P>With regard to the question of special courts&mdash;I think we can call these family tribunals or courts because that phrase has become familiar and people know broadly what they would like to see when they talk about these&mdash;the matter comes down to a detailed analysis as to the level of our judicial system at which the court or tribunal should be inserted, who should preside over it, its jurisdiction and procedures. All these things will have to be carefully analysed.  Devising something new like this, something radically different from our present institutions, will require very detailed analysis.</P>
      <P>Deputy Andrews suggested there could be a new division of the High Court &mdash; section A dealing with children and section B dealing with matrimonial affairs.  He then went on to talk about a complex in which there would be three High Court judges, two District Justices and a special judge to hear appeals from the District Courts.  I do not know exactly what this means, but presenting the matter in these terms highlights the need to proceed with care and emphasises the need for detailed analysis so that questions of jurisdiction, procedure, position and the qualifications of those participating in these courts can be gone into in the detail necessary to ensure the courts will be effective when they come to be established.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This idea of the family court is not new and it does not come, therefore, as any surprise to me.  It has been about for a considerable time.  It is usually mentioned in the context of deserted wives, the wife's right to the matrimonial home, the question of ill-treatment and default by spouses responsible for maintaining the family home.  All these things are generally talked of in the same context and in the same breath.  This was one of the first things that came to my notice when I was appointed.  There was a very vocal body of opinion seeking reforms in this area and they were seeking them with a great sense of frustration. They had been seeking them for quite some time without anyone making any <Col N="371" /> move whatever to relieve their frustrations. I have no doubt now that Deputy Andrews, having gone back into ordinary life, so to speak, has become&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="DavidAndrews" hpid="Mr. Andrews Mr. Andrews">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Andrews</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMarkCooney" hpid="Mr. Cooney Mr. Cooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cooney</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;aware of the frustrations these people have been suffering for so long.  He can now see the situation that years of neglect have left in this particular field.  When I assumed office &mdash; I had, of course, been aware before I assumed office&mdash; I became more keenly aware of these various groups and their pressure for reform, indeed of the need for reform. I became aware of the adverse effects of years of neglect by our predecessors in this socially sensitive area.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidAndrews" hpid="Mr. Andrews Mr. Andrews">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Andrews</NameTxt>
      <P>The corollary is that the Minister now in office is out of touch with the situation on the basis that I was out of touch with it when I was in office.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMarkCooney" hpid="Mr. Cooney Mr. Cooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cooney</NameTxt>
      <P>It does not necessarily follow and I shall proceed now to prove that.  Having been aware of the situation, consequent upon years of neglect of this socially sensitive area, I wondered what was the best way to deal with it and I decided the Committee on Court Practices and Procedure already in existence was composed of people of varying disciplines, having been set up by Deputy Haughey, with narrow terms of reference, unfortunately, to deal with court practice and procedure.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cooney</NameTxt>
      <P>I decided that, because of its expertise and because of its personnel, this committee should have its terms of reference extended to enable it to make reports and recommendations in areas of substantive law as opposed to purely procedural matters to which its then terms of reference confined it.</P>
      <P>I found that the committee welcomed this extension.  It puzzles me &mdash;and Deputy Andrews might inquire from my predecessor&mdash;why he failed to avail himself of the willingness of the committee to investigate areas of substantive law as opposed to areas of mere procedure.  I was very glad I took that step to extending its terms of reference because very quickly it produced the 19th interim report to which Deputy Andrews referred and which contains many recommendations which will meet many of the grievances in this field when implemented.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidAndrews" hpid="Mr. Andrews Mr. Andrews">

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cooney</NameTxt>
      <P>I gave an undertaking that, when that report was received by me, it would be dealt with as a matter of urgency and with all possible speed.  That undertaking is being honoured.  Since the report was received it has been under examination by my Department and also by the other Departments of State which, as Deputy Andrews knows, must necessarily be involved in legislation which can impinge on their activities and on which they would have a view to offer.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am happy to say that the preparation of the legislation consequent on that examination is at an advanced stage.  My timetable was to deal with that legislation during this session and I am still optimistic that timetable can be met.  That is something to be pleased about because in the eight months, I think it is, since the committee reported &mdash; it cannot be much more than a year since I extended its terms of reference &mdash; this country will see far-reaching reforms in the area of the deserted wife, attachment of <Col N="373" /> wages, widening the concept of family default.  The recommendations made in this Nineteenth Interim Report, with some exceptions, will be debated in the House.</P>
    <P>I contrast that speed with that of another report to which Deputy Andrews referred, the Kennedy report.  He said it has now reached its fourth birthday.  If it has, it had two or three of those birthdays under our predecessors.  I contrast the speed with which we are dealing with this subject with the delay and lack of interest of our predecessors in this field of family law.</P>

      <P>As I said, very often this subject lends itself to facile and easy comment because there are obvious grievances and we can all cry about them.  Bringing in reforms to remedy these grievances is where the close analysis and the hard study are required.  That has been going on in this area since the report was received from the committee.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I might mention, too, that when I extended the terms of reference of the committee, which my predecessor failed to do&mdash;why I do not know but, <Col N="374" /> as I suggested, Deputy Andrews might ask him&mdash;I also asked it to consider the desirability of establishing special family tribunals.  I consider that this committee is peculiarly well placed to advise the Government on the tricky question of special family tribunals.  As I indicated earlier, it raises a number of problems: jurisdiction, composition, procedures and qualifications of personnel.  I look forward in due course to receiving a report from the committee and having it examined and implemented.</P>
    <P>I have no doubt that, because of its inherent difficulties, this subject will require very close analysis.  As Deputy Andrews must know, close analysis and close study, involving possibly studies of comparative law and comparative procedures, are tedious and time-consuming.  I can sympathise with the frustration of those who are waiting for reforms and are inclined to blame the delay on so much unnecessary red tape.  I must deny for myself that any unnecessary red tape will delay any necessary reforms.  The proof of that will be before the House shortly.</P>
    <P>The House has already had proof of my anxiety to bring in reforms in this field of family law.  I instance the Adoption Act, which was passed by this House some months ago and the Maintenance Orders Act, to which Deputy Andrews referred in flattering terms.  The Adoption Act satisfied a grievance which had been voiced on a very large scale for a long time before we took office.  One could hardly look at a daily newspaper or turn on the radio without reading or hearing some criticism of the adoption code.  I am pleased to say that I was able to bring to this House, within a year of taking office, a reforming measure which has cured many of the ills in that field.</P>
    <P>Likewise, the Maintenance Orders Act represents a milestone in the protection of the deserted wife in that the miscreant husband will no longer be able to flee with impunity to England.  These are two positive proofs of my personal anxiety and willingness to introduce reforms and of the Government's collective <Col N="375" /> anxiety in this field because, unless I had the co-operation and the encouragement of my colleagues, these reforms might not have been achieved with such speed.  This is in contrast to the lack of action for many years in this field.  I offer that as an indication of our good faith in this area and as something from which the public can take encouragement and confidence that reforms in the social area will be implemented speedily.</P>

      <P>Another area which Deputy Andrews dealt with was that of children in conflict with the law and deprived children.  This again is an area in which reform had been called for, for a considerable time. One of the difficulties was the division of responsibility between the Department of Justice, the Department of Health and the Department of Education. In an effort to get over the difficulty of divided responsibility and to have some measure of co-ordination it has been agreed that the Minister <Col N="376" /> for Health of the day, whoever he might be, will co-ordinate activities in this field.</P>
      <P>In order to bring about the reforms which we need, a task force has now been set up on the lines of the proposal which Deputy Andrews made towards the end of his speech when he talked about the need for involving outside people with expertise in a particular project.  In fact, that is what this task force is doing.  We look forward with interest to what it will produce.  It involves outside people with expertise in the field of deprived children.  It has recently advertised for interested parties to make submissions to it.  Deputy Andrews might like to make a submission to this task force, having studied the problem in detail as he told us, and give his views, for example, on the age of criminal responsibility.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidAndrews" hpid="Mr. Andrews Mr. Andrews">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Andrews</NameTxt>
      <P>I have already done so.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMarkCooney" hpid="Mr. Cooney Mr. Cooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cooney</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with him about the age of 12 years but there are varying views on this.  I have indicated that I could prepare legislation to deal with this <i>ad hoc</i> item of raising the age of criminal responsibility, but in view of the setting up of this task force to deal on a more global basis with the problem of deprived children, I think it would be wrong of me to proceed with just that piece of legislation. The proper thing would be to allow the task force to deal with that aspect of the deprived child in the context of his total scene.</P>
      <P>I am glad to say that the setting up of this task force and the novelty of it are indications of the Government's determination to tackle urgently the social problems of the deprived child.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The type of tribunal which should deal with the child in conflict with the law or out of step with society generally will require careful analysis. Deputy Andrews referred to a district justice sitting with two lay assessors. At the same time, he referred to the Kilbrandon report in Scotland which set up their system of lay panels.  Again there is mounting criticism in Scotland as to the efficacy of the lay panels and <Col N="377" /> there is the beginning of a swing against them.  In England there was a compromise which is more or less on the lines suggested by Deputy Andrews of lay people with the magistrate. There has been some dissatisfaction in England with that, too, not so much with the tribunal itself but more with the after care under the probation service. That service has taken two courses, one attached to the courts and the other with no responsibilities to the courts.  There have been very definite social problems in the case of continually delinquent children.  This matter will require very careful analysis and study.  I am delighted to see a task force of so many experts has been set up to consider the form of tribunal which should deal with children.  They will welcome submissions from interested parties.</P>
    <P>It is easy to say that there should be something different.  The difficult thing is to say what something different should be and what form it will take. Lay assessors are mentioned almost invariably when this question of a children's court arises.  We have got into the habit of considering children's courts in the context only of the Dublin Metropolitan Children's Court.  In the anonymity of a conurbation like Dublin one could see a role for lay assessors. That might not necessarily be the case in the intimate society of a country town where there might be an objection from the parents of the child in conflict with the law to their neighbour sitting in judgment on their children. These are real problems and are not being mentioned merely as an obstructive tactic for doing nothing.  They must be analysed and an answer teased out.  That will be the job of the task force.</P>
    <P>Deputy Andrews is pushing an open door when he asks the Government to take action.  The action is under way by the setting up of this task force which had been charged as a matter of urgency to bring in recommendations and new legislation to deal with the anomalies in our children's courts.  These anomalies are the result of more enlightened public opinion.  As Deputy Andrews said, the 1908 Act was up to date in its time but is now <Col N="378" /> out of date.  I welcome his offer of every assistance in bringing forward legislation and look forward to his presence here for all stages of debates in these areas.</P>
    <P>One must be careful how one phrases things.  The Deputy said that free legal aid should not only be available in all children's cases but should be offered to them.  That would be an extreme view.  I sympathise with the generosity behind it but I think what the Deputy means is that it should be available in all cases where the parties would be entitled to it, but it should not necessarily be offered in every case coming before the courts.</P>

      <P>I am glad to hear that.  The Kilkenny Conference took place four years ago.  Nothing was done on foot of the recommendations of the conference to ease the lot of the unmarried mother until there was a change of Government.  In our first budget we introduced for the first time in the history of this State a weekly allowance payable to the unmarried mother.  This shows the different approach of this Administration to our predecessors in this social area.</P>
      <P>The conference called for other reforms such as créches and houses for the unmarried mothers.  It is very difficult for a girl to find a home for herself and her child.  It is not surprising that the conference called for these measures having regard to the tremendous housing problem we had and which is now on the way to being solved.</P>

      <P>We act collectively and in a unified manner.  The spirit behind this motion is an excellent one and I welcome it.  The implied criticism in much of what Deputy Andrews said that there was foot dragging on my part and on the part of the Government in the field of social and family law reform is unjustified. I have given enough examples to show that in our short period in office we have done far more than was done in decades by our predecessors.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Andrews has done the House a considerable service in putting down this motion for discussion in Private Members' time.  The fact that he tabled it gives us an opportunity of reviewing the situation in this area.  It helps us as Deputies to focus attention on what is happening.  What will emerge clearly from the debate will be a universal and unanimous demand for some <Col N="381" /> positive and concrete action on the part of the Minister.</P>
      <P>I accept Deputy Andrews' statement that he put this motion down in an entirely non-political, non-contentious and non-partisan frame of mind. The Minister has done himself quite a disservice by the party political type of reply which he has given by way of intervention.  Rather than giving us an outline of his thinking, his proposals and the action he has on hands, the Minister has sought to contrast some alleged activity on his part with inactivity on the part of the previous Government.  I do not think the voluntary bodies and those interested in these areas of social progress are interested in that sort of political skirmishing.  They want to see positive and concrete action by the Minister, but I do not think they are getting that.</P>
      <P>That is a criticism I have of the Minister and it is why I am glad Deputy Andrews has tabled this motion.  His motion gives us an opportunity to urge the Minister to take some action in these different fields.  I do not think there is any need for any more reports, any more Commissions of inquiry or investigations.  In my view the Minister could give effect to up to 40 things if he had the will and parliamentary time.  What is lacking on his part is the will and energy to get on with that.  From this side of the House we give him a complete undertaking that we will facilitate the passage of any of these measures through the House.</P>
      <P>It should be remembered that many of the suggestions put forward could be given legal effect without legislation. There has been plenty of discussion in these areas, numerous seminars have been held and a great deal written and discussed about the problems.  There is plenty of goodwill. This discussion and debate has tended to give people the impression that things are under way, that things are happening.  As far as the people with whom I have been in touch about these matters are concerned, and as far as I am concerned, things are not happening.  In my constituency the hardship, distress, suffering and the agony continue unabated.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="382" /> I am referring particularly to the situation of the deserted wife, the unmarried mother and those with matrimonial problems.  I frequently have to listen to a wife or a mother say: &ldquo;My life is a living hell and I cannot carry on&rdquo;, or &ldquo;I cannot continue to protect the children in the situation and the circumstances in which I find myself&rdquo;.  That is the reality of the situation.  In my view I am not a public representative in an enlightened community if I cannot list, for a deserted wife or a person who is responsible for looking after deprived children, their rights under the law.  It is wrong that I cannot tell such people that there is a system of free legal aid to enable them to assert those rights and that I cannot give them the address of an advice centre where they can go to obtain help.  Until the day arrives when we can tell constituents who come to us for solace their inalienable rights under the law and the way they can have them dealt with, I do not think we can be content that we have done our job as social or legal reformers.</P>
    <P>In my view it is not sufficient for the Minister to adopt the attitude he has adopted by way of reply to Deputy Andrews.  One aspect to which I should like to draw the attention of the Minister is that, in the situation of matrimonial disputes and problems, the legal profession does not want to enter into this particular area. I have had the experience&mdash;I am sure other Deputies have had similar experiences&mdash;of deserted wives or wives with problems not being able to get solicitors to take up their case.  I am not blaming the solicitors' profession for that fact.  I believe the reason is that most of their offices are not geared to take on this sort of work and they do not want to take it on. There are one or two honourable exceptions in this city.  These people undertake this type of case, but most solicitors' offices do not want to know about cases of this sort.</P>
    <P>Even such rights as a deserted wife might have, or a wife who is looking for a separation, the custody of her children or maintenance, are often denied to them in practice because they cannot get legal practitioners to <Col N="383" /> take up their cases.  That is why I press the aspect of Deputy Andrews' motion which deals with the establishment of courts presided over by a judge or a justice, sitting with qualified lay advisers, to deal with family problems.  I should like to emphasise to the House, and to the Minister, that there is a real problem in this regard. It is very important, in common justice, that we get courts of this sort. When such courts are established they would attract to them, hopefully, a body of lawyers who would specialise in practices of that sort.  Then the type of person I have in mind would have this legal advice available to him.  But, unfortunately, the reality of the position at the moment is that a wife&mdash;and I speak mainly of wives in this connection because it is more often the wife who is seeking redress than the husband&mdash;just cannot get, even if she can pay for it, the sort of legal service she needs if she is to be in a position to assert her rights.</P>
    <P>I want to stress to the Minister as strongly as possible that there is widespread disappointment about the lack of action.  I was not listening carefully enough to Deputy Andrews to know whether or not he mentioned the Kennedy Report.  Certainly the Minister mentioned it.  In view of the attitude taken by the Minister in his reply, I am sure he will not mind my mentioning the fact that when I was Minister for Justice, Miss Kennedy&mdash; as she was then&mdash;was appointed to the District Court, the first woman ever to be appointed to the District Court in this country.  Therefore the Minister cannot say that we on this side of the House were completely impervious to any sort of social progress or enlightened development in these areas.</P>
    <P>This Kennedy Report is an excellent document.  It is full of sound recommendations. Mark you, I am always inclined to judge reports by the number of positive recommendations they put forward.  My attitude towards a report of this sort is to go through it and tick the number of recommendations that can be adopted immediately; then adopt them and leave <Col N="384" /> over the others needing to be teased out until such time as they have been teased out and then get on with them. In this excellent report there are a number of things that could be done straightaway.  I shall take as an example the recommendation that the Minister's responsibility for all aspects of child care should be transferred to the Department of Health but that the responsibility for the care and education of children should remain with the Department of Education. What is to prevent that being done immediately?</P>
    <P>The Minister suggested that the recommendation regarding the age of criminal responsibility being raised to 12 years raised some problems.  If there are some problems involved, let them be dealt with; let them be elucidated, elaborated upon, teased out, as he said, and let us wait until we get the right answer.  I agree it is better to wait and get the right answer than to do something inappropriate. But in this report there are a number of things so straightforward and clearcut that they could be done straightaway.  I think the Minister will not accept this criticism from me, but I can assure him it is true.  I have on many occasions said to individuals, bodies, organisations and deputations: &ldquo;The present Minister has indicated that he is favourably disposed towards reforms in all of these areas.  I think you can be assured that something will happen and that these reforms will be enacted.&rdquo;  I must say to the Minister now it is time he showed more positive results.  Many of the things he mentioned here were very desirable but in fact were nothing more than extensions&mdash;normal, natural extensions of the social welfare code; they were not legal reforms.  I think it is slightly dishonest on the part of the Minister to trot out extensions of the social welfare code in regard to allowances of one kind or another as being representative of progress in this area.  We welcome them but they do not constitute progress in the area with which we are concerned in this motion.</P>
    <P>A lot of people fell for and supported the Minister's party on the <Col N="385" /> occasion of the last election because they thought this was going to be a Government of reform.  They looked forward with some confidence to individual members of this Government whom, because of their performance in Opposition, the people felt would achieve a great volume of enlightened reform.  These people are bitterly disappointed. The Minister should be aware of that.  It is no help to him or to anybody else if he is closing his eyes to the reality of the situation. This Government have been in office practically two years now.  The behaviour of some members of the present Government when in Opposition&mdash;I would refer particularly to the Minister for Foreign Affairs&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I was intending to deal in some detail with the recommendations put forward in the Kennedy Report.  Perhaps the preface to that report is something we could all keep clearly before us in consideration of these matters.  The preface states:</P>
      <P>All children need love, care and security if they are to develop into full and mature persons.  For most children, this is provided by a warm, intimate and continuous relationship with their parents, brothers and sisters.  Children in institutions have for the most part missed this happy relationship.  If they are to overcome this deprivation they must, therefore, be given love, affection and security by those in whose care they are placed.</P>
      <P>The recommendations made by the Committee in this report are based on the assumption that all those engaged in the field of Child and Family Care agree that this must be their fundamental approach to the work they are undertaking.</P>
      <P>That certainly provides a very full, philosophical, framework within which the reforms needed in these areas can be tackled.</P>

    <P>Debate resumed on amendment No. 15:</P>
    <P>Before section 17 to insert a new section as follows:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;The members of an amalgamating trade union, which has not got a political fund, shall, upon becoming members of an amalgamated union with such a fund, be deemed to have opted out of such fund&rdquo;.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanMoore" hpid="Mr. Moore Mr. Moore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moore</NameTxt>
      <P>When I spoke earlier I suggested that Deputy Dowling had made a reasonable plea to the Minister that he might accept this amendment and in later legislation give us the opportunity of discussing other matters the Minister raised.  I do not know how much persuasion we can exert on the Minister to alter his opposition to this amendment.  Even at this late stage, so that the business of the House may proceed on other matters, the Minister might indicate if he will accept Deputy Dowling's amendment or if, as I suggested earlier, he will add to Deputy Dowling's amendment an addendum to the effect that a trade union which has not got a political fund upon becoming members of an amalgamated union with such a fund shall be deemed to have opted out.  The Minister, in <Col N="388" /> reply to that, said: &ldquo;Look, there are lots of other arguments on such things as the private contributions of firms to political parties at election time.&rdquo;  I am ready to discuss this aspect if the Minister gives us an opportunity.</P>
      <P>I ask the Minister if he will accept Deputy Dowling's amendment and let us get on with the rest of the Bill, or if he will move an amendment or an addendum to that stating that no member of an amalgamated union shall have to opt out of paying a political levy, which is the fairest way of doing it; or else that the Minister will give us an indication that he will introduce wider legislation on trade unionism so that we can discuss very fully the Minister's concern, shared by many of us, on the matter of financing political parties for election purposes.</P>
      <P>The basic motive behind Deputy Dowling's amendment is not to deprive a trade union of any funds from a political levy.  If they want to contribute to a political fund, that is their business.  The amendment seeks to put the onus on the people who want to do that to opt in and to remove the onus from the people who do not want to do it to opt out.  This is a very just request from Deputy Dowling.  I recommend it to the Minister wholeheartedly so that we can move on with this Bill.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JosephDowling" hpid="Mr. Dowling Mr. Dowling">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dowling</NameTxt>
      <P>Section 9 states:</P>
      <P>(1) A member of a trade union which passes or purports to pass a resolution approving an instrument of amalgamation or transfer may complain to the Registrar on one or more than one of the following grounds&mdash;</P>
      <P>The section set out the grounds on which the member might complain to the registrar.  In the discussions on this section we were told that members would be protected by the provisions in the section and it appeared this was so.  However, the Schedule states:</P>
      <P>1.  On a complaint made under section 9 the Registrar may&mdash;</P>
      <P>(a) require the attendance of the complainant or of any officer of the trade union and may, on the application of the complainant or any such officer, require the attendance of any person as a witness;</P>
      <P>(b)  require the production of any documents relating to the matters complained of;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="391" /> (c) administer oaths and take affirmations and require the complainant, any officer of the trade union or any person attending as a witness to be examined on oath or affirmation;</P>
    <P>(d) grant to the complainant or to any officer of the trade union such discovery as to documents and otherwise, or such inspection of documents, as might be granted by the High Court;</P>
    <P>(e) order the whole or any part of the expenses of hearing the complaint, as certified by him, to be paid either out of the funds of the trade union or by the complainant; and</P>
    <P>While it appears that a person has a right to complain, apparently he will pay dearly for that right.  It is unreasonable for the Minister to insert penal clauses in this Bill which will victimise a member who has a legitimate right to complain as set out in section 9.  Paragraph 1 <i>(f)</i> of the Schedule states that the Registrar may:</P>
    <P>order the trade union to pay to the complaintant out of the funds of the union, or the complainant to pay to the union, either a specified sum in respect of the costs incurred by the complainant or the union (as the case may be) or the taxed amount of those costs.</P>
    <P>We can clearly see that this will victimise a person who will be obliged to pay expenses.  It is completely unreasonable that while we have a section that guarantees the right of a member to make a complaint to the registrar against the manner in which a vote has taken place, a member will have to pay the expenses incurred. What would happen if an ordinary member of a union lost a case and was thereby liable to pay the substantial costs involved?  Would he be obliged to sell his home to pay the expenses incurred as a result of a complaint legitimately made?</P>
    <P>Paragraph 2 states:</P>
    <P>A person who, on the application of any person, is required to attend before the Registrar as a witness in <Col N="392" /> proceedings on a complaint under Section 9 shall be entitled to be paid by the person on whose application he is so required&mdash;</P>
    <P>(a) such sum in respect of time and travelling expenses as he would be entitled to on being served with a summons to attend as a witness in the High Court, and</P>
    <P>(b) if he duly attends, a sum equal to any further allowances to which he would be entitled if attending as a witness in proceedings in the High Court.</P>
    <P>These are clauses that penalise the member who makes a complaint. Under section 9 the member is given that right in relation to the ballot but if, in the pursuance of a legitimate complaint, he calls witnesses he must pay.  This is absurd and the Minister will have to change his attitude so that these people will not be victimised.</P>
    <P>Not alone does a member have to pay the union the expenses they incurred, he must also pay the expenses of the witnesses he has called on his behalf.  The intention of this Bill is to ensure that mergers and amalgamations are made easier, with moneys forthcoming to the unions by way of grants towards exceptional expenses in relation to the amalgamations. However, the unfortunate union member, the smallest cog in the wheel, the person who considers he has a legitimate complaint which he makes to the registrar, will be burdened with this tremendous expense. These penal clauses have been inserted to ensure that members of unions will not make complaints because of the substantial expenses they might incur at some stage.  Paragraph 3 (2) of the Schedule states:</P>
    <P>A person shall not be convicted of an offence&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <P>this refers to the person who does not turn up</P>
    <P>&mdash;&mdash;under this paragraph by reason of failure or refusal on his part to comply with a requisition to attend as a witness before the Registrar unless any sum to which he is entitled under paragraph 2 (a) of</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="393" /> this Schedule has been paid or tendered.</P>
    <P>He has to pay prior to the attendance of the witness and I hold this is completely unreasonable.  I suggest to the Minister that complaints will not be made to the registrar because people will be afraid of the expenses that will be incurred.  The Minister should be empowered to make money available to unions who are contemplating amalgamation.</P>
    <P>This Bill is defective when one considers the penal clauses set out in the Schedule.  I would ask the Minister to explain the provisions in the Schedule and to give us an assurance that no one will be victimised and that we will not have penal clauses whereby people will be afraid to make legitimate complaints because of the possibility of having to pay compensation. While it may be said that a complainant may be successful in his claim, there is always the chance that he may be on the losing side.  The enacting of this legislation would put us back in the dark ages and no one would avail of his rights under section 9.</P>
    <P>I agree with Deputy Esmonde that this measure would probably prevent cranks from taking proceedings but we must not legislate on the basis that some cranks may pursue certain claims. The vast majority of trade unionists are responsible persons.  Only a very small section would bring proceedings on the basis outlined by Deputy Esmonde.  Therefore, the Bill is defective in this respect and I trust that the Minister will consider the situation further with a view to providing for the availability of moneys to meet the costs involved in bringing a case.</P>
    <P>Earlier we discussed the question of an appeal going to the High Court on a point of law.  Again, the person who would have to pay would be the complainant if the findings were not in his favour.  In the pursuit of any claim there is the risk of not being successful. A complainant may be successful for 99.9 per cent of the way but the other 0.1 per cent might be the deciding factor in the case being lost.  This part of the Bill is outrageous and I ask the <Col N="394" /> Minister to withdraw it and to ensure that people wishing to pursue a legitimate claim can do so without the fear of, perhaps, losing their homes or a substantial amount of their savings.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy is incorrect in thinking that there obtains any of the dire consequences which, by some extraordinary interpretation, he has read into the Bill, This clause is supplemental to section 9 whereby a member of a trade union has certain rights in the matter of complaint, for instance, the grounds on which he may complain that procedures outlined in this Bill have not been complied with. It is standard provision and is in line with that obtaining in respect of witnesses appearing in the High Court and there is always this provision against a complainant who brings forward a case that is based on a frivolous pretext.  The complainant is protected fully under section 9.  He may complain that the matter in which a vote on a resolution is taken does not satisfy the conditions in section 3 (1) which we considered exhaustively this afternoon. We satisfied the Deputy that the provisions in section 3 (1) give ample grounds for believing that there would be a fair vote and that all concerned in the vote would be in full possession of the facts relating to amalgamation. This schedule simply outlines the rights that the registrar has to ensure that the complainant complies fully with the provisions of section 9.  That section simply outlines how the registrar may, on request by a complainant, carry out the duties fully which are his.  Paragraph 1 (f), about which the Deputy is so worried, is there merely to ensure that the rights of the complainant are not abused.  In legislation such as this in which we give such liberties to a complainant we must also comply with standard practice and guard against these rights being abused.</P>

      <P>Paragraph 1 (e) provides that the registrar may order the whole or any part of the expenses of hearing a complaint to be paid either out of the funds of the trade union or by the complainant.  What does that mean?  Does it mean that in the pursuance of a legitimate complaint, <Col N="395" /> the complainant might have to pay the expenses incurred?</P>

      <P>It is unrealistic and absurd for the Deputy to suggest that the registrar could ignore the clearly formulated provisions laid down here in relation to complaints made to him.  The registrar will be the servant of the provisions of this legislation and will abide faithfully by them.  Paragraph 1 (f) is put in merely to guard against a complainant taking liberties with the legislation as set out.  It is simply to guard against the very odd case of a person initiating proceedings on a frivolous pretext.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JosephDowling" hpid="Mr. Dowling Mr. Dowling">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dowling</NameTxt>
      <P>While the question of frivolous complaints may arise one cannot write into legislation penal clauses that would prevent legitimate grievances being pursued.  Paragraph 1 (f) reads that the registrar may:</P>
      <P>...order the trade union to pay to the complainant out of the funds of the union, or the complaint to pay to the union, either a specified sum in respect of the costs incurred by the complainant or the union (as the case may be) or the taxed amount of those costs.</P>
      <P>It goes further than that in paragraph 2.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelOLeary" hpid="Mr. M. O'Leary Mr. M. O'Leary">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>Perhaps if the Deputy is worried about paragraph 2 he will wait until we come to that clause before expressing his concern.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JosephDowling" hpid="Mr. Dowling Mr. Dowling">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dowling</NameTxt>
      <P>It involves another penal clause in that not only are the expenses in relation to the complainant to be covered by him but he must also cover witnesses' expenses and these could be substantial.  If the Minister wishes to guard against frivolous complaints he should write that into the Bill but the majority of complaints can be expected to be legitimate. Under one section we are affording a person the right to bring a complaint to the registrar while under another provision we are penalising him to the extent that would possibly rule out his ability to proceed with the case.  Of course there is no reason to believe that every complaint made to the registrar would be successful <Col N="396" /> but the point is that in respect of unsuccessful cases, the complainant will have to pay to the unions the costs involved.  However, what would happen in the case of a man being unable to pay the costs?  Would he be imprisoned or what action could be taken against him?  This aspect of the Bill is unreasonable and negatives the trouble the Minister has gone to in section 9 to ensure that every person would be included in so far as the rights of a member of a trade union to make a complaint to the registrar are concerned.  Although some claims may be lost, we can take it that they will all be initiated in the belief that they are justified.</P>

      <P>Section 3 lays down criteria relating to the holding of a ballot and these criteria must be complied with.  In section 9 there are further rights for the dissatisfied member, the person who is dissatisfied with the methodology of the voting.  Deputy Dowling's thesis is correct only if we imagine that the registrar takes leave of his senses, if we imagine him becoming not the servant of the legislation but its enemy.  Under this legislation the registrar in partnership with the person making the complaint is there to see that this legislation is carried out in the letter and in the spirit. If we had a situation where the registrar was left without the protection of paragraph (1) (e) and (f) in the Schedule it would mean that the registrar would have no protection and would be inundated with frivolous cases.  The Deputy will agree that this legislation is designed for the person with a genuine case based on section 3 or section 9.  The registrar is there to carry out the wishes of the individual and the Deputy need not worry that this legislation militates in any way against a person with a case based on the provisions of this legislation. I am informed that this is the standard procedure and that where extensive rights are given to an individual there should, for reasons of prudence, be some safeguards for the registrar.  The Deputy may see that under this legislation the registrar has so many duties that he requires to be protected against frivolous cases.</P>

The Minister could include &ldquo;frivolous cases&rdquo; in the legislation.  He wants to ensure that if members who have, or feel they have a legitimate case&mdash; and perhaps are legally advised that it is a legitimate claim&mdash;which they wish to pursue, proceed and are not 100 per cent successful, they will have to pay the expenses of the trade union and the witnesses involved.

      <P>An individual would never be in the predicament of being unable to meet the costs awarded against him if he did not bring a case based on a frivolous pretext and we are defining a frivolous pretext as one not in accordance with the provisions of this legislation.  The object of the Bill is to facilitate mergers and amalgamations by the unions willing to merge or amalgamate by ridding the legislation of obstacles to such mergers.  Having got rid of these obstacles in legislation going right back to the 1871 Act, we are substituting the provisions of this Bill, making sure that there are guarantees in the legislation giving the person involved in the balloting procedure full information and justice and the right of complaint to the registrar.  We have gone over that before.</P>

All the problems the Deputy has in regard to this legislation are adequately catered for between section 3 and section 9 and the paragraphs in the Schedule.

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JosephDowling" hpid="Mr. Dowling Mr. Dowling">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dowling</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes.  Paragraph 2 will impede a person who wishes to call witnesses and the calling of witnesses is a very important part of any inquiry. The Schedule states:</P>
      <P>A person who, on the application of any person, is required to attend before the Registrar as a witness in proceedings on a complaint under section 9 shall be entitled to be paid by the person on whose application he is so required&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      <P>(a) such sum in respect of loss of time and travelling expenses as he would be entitled to on being served with a summons to attend as a witness in the High Court, and</P>
      <P>(b) if he duly attends, a sum equal to any further allowances to which he would be entitled if attending as a witness in proceedings in the High Court.</P>
      <P>And this is only before the registrar.</P>
      <P>Paragraph 3 (1) reads:</P>
      <P>Subject to subparagraph (2) of this paragraph, if any person without reasonable excuse fails or refuses to comply with a requisition of the registrar under paragraph 1 (a) to 1 (c) of this Schedule or any order of the registrar made in pursuance of paragraph 1 (d) of this Schedule, he shall be liable on summary conviction to a fine not exceeding fifty pounds or to imprisonment for a term not exceeding three months, or to both such fine and such imprisonment.</P>
      <P>Paragraph 3 (2) reads:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A person shall not be convicted of an offence under this paragraph <Col N="402" /> by reason of failure or refusal on his part to comply with a requisition to attend as a witness before the registrar unless any sum to which he is entitled under paragraph 2 (a) of this Schedule has been paid or tendered.</P>
    <P>That means that if I want to call a witness I have, out of my own pocket, in the pursuance of a legitimate claim, to pay a witness the amount involved beforehand.  This is absolutely unjust.  In the pursuance of justice one must be permitted to call witnesses, and it is completely irresponsible to expect a union member to be saddled not alone with his own expenses but also with the expenses of witnesses.  There is no protection whatever for trade unionists in this Bill.</P>
    <P>If a person does not attend&mdash;</P>
    <P>...he shall be liable on summary conviction to a fine not exceeding fifty pounds or to imprisonment for a term not exceeding three months, or to both such fine and such imprisonment.</P>
    <P>If a person fails to meet the costs what will happen to him?  Will he be subjected to imprisonment?  Will his home, furniture or belongings be seized?  I would have hoped that the Minister would have eliminated penal clauses such as those.  The whole emphasis of the Minister is on frivolous complaints. Of course there will be frivolous complaints but there will also be legitimate complaints and we should not allow the few to interfere with the rights of the many.  Of course the registrar will get frivolous complaints, just as every Member of this House does, but we also get legitimate complaints and we must pursue all of them to find out whether they are frivolous or legitimate. Who decides whether the complaint is frivolous?  Is it the registrar and, if he decides it is frivolous, are costs awarded against the individual? I would ask the Minister to have another look at this.  I thought he would ensure that no injustice would be done to a worker.  Under this, people will be victimised and deprived of a right. We all know that many a man was prevented from pursuing a legitimate case in our courts because he did not <Col N="403" /> have the necessary financial backing, notwithstanding the fact that his case was a good one.</P>
    <P>While the Minister claims to be a champion of the worker, he brings in legislation that will deprive the worker of his rights.  This Bill will be a deciding factor in some people's minds in determining whether or not they will vote in favour of a merger.  If I were pursuing a legitimate claim as a member of my union I would want to know if I were to be burdened with extensive costs and whether I should lose my home or my belongings or what action would be taken against me if I was unable to pay the cost levied against me.</P>
    <P>The Minister should give us a reasonable explanation of how he will determine what is a frivolous case and what is a responsible case.  There are cases which, even at a late stage, appear to be substantial and to be what the Minister would regard as non-frivolous but the case would be awarded against the complainant.  Surely it is unreasonable to expect those people, who are trying to protect themselves and the fellow members of their union, to pay their own cost.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOLeary" hpid="Mr. M. O'Leary Mr. M. O'Leary">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>I have been making the point, that parallel with the rights given to the complainant in the legislation, there must be protection given to the registrar so that he can effectively carry out his duties under this Bill and devote his time to genuine complaints.  Genuine complaints would be those grounded on the provisions of this legislation; frivolous complaints would be those totally outside its provisions.  The registrar's time could be taken up by people who knew their case was not grounded on such provisions, and by their importuning of the registrar and calling on his aid they would deprive genuine cases of his attention.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It all boils down to whether Deputy Dowling believes that the registrar, who is there to carry out the provisions of this legislation, would award costs against the person with a genuine complaint based on the provisions of this Bill.  I do not think he could or would do that.  In fact it <Col N="404" /> would not be possible for him to do so, having regard to this legislation. Paragraph 3.  (1) which so worries the Deputy relates only to persons who fail to obey the registrar's request (a) for the attendance of witnesses, for the production of documents, for the attendance of the complainant and the discovery of documents.  All these powers are necessary for the registrar to determine a complaint under section 9.  Paragraph 3 (1) which provides for offences relates only to those things and not to the award of costs under section 1 (e) and (f).  I have every confidence that the registrar will interpret this legislation in accordance with its provisions.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JosephDowling" hpid="Mr. Dowling Mr. Dowling">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dowling</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister has indicated that a frivolous case is one that is totally outside the provisions of this legislation.  Surely the registrar would know at an early stage that a case was completely outside the provisions of the legislation and would then dismiss it and would not involve himself in proceedings which would necessitate the calling of witnesses. Surely he would decide that there was no case to pursue.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JosephDowling" hpid="Mr. Dowling Mr. Dowling">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dowling</NameTxt>
      <P>If the registrar sets in train the calling of additional assistance, he must not regard the case as frivolous at that stage.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M. O'Leary</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JosephDowling" hpid="Mr. Dowling Mr. Dowling">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dowling</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister has not defined what a reasonable case would be.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy has sought all day for clarification in layman's language and, in layman's language, a frivolous case would be one not covered by this legislation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JosephDowling" hpid="Mr. Dowling Mr. Dowling">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dowling</NameTxt>
      <P>That is exactly what I thought I heard the Minister say <Col N="405" /> before.  Surely the registrar would say at the initial stage that the case was not in accord with the provisions of the legislation and would not pursue it.  He must be able to show there is no case to pursue at that stage.  If the registrar wishes to bring in additional staff and additional assistance he must regard the case as having some substance, and, therefore, the complainant should not be taxed for costs if, in the last analysis, the case is decided against him, because this would certainly prevent people from availing of their rights under section 9.  Paragraph 1 (e) provides:</P>
      <P>order the whole or any part of the expenses of hearing the complaint, as certified by him, to be paid, either out of the funds of the trade union or by the complainant.</P>
      <P>Surely that is unreasonable.  The registrar should at an early stage be able to indicate to the person making the complaint that it was outside the scope of the Bill and, therefore, he could not pursue it.  The registrar would be foolish to pursue complaints that would be outside the provisions of the Bill, because it would not be his job to do so.  His job is to pursue only cases within the provisions of the Bill.  Therefore, if the case was frivolous it could be dismissed at an early stage.  If additional advice were needed by the registrar, it would show that there was a doubt in his mind about the factors surrounding the complaint.</P>
      <P>I would not like to see trade unionists being victimised to the extent they seem to be victimised under this paragraph.  We want an assurance from the Minister that the ordinary trade unionist who wishes to pursue what he believes is a valid complaint will not be victimised by having to pay the costs of the case, which could be very substantial.  The Minister must agree that it could be reasonable for a person to call witnesses on his behalf.</P>

The job of the registrar will be to deal with what is in this legislation.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>We are arguing a hypothetical case because I cannot see a possibility arising of someone bringing a case not founded on the provisions in this legislation.  Such a case would be a frivolous case.  Because of the Fall there is a certain proportion of wickedness in the world and, because of that wickedness, it is necessary to have a certain penal element in legislation.  There are great liberties and rights given to an individual making a complaint under this legislation.  To ensure against any abuse of these rights we have these provisions protecting the registrar. The Deputy says the registrar, in his wisdom, will see that no witnesses are necessary when a case that has no substance in it is brought.  If a person, however, brings a frivolous case the registrar would be forced to go through all the steps required in a genuine case and the purpose of this provision is to ensure he is not forced into that position.  The Schedule is as much in the interests of the genuine complainant as it is in the interests of the proper utilisation of the registrar's time.  I would urge the Deputy <Col N="407" /> to withdraw his opposition because the case about which he is talking simply will not stand up.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JosephDowling" hpid="Mr. Dowling Mr. Dowling">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dowling</NameTxt>
      <P>Perhaps I was not too clear.  Earlier the Minister indicated that a frivolous case was a case totally outside the provisions of this legislation. If that is so, then I accept that, but that is not what the Bill states. Then the Minister goes on to say that it does not really mean that, that it means something else.  If a frivolous case is totally outside the provisions of the legislation any intelligent registrar would be able to convince the complainant that that is the position.</P>
      <P>The Minister also agrees that the bulk of cases would not be frivolous. They would be made by responsible trade unionists.  Now there can be no guarantee in the pursuance of any particular complaint that the complaint will be successful.  There may be a doubt and the complainant may not get the benefit of the doubt.  If he does not, he will be subject to all the penal clauses in this Bill.  He will have to pay all the costs.  This will prevent responsible people from making legitimate complaints.  It is a very serious matter and I would appeal to the Minister to consider this particular aspect.</P>
      <P>I would also press the Minister for an answer to the previous question: what will happen in the event of a trade unionist finding himself unable to pay the costs?  The fact that he would lose the case would not necessarily mean the complaint was frivolous. It might have major substance. It might be a borderline case.  But there might be some doubt and the complainant might not get the benefit of the doubt.  The majority of complainants will be responsible trade unionists and therefore the majority of the complaints will not be frivolous. There should be some provision to protect the trade unionist.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Very often in legislation we have to probe deeply.  We have to pursue the matter to the bitter end and we may finally discover we will not be successful.  But this is normal procedure. It is the normal procedure that <Col N="408" /> must be followed in all cases where we give rights to an individual to complain.  The Minister is very unreasonable in writing down this situation. He has changed his position on several occasions as to what might or might not be a frivolous complaint. As I said, a competent registrar should be able to convince a complainant at an early stage that the complaint has no substance, if it has no substance.  This provision will prevent genuine complaints being made because of its penal nature.  If a right is given, then an individual should not be penalised for exercising that right and neither should he be inhibited from pursuing that right or from seeking rectification of a legitimate grievance.  The Minister will have to change his attitude.  It is most offensive. It will certainly be offensive to the great bulk of responsible trade unionists.</P>
    <P>I hope the Minister will see some reason in the points made here this evening.  Will he re-examine the Schedule before Report Stage and ensure that a person who brings a frivolous case will have to meet the costs? If a man makes a deliberate effort to obstruct he should be called upon to meet certain costs.  At the moment, a person who brings a genuine case will be asked to pay the expenses if he is not 100 per cent successful.  The Minister has not told us what will happen to a trade unionist if costs are awarded against him and he finds himself unable to pay them.  This is a very important point.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOLeary" hpid="Mr. M. O'Leary Mr. M. O'Leary">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>In the context of this legislation, costs would only be awarded against the person bringing a frivolous case.  The registrar would not award costs against a person who lost a genuine case.  It is inconceivable that costs would be awarded against such a person.  I think we have gone over this ground sufficiently now.  The penal clauses are necessary to ensure that there is no abuse by a tiny minority. This is standard procedure and it is important from the point of view of the registrar and the genuine complainant.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In answer to the Deputy's request that I should reconsider this Bill.  I <Col N="409" /> think he will agree that I have readily accepted any suggestions he made which I thought worthy of being incorporated in the Bill.  I am satisfied that the Schedule meets what we wish it to meet.  In no case is there a penalty against a genuine complainant. I hope the Deputy will not consider me unreasonable when I say that the Schedule is satisfactory in every respect.</P>
    <P>When I was sitting on the benches opposite it was remarkable to find a Minister accepting any amendment put forward by the Opposition.  I believe that, if a reasonable proposition is put forward by the Opposition, it should be accepted.  Any legislation is the product of this House sitting as a legislature.  I do not suffer from any false pride in thinking that every clause in a Bill must be my own creation.  I am willing to have every Deputy participate.</P>
    <P>I see no point in some of the criticisms of the Schedule which the Deputy is making.  It may not be intentional, but the tenor of his remarks is inclined to discredit the role of the registrar.  We would not like to cast any slur on the impartiality of a respected member of the legal profession. He is chosen for his impartiality and he will be the servant of this legislation, its interpreter.  It could not be accepted that he would award costs against a genuine complainant even though he lost his case which was based on a genuine ground.  People must lose cases in the ordinary way when there is disagreement on an interpretation.  A frivolous pretext is not based on any sane interpretation of the provisions of this legislation.

      <P>Even though people base their case on a genuine interpretation of the law they may lose.  I find it inconceivable that the <Col N="410" /> registrar would award costs against such people.  The penal clauses are in the Schedule to deal with people who base their case on a frivolous pretext. This legislation defends the genuine complainant.  It would be very unprofitable for us to wonder what would happen in this case or in that case. The Deputy accuses me of being dogmatic in other respects, rather unfairly, but I can be dogmatic in saying that a person who brings a frivolous case will suffer the full rigours of the Schedule, and rightly so.</P>

      <P>I agree that a person who brings a frivolous case which is intended to obstruct or impede an amalgamation should have to pay the costs.  The Minister has defined a frivolous case.  He has now indicated that if a genuine case is lost, it is not necessary for the registrar to award costs against the complainant.  That is not in the Bill.  If there were guidelines for the registrar I would be quite happy.  I wanted an assurance from the Minister that a person who lost a legitimate case would not have to pay the witnesses' costs or the union's costs. Can I take it that a person who pursues a legitimate claim will not have to pay the witnesses' costs or the union's costs?</P>

Does the Minister not think that is unreasonable?</P>
      <P>The Minister indicated earlier that my reference to registrars could be regarded as offensive.  The Minister clearly indicated that the registrar should be able to make up his mind at an early stage as to whether a complaint was frivolous.  Although he does not have to pay union expenses, he must pay the expenses of the witness. In the event of a witness being called upon to meet expenses, what will happen if he is unable to pay? How will the union be compensated for the expenses paid by them which would normally be paid by the complainant? Would the officials of the unions be regarded as witnesses for the purposes of the complainant being called upon to meet the expenses? Would he be responsible for the expenses of the witnesses called by the registrar, even if they are trade union officials?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>I am grateful to the Minister for meeting the point of view expressed on this side of the House. Section 9, as worded, with the proposed amendment, still leaves in general terms an obligation on members of the board not to vote when matters come before the board in which they have beneficial interests. I should like to highlight the general terms of the section giving this direction to members of the board and compare them with the amendments which have recently been put down by the Minister laying down the specific procedures which must be gone through by members of local authorities in declaring any interest they may have in dealings in land or development of land which may come before the council.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There seems to be a serious distinction being made between members of local authorities and members of the board.  In fact, they are both performing similar duties except that the board, being the final decider of planning applications, must be deemed to be in a more important decision-making position than members of local authorities whose decisions can be appealed against to the board by persons who so desire.  Would the Minister elaborate on this so that we may understand his thinking?  Why is he satisfied with the general directions to members of the board when he has laid down specific procedures and prescribed the form on which members of local authorities must make declarations?  He has also decided that registers must be kept of the interests of any member of the local authority. Generally, there is elaborate machinery to ascertain the interests of local <Col N="415" /> authority members but this is not required of members of the board or employees of the board.  One must agree that these groups are all involved in the same process of decision-making in relation to planning matters.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>It is possible that Deputy Molloy has missed the point.  Local authority members are elected for the purpose of carrying out a number of functions one of which is to draw up a plan for an area.  Members of the board are appointed for the specific purpose of doing a job.  If they have an interest they must give the chairman, in writing, notice of that interest. As far as the employees are concerned they will not be in a position to influence the decision of the board.  Employees of local authorities may obtain information about numerous applications which come before them.  There is a big difference, and I am sure the Deputy appreciates that difference.  One group are elected to do a number of jobs, one of which is to draw up a county plan but not to give a planning decision, and the other group are appointed specifically to deal with planning appeals.  The latter must give notice to the chairman if they have an interest in any of the matters coming before them.  It then follows that they will not vote or take part if they have an interest.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Mr. Molloy Mr. Molloy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>In the case of members of local authorities the Minister requires that a register be kept and this register is available for public inspection but this will not be done in the case of members of the board.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>Members of local authorities are elected and the public when voting for them to carry out certain functions do not take into account what associations they have or what property they have.  They are not selected specifically to do the job but the members of the board are appointed.  Matters to be considered when the appointments are being made are who they are and what they are.  When they are on a case in which they have an interest members of the board must give notice of that interest to the chairman.  The question of a <Col N="416" /> register does not arise in their case because they are appointed to do the job specifically and are not elected haphazardly&mdash;if the House will excuse the expression&mdash;as members of a local authority may be by a vote. There is no comparison between the two.  There is a difference in the functions of both and a good reason why members of the board, having been selected for this job, have to notify the chairman if they have an interest.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Mr. Molloy Mr. Molloy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>The explanation still leaves a lot of question marks.  I do not accept fully the explanation given by the Minister.  There seems to be a certain amount of discrimination against one section <i>vis-à-vis</i> another. The group being discriminated against most are those who are elected.  The Minister expressed the view last night that his preference always was for the view of those elected but in this case he is requiring elected members to adhere to a rigid procedure of disclosure and he is not requiring members of the board to adhere to similar strictures.  That raises some doubts in my mind.  I fail to understand why this distinction must be made and why the members of the board should not also be required, if it is thought fit and proper that members of local authorities should write their interests on a register to be kept available for public inspection, to do the same as councillors.</P>
      <P>If the purpose in keeping such a register is to allow the community to satisfy themselves that decisions of these bodies, the board and the local authorities, are arrived at in an open and fair manner and that persons are not taking advantage of the position they hold in matters which come before them for decision, why such rigid procedures should be adopted in the case of elected members and not applied to members of the boards is something I do not fully understand.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy must agree that the whole point is that people are selected to do this job because of special qualifications.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Mr. Molloy Mr. Molloy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>If it is a question of <Col N="417" /> human weakness surely members of the board can have these human weaknesses just as members of local authorities can, if the Minister is suspicious of these people.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>Except for the fact that even the members of the board who are appointed specifically to do a job must give notice in writing to the chairman if there is any question of a connection. The members of the board will be appointed by the Minister and when making the appointment the Minister shall fix such members' term of office which shall not exceed three years and, subject to articles 10 and 12 of the Schedule, such members shall hold office on such terms and conditions as the Minister, with the consent of the Minister for the Public Service, determines.</P>
      <P>In fact, if a member of the board is found not to be carrying out his duties, or to be in any way infringing, it is possible to deal with him.  Deputy Molloy is missing the cardinal point although I repeated it three or four times.  One group of people are elected to do a number of things, not specifically to deal with planning, while, in the other section, the board are appointed because of their qualifications to deal with planning.  This is the kernel of the matter.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cunningham</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;that members of local authorities will declare their interest in writing and have a register kept of those interests.  The Minister had said: &ldquo;not specifically as far as planning appeals are concerned&rdquo;.  I think planning appeals form a very important aspect of the planning legislation under the 1963 Act and under <Col N="418" /> this Bill also.  Indeed I think it was the debate in this House on planning appeals which more or less expedited this legislation and caused the proposed formation of a board as envisaged in this Bill.  Members of local authorities have very little to do with planning appeals.  Their influence would come into play in certain cases.  In other words, after a Minister for Local Government decided a planning appeal, that decision could be upset or set aside by members of a local planning authority by way of motion, but that very rarely happens.</P>
      <P>The point I am trying to make is this.  The influence of members of local authorities in planning appeals is minimal compared with that which the board will have.  In other words, 90 per cent of the planning appeals which will be decided will be decided purely and solely by the members of the board.  It is in a very few cases only that a situation would arise where the influence of members of local authorities would come into play in planning appeals.  Yet they are expected to declare their interest, all of their personal interest.  Indeed if their wives or families had any interest they would have to be entered in the register as well.  Therefore, if this be so, in 90 per cent of the planning appeals decided the board will be 100 per cent involved.  In those circumstances it is only right and equitable, if you are going to have elected members of local authorities declare their interest and keep a register of such interest available for inspection, that there should be more required of members of the board than the Minister is proposing in this Bill.  I think this is reasonable.  I think no member of the board would object if the Minister decided to have him operative under the same criteria as he requires of elected members of local authorities.</P>

But, as yesterday evening, Deputy Cunningham comes in and starts talking about things that do not affect the Bill.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>Could I explain to Deputy Cunningham because, when I have finished, I should like him to know what is the situation?  When we talk about members of local authorities and decide that they must do certain things&mdash;and really I should be explaining this at a later stage in the Bill, but I hate somebody to go asleep not knowing something they could know tonight&mdash;they have the right to make changes in the use-zoning of land which can increase its value. Local authority members can do that; members of this board cannot. Changes in use-zoning can enhance the site value by facilitating development or redevelopment which is more profitable.  Local authority members can do that.  The planning board cannot do that.  The planning board will be dealing with individual appeals and they cannot vote if they have an interest. Deputy Cunningham spoke as if there was only one thing that local authority members could do, that is, that if a planning appeal was carried when it came back to the local authority, they could reverse the decision.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>They can do that but the reason they are asked to make the declarations which they will be <Col N="420" /> asked to make when this is finished is because of the allegations which are being made fairly widely, rightly or wrongly, that members of local authorities can and have rezoned areas so that the land within those areas would be of greater value and that they or their friends were able to enrich themselves as a result.  This has been published in newspapers and fairly generally talked about.  Nobody in this House has more respect for local authority members than have I, but if there are people who do that kind of thing, in order to ensure that they cannot get away with it we are making provision in the Bill to prevent its continuance.  But that is an entirely different matter to dealing with people who are appointed specifically to deal with individual appeals which come before them in which, if they have any interest, they must declare it in writing to the chairman. I think that is reasonable and fair.  To try to fuse the two issues as one is, to say the least of it, mischievous.  I will go a little further if Deputy Cunningham feels that stronger words might be used.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cunningham</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister made a song and dance about his action which was to prevent members rezoning and thereby benefiting themselves and their friends.  Let the Minister not try to wriggle out of what he said.  He insinuated that members of local authorities had nothing to do with planning appeals and that as far as planning appeals were concerned it was not necessary for them to have their interests declared and registered. I will not say the Minister is stupid and does not know what he is talking about.  I want to try to impress on him that elected members of local authorities have a say in planning appeals legislation.  It is only right they should have a say in dealing in certain cases with planning appeals which have gone to the Minister, and which under this legislation will go to the board.  Neither the board nor the Minister are God Almighty and it is a good thing to have a further safety valve in the legislation.</P>
      <P>It is being continued in this legislation the same as it was embodied in the previous planning legislation of 1963, that members of local authorities, having been informed officially of the Minister's decision and any individual appeal, have the right to table a motion at the local authority meeting, setting aside the decision of the Minister and in this case setting aside the decision of the board.  The Minister is protecting the principle, with which we agree, that the action of members of the local authority should not be motivated by personal gain or interest by putting down a motion, the effect of which may be to benefit one or more of their members or their friends.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="422" /> You may have a planning appeal in respect of any development.  As far as that is concerned a member or members of a local authority could be personally and beneficially involved. The Minister is ensuring in this Bill that if they are so involved they must declare their interest in writing and have it registered.  This is in the case of members of local authorities who will deal with planning appeals.  The Minister will not in this section make the same provision for the declaration of interest by the other parties involved in the planning appeal, who are the board.  It is logical that we should require the same treatment for all from one end of the process to the other.  If certain provisions are required at one end and more stringent provisions are required at the other, then the Minister will have to do a lot more to justify the differentiation.</P>

      <P>I am sorry we do not appear to be making much progress but this is a natural thing when we are dealing with a long Bill of this kind with a large number of amendments and we have not taken the trouble to check on all the material before we start the debate.  Deputy Cunningham made a number of categoric statements.  For his information I refer him to section 30 (e) which states:</P>
      <P>the insertion of the following subsections after subsection (2) of section 30:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(2A)  A planning authority shall neither revoke nor modify a permission under this section unless there has been a change in circumstances relating to the proper planning and development of the area concerned and such change in circumstances has occurred,</P>
      <P>(a)  in case a notice relating to the permission is served under this section and is annulled since the annulment of the notice,</P>
      <P>(b)  in case no notice is so served, since the granting of the permission.</P>
    </Speaker>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Cunningham spoke about permission under the existing law to revoke planning permission and he said that it was continued in this Bill.  I am saying it is not continued unless there has been a change in circumstances from the time the appeal was made and decided. That being so, Deputy Cunningham's whole argument appears to be exploded.</P>

      <P>It appears to me.  I do not know what Deputy Cunningham thinks of it.  He may have peculiar ideas in his own mind which I would not dare to try to follow.  He spoke about declaring an interest.  This board will be dealing with appeals.  Say an appeal comes up from any place; say somebody applies for planning permission for a site in County Galway in Deputy Molloy's constituency.  How would somebody, after the board have been appointed, declare an interest in that site?  They do not know what is to come before the board.</P>
      <P>Where local authority members are concerned, they are able to declare an interest because the general issue will be there; but the board will be dealing with specific cases, and only with appeals in specific cases.  I do not want to continue with this argument which we have been carrying on because we are adequately covered. Members of the board will be appointed because they are people of integrity who will have the ability to deal with planning appeals.  They will be people who, if by any chance something comes before them in which they have a beneficial interest, will declare that interest in writing to the presiding chairman.  The time we have been wasting on this matter could be very well used dealing with the other sections of the Bill.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Mr. Molloy Mr. Molloy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>The statement by the Minister does not alter the argument being made by Deputy Cunningham and the points I have been making. He said that local authority members are involved in certain circumstances in deciding planning applications which go on appeal&mdash;that they had power in certain circumstances to revoke the Minister's decision on appeal.  Section 30 of the 1963 Act, to which the Minister referred&mdash;by coincidence the section in this Bill is also 30&mdash;does not preclude members of local authorities from revoking decision on appeal providing certain circumstances obtain, but there is no total removal of the right to revoke. The amendment the Minister is suggesting merely tightens up the circumstances in which local authority members can revoke.  Section 30 (1) of the 1963 Act states:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="425" /> Subject to the provisions of this section, if the planning authority decide that it is expedient that any permission to develop land granted under this Part of the Act should be revoked or modified, they may, by notice served on the owner and on the occupier of the land affected and on any other person who in their opinion will be affected by the revocation or modification, revoke or modify the permission.</P>
    <P>(2)  In deciding, pursuant to this section, whether it is expedient to serve a notice under this section, the planning authority shall be restricted to considering the proper planning and development of the area of the authority (including the preservation and improvement of the amenities thereof), regard being had to the provisions of the development plan and the provisions of any special amenity area order relating to the said area.</P>
    <P>Amendment No. 89, which we will be moving on to and which the Minister has referred to, states that the insertion of a subsection after subsection (2) of section 30 will read:</P>
    <P>In page 19, between lines 24 and 25, before paragraph (f) to insert the following paragraphs:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;(f) the insertion of the following subsection after subsection (1) of section 38:</P>
    <P>&lsquo;(1A) A planning authority in entering into an agreement under this section may join with any body which is a prescribed authority for the purposes of section 21 of this Act.&rsquo;;</P>
    <P>(g) the substitution in section 38 (2) of &lsquo;the planning authority or any body joined with them for &lsquo;the planning authority&rsquo; where that expression firstly occurs and of &lsquo;the planning authority or such body, as may be appropriate,&rsquo; for &lsquo;the planning authority&rsquo; where the expression secondly occurs; and&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>Does the Minister agree with that or is he saying to Deputy Cunningham that local authority members do not <Col N="426" /> have power to revoke decisions in any circumstances?  I do not think that is what he was saying.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LiamCunningham" hpid="Mr. Cunningham Mr. Cunningham">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cunningham</NameTxt>
      <P>That is what he tried to say.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Mr. Molloy Mr. Molloy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>We should clear that up.  It is necessary to show that local authority members are involved in decisions which affect decisions made previously. They are also involved, as the Minister has stated, in the adoption of development plans and in zoning which will apply within development plans. The Minister tried to make a distinction between the functions and responsibilities of the board and those of local authority members.  I do not accept the validity of the Minister's argument that a difference applies in as much as he is of the opinion, because the board will be dealing with specific cases of permission, it is not necessary to expect that members of the board should make declarations similar to what, later on in the Bill, he requires local authorities to make.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>His argument therefore falls because local authority members are also involved in decision making in specific cases.  We also know that they have the facility of section 4 of the 1955 City and County Management Act through which they can direct managers to grant permission in certain cases.  That takes away whatever validity the Minister thought he had in his argument.  His facts were not correct. The main point I want to get to is that if the Minister is satisfied that laying down such rigid and strict regulations to be complied with by local authority members&mdash;he has put down an amendment which we will be discussing later and we must accept that he is in favour of his own amendment &mdash;our argument is that the Minister must also apply similar stringent rules to members of this board who will be involved on a day to day basis in important planning decisions.  The opportunities granted to local authority members in the normal course of a <Col N="427" /> year's work to make decisions affecting a planning area are very rare.</P>
    <P>It is not the practice that councils have a series of section 4 decisions before them at every meeting; it is not the practice that they rezone land at every meeting; it is not the practice to have several motions of revocation before monthly council meetings.  It does not happen very often in the course of a year.  However, the board will be in the position where they are making vital planning decisions every day&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="LiamCunningham" hpid="Mr. Cunningham Mr. Cunningham">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cunningham</NameTxt>
      <P>Three thousand planning cases per year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Mr. Molloy Mr. Molloy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>This board is a new one.  We must ensure that we do not leave any loopholes, so that the public will be satisfied that the board is independent, above suspicion and reproach, and that members will not find themselves in a position where they can make decisions from which they might obtain benefit.  If the principle which the Minister is introducing in a very elaborate way <i>vis-à-vis</i> members of local authorities is to be accepted as a good principle, it must be applied equally to members of the board who will be involved to a greater extent than members of a local authority.  The sheer logic of that argument must influence the Minister in accepting the points we are making.  If it is to be laid down that members of local authorities are to write into a register, to be kept by officers of county councils, every interest they have in land or in its development, every interest their wives or nominees may have, or any shares they hold in excess of £500 in a company that develops land, why do we not ensure that the members of the board make similar declarations?  That is the point we are making.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The arguments the Minister has given so far against it fall because they were not factual.  The Minister incorrectly stated in the course of his short contribution that members of local authorities could rezone land which might benefit some friends of theirs. He seemed to imply that the provisions in the Bill dealing with local <Col N="428" /> authority members in some way would prevent that type of situation arising. Of course, the Minister's amendment cannot prevent such a situation arising if a member decides that is his motivation. I do not know whether it would happen but certainly the Minister's amendment will not stop it.  His amendment only precludes a person from voting as a member of a local authority where the matter for decision is one in which he has some beneficial interest.  There is no obligation on him to abstain from voting if, in the Minister's words, &ldquo;his friends&rdquo;&mdash;I put that in inverted commas&mdash;want something done and he is prepared to vote for it.</P>
    <P>The Minister has not given us a satisfactory explanation although I had assumed he had a reasonable one. If he is open-minded with regard to the points we have been making he must accept that there is logic and sense in what we have said.  If he can show us there is not we will accept that.  If in his heart he agrees with what we are saying we would expect that he would give some indication of making similar provisions here if he considers they should apply later.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy referred to &ldquo;his friends&rdquo; and mentioned that he would put those words in inverted commas.  I would put them very much in inverted commas because the allegations that got so much publicity was that friends&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Mr. Molloy Mr. Molloy">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>It means that people were so friendly they would give compensation to their friends for doing this for them.  This is what I am trying to stop and I am sure the Deputy will agree that if it is happening it should be stopped.  The whole question of information which councillors may have with regard to water supplies, sewerage schemes and other types of development may be debated under section 30.  The arguments being made now are about section 30, not about this section.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Cunningham was interested in whether the proposal included in <Col N="429" /> this Bill would prevent the revoking of decisions of the board by the local authority.  Unless there is a change in circumstances the answer is &ldquo;yes&rdquo;; if there is a change in circumstances the answer is &ldquo;no&rdquo;.  It will prevent the blanket right which they now have, namely that on any matter which comes before the Minister in which he makes a decision with which the local authority disagree if they can get a section 4 applied they have the right to reverse it.  That will no longer exist.  All that will exist will be the right to revoke it if circumstances change.  It is right that permission be given.</P>
    <P>With regard to what the board should declare, I do not know where extra security can be put in to ensure that they are honest men.  Deputy Haughey introduced an amendment on this and eventually I suggested a form of words I proposed to put in on Report Stage.  The Deputy said it covered the two points he wanted to make.  I say to Deputy Molloy I do not know in what way this can be safeguarded.  I do not believe the declaration being asked of local authority members is what is required here.  Would the Deputy like to say what he thinks should be put in here?</P>

      <P>Let the Deputy keep his tongue quiet for a few minutes. That is a phrase that he often uses to the Chair.  Let me rephrase what I said to Deputy Callanan.  I said that he was expressing the views which some people on the Fianna Fáil front bench seem to agree with but do not say so.  What they were implying was that one could not trust even a judge. A judge is appointed in a certain way and is respected in that way.  When he is trying a case he has no need to make any kind of declaration.  We accept the law that he determines.  It is suggested now by Fianna Fáil that to take him from a court of law and put him in charge of a planning board may result in his becoming a different person.  I have asked Deputy Molloy to put into words what he suggests that both the judge and the eminent members of the board should declare before being allowed to hear appeals as to whether somebody should build a house, a factory or whatever is involved.  We should know what the Deputy is thinking of because on several occasions he has talked of the necessity for a declaration. It is sufficient to lay down that members of the board cannot vote if they have an interest and that if they have an interest they must declare that in writing to the chairman.  I am happy with that provision and shall continue with it until such time as evidence can be produced which can be accepted as something which these people can subscribe to and which the House would consider to be the proper sort of declaration to be made.</P>

      <P>I should hope that this debate would not develop into a <Col N="433" /> dual effort.  There are other people here who have the right to express themselves also.  I am concerned about the image of public representatives. The Minister has said, and rightly so, that it is desirable that the image of public representatives should be no less than that of any other section of the community and I include here judge, jury or anybody else.  I am a public representative.  In other areas of my life I have objected to suggestions that people should come and watch what I do.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Tunney</NameTxt>
      <P>I have been elected by the people in a democratic way but if they should discover that I am not the person they elected they would have the right to sack me.  I object to a suggestion that there should be anybody present at times on committees to observe what I do because the inference would be that while being observed I might do something that I would not do otherwise.  I am anxious to uphold what must be the integrity and the honour of public representatives. The Minister, rightly, in this legislation is making it mandatory that public representatives should indicate their interest in areas, the value of which could prove beneficial to them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would suggest that anybody else operating in that field might reasonably be expected to indicate the same interest, if such exists.  We all know that a judge, whether present or past, is a human being like anybody else and on occasion might be seen to move from a straight and narrow path.  It is wrong to talk about members of this board, regardless of which professional field they might come from, as being eminent people who would not do wrong.  Simultaneously there is an implication there that public representatives are not so eminent or have not as much integrity.  Generally speaking, human beings can be accused of being lacking in both these respects but where a Bill involves those different sections, it is normal and reasonable to expect members of the board to yield to the same register of interest as <Col N="434" /> would be the case in respect of public representatives.</P>
    <P>The Minister said that there would be no point in asking him, for instance, to indicate his interest because he might be called on to adjudicate on a case in respect of an area in Galway but if he had indicated already where his interest, if any, lay, it should be obvious to all concerned as to whether he should serve on a board that was adjudicating on a case in respect of Galway.  This section should not generate any unnecessary heat.  It would be a worthwhile exercise for the Minister to think about the point I am making, that is, that members of the board are asked for the same declaration that is required of local authorities because so far as I am concerned one is not greater than the other in terms of integrity or honour.</P>

      <P>In the discussion we are having on section 9 we feel that the obligation of members of the board to disclose their interest should be similar to the obligation that the Minister intends to place on members of local authorities.  He should not make any distinction because both are performing similar functions in planning <Col N="435" /> matters.  I was asked to give some indication of the type of amendment I had in mind.  It would be quite a simple matter if the Minister accepted it to change the wording of amendment No. 75 and where the words &ldquo;planning authority&rdquo; appear to put in &ldquo;boards&rdquo; and where the words &ldquo;authority to whom the declaration is being made&rdquo; appears to put in either &ldquo;the Minister for Local Government&rdquo; or &ldquo;the Secretary of the Department of Local Government.&rdquo;  It might be better that the Department should keep the register.  The amendment would then read something like this:</P>
      <P>.&mdash;() It shall be the duty of a member of the Board to give to the Secretary of the Department of Local Government a declaration in the prescribed form, signed by him and containing particulars of every interest of his which is an interest to which this section applies and for so long as he continues to be a member of the Board it shall be his duty, where there is a change regarding an interest particulars of which are contained in the declaration or where he acquires any other interest to which this section applies, to give to the Secretary of the Department of Local Government a fresh such declaration.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>The amendment would continue to say:</P>
      <P>() This section applies to the following interests, namely:</P>
      <P>(a)  any estate or interest which a member of the Board has in land situated in the jurisdiction of the State, the Twenty-Six Counties,</P>
      <P>(b)  any business of dealing in or developing land in which such a member is engaged or employed and any such business carried on by a company or other body of which he, or any nominee of his, is a member,</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>(c)  any profession, business or occupation in which such a member is engaged, whether on his own behalf or otherwise, and <Col N="436" /> which relates to dealing in or developing land.</P>
    <P>()  A person who is a member of the Board and who has an interest to which this section applies shall be regarded as complying with the requirements of the subsection of this section if, and only if, he gives to the Secretary of the Department of Local Government a declaration mentioned in that subsection within the period of twenty-eight days beginning&mdash;</P>
    <P>(a)  in case the person is such a member on the commencement of this section, on such commencement,</P>
    <P>(b)  in case the person becomes such a member after the commencement of this section, on the day on which he becomes such a member,</P>
    <P>(c)  in case there is a change regarding an interest particulars of which are contained in a declaration already given by the person or where the person acquires any other interest to which this section applies, on the day on which the change occurs or the other such interest is acquired.</P>
    <P>()  For the purposes of this section a member of the Board shall be regarded as having an estate or interest in land if he, or any nominee of his, is a member of a company or other body which has an estate or interest in the land.</P>
    <P>The Secretary of the Department of Local Government shall for the purposes of this section keep a register (which register is in this section referred to as the register of members' interests) and shall enter therein the particulars contained in declarations given to the Board pursuant to this section.  The register of members' interests shall be kept at the offices of the Secretary of the Department of Local Government and shall be available for public inspection during office hours.</P>

      <P>The Minister asked me if I could give him some idea of the type of amendment which would meet the arguments we were making. He seemed to think it would not be possible or else he wanted us to elaborate on the type of amendment we had in mind.  I am giving the House the type of amendment I have in mind which is very similar to the type of amendment which the Minister later on will wish to apply to members of local authorities.  We are reasonable in asking that this should apply to members of the board.  If the Chair allows me to complete it, it will make sense.</P>
      <P>()  Where a person ceases to be a member of the Board, any particulars entered in the register of members' interests as a result of a declaration being given by the person to the Department of Local Government pursuant to this section shall be removed, as soon as may be after the expiration of the period of five years beginning on the day on which the person ceases to be such member, from the said register by the authority.</P>
      <P>The numbering of these subsections will need adjustment.</P>
      <P>() Subject to subsection (8) of this section, a person who fails to comply with subsection (1) of this section or who, when purporting to comply with the requirements of the said subsection (1), gives particulars which are to his knowledge false or misleading in a material respect, shall be guilty of an offence and shall be liable on summary conviction to a fine not exceeding one hundred pounds, or at the discretion of the court, to imprisonment for a term not exceeding six months, or to both the fine and the imprisonment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>()  In any proceedings for an offence under this section it shall be a defence for the defendant to prove that at the relevant time he believed, in good faith and upon reasonable grounds, either that there was no matter as regards which he was then required to make a declaration under subsection (1) of this section or that the matter in <Col N="438" /> relation to which the offence is alleged was not one as regards which he was so required to make such declaration.</P>
    <P>()  In this and in the next following section &lsquo;company&rsquo; means a company within the meaning of section 2 of the Companies Act, 1963, or a company incorporated outside the State.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>That is a long section and I am sorry it had to be read out.  That is the type of amendment we propose. There is another long amendment with which I shall not bore the House but which goes into great detail on how these matters shall be operated. Our complaint is that the Minister set out in very great detail new regulations which he wishes to apply only to members of local authorities and not to members of the board.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LiamCunningham" hpid="Mr. Cunningham Mr. Cunningham">

      <P>Discrimination against elected representatives.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Mr. Molloy Mr. Molloy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>Surely they should be applied where the greatest volume of decisions is being made, if anywhere, and that is in the board.</P>
      <P>The Minister should come clean and remove any element of discrimination. He has cast very serious aspersions on the integrity of members of local authorities.  There are roughly 1,500 members of local authorities throughout the country many of whom have given long, faithful and loyal service to the communities in which they live over a great number of years.  They are held in high esteem and the fact that a Minister should by making this distinction in a Bill, discriminate against them in this way and so cast a serious aspersion on their integrity, is unworthy of a Minister and certainly unworthy of the Oireachtas and we, in the Opposition, should not be asked to accept such an amendment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That is the point we are making. We are discussing section 9 and we say that if this type of provision is to be introduced it should be introduced fairly.  There are three classes involved in decision-making, the county managers in making decisions at local authority level, the board, under this <Col N="439" /> Bill when it becomes law, who will make decisions on appeal and the members of the local authority who are charged with responsibility for adopting development plans and who have other responsibilities and authority under the Planning Act such as revoking permissions and directing that permissions be granted under section 4 of the City and County Managers Act, 1955.  The Minister has chosen the local authority members for stringent regulations on declaration of interest.  He has not sought such stringent regulations to be applied to members of the board and he has sought nowhere to apply any obligation to declare interest to the county managers.  I hope our contributions so far have brought home to the Minister the problem he is creating for himself.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>I have not, nor ever would, cast aspersions on the elected members of local authorities.  Aspersions which were cast were cast in the public press and it is to prevent people like those who cast the aspersions from ever getting the opportunity of doing it again that we are introducing this, to prove that people who are members of local authorities will not be caught in the net in which apparently people were caught because I did not see any court cases, as I was hoping I would see, against the newspapers which cast those aspersions. They cast them publicly.  They put it down in black and white and every one of us in public life has suffered as a result of the fact that those things were published and were not challenged.</P>
      <P>It is all right for Deputy Molloy and people like him to get up and make long-winded statements about what is and what is not being done. We want to protect the integrity of the public representative and this Bill will ensure that it is done.  Deputy Molloy read out an amendment to a section of the Bill which applies to public representatives.  Am I to assume that if such an amendment is put down to deal with the members of the board the Fianna Fáil Party will accept it?</P>

      <P>The Minister has made a very important announcement here now and that is that there is comprehensive legislation on the way dealing with this whole area.  This is something we welcome and we are very pleased to hear it.  We have dealt with section 9 within the strict ambit and confines of this Bill and the board and we are reasonably happy with the proposal the Minister made to us across the floor of the House. Is it not the sensible thing then to leave the provisions governing public representatives and put the whole lot into the comprehensive legislation?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>No, Sir.  I have some amendments here which are going in. <Col N="443" /> Deputy Molloy read one at length and he suggested that it should apply to the members of the board.  I asked him whether, if it were introduced as an amendment, he would be prepared to accept it on behalf of the Fianna Fáil Party and he said yes.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>We are only dealing with section 9 and managers are not mentioned in section 9.  He can come to that afterwards.  As far as I am concerned, Deputy Molloy has agreed that the Fianna Fáil will accept this amendment if it is introduced on Report Stage.  If that is so that deals with this particular matter.</P>

      <P>The Deputy can deal with that when he comes to the section dealing with it.  I have an assurance from Deputy Molloy that <Col N="444" /> he will accept that amendment on behalf of the Fianna Fáil Party.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>No, no, no.  That does not arise.  We will deal with the managers on the relevant section. This section deals with the planning board and he has given an assurance which I will have pleasure in holding him to in this House.</P>
