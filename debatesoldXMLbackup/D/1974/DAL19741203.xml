    <Speaker pid="LiamCosgrave" hpid="The Taoiseach Liam Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LiamCosgrave" hpid="The Taoiseach Liam Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>No.  Some are additional. The post of assistant secretary replaced a previous assistant secretary, Mr Ó hAnnracháin, who was transferred to the Department of Education as information and publicity officer.  Two clerical assistants were appointed to fill normal vacancies created by the departure of staff. Five information assistants were recruited in September and October, 1973, by the Civil Service Commission to posts which were established in 1972 to replace existing staff officer posts (4) and a deputy assistant post (1).</P>

The Minister has received numerous requests and letters to which he has not replied, except by formal acknowledgment.

      <P>I am not aware that the decision announced by me on 17th October, 1974, which involves the appointment of committees of management for national schools, has been rejected by the Irish National Teachers' Organisation.  On the contrary, my information is that the matter is to be considered by a special congress of that organisation in January, 1975.</P>
      <P>I may say, however, that the appointment of separate committees of management for individual national schools is an issue quite apart from the overall organisation of school administration on a county or a regional basis.  Proposals in this latter regard are still under consideration.</P>

      <P>Since the closure of Marlboro' House the Department no longer operate any detention centre in the sense of the term used in the legislation, nor do they propose to do so.  Such <Col N="615" /> centres were intended for the committal of children for a month at a time as a purely punitive measure and this procedure is not now considered to be of sufficient rehabilitative value to warrant the maintenance of such centres.</P>
      <P>The great majority of child offenders requiring residential care can be catered for in the special schools administered by my Department. These provide an educational programme in an open setting designed to change the children's attitudes and behaviour and to rehabilitate them as responsible members of society.</P>
      <P>The development of assessment facilities, at Finglas Children's Centre and elsewhere, is tending to establish the need for certain specialised facilities beyond those available in the existing special schools.  Some of these facilities would require a psychiatric orientation; others would simply call for more intensive care.</P>
      <P>My Department are at present studying these issues, in consultation with the other Departments and interests involved.  The matter will also be considered by the Task Force on Child Care Services.</P>

The situation is that the Minister for Health has taken over the main responsibility, including that of co-ordination, but the responsibility for the administration of existing services still rests with the Department concerned.

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. Bruton Mr. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>The position is that there is now a different set of eligible children travelling to this school than was travelling originally and the bus is following a different route.  In accordance with the measurements which have been carried out&mdash;and of which I have no reason to doubt the veracity&mdash;this child is nearer to Milltown national school than to the Presentation national school in Kildare. I would not be empowered to change the route at present operating for those who are eligible in order to facilitate a child who is not basically eligible on the basis of those mileages. The problem is that the route was changed and I am not in a position to go back on that now because the child in question, on the basis of the mileages I have available to me, is not eligible.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Mr. Molloy Mr. Molloy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>Could the Parliamentary Secretary clarify for me <Col N="618" /> whether the limitations of the two miles and three miles laid down in the regulations governing school transport apply to the route decided on by CIE, or apply to the normal roadway leading from the child's house to the school?  The Parliamentary Secretary seems to imply that, because the route was changed, a different distance now obtains.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. Bruton Mr. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>No, that is not what I am saying.  Originally, in 1968, this bus going to the Presentation school in Kildare passed very close to the residence of the children in question. It is now following a different route because the distribution of eligible children is different.  What Deputy Power asks me to do is to have the bus travel the old route, perhaps solely in order to facilitate the children he has in mind whom, as I have said&mdash;on the basis of mileage&mdash; are not basically eligible.  If the bus was passing by their door, as it was at that time, there would not be the same problem.  But I cannot make an extension solely for the benefit of children who are not eligible.</P>

      <P>I am a little puzzled because this is the first time that a route has been mentioned.  I would refer the Parliamentary Secretary to his letter of the 8th November which made no mention whatsoever of the route being changed.  The principal reasons given were ones of mileage, and the nearness of one school to the pupil's residence rather than the other.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DavidAndrews" hpid="Mr. Andrews Mr. Andrews">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Andrews</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Education the number of recommendations of the Kennedy Report already implemented and remaining to be implemented; and if he will give details in each instance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. Bruton Mr. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>There were 13 major recommendations in the Kennedy Report.  The progress made in implementing them has been as follows:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Recommendation No. 1 stated that the whole aim of the child-care system should be geared towards the prevention of family breakdown and the problems consequent on it; the admission of children to residential <Col N="620" /> care to be considered only when there was no satisfactory alternative.</P>
    <P>The Department of Health have greatly extended their community care programme through the recruitment of additional social workers and home helps.  These measures are designed to prevent the breakdown of families and, where breakdown does occur, to ensure that the most suitable remedies will be applied in each individual case.  The welfare service of the Department of Justice is also being rapidly expanded.  As a result of these and other measures the number of children in care in residential homes and special schools under the control of my Department has fallen to 1,498 as compared with 2,775 when the Kennedy Committee commenced work in 1967&mdash;a decline of 46 per cent.</P>
    <P>Recommendation No. 2 urged that the institutional system of residential care should be abolished and be replaced by group homes.</P>
    <P>Sixteen out of the 25 residential homes in receipt of financial aid from the Department of Education have now adopted the group structure. They have done this in three ways with the aid of grants from my Department: (i) by erecting new purpose built group homes; (ii) by purchasing private houses for adaptation of group homes; (iii) by converting existing buildings to the group home system.  The recommendation also stated that &ldquo;children from one family and children of different ages and sex should be placed in such group homes&rdquo;.  This recommendation is also being borne in mind in connection with the developments being undertaken.</P>
    <P>Recommendation No. 3 drew attention to the inadequacy of the reformatory system.  It said that St. Conleth's Reformatory, Daingean, should be closed and replaced by a more suitable building with trained child care staff.</P>
    <P>St. Conleth's closed in October, 1973, and has been replaced by Scoil Ard Mhuire, Lusk, an entirely new special school with modern facilities. The industrial school at Letterfrack, treated in the Kennedy Report as a <Col N="621" /> junior reformatory, has also been closed.  A new special school for juvenile offenders has been opened at Finglas.  Planning for a similar special school at St. Joseph's Clonmel, is at an advanced stage.  The question of providing a new special school for girls is under examination.</P>
    <P>Recommendation No. 4 related to the replacement of the Remand Home and Place of Detention at Marlborough House, Glasnevin.</P>
    <P>Marlborough House has been closed and replaced by a new children's centre at Finglas, which provides remand and assessment facilities on modern lines.  Medical, social, educational, psychological and psychiatric services are available for the assessment process.</P>
    <P>Recommendation No. 5 was to the effect that the staff engaged in child care work should be fully trained. The Kennedy Committee said that this should take precedence over any other recommendations.</P>
    <P>In response to this recommendation a full-time residential course in child care has been in operation at the School of Social Education, Kilkenny, since 1971, financed by my Department. Forty-one students have qualified to date and a further 20 are following the current course.  My Department have also promoted the organisation of in-service training courses at St. Patrick's Training College, Drumcondra; St. Vincent's, Goldenbridge; the Waterford Regional College of Technology, and Saint Mary's College, Cathal Brugha Street.  Approximately 75 per cent of the staff in residential homes and special schools have now training in child-care.</P>
    <P>Recommendation No. 6 dealt with the question of educating children in care &ldquo;to the ultimate of their capacities&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>The children in residential homes attend recognised primary and secondary schools and remedial or special education is provided as appropriate.  The grants system has been revised so that children in care can be paid for by the State while <Col N="622" /> they complete their education, up to third level as appropriate.  As regards the special schools there is an intensive programme which aims at the rehabilitation of the children through education, using that term in its widest sense.</P>
    <P>Recommendation No. 7 stated that after-care should form an integral part of the child care system.</P>
    <P>In the case of the residential homes after-care is primarily the function of the manager of the home.  The decrease in the number of children in care has meant that it is easier for the homes themselves to keep contact with the children after they leave.  There is also co-operation in regard to after care with the regional health boards and this will increase as the social work services are extended. Half-way hostels for older children in the homes who have commenced employment have been provided in Dublin and Cork.</P>
    <P>In the case of the special schools arrangements have been made for the provision of after-care in the form of supportive supervision through the welfare service of the Department of Justice.  Three &ldquo;half-way houses&rdquo; run by voluntary groups and affiliated to the welfare service have been provided for boys in the 14-17 age group and there are proposals for three further such houses.</P>
    <P>Recommendation No. 8 urged that administrative responsibility for all aspects of child care be transferred to the Department of Health, responsibility for the education of children in care to remain with the Department of Education.</P>
    <P>The Government have now allocated main responsibility, including that of co-ordination, in relation to child care to the Minister for Health.</P>
    <P>Recommendation No. 9 dealt with the up-dating of all laws related to child care into a composite Children Act.</P>
    <P>The Government have authorised the Minister for Health to set up a working party to report on the necessary updating and reform of child care legislation and of the child care services.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="623" /> Recommendation No. 10 involved the raising of the age of criminal responsibility to 12 years.</P>
    <P>This will be dealt with by the working party on legislation.</P>
    <P>Recommendation No. 11 was to the effect that the special schools and residential homes should be paid on a budget system rather than by capitation grant.</P>
    <P>In making this recommendation the committee of enquiry were concerned to ensure that the schools and homes had adequate financial support.  The new special schools at Finglas and Lusk are in fact being paid in this way and a similar arrangement will be introduced in other special schools according as modernisation plans are completed.</P>
    <P>The question of introducing a budgetary system for the residential homes is being examined.  In the meantime the capitation grant has been considerably increased and now stands at £12.50 per week.  In addition extra grants have been made to a large number of homes for works involving the maintenance and renovation of the buildings.</P>
    <P>Recommendation No. 12 was that an independent advisory body should be established at the earliest opportunity to ensure that the highest standards of child care be attained and maintained.  The Government have authorised the Minister for Health to set up an advisory committee on this basis in due course.</P>
    <P>Recommendation No. 13 called attention to the need for continuous research in the field of child care.</P>
    <P>It is visualised in the report that one of the functions of the advisory body referred to in recommendation No. 12 will be to arrange that facilities will be available to suitable persons for research work in child care.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>With the permission of the Ceann Comhairle, I propose to take Questions Nos. 12, 13 and 14 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="626" /> I am very conscious of the important role that youth organisations have to play in our society and it was in recognition of this that I increased the allocations made to voluntary youth organisations this year by more than 43 per cent&mdash;£57,050 paid in 1973 as against £81,300 paid in 1974. In allocating £112,500 to Comhairle le Leas Óige for the current nine-month period, which represents £150,000 for a 12-month period, I make an increase of more than 15 per cent.  The allocation to Macra na Tuaithe was also substantially increased&mdash;£27,800 this nine-month year as against £22,000 in the previous 12-month year.</P>
    <P>The study of the entire youth service which I undertook is nearly completed. The question of the personnel required to meet the special needs of young people will be fully dealt with in that document and I agree entirely with the Deputy in stressing the need for flexibility.  However, it would be inappropriate to comment on any specific part of the policy until it is available for discussion.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NoelTLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>No doubt the Parliamentary Secretary is aware that the activities of voluntary organisations in this field are expanding all the time. In view of this and also because of the very high rate of inflation, these organisations are experiencing great financial difficulties.  Therefore, will the Parliamentary Secretary endeavour to ensure that the amounts of money being made available will be increased next year and also that the system of allocation of funds will be re-examined?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. Bruton Mr. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Education if young children up to the age of 12 years are prohibited from participating in sporting activities sponsored by Comhairle le Leas Óige; and, if so, if he will initiate legislation to remove this impediment to their participation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. Bruton Mr. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>Under their present constitution, Comhairle le Leas Óige caters for young people of 12 years of age and upwards.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As regards the under 12 age group, apart from school based activities <Col N="628" /> outside normal school hours, bodies such as scouts and girl guides, the Catholic Youth Council and various sporting bodies have special sections for those aged seven and older.</P>
    <P>Certain other voluntary organisations also cater for this younger age group.</P>
    <P>At present new policies in relation to youth and sport are being formulated. The necessity for new or amending legislation will be considered in relation to those policies.</P>
    <P>Comhairle le Leas Óige, being a sub-committee of the Dublin Vocational Education Committee, are subject to the provision of the Vocational Education Committee, are subComhairle's role will be considered in the context of general policy.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NoelTLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>The Parliamentary Secretary must be aware of the difficulty experienced by voluntary organisations who cater for children of 12 years and upwards when they are approached by children of, say, 11 years who must be sent home. This is a somewhat recent development and one that may not have been envisaged at the time of the coming into being of the Act.  Is there any way in which the Parliamentary Secretary could ensure that children younger than 12 years would be catered for simultaneously in the same areas in which those of 12 years and upwards are playing?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. Bruton Mr. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>Where it is proposed to lay on an activity designed specifically for children younger than 12 years, there can be a problem in that they would not appear to come within the ambit of the Act.  However, if those children who are younger than 12 can be provided for within the ambit of the service being provided for those in the older age group and who come within the Vocational Education Act, I do not think any difficulty arises.  However, if the Deputy can furnish me with any information on that matter, I shall be glad to have it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoelTLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I suggest that the Parliamentary Secretary check with the Ballyfermot Sports Federation <Col N="629" /> who have this difficulty of not being able to cater for the children in the younger age group although they have the facilities required.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. Bruton Mr. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>If the Ballyfermot Sports Federation are envisaging activities in respect of which they would be seeking aid and which are designed specifically for children younger than 12, this difficulty may well arise but I am having the overall question examined and am seeking legal advice to ascertain what is the position of Comhairle le Leas Óige in this matter.</P>

      <P>I take it that the question refers to the pay and conditions of chief superintendents and superintendents about which there has been some recent publicity.  Both of these ranks are within the scope of the Garda Conciliation and Arbitration Scheme, which provides for the determination of claims by an independent arbitrator in cases where agreement cannot be reached at conciliation. Certain representations by the two ranks concerned about the method of determining their pay and conditions are under consideration by the Government. Beyond mentioning that fact however I do not consider that either the interests of the ranks themselves or the public interest would be served by any public statement on my part, since I believe that complex matters of this kind are best dealt with in private negotiations.</P>

    <P>I am aware that there was and still is public unease at the escape of 19 prisoners from Portlaoise Prison.  I <Col N="638" /> would hope that it also extends to the regrettable fact that some of our people seem to be prepared to assist the escapees to remain at large.</P>

In regard to the escape from Portlaoise, of the 19 prisoners who escaped how many have been returned to custody?  Were not among the 19 those convicted of the brutal murder of Senator Billy Fox?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Andrews</NameTxt>
      <P>Again I must express dissatisfaction with the derisory information the Minister is giving the House.  This is a pretty important question in the context of the Government's lack of will and lack of initiative in the area of security.  Why will the Minister not now appoint a director of security, to direct security operations as they arise?  For instance, in the context of the Portlaoise break-out, why was there not an immediate situation brought about then?</P>

The performance of the Government and the anxiety of the Government in this area is well known and their task would be less difficult if their heritage was not as it is.  I want to make the point that the question asked was whether it was our intention to appoint a director of security. What I said is that a special post of Assistant Commissioner in the Garda Síochána with whole time responsibility for security has been made. It would be inapt in this area of security to start detailing here his role.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Andrews</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister is well aware of my concern that security arrangements should not become public but my point here is that this director of security would liaise or would be in charge of the Army and the Garda and the other security <Col N="640" /> forces within the State in the event of a particular situation occurring and that this man would have the overall control of security operations.

    <P>The committee are aware of my desire to receive their final report on the introduction of a system of legal aid and advice in civil matters as soon as possible.  Indeed, the desirability of an early report is implicit in their terms of reference.  However, as the subject is complex and as most of the members of the committee are giving their services voluntarily I consider that it would be inappropriate for me to inquire from the committee as to the number of meetings they have had or when they hope to report finally to me, or to do anything else that might appear to be putting pressure on them.

      <NameTxt>Minister for Transport and Power (Mr. P. Barry)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>The main purpose of the Bill is to provide statutory authority for subvention payments to CIE amounting to £11.3 million in the nine-month period ending on 31st December, 1974, which are additional to the annual grant of £2.65 million payable to the board under the Transport Act, 1964 (Section 6) Order, 1969.  This is in accordance with the views expressed by the Public Accounts Committee earlier this year, in the course of its consideration of the appropriation accounts for 1971-72, that supporting legislation is desirable when moneys to supplement CIE's statutory annual grant are being provided by the Oireachtas.  The Bill also makes certain necessary amendments to existing transport legislation arising from the provisions of EEC regulations governing State aid to transport undertakings.</P>
      <P>At the outset, I propose to review briefly the position of CIE in recent years.  The progressive deterioration in the board's financial position continues to be a cause for concern. Since it was fixed in 1969, the board's statutory annual grant of £2.65 million has proved to be completely inadequate due largely to the effects of inflation.  The board's losses increased from over £3 million in 1969-70 to £11.67 million in 1973-74; the estimated net loss for the nine-month period ending 31st December, 1974, is almost £14 million.  The main portion of these losses is attributable to the railway system, but the position has been aggravated by a decline into a loss-making situation of hitherto profitable road services.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As announced in March, 1974, the Government has decided that the railway system should continue to be preserved subject to further concentration and re-organisation in accordance <Col N="665" /> with the general concepts outlined in the McKinsey Report on CIE, as developed in further studies made by the board, and has approved, in principle, additional capital investment to enable CIE to implement their proposals.  The Government accepted that there was an acute need for modernisation and rationalisation of the railway system, particularly in the freight sector, in order to contain railway losses and to avoid a continual erosion of traffic.  CIE's plan for the future development of the railways, involving modernisation of stations and depots, introduction of new equipment and handling methods and redeployment of manpower, was announced by the board last July.  The plan will take six years to implement and will cost in the region of £27 million.</P>
    <P>No fundamental alteration of the passenger network is proposed for the present, other than normal timetable adjustments.  The plans for freight movement involve the introduction of new types of trains on which economic loading and high utilisation will be achieved.  Twenty-two railheads throughout the country are scheduled for reconstruction and development and will provide a comprehensive freight service for containers, small freight and bulk traffics.  A further 27 railheads are scheduled for major alteration and development to cater for specialised freight traffics.  Freight facilities are being withdrawn on a selective basis from a number of lightly used stations, some of which have handled negligible volumes of traffic in recent years.  CIE are fully conscious of the need for adequate communication with all parties concerned in relation to proposed changes and an extensive programme of consultation with staff, trade unions and customers has taken place and it is the board's intention to keep interested parties advised of progress.</P>
    <P>In the year 1973-74 over 12.7 million passengers were carried on CIE rail services reflecting continued buoyancy in rail passenger carryings due, no doubt, to the board's new promotional fares, the increased number of passenger trains daily and the <Col N="666" /> attraction of CIE's new supertrain services.  Over the past three years the number of rail passengers has increased by 23 per cent.</P>
    <P>Rail freight tonnage at 3.7 million tons in 1973-74 was over 1 per cent higher than 1972-73.  Significant increases occurred in general traffics, mineral ores and gypsum but reductions occurred in fertilisers, sugar, grain and cement traffics.  There was also an increase in CIE's road passenger carryings.  Dublin city buses carried 220 million passengers in 1973-74, an increase of ten million over the previous year.  Sixty-three million passengers were carried in 1973-74 on the board's provincial bus services, excluding special school services, an increase of one million over the previous year.  In the road freight section, the total tonnage carried in 1973-74 was six million tons, representing an increase of 6 per cent.</P>
    <P>Nothwithstanding the fact that most of the services showed continued buoyancy, this has not, unfortunately, been sufficient to counteract the prevailing economic forces, and the board's deficits still continue to grow.  The energy crisis which occurred in late 1973, while it created additional demand for passenger services and highlighted the importance of public transport in a situation of world energy shortage, nevertheless, added considerably to the CIE's fuel bills and adversely affected costs. Of greater significance, however, are the continuing increases in labour costs, which together with higher materials costs and increased social insurance and interest charges, contribute substantially to the board's deteriorating financial position.</P>
    <P>The latest estimate of CIE's net deficit for the current nine-month financial period ending 31st December, 1974 is £13.95 million.  Of this amount, £9.25 million has already been met by way of subvention payments to CIE, the necessary provision having been made in the Estimate for my Department. The main reason for the excess of £4.7 million in the board's deficit over the Estimate provision was the decision of the Government to ameliorate the impact of the July, 1974 increases in CIE rates and fares by <Col N="667" /> limiting the increases in Dublin city bus and suburban rail fares and provincial city and town bus fares to 20 per cent instead, of the 33 per cent increases proposed by CIE and approved by the National Prices Commission. This, combined with a delay of three months in the implementation of the increases, resulted in a reduction of an estimated £3.3 million in the anticipated yield from the increased charges.  Other significant factors were the nine-week bus strike in Dublin city and a general decline in economic activity, resulting in heavy revenue losses to CIE.</P>
    <P>The statutory annual grant to CIE of £2.65 million is, therefore, inadequate to the extent of £11.3 million and statutory cover for payment of this amount to CIE is provided in section 2 of the Bill.  It is proposed to provide in a Supplementary Estimate which will be introduced before the Christmas Recess for the amount of £4.7 million, not already covered in the Estimates provision.  Pending provision of these additional moneys, CIE with my consent, given with the approval of the Minister for Finance, have been availing of temporary borrowings to meet their serious cash deficiency.</P>
    <P>Under EEC regulations governing State aid to transport undertakings the existing blanket subvention arrangements for CIE are no longer appropriate and provision is therefore being made in section 5 of the Bill for the repeal of section 6 of the Transport Act, 1964, which provided for a fixed annual grant for CIE, subject to review at five-yearly intervals. Consequential on the repeal of this section an amendment is required in section 2 of the 1964 Act and this is provided for in section 3 of the Bill. Henceforth grants to CIE will be paid in accordance with the relevant EEC regulations and provision for these payments will be made in the Estimates for my Department.</P>
    <P>There are three relevant EEC regulations:&mdash;</P>
    <P>(1)  Regulation 1191/69, which provides for payment of compensation to transport undertakings in <Col N="668" /> respect of losses incurred on services operated under public service obligations which are deemed essential to ensure the provision of adequate transport services.</P>
    <P>(2)  Regulation 1192/69, which provides for compensation in respect of specified financial burdens borne by railway undertakings which are not borne to the same extent by other transport undertakings, for example, cost of level crossings, retirement and welfare benefits and so on.</P>
    <P>(3)  Regulation 1107/70, which specifies certain additional circumstances in which State aids may be paid to transport undertakings.  This regulation enables the grant of State aid to cover, <i>inter alia,</i></P>
    <P>(a)  public service obligations not coming within the meaning of Regulations 1191/69;</P>
    <P>(b)  railway infrastructure costs, to the extent that competing modes of transport do not bear their full share of infrastructure costs;</P>
    <P>(c)  balancing subventions to meet the residual deficits of railway undertakings.</P>
    <P>These EEC regulations are merely part of a comprehensive structure which is being built up in the development of a Community Common Transport Policy.  One of the aims of this policy is to eliminate disparities liable to distort conditions of competition in the transport market and for this purpose it is necessary to harmonise laws, regulations and administrative provisions relating to transport.</P>
    <P>Proposals for a new subvention structure for CIE to comply with the provisions of these EEC regulations have been submitted to the EEC Commission and arrangements are being made for the introduction of the new subvention structure from 1st January, 1975.</P>
    <P>The main features of the proposed new subvention structure are as follows:</P>
    <P>(1)  It is proposed that compensation will be paid in respect of the <Col N="669" /> losses remaining on rail passenger services after fares increases and any possible economies in operation, on the grounds that these services are being provided under a public service obligation within the meaning of regulation 1191/69.  The obligation will be subject to whatever conditions I may decide to impose with a view to reducing losses.</P>
    <P>(2)  Losses on rail freight services, in so far as they cannot be met by rates increases, economies, <i>et cetera,</i> will be covered by a combination of payments under the provisions of Regulation 1192/69 and Regulation 1107/70 including a balancing subvention as provided for in the latter regulation.  Every effort must however be made by CIE to operate these services on a commercial basis.</P>
    <P>(3)  Losses incurred on the board's road passenger services, including the Dublin city services, which cannot be recouped by way of fares increases or eliminated by economies in operation, will be met under the provisions of Regulation 1107/ 70.</P>
    <P>(4)  It is proposed that losses incurred on the maintenance of the canals will be met under the provisions of Regulation 1107/70. Separate provision will be made in my Department's Vote for losses on the Galway/Aran service operated by CIE.  As regards CIE's other services, I would expect the board to operate at a profit or at least break even, taking one year with another.</P>
    <P>The new arrangements for subventing CIE will be subject to review at regular intervals and will of course come under scrutiny each year in connection with the Estimate for my Department.</P>
    <P>I commend the Bill to the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SylvesterBarrett" hpid="Mr. Barrett Mr. Barrett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Barrett</NameTxt>
      <P>We appreciate the necessity for this Bill and the importance of having it passed expeditiously. We have not yet had an opportunity of discussing the Estimate for the Minister's Department, <Col N="670" /> but we look forward to having that opportunity in the very near future. The Estimate will of course provide us with the opportunity of having a wider discussion not only about CIE but about all the other matters involved in the Minister's jurisdiction. However this Bill gives us an opportunity for a short discussion on CIE.</P>
      <P>CIE is very much in the public mind and has been for the past year. During the past year the overall efficiency and the public image of CIE have sunk to a level lower than any level since its formation.  There seems to be a falling-off in dynamism, drive and innovation at management level. That has been commented upon by others.  Drive and dynamism and innovation were features of the organisation which now seem to have disappeared. I do not know the reason for this, but that is certainly the position.</P>
      <P>We have had two bus strikes which inflicted very widespread hardship on people already affected by the adverse economic situation.  Little progress has been made in the establishment of sound industrial relations between management and workers.  The labour force feels uncertain about its future because of lack of direction.</P>
      <P>There are certain questions one must ask.  What has happened to the plans drawn up on the future of the railways?  What has happened about the Dublin commuter rail system? CIE were given to understand that moneys would be available for the system.  We have had announcements as to intentions and so on but there is no clear evidence of anything happening. We would like to see something happening in the proposed reorganisation, something to the advantage of the country as a whole and to the advantage of the taxpayer.  If operations could be made economic and this recurring subvention could be reduced that would certainly be an advantage.  The subvention this year is higher than it ever was in any other year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Undoubtedly within CIE there is a fear of redundancies.  How extensive the redundancies will be is another question but the fear is there and uncertainty <Col N="671" /> is created at all levels.  Perhaps transitional plans have been discussed with the staff but they have not been finalised.  These are priorities which should be dealt with and should be seen to be dealt with, with the minimum delay.  Announcements have been made but CIE and the public want to see that something is happening. As the Minister knows, when his party were in Opposition they were calling for a complete inquiry into the affairs of CIE.  I trust the Minister is devoting considerable time to inquiring into the whole concept of CIE.  I appreciate that he had others matters to attend to during the year due to the oil crisis, and so forth.  CIE have been allowed to drift into heavier and heavier losses.  While the service must receive a subvention from public funds, overall direction and policy have been sadly lacking.  The public are paying for this service and they deserve information on policy.</P>
    <P>Has consideration been given to separating the various sections within CIE into distinct entities?  This has been done in other countries.  It was done in Britain under a transport board.  This concept of dividing the different sections into different entities each with a definite and defined role to play within CIE or under a transport authority should be studied.  The policy on fares can no longer be applied straight across the board without reference to the individual characteristics of the separate services being provided.  Should the Dublin bus services be subsidised by the provincial operations&mdash;or <i>vice versa</i>, but I think the former is the case&mdash;when the economic and social aspects of the rural services are taken into consideration? Should a fares policy be formulated for country buses?  Is it right that Dublin commuters should be subsidised in some way by the school bus services?  If we are serious in saying that we want to maintain our rail system we must ensure that it can operate in its own right.  These are matters on which we should like to have some clarification.</P>
    <P>I have heard a rumour and I should like to know if there is any foundation <Col N="672" /> for it.  It is that there is a possibility of the timetable being curtailed in the new year.  If there is any foundation for that rumour I should like to know to what extent it is likely to happen, its financial effects and its effect on the public service.</P>
    <P>Another big financial problem for CIE is the transportation of what are known as &ldquo;sundries&rdquo; on the railways. Would CIE look into the question of having these sundries transported by road freight since they involve such tremendous losses for the railways?  A great deal of the company's resources are committed to this activity which gives such a bad return.  We would like to know when it is envisaged that the plans which were published will be put into effect.  I do not want in any way to decry the present chairman of the board but I understand he is working on a part-time basis.  Would it have been more beneficial for the company and would we have got better results if we had a full-time chairman as we had in the past?  I am not saying anything personal against the gentleman concerned.</P>
    <P>Are CIE in touch with the EEC and with their thinking with regard to urban and rural transport?  It is important that there should be proper liaison between them.  The EEC are very conscious of the problems of urban transport.  There was a rapid increase in the number of cars on the roads between 1963 and 1970.  Within the EEC the number of cars doubled in that period.  Goods traffic has also increased by 42 per cent.  The EEC are looking into these problems in great detail.  I hope CIE are involved and know what is going on and are playing their part in trying to identify and eliminate the inequalities which exist in the different national transport systems within the Community.</P>
    <P>Problems which cause grave congestion in cities and on access roads are being studied by the Commission.  The results will be very important to us.  We should avail of any knowledge or suggestions which can be made available to us.  They have certain guidelines and regulations with which we should be fully acquainted.  They are looking into two important aspects: the protection <Col N="673" /> of transporters and, even more important, the protection of the labour force.  They are making comparisons between different nations regarding investments and infrastructures.  I hope that CIE and the Department of Transport and Power will keep in touch with the Commission.</P>
    <P>There is an urgent need for this Bill. When the Minister's Estimate comes before the House&mdash;and I hope it will not be very long before it is introduced &mdash;we will have more time to discuss CIE and other semi-State bodies.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FergusOBrien" hpid="Mr. O'Brien Mr. O'Brien">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Brien</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the opportunity to speak on this Bill, particularly when we realise the amount of money involved.  We rarely get an opportunity to speak on semi-State bodies here.  As I mentioned before, the time has come when a Committee of this House should be set up to examine the functions and operations of our semi-State bodies.  It is not good enough that they should be able to come here and ask for vast sums of money for which they are not accountable.  One is not even allowed to put down questions.</P>
      <P>It is time there was an inquiry into the operations of CIE.  I do not mean that this should be in any sense a witch hunt.  This inquiry could ensure that the company are operating in the most efficient manner and that we are getting value for the money we are giving them for their operations.  It is very easy for them to say that they are losing X number of pounds and to ask the House to vote them a certain sum of money.  A proper scrutiny should be made of their operations.  The Minister should have a look at this aspect of CIE.</P>
      <P>During the year we had two bus strikes in Dublin.  During those strikes I got the impression that CIE sat back and said it was not their affair but an inter-union dispute.  It is their affair to ensure that bus and train services are operating.  At the time I was very concerned they took this indifferent attitude, a Pontius Pilate attitude of washing their hands and blaming the unions for their problems.  When there were problems with the ESB, we had the Fogarty Report into staff relations.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="674" /> We should ensure that the staff in CIE are making the maximum effort and that there is a happy and effective staff relations position there.</P>
    <P>I am always surprised at the lack of initiative by CIE.  There is a chaotic traffic problem in Dublin city.  We never hear of ideas to co-ordinate with the local authorities on what should be done to ensure that we have an efficient bus service.  We hear that the cost of fuel is very high.  The cost and the waste involved as a result of chaotic traffic conditions represent a big problem.  It is incumbent on CIE to put forward a realistic traffic plan for all cities, particularly Dublin.  The position will not get better; it will get worse.</P>
    <P>As the principal operators of the commuter service CIE have the obligation to push the Government and the local authorities into taking action in order to ensure that as far as possible we have free roads.  This can be done quite easily by developing busways which will move passengers quickly in and out of towns.</P>
    <P>Are we developing our rail commuter traffic in Dublin?  In my view, we are not.  As a capital city we lag very far behind in a rail commuter system.  Harcourt Street station was closed.  We never hear a word about it now&mdash;not even a word of regret. We all know that the people of the city are crying out for a link in that very densely populated area from Harcourt Street to Bray.  There is still a vast amount of derelict land in that area.  It is still not too late to develop this railway link.  There are other links which could be operated, such as Ballyfermot, which has a vast housing scheme waiting to be tapped.  This would take a great deal of traffic from our roads.  CIE have fallen down on this.  This is because they can come here looking for money and get it. They say they are responsible only for the running of buses and trains and have an obligation to provide an efficient service.  They should plan with the local authorities and central government to ensure a service of this kind.</P>
    <P>Now that we are in Europe the international traffic is increasing.  We <Col N="675" /> must rely to a large extent on foreign companies to transport our goods.  Are CIE doing enough to get into this market?  Are they doing market research? Are they making sure that they will get a large share of the market?  CIE should ensure we will have an effective transport system to deliver our manufactured goods to European countries.  If enough is not being done in this regard the Minister should initiate plans so that CIE can get involved.  I do not know how it would affect them as a semi-State body but if there are no impediments CIE should be carrying on a haulage service to European countries.  They have the expertise and the capital resources to enable them to move into this field.  As far as I know this is a lucrative and profitable market.</P>
    <P>In my view CIE are a little arbitrary when it comes to closing stations. In most cases the stations are closed without any effort being made to keep them open.  In my constituency Westland Row was closed as the central point of departure for the west of Ireland.  People travelling to the west must now cross the centre of the city, which is congested at most times, to Kingsbridge.  We all know how difficult it is to get through the city particularly if one has to catch a train departing at 5.30 in the evening.  A person has not a hope of getting through the city traffic within 20 minutes.  The decision to cease to use Westland Row as the departure point for travellers to the west had the effect of closing a number of businesses in that depressed area.  CIE closed that station without any in-depth investigation. In my view this highlights CIE's inability to expand in a proper way.  The attitude of the company seems to be to close rather than to expand.</P>
    <P>In asking the Minister to hold an inquiry into the operation of CIE I should state that we do not have to apologise to CIE when asking for such an inquiry.  We are voting a considerable sum of money to CIE and, therefore, we should ensure that Deputies are aware of the way the company is run.  I look forward to the Minister's Estimate, which will give <Col N="676" /> me a further opportunity of speaking about CIE.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. G. Fitzgerald Mr. G. Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad of the opportunity of commenting on the operations of CIE.  One is rarely given this opportunity and, since I became a Member of this House there has not been an Estimate for the Department of Transport and Power. We all appreciate the necessity for the introduction of this Bill to make money available to CIE.  In speaking on this Bill one has to give consideration to some of the points made by the Minister, or to some of the points not made by him.  One has to sympathise with any Minister for Transport and Power who has to wear two hats when dealing with a national transport company.  There is a necessity to make it self supporting and there is also the social need which has to be catered for.</P>
      <P>The Minister made an encouraging start when he informed the House that he intended reviewing briefly the position of CIE but I was disappointed that the Minister did not review it as deeply as I would like him to have done.  Because he has not done so the Minister has left many questions unanswered and these questions are worrying the staff of CIE and people in many areas.  I hope the Minister did not deliberately avoid these areas, which may be regarded as being slightly controversial.  The Minister stated that in order to contain railway losses and to avoid continual erosion of traffic the Government accepted that there was an acute need for modernisation and rationalisation of the railway system, particularly in the freight sector.  I should like the Minister to elaborate on that statement because it worries me.  The Minister should tell us the reason for this erosion of traffic.  Has this been investigated by the company and can progressive action be taken in order to have the trend in the other direction?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>An important question that arises in this regard is that relating to redundancies. I hope the Minister will refer to this.  There is a fear and concern among staff in that sector regarding redundancies they may be <Col N="677" /> facing.  I am not anxious to see any further redundancies in our transport system and I am sure the Minister will endeavour to make certain that they do not occur.  I am all for rationalisation and modernisation but I warn that these beautiful words which are applied broadly today can create many social hardships.  A year or two hence the rationalisation or modernisation may become far more inefficient than what it originally replaced. This is a danger, particularly in the transport business, and the haulage and movement of goods and materials.</P>
    <P>The Minister informed us that no fundamental alteration of the passenger network is proposed for the present.  I would have preferred if the Minister had not included, &ldquo;for the present&rdquo;.  The number of passengers carried by rail in 1973-74 was 12.7 million, an increase of 23 per cent over three years.  What is the annual increase there?  How does it compare with last year's figures?  There has been a vast improvement in CIE's rail passenger service.  The Cork-Dublin service is one we can all be pleased with.  It is regular, efficient and easy to travel by.  The staff are courteous and one travels in comfortable surroundings.</P>
    <P>The Minister also informed us that rail freight tonnage at 3.7 million tons in 1973-74 was over 1 per cent higher than 1972-73.  I would not be happy with an increase of that order.  Surely a 1 per cent increase represents a setback and is not reasonable.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PeterBarry" hpid="Mr. P. Barry Mr. P. Barry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>That is the whole point.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. G. Fitzgerald Mr. G. Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I accept that and I am glad the Minister highlighted it but has the Minister any reason to offer for this?  Was it the lack of sales effort?  Was the present system the reason for it?  Even with the present system I could not accept the small increase.  I suspect the Minister is talking about the period up to 31st March, 1974, which, in my opinion, makes it even more serious.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I notice also that no reference was made by the Minister by way of figures to the school bus services although such was done in respect <Col N="678" /> of the Dublin city bus service, and it was done also in respect of the provincial services which specifically included school bus services.  Something is happening at present with regard to school bus services being operated by CIE.  There was mention of this in the House today by way of parliamentary question in regard to a different county from mine. I am aware of many cases where children are not now being carried in a school bus.  I can think of one specific case where six members of a family have been and are still getting transport to a particular school.  The youngest member of that family commenced school this September.  Somebody makes a decision, whether it is CIE, or the Department of Education I do not know, but CIE operate the scheme and that young child, the seventh in that family attending the same school, is not given a free ticket or carried in the bus because apparently that child is nearer to some other school although still over two miles distant.  This is very common.  I am disappointed that the Minister, when he spoke about the school services, did not say whether the numbers being carried are down or whatever might be the reason for these occurrences.</P>
    <P>The Minister referred to the topsyturvy, backwards-forwards situation of the Government.  We are told that the delay of three months in implementing an increase in bus fares meant that an additional £3.3 million are required to be passed by this House.  In other words, the Government played hide and seek with the general public for three months.  The Minister for Industry and Commerce would not sanction a price increase.  He was making himself so popular with the ordinary people that it would have been wrong to have sanctioned an increase in fares for CIE. But now the House is being asked to pass another £3.3 million of the people's money to compensate for that inactivity on the part of the Minister for Industry and Commerce.  That does not make sense to me.</P>
    <P>Reference was made by the Minister also to the loss of revenue resulting from the Dublin city bus strike.  I would merely comment here that never <Col N="679" /> was a situation so bady handled.  Possibly the Minister for Transport and Power is not the Minister to be blamed in this regard.  But I heard a previous speaker in this debate say that CIE said that from beginning to end it was an inter-union dispute.  The man I heard say this time and again in this House was the Minister for Labour. He repeated it many times here.  Despite pressure being brought to bear on him from this side of the House, the Minister for Labour failed absolutely to get both sides together over a nine-week period.  That, surely, was a ridiculous situation in a public transport service.  He should have been working day and night until a solution was found.</P>
    <P>The Minister mentioned Community Regulation 1192/69 regarding compensation being provided for, among other things, retirement and welfare benefits.  The present CIE pension scheme is deplorable.  It is a legacy inherited by the Minister.  Nevertheless that does not alter the situation that annually a huge profit is being made on this pension fund.  A very significant fund is being created which is being contributed to by the ordinary workers employed by CIE.  Men who have worked in CIE, who have driven buses, who have been conductors, who have worked as labourers, lorry drivers and so on receive a mere pittance by way of pension, a pittance to which young men contribute from the day they enter the company's employment.  It is an injustice to think that the pension fund of a transport company is earning huge amounts of money which will never be paid out to its employees.  I would ask the Minister to re-examine this situation and endeavour to make the pension worthwhile, make it comparable to that operated by, say, local authorities and other semi-State bodies. It is an insult to offer to any man who has worked so long in CIE the pension he is being offered at present.</P>
    <P>Road freight has been given very little coverage in the Minister's brief. I wonder why.  However, as I said earlier, possibly this is one of the fields in which there are controversies at present and in respect of which, certainly, I should like to hear certain questions <Col N="680" /> answered.  Earlier I referred to the fear of redundancies in the railway system. At present there is concern about redundancies in the road freight sector.</P>
    <P>Is there anything wrong with management in CIE?  Are they <i>au fait</i> with the situation?  What is the present utilisation of the road fleet?  Are we absolutely sure that every effort is being made to sell the usage of this fleet, or is it being allowed stand idle?  Again, I emphasise that no redundancies should be allowed in this field because they are unnecessary.  What effect has the change in the lime subsidy had on the road freight haulage sector of CIE? Has it affected the revenue?  Are lorries standing idle because of it?  Is there a danger of jobs being lost because of it?  These are questions that must be posed.</P>
    <P>For that reason, if for no other, I agree with the previous speaker when he said that a Committee of this House should have an opportunity of examining the operations of semi-State bodies.  He mentioned an inquiry.  I am not very much in favour of inquiries. My political life has been a short one but I have heard about this report in one Department, that report in another Department, another report in yet another Department and, God knows, we have enough reports on which to work.  What we need are men with a bit of dynamism, flair and enterprise to push CIE, because CIE have a lot to offer.</P>
    <P>Before I entered political life I happened to have experience of road freight.  I had &ldquo;on the spot&rdquo; experience of the heavy haulage section of CIE road freight.  Both at management and operational level it would not be possible to find a better group of people.  I pay those men this well deserved tribute because I have seen them operate.  In that section, because of its very nature, they operate under very severe handicap at times.  That section was a fine one.  They were operators who knew what they had to do and who set out to do it.  It is possible to have the same spirit in all sections of CIE with the proper dynamism at the top and the proper usage of certain services.</P>
    <P>There is one point I should like to <Col N="681" /> mention to the Minister, particularly since he is a Cork man, as warranting examination.  There should be greater utilisation of single-decker buses on some of the Cork city services where, perhaps for one reason or another, a double-decker would not be the answer.</P>
    <P>There are many other aspects of CIE which we could discuss but we will have another opportunity to discuss them when we come to debate the Estimate for the Department of Transport and Power.  We all appreciate the need to give this money to CIE but we are concerned about how this money is spent.  The Minister will find from this side of the House, unlike the time when some of the present Ministers were in opposition and shouted about inquiries into the need for money for CIE, that he will get constructive opposition.</P>
    <P>I fully appreciate the difficulties of a transport company trying to fulfil a social need and still trying to give a return for the money which they receive.  It is a responsibility to ensure that in all areas in CIE a genuine effort is made to see that the company are as near self-supporting as possible.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MylesStaunton" hpid="Mr. Staunton Mr. Staunton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Staunton</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister's speech on this Second Stage of this Bill paints a rather gloomy picture on first reading.  We note the enormous increase in losses by CIE.  Indeed, the level of increase is greater than might appear on first reading the Minister's speech.  The net loss for this year refers to a nine-month period so that if one takes a full year into account the net loss would be £19 million.  This is a staggering increase over the loss for the previous year.</P>
      <P>This Bill is very necessary and must be passed by this House.  We will have an opportunity when we deal with the Estimate for the Department of Transport and Power to discuss the activities of CIE again.  As a new Deputy I have noticed the rather haphazard selection of Estimate debates. The result is that some very important areas of activity, such as transport and power and many semi-State organisations, are not discussed as often as they might be.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="682" /> I would like to refer to a few remarks of Deputy Fitzgerald.  Most of the time he was very critical of the Government and then finally he said the Government would get more constructive opposition from his party than the Opposition of a few years ago gave the then Government.  Last July, CIE sought an increase of 33 per cent in fares.  This increase was recommended by the National Prices Commission but the Government decided to limit the increase to 20 per cent. Deputy Fitzgerald's analysis was absolutely right.  Some of the reasons for the increase sought by CIE are outside our control.  The Government are placed in a very difficult position when the National Prices Commission come along and recommend substantial price increases.  They have to make the decision whether they should accept their recommendations.  The Minister for Industry and Commerce is placed in a very difficult position with regard to some price increases recommended by the National Prices Commission.</P>
    <P>I agree with Deputy Fitzgerald in his comments about the staff of CIE. It has been my experience in my capacities as a passenger and in my business capacity outside this House that most of them are sensible, reliable and competent people.  The problem we have with a very small population is that we are attempting to run a transport company on the same lines as in a country with a vastly greater population than we have.  This creates a most serious problem for us.  I realise that the Cork-Dublin train service is superb but I wish I could say the same about the Westport to Dublin service.  We cannot expect to have supertrains in every area of a small country like this but there are many other types of trains which apparently are equally as good as the supertrains in terms of suspension and comfort.</P>
    <P>However, if we cannot have supertrains for the time being the least we might expect is that every carriage on a train travelling between Dublin and the provinces would be of a superior type.  Unfortunately, that has not been the case.  I know this from my experience <Col N="683" /> as a passenger.  At times during the past I have been appalled on seeing some of the carriages on some of these trains.  This situation is not good enough.  Normally I travel standard fare but I have noticed from time to time that the carriages in the firstclass compartments are appallingly bad.  If CIE are serious in offering first-class services, they should ensure that these are provided.  Otherwise, a great deal of damage could be done to the company's image.  This may be a relatively minor matter but it is one that is worth mentioning.  We would welcome the superior type of carriages until such time as it is possible to have supertrains.  However, I accept the point that CIE make, that is, that there is a problem, relative to population, regarding the availability of these supertrains.</P>
    <P>Regarding subsidisation there is one point I would like to put to the Minister and, again, this concerns the part of the country in which I live.  A few years ago when the situation was more gloomy than it is now regarding industrial development, there was consideration given to the different types of subsidy which might be introduced by the Government to improve the position of the west.  At that time statistics were produced to show that of every nine freight wagons coming into County Mayo, complete with goods, only about one was going back to Dublin full, in other words, only 12 or 15 per cent were going back full while the rest were going back empty. At the time the point was made that in an effort to have better regional and industrial development west of the Shannon, the situation of these empty trains returning to Dublin presented the Government with an opportunity of providing a subsidy on the freight of industrial goods on the basis that the net loss to the Government would be almost nil and the task would merely be one of loading at stations in the provinces and offloading at Dublin.  It would not involve any additional expense in so far as CIE were concerned.  Representations were made to the then Government in this regard and if memory serves me right, <Col N="684" /> Deputy Colley was involved in the matter at some stage.</P>
    <P>It was suggested that doing something like this might not be compatible with our EEC obligations. However, since then this has not been proved to be correct because I gathered from one or two people from the EEC who spoke in this country that some types of rail subsidies are in operation at present in respect of freight from the Bavarian area of Germany to the ports.  Therefore, it would seem that there is a precedent in the EEC for such subsidy.  In any case the idea is worth examination. As we have this enormous level of subsidy which is costing this country a great deal, the possibility should be examined of introducing subsidies on the lines I suggest.</P>
    <P>The last matter to which I wish to refer is one that has been referred to already by other Deputies.  I agree entirely with them when they say there is a necessity for more parliamentary control of our semi-State organisations.  When the semi-State system was introduced the founding fathers were not aware of the enormities that lay ahead.  At that time the semi-State organisations represented only a very small proportion of national activity but the picture is very different today. If we examine the budgets of recent times we realise the degree to which there is control of national bodies of immense proportion and the degree to which there is an immense power in the semi-State area of which CIE are merely one example.</P>
    <P>Having said that I hasten to add that I do not think the Government have been negligent in any sense in this area because the Minister for the Public Service, since his appointment, has made two or three speeches referring to this issue.  He has referred to the need for greater control of semi-State bodies and he has mentioned that the Government are carrying out a detailed examination which he hopes will result eventually in a system of such control.  It is control that is vitally necessary.  If we are to continue as a Parliament to rubber stamp matters relating to semi-State companies we shall erode the relevance <Col N="685" /> of the Dáil.  However, today we are not rubber-stamping anything; we are having a sensible discussion about CIE but there are many other issues which do not see the light of day in this House.  Until such time as there is introduced a committee system whereby it will be possible for Members of the Dáil to engage in dialogue with the principals involved in semi-State bodies, we will not have a healthy situation.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Geoghegan</NameTxt>
      <P>I accept that fully. This Bill is for the purpose of making available money to CIE to keep them on the rails, as it were.  On an occasion such as this a hard look should be taken at the whole area of CIE activities.  We should give serious thought to how the money is spent. There is not much information in this regard in the Minister's speech.  I suppose he has given us all the information available to him but the House is entitled to have more details.  However, as I have said on other occasions, it will be necessary always to subsidise CIE because it is not likely that they will ever be able to operate is a profitable concern.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>At the same time the Minister should ascertain if CIE are top-heavy. We know that their workers are among the best in the country but we must investigate what is the position at the top so as to ascertain if there is overloading at that level.  Also we <Col N="686" /> should make every effort possible to ascertain where the losses are being incurred.  Are they being incurred at any individual station or depot?  This is the sort of information the House is entitled to have.  Perhaps the Minister will deal with the matter more fully in his Estimate speech.  On that occasion he may be able to tell us whether the losses are being incurred in Dublin or in the provinces and to what extent the losses are occurring in any area.  For instance, if there is a loss in Dublin the Minister might tell us what percentage of the entire loss that represents.  Let the board stop playing this cat and mouse game once and for all.</P>
    <P>CIE are encouraging people to use the rail service.  They tell you that if you travel on Tuesday, Wednesday or Thursday you can come back free. Why cannot this concession apply also on the other days of the week? Possibly the Minister's officials will tell him that Friday begins the long weekend for civil servants, that they want to get home and that the trains are overcrowded, but I can say that there are plenty of trains from both the south and the west during the day with probably 50, 60 or 70 passengers and perhaps even fewer sometimes. Could not one or two coaches be left over to carry the extra people going home on Friday evening or returning on Sunday evening for work on Monday morning?  The powerful engines CIE have are certainly capable of taking more carriages; nobody can deny that.</P>
    <P>When we examine our road traffic we find many articulated trucks carrying huge loads north, south, east and west.  What are the CIE board doing to get this traffic on to the railways?  Are they doing anything? If they have given the Minister no explanation he should demand one and he should ask what areas they have explored.  These goods can be carried as cheaply, if not more cheaply, by CIE than by any other form of transport.  You can meet on the road a conveyor carrying six or eight new cars from Cork to Dublin or from Dublin to the west.  Surely if the CIE board were about their business this would not be happening.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="687" /> Surely these cars could be conveyed more cheaply by rail than by carrier trucks&mdash;although I have nothing against the carrier trucks.</P>
    <P>The CIE board are not doing their job.  I would go as far as to say: &ldquo;Scrap it completely; take over CIE, as a Minister of State and run it as it should be run.&rdquo;  That is fairly strong talk but I mean every word of it. I am sick and tired looking at what is happening and knowing where the losses are.  There are too many men in high places.  If the job were left to the ordinary worker in CIE the company would be better run.</P>
    <P>About two years ago the CIE board decided to cut out the west completely and start all trains from Heuston station.  Pearse and Connolly stations were dispensed with although these stations had been providing a good service for the west which provided a considerable number of passengers. These stations were within easy reach of O'Connell Street and Grafton Street.  Five minutes could take one from Westland Row to Kildare Street.  Now you come to Heuston station and get on a double-deck bus. If you want to go to the south side of the city you are dumped out south of O'Connell Bridge in a little side street the name of which I do not know.  If you want to go to O'Connell Street and you have baggage you must get off the bus and walk across O'Connell Bridge to reach O'Connell Street.  Why not bring the buses from Heuston station at least into O'Connell Street where people could then change to another bus if they want to get to the south side?  Dumping them south of O'Connell Bridge and leaving them to get to their destination however they like is a very bad arrangement.</P>
    <P>All these matters must be examined. Pearse station, or Westland Row station is now practically a white elephant. Surely there would be nothing wrong in restoring the west of Ireland trains to both Pearse and Connolly stations so that the people would be brought nearer where their business takes them. They could come and go by either Pearse or Connolly stations whichever suited them best.  At present if they are shopping in Dublin and want to catch <Col N="688" /> a train to the west they must think about leaving at 4 p.m. in order to reach Kingsbridge in time, with traffic conditions as they are.  I do not know where half the trains leaving Heuston at present are going or where those arriving are coming from.  The CIE board must think hard or they must be scrapped.  We should return to Connolly and Pearse stations and not dump passengers south of O'Connell Bridge.</P>
    <P>Perhaps I have strayed beyond the limits which would apply to this debate and, if so, I ask the forebearance of the Chair, but I should like the Minister to have the benefit of what I have to say before his Estimate comes to the House.</P>
    <P>For the past year we have had an excellent train service both to the south and to the west.  As far as my area is concerned it means something like seven trains in and seven out.  It is a very good service but I must ask if that is the service provided in the summer and it is carried on all through the winter are you not losing money? I should like the board to answer that question.  It was proposed next January to cut down on services to the west.  I understand that is now to be postponed until February.  Also we had rail hostesses on the trains who did an excellent job for passengers, particularly the women and children.  I congratulate them on the way they did their work.  I understand now that they are being phased out.  Is this just for the sake of the board being able to say: &ldquo;We saved something here?&rdquo; What is really happening?</P>
    <P>I have referred to articulated trucks. If you get behind one of these God knows when you will be able to pass it out, especially between Dublin and Kilcock.  You must be resigned to staying behind.</P>
    <P>Are the board going after the traffic that is travelling 100, 130 or 150 miles in articulated vehicles?  In future when the Estimate is brought in can it be shown exactly where the money is being lost?  I know many people from the west who, because of the way they were treated in regard to Pearse and Connolly stations, decided to use their cars to travel to Dublin.  They park a <Col N="689" /> little way out of Dublin and they can travel in their own time.  If a woman with a few children comes to Dublin by train to do some shopping she must leave the bus south of O'Connell bridge and then walk or take a bus to whichever part of the city she wishes to go.  People should not be treated in that way.  The buses from Heuston Station should turn left at O'Connell bridge and drop their passengers midway up O'Connell St.</P>
    <P>A hard look must be taken at the board of CIE.  Is it top heavy?  I remember when a questionnaire was sent around to the working men of CIE.  They were asked for suggestions for the betterment of the services, the timetables and so on.  The men gave their honest opinions.  A few people here in the capital city sat at a round table and decided the way things should be.  However two years later they adopted some of the suggestions that had been made by the ordinary rank and file workers because they were sound and sensible.  Who knows better what suits the public than the men who meet the people every day particularly on country roads?</P>
    <P>I would ask the Minister not to have Pearse and Connolly stations as white elephants while the people from the west do not have a proper way of getting to Kingsbridge.  At least bring all Mayo and all Galway back to Pearse and Connolly stations.  I hope that when the Minister brings in his Estimate he will give us details as to where, when and how the losses are taking place.  I believe that some of them can be overcome.  While we have a bus service and a train service this House and the country will have to subsidise them.  I would like to know how it is that the Aran service is losing money.  Perhaps this happens during the winter.  I know that in summer the two boats are choc-ablock each time they sail.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FrancisTaylor" hpid="Mr. Taylor Mr. Taylor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>This Bill was necessary because a decision had to be taken as to whether the travelling public should have to pay the increase of 33 per cent demanded by CIE.  It has now been decided that the public will pay only 20 per cent and the Minister and the Government will carry the <Col N="690" /> additional charges.  The past year has dealt CIE a heavy blow.  Fuel costs contributed in a big way to the outlay of the company and have made it necessary to increase freight charges and passenger charges on our bus services.  It is worrying that this year there has been a loss of £14 million in CIE.  Despite the fact that over the years many changes have been made in CIE's board of management and that the Government have in the past given pretty generous subsidisation to CIE they still show a frightening deficit.  The Minister and the management of CIE at this stage should come together to work with the trade unions and all those involved and attempt, at this time when we all have to tighten our belts, to reduce the heavy loss which is an annual feature of our transport company.</P>
      <P>Some of the things that took place in the last 12 months did not contribute to CIE's efficiency.  I refer specifically to the nine weeks' bus strike we saw in this city which did not relate to any grievance in regard to working conditions or rates of pay but rather to an inter-union squabble.  Personnel will have to give attention in the future to the question of whether there are too many unions and whether they should come together for the common good and accept leadership from one or two unions and see if this would improve relationships.  I have seen the workers of this city and those who live outside the city being inconvenienced by bus strikes.</P>
      <P>There is no point in closing the stable door when the horse has gone. We should see how such strikes can be avoided.  This is only one factor. When the public are asked to subsidise losses annually they are entitled to request an examination of the factors which over a long period have caused those losses.  Every factor should be considered.  CIE have plans for rationalisation.  Rationalisation to me means nothing but closing down stations, depriving areas of transport to which they are socially entitled. We have seen this in the west, including my own county, half of which is without a rail service.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If agricultural production does not increase in the year ahead&mdash;and this <Col N="691" /> will be difficult because of increased costs for fertilisers and so on&mdash;there could be a reduction in freight in certain areas.  The carriage of fertilisers brings great revenue to CIE, and I can see restricted purchases and therefore restricted income for CIE from this source.  However, maybe that could lead us to explore areas where there are fertilisers and thus reduce transport costs.  I refer specifically to the opportunity there is for developing the phosphate mines in north Clare which were a godsend during the war years.  Unfortunately if they were developed there is no rail system to take out the raw phosphate. We must take the situation as we find it.  We are now in a Community with a common transport policy, and from 1st January next we shall be operating the EEC transport policy, and any reliefs we can give to CIE must conform to EEC regulations.</P>
    <P>There was a noticeable improvement in the standard of our train services with the introduction during the past 12 months of the supertrains, which cannot be criticised in regard to speed, heating and so on.  Maybe the dining service could be improved. Better facilities should be made available for regular travellers, particularly from the west.</P>
    <P>I have been told there is the intention to rationalise the service from Limerick station to Dublin by eliminating the 12.00 train from Limerick which arrives here at 2.30 p.m. at Heuston station.  The cutting of this service, as I am sure other regular travellers like our shadow Minister, Deputy Barrett, would agree, will mean that we shall be rather late arriving here in the city for the Dáil sitting, and that people travelling on business will not be able to catch a train to return to Limerick that evening. We are opposed to this cut-back in service and would ask the Minister to ensure that this train is not cancelled. If we are to give the west equal opportunity with the east, it must be seen to be done rather than talked about.</P>
    <P>There has been an increase in the rail passenger service over the years, <Col N="692" /> and we can foresee additional users of the railway.  That will be commensurate with the type of service, and some of the increase can be attributed to the introduction of the supertrain. People will use the service if it is comfortable and efficient.</P>
    <P>The Minister should encourage people to make more use of our waterways, particularly the Shannon.  If landing and other facilities are provided a greater interest will be taken in such a service.  All our waterways should be utilised fully and encouragement given to people who show an interest in development of this kind.</P>
    <P>I believe the Minister was right when he decided that CIE passengers should not have to pay additional charges, that the State should take its share of the responsibility.  It is our social obligations to the people in remote areas to provide some of the finance to subsidise the service so that the full increase in costs would not be passed on to them.  The purpose of this Bill is to meet that situation.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RayBurke" hpid="Mr. R.P. Burke Mr. R.P. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R.P. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>One thing which has become obvious from this debate so far is the need for a system of Select Committees of both Houses to examine in detail the operations of the various semi-State bodies.  A debate such as we are having now places certain restrictions on speakers and is therefore inadequate.  One is not in a position to get down to the nitty gritty detail into which one should go and I would suggest to the Minister that he should seriously consider, with his Cabinet colleagues, a system of Select Committees to examine the operations of semi-State bodies.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We are talking here of a sum of £11.3 million on the backs of the taxpayers. One subject that should have been discussed over the last nine months at some stage was the nine-week bus strike.  Our hands were tied from the point of view of discussing that strike.  A Select Committee could have gone into immediate session and examined the workings of the company and the reasons for the problems which brought about the strike. The Minister said that one of the significant factors for the increase in <Col N="693" /> expenditure was the nine-week bus strike and the general decline in economic activity resulting in heavy revenue losses to CIE.  It was not only CIE which suffered heavy losses; the economy generally suffered.  Industry, traders, workers and others suffered. These are things that should have been discussed and could have been discussed by a Select Committee.  The time is overdue for the operation of such committees.</P>
    <P>With regard to the reorganisation of CIE in the greater Dublin area, there is need for fast suburban rail links to serve the growing populations in areas like Tallaght, Blanchardstown, Fingal and Swords.  There is a rail link to Balbriggan, serving Skerries, Rush and Lusk, Malahide and Donaghmede. A rail link would make it attractive for motorists to travel by rail and leave their cars at home.  That would solve parking problems.  There could also be a rail link from Dublin Airport to Portmarnock and Howth Junction.  Air passengers could then step on to a train which would bring them right into the city or even out to their hotels in Ballsbridge. That would remove the need for buses, taxis and cars to serve the airport.  Workers from Ballymun would be able to get by train to the airport or into the city and out into Tallaght. A circular route would be the proper solution and there would then be no need for improved motorways in the city centre with consequent damage to areas like the Liberties.  Because of high petrol and fuel costs it is absolutely vital that people should be transferred to the railways.  One train could carry a couple of hundred people.  The same number travelling in cars causes chronic congestion, to say nothing of polluting the environment.</P>
    <P>The overhaul of CIE services in the city is overdue.  CIE have not changed their schedule in years.  New estates have developed and local representatives press for an extension of bus services: after five years the service is extended.  I suggest to the Minister&mdash; he can pass the suggestion on to CIE &mdash;that a circular route from Howth to Portmarnock, Malahide, the Airport and right into Ballymun would make an enormous difference.  CIE seem to <Col N="694" /> think that every bus must go into the centre of the city.  People living on the north side and working on the south side have to take two buses to get to their places of employment.  A circular route would make this sort of transfer unnecessary and it would also mean a better and more intelligent use of the facilities and manpower we have.</P>
    <P>Workers at the moment have the burden of massive fares travelling to their places of employment.  Added to transport costs they have to meet the costs of electricity and gas, plus high rents.  The time has come when we must take a long look at the operations of CIE to see where economies can be effected and to see whether operations can be made more efficient and more economic.  The result could well be a reduction in fares.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>Thank you.  Before I reported progress on the last occasion I was making the point that there is fairly widespread disappointment and disillusionment with this Government in the matter of desirable law reforms. Individual Members of this Coalition Government in Opposition had presented themselves, and very successfully presented themselves, as dedicated reformers. No platform, no seminar, no conference was neglected by them as an opportunity for protestation of their zeal.  Every cause was espoused when they were in Opposition.  I pointed out that many people had accepted the protestations at their face value and had looked forward genuinely and <Col N="696" /> honestly to a great reforming programme by this Government.</P>
      <P>We are not getting that programme of reform and there is widespread impatience on the part of many groups and many individuals who had been let to believe that this Government would embark on a comprehensive programme of necessary reform.  I said on the last occasion that it is not sufficient for the Minister for Justice in this context to fob us off by pointing to improvements in the social welfare code.  We welcome those improvements.  We made them ourselves as resources became available. We accept that the Government have gone along the same road in a number of directions.  That is not what we are concerned with in this motion.</P>
      <P>What we are calling for in Deputy Andrew's motion is legal reform, the provision of legal rights and legal remedies for those people in our community who need them, the defenceless people who are described in this motion.  Deputy Andrews and I and those of us on this side of the House who are interested in this area recognise that this is a major legislative undertaking and we do not expect the Minister to do everything overnight. We want some payment on account. We want some positive action.  It is our belief that it is the duty of every Minister to do what he can in his time.  We believe that the law must be continuously updated to provide solid protection for those citizens, those members of our community, who are weak and defenceless and incapable out of their own capabilities and resources of looking after themselves.  That is what reform is all about.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I also want to make the point that these remedies and these protections which we are seeking must be readily available.  We want a workable system. We want something which will be available to the ordinary citizen who has no particular resources at his or her disposal.  This motion is inextricably bound up with the question of free legal aid which we discussed on another motion of mine a short time ago.  Every Deputy knows that involved in this question of deserted <Col N="697" /> wives, deprived children and unmarried mothers are many elementary needs which are not available to them. This motion is concerned with those needs.</P>
    <P>Our case is that our courts at present are not suitably constituted to deal with the type of problem which comes up in this area.  The legal profession at the moment is not geared to deal with this sort of case.  I mentioned that from my own personal knowledge in the city of Dublin there are only one or two solicitors who are prepared to undertake this type of work.  The ordinary solicitor's office is not geared to undertake these types of family remedial actions.  We want to see progress made in this area.</P>
    <P>Mainly what we are concerned with in this motion is to try to push the Minister into positive action.  We believe that the problem has been sufficiently exposed.  There are many excellent groups and organisations working in this area.  There has been plenty of publicity as to what the reality of the situation is, what the problems are, where the hardship is and what remedies are needed.  These have been fairly well exposed and publicised and what we need now is positive action.  In this motion we are asking the Minister to come forward with legislation in some area to assist these groups.  The Minister has expressed his sympathy and his goodwill. He has told us we are pushing an open door.  He said something along the same lines when he intervened on the last day when this motion was being discussed.  He said:</P>
    <P>The spirit behind this motion is an excellent one and I welcome it.</P>
    <P>We appreciate the expression of that sentiment by the Minister but we want to see concrete action.  Many aspects of this could be dealt with immediately.  They do not require any further investigation or any further inquiries.  It is simply a matter of the Minister bringing the legislation into this House.  I assure him that in terms of relief from human suffering and human hardship and human agony any one single measure enacted in this area will be of enormous benefit and well worthwhile.</P>

      <P>I wish to support this motion.  As yet I do not know the precise Government attitude to this motion but I gather it is not being opposed.  In my view it should not be opposed.  Deputy Andrews has done a service to Dáil Éireann in tabling it.</P>
      <P>In recent years we introduced amending legislation in relation to adoption.  We have also introduced the Maintenance Orders Act.  We have reformed certain areas of social welfare, such as monetary allowances for unmarried mothers, special allowances for wives of prisoners and so forth. In this political establishment&mdash;and this is my personal opinion&mdash;there is a trough of complacency.  This is very dangerous.  I share with Deputy Andrews and many members of the Government, notably the Attorney General, a deep sense of anger and personal frustration that for many years we have been waiting painfully, slowly, for successive Cabinets to introduce reforming legislation.  It came at a snail's pace when Fianna Fáil were in power.  It has come at a slightly faster pace since the Coalition came into power.  I say this because the pace and content of the reform have not been fast enough.</P>
      <P>I do not want to face a general election in two or three years' time with a record of a new Adoption Bill, a Maintenance Orders Bill and we are still considering the interim report.  I want to be able to stand as a politician deeply interested in this area of legal reform.  I want to be able to say that we have positively discriminated in favour of the 7,000 or 8,000 children who come to the attention of the Irish Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Children every year.  There are many thousands of children of widows and widowers who still do not have adequate social positive discrimination in their favour.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are grave deficiencies in the law regarding the children of deserted wives, deserted wives themselves, juveniles, families who appear before <Col N="699" /> the courts, husbands who abuse their wives or wives who abuse their husbands, husbands who desert their wives or wives who desert their husbands.</P>
    <P>Deputy Andrews referred to the plight of children.  Do we know the deprivation being suffered this winter by the 3,000 or 4,000 itinerant children here?  What have we in Dáil Éireann done?  I am a member of Dublin County Council.  The record of that council in terms of providing elementary living accommodation for children is a public disgrace.  In my own constituency there is a family of 11 children living under a tent in Cabinteely&mdash;that magnificent, affluent suburb.  Their father is in hospital.  They are suffering. The public representatives of the area are doing very little for them.  Apart from passing nominal resolutions that perhaps they would provide one or two houses&mdash;something small enough to ignore the problem and yet large enough to say they are doing something about it&mdash;they have done nothing. These people to whom I refer are my fellow councillors of Dublin County Council.  I claim no exemption in that regard.  Those 11 children are included among the deprived children of our community.</P>
    <P>We must also consider this motion in another context.  I know we are concerned about the legislative reporting aspect.  We must consider the 7,000 or 8,000 children who will not go beyond primary school and many of whom will leave school illiterate despite the lauded benefits of our educational system.  We must consider the several thousand children who will finish up in different forms of public care.  I suggest that, in a community which can comfortably spend £4 million a week on drink while not worrying unduly about deprived children we can do two things: first, ensure that taxpayers' money is spent on deprived families, deserted wives, deprived children.  Or else we can implement the classic elementary socialist principle: we can introduce the necessary transfer payments in the community.  This can be done if we have the political will to do it.  I am sure the Irish people would not be unresponsive.  The opportunities <Col N="700" /> are there.  The need is there.  We must go to the electorate and convince them that these areas of reform still remain to be dealt with.</P>
    <P>I echo Deputy Haughey's comment that underlying this is the need for an effective system of legal aid for deprived families.  Despite the alleged generosity of the legal profession&mdash; many solicitors and barristers are extremely generous in providing what they regard as a personal system of legal aid&mdash;there is nowhere in my constituency where I can send for legal aid a deserted wife, a battered wife, a wife with four or five children having suffered at the hands of her husband, or a husband who has been deserted by his wife and who is wondering who will mind his children when he goes to work on Monday morning.  Although he may be living in Dublin his relatives may not live here.  He wants legal aid.  I can, perhaps refer him to a lawyer friend of mine, hoping that that friend will help.  Some members of the legal profession patronise the poor by providing charitable legal aid.  I want to see a system here where such persons can have elementary public protection.</P>
    <P>Last weekend in Dún Laoghaire a young unmarried mother who had had a nervous breakdown informed me that her landlord had told her that she would have to pay an extra £1 per week in rent.  She is now paying £15 per week rent for two rooms in Dún Laoghaire.  The extra £1 per week is because the landlord said the price of gas has increased.  The flat has a gas central heating system but the £15 does not include the usual 10p she puts into the meter for electricity. There is no way by which I can provide legal aid to such an unmarried mother who is rather desperately trying to care for her child at home.  How can I refer this unmarried mother who lives in a furnished flat to a rent tribunal or court?  There are no courts in existence.  This person is on a casual week to week tenancy of an exploited nature.</P>
    <P>There is no legislation to provide protection for such persons and such persons are being exploited.  Those living in private rented accommodation, deserted wives, unmarried <Col N="701" /> mothers and deprived children, are very frequently eternally grateful to any landlord who takes them in because they have, in this so-called Christian country, the stigma of being unmarried and having children.  For this reason very few landlords or landladies want to see them.  Very few landlords want to see a deserted wife either.  We are unduly complacent about this.  If I speak strongly on these topics it is because I feel that Dáil Éireann, a male dominated platform of a political nature consisting mostly of people from the middle income group, tends to treat these major issues in a rather remote fashion.</P>
    <P>In the course of the debate on this motion last week Deputy Haughey told us that he frequently has to listen to a wife or a mother telling him that her life is a living hell and that she cannot carry on or that she cannot continue to protect her children in the situation and in the circumstances in which she finds herself.  If I cannot listen to such a person and tell her her rights under the law then there are deficiencies.  I share that sense of frustration with Deputy Haughey.  I suggest to the Minister for Justice that there are areas where staff of his Department could produce a system of family courts without having to suffer sleepless nights in the Christmas Recess.  I do not want to be critical of public servants because, in my opinion, a public servant is as good as his Minister.  I do not suggest that public servants should be caught by the scruff of the neck and dangled around until they produce a Bill.  If a Minister has not sufficient political determination he should be prepared to stay up until 5 o'clock in the morning to get the knowledge or the background. I am convinced a system of family courts can be produced by officials in the Department of Justice and I do not think it is a subject of such complexity, with due respect to the Minister for Justice, or to any member of the Government or the Attorney General&mdash;there is no more sensitive and perceptive person in the Dáil on the Government side than the Attorney General who has a grasp of the problems involved.  I do not think the close analysis or study required are as tedious <Col N="702" /> or as time consuming as the Minister told us.</P>
    <P>I suggest that studies of comparative law and the comparative procedures which we had over the past five years, are not necessary again. What we need are a few straightforward simple decisions, for instance, to establish family courts, and set up a system of lay assessors within these courts.  It is possible that we will not make a success of this in the first year but we should try the system out in an urban area where it can be done without any major legal anomalies developing. I am not one for experimenting with the law but there must be some sense of imagination and innovation, particularly in an area where there is an abundance of evidence and reports available.  I am worried that it has been suggested that we may have to wait until we receive the report on Court Practices and Procedure before we proceed to set up family courts.</P>
    <P>If we have to wait for that kind of eventuality I believe we will not see family courts established in the life-time of this Dáil.  The committee on Court Practices and Procedure is an excellent one but I am worried, knowing the nature of what happens when a report gets into the hands of the Departments after production, that the delay could be considerable.  I urge the Minister to have a look at this situation.</P>
    <P>I welcome the decision to set up a task force.  I know a number of the members of this task force, particularly Mr. O'Mahony, Mr. Ó Cinnéide and Mr. Shanley, and I have not the slighest doubt but that their report will be produced quickly and that it will be possible to implement it speedily.  I urge one warning on the Minister and it is that the setting up of this task force may give rise to the old temptation, as happens in many Government Departments, that once it is there under the auspices of the Minister for Health, officials will sit back and wait.  It is possible that the report during 1975 will be sent from Department to Department until, perhaps in 1976, a Member decides to have a further look at the situation.  I issue these warnings in a harsh sense because while I have <Col N="703" /> no doubt that the task force will report in time there is a danger that its recommendations may not necessarily be implemented.</P>
    <P>Deputy Andrews suggested that there should be a court system for children in conflict with the law.  He suggested a system whereby a justice will sit with two lay assessors.  On balance, I tend to favour it if only on the grounds of simplicity.  I know the Minister for Justice has suggested that there is a danger in remote rural towns that one's next door neighbour might well be sitting as an assessor. I think that danger could be overstated. I would suggest to the Minister that initially one could set up a court system for children in conflict with the law; in, say, Dublin, Cork, Waterford, Limerick, Galway, in the major areas; have the lay assessors appointed, who presumably, would have an elementary training in child care and, in social administration.  Indeed, I would hope that if there were two assessors one of them would be a woman.  I think it should be ensured that women social workers are involved directly in such a new courts system.  Rather than suggest that a neighbour might be worried about the fact that another neighbour might be sitting in judgment on his children in court, I would suggest to the Minister that one should think in a positive, innovative sense and take a chance, set up a system, let it operate for a couple of years, have a report from the district justices concerned&mdash;and there may be only five or six of them spread throughout the country initially in the major urban areas&mdash;and have a report from the lay assessors. Then, in the light of experience, one could introduce a more comprehensive system.  Perhaps this represents an air of impatience on my part but I would prefer to see something like that done rather than wait and see nothing done during one's membership of Dáil Éireann.</P>
    <P>Indeed, I would hope that one of the early recommendations within the task force and emanating from any district justice would be that reports on children who come in conflict with the law at juvenile liasion officer <Col N="704" /> level&mdash;where they are, as is the custom, warned, where the parents are informed and where no charges are brought&mdash;would not be recorded.  I would hope and pray that the arduous practice of recording such warnings in public records would cease so that when such children subsequently apply for State employment&mdash;and this happened in one instance of which I am aware in the past three weeks they are not told: &ldquo;Sorry, you are not entitled to be posted; sorry, you cannot apply to be a BIM fisherman under a State scheme; you are not eligible because we have a report that you came in conflict with the law.&rdquo; I have been assured by those responsible for the operation of the juvenile liaision officer system that there was never any such intention, that any slur of a non-statutory, non-judicial nature would be cast on the character of such children who have obtained what one might call &ldquo;off the record&rdquo; warnings.  I would sincerely hope that this practice would cease.  Indeed, I raised this matter in the House four years ago.  All I got at the time was a very gruff response from the then Minister for Justice and nothing was done about it, although he did admit that this practice should cease.  God knows, with the dangers inherent in the use of computers at present, the keeping of records of that nature could mean that some unfortunate child of 15 or 16 years of age who had had a severe warning for some petty offence which is recorded and who applies for a job subsequently at 18 or 19 years of age could be told he was not suitable on those grounds. I would hope that that situation would be rectified as soon as possible.</P>
    <P>Within the system of family courts I should like to see established the requirement that there should be a full, written, social background report, a social inquiry prepared in respect of every child and every young person who appears before the courts.  I would suggest that such a report should be specially and directly prepared by qualified social workers.  This is an essential element in the care of deprived children.  I would suggest that there be more effective and positive use of a system of supervision <Col N="705" /> orders to assist children and their families in their problems.  Where children might require a compulsory period of residential care, I think that should be for a limited period only; initially, say, for three or four months, subject to review, rather than having a blanket period of custodian care. Those are elementary provisions which the task force should introduce. Indeed, I would urge that there be the facility of providing for an interim care order of up to 28 days, if necessary, during which time the young offender can be properly observed and assessed.  Subsequently the district justice might make an order rather than, as at present&mdash;with due respect to our district justices and social workers&mdash;having it done on a somewhat hit and miss basis.</P>
    <P>Finally, I come to part (b). Deputy Andrews suggested the guarantee by the State of an adequate standard of living for all who have the care of children.  Since this is an aspect which relates particularly to health and education, I would suggest to the Minister for Health that the time has come for a radical, comprehensive review of the system of children's allowances. As a Deputy I earn £4,200 per annum.  I have no other source of income.  I have three children and I get £9.40 or £9.65 a month for my three children.  Do I need that money more than a family with an income of, say, £1,500 or £1,250 per annum? I would strongly suggest to the Government that the across the board children's allowance to every child in the community, irrespective of the means of that child or of its family &mdash;now costing millions of pounds per annum&mdash;is not the most socially desirable, the most socially egalitarian or, indeed, the most balanced way of giving assistance to children in need. There are very large farmers in this country; and there are numbers of industrial workers who are not that badly off.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>Therefore, I <Col N="706" /> would suggest that we should give a weighted children's allowance to, say, the fourth or fifth child; perhaps the first child might not get any.  I know this is a very contentious area. Perhaps there should be some ceiling in relation to income for the payment of children's allowances.  Again, perhaps, the principle of selectivity should be applied.  But were we to take the millions of pounds we spend on children's allowances and distribute them more fairly throughout the country to the children, mothers and families in greatest need, that money would have far greater impact in terms of family income maintenance.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>I therefore strongly support the motion before the House and commend my colleague, Deputy Andrews, for introducing it.</P>
    </Speaker>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Health and Social Welfare (Mr. Corish)</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to intervene briefly on this motion in the knowledge that my colleague, the Minister for Justice, covered a great deal of ground when he spoke here last week.  I should like to deal briefly with the section of the motion which is concerned with the question of deprived children and the updating of the 1908 Act, which in the year 1974 could certainly be described as being ludicrous when one has regard to the needs of children, particularly deprived children.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not think any of us should claim credit in this respect and I do not think anybody in the House who has spoken has deliberately made a political issue of this motion.  The blame must be shared by all of us who have been in Government in Dáil Éireann for any length of time.  Even now at this late stage we can claim credit from both sides of the House that we are concerning ourselves with the matters which are contained in the motion which was moved by Deputy Andrews.  As far as the 1908 Act is concerned, with all due respect to those who administer the law in the courts, in many cases rather than reforming the child the sentences <Col N="707" /> which are meted out are, in my view, making criminals rather than reforming them.</P>
    <P>There are many organisations who have campaigned for the updating of the 1908 Act and an improvement in the lot of deprived children, who have concerned themselves about the problem.  We have those who were responsible for the compilation of the Kennedy Report about four years ago. We have the CONCERN organisation, the CARE organisation and the Council for Social Welfare.  We have also the further recommendations published recently by the CARE organisation.</P>
    <P>This Government were elected on a policy of social reform.  That social reform does not mean that reform should be merely in the matter of cash allowances, whether they be for orphans, deserted wives or any other such people as are described here in this motion.  It was inevitable of course that, because we were elected on a policy of social reform, we should turn our attention to reform in the area of children's law and children's services as soon as the opportunity presented itself.  It was emphasised in the Kennedy Report that responsibility must be centred in one Minister.  Inevitably, no matter what might happen in the near future, the Minister for Education and the Minister for Justice must be involved &mdash;the Minister for Justice in court matters and the Minister for Education in the general education of those who may be sent to institutions.</P>
    <P>The House will welcome the fact that the Government decided the main responsibility should be vested in the Minister for Health.  My task therefore, as Minister for Health, is threefold: (1) the preparation of a new Children's Bill; (2) the preparation of proposals for the improvement of the service for deprived children and children at risk; and (3) the preparation of proposals on any administrative changes which will be required to put these proposals into effect.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Justice might have been under a disadvantage today in that there was a question posed to him by Deputy Andrews which <Col N="708" /> possibly should have been directed to me because I was the person who was given the responsibility of appointing the full-time task force of experts in the field of children's services.  I should like to assure Deputy Andrews and any other Deputies who asked supplementary questions that it is a full-time task force.  I believe the Minister for Justice may not have had the information that is available to me because, as I said, mine was the responsibility for the establishment of this task force.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DavidAndrews" hpid="Mr. Andrews Mr. Andrews">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Andrews</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>Possibly the question should have been directed to me, but that is not the fault of the Deputy. There were questions asked about whether or not there would be an interim report and how long the working party would take to make their recommendation.  I know politicians are prone to making promises but I should like to assure the Deputy that it is a full-time task force and I am informed by them they will complete their task in a matter of months.  I do not want to tie them or myself to two months or three months but it certainly will not be one of these commissions or working parties that will go on and on because I am very anxious to do what is contained particularly in part three of the Deputy's motion.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>During my consideration of reform of the law in relation to children some of the major issues I will have to consider will include the following.  The new age of criminal responsibility which at present is at the ridiculous age of seven.  It has been recognised for a long time that this age is far too low.  There are various views, as has been said in the House, as to what the age should be for criminal responsibility. <Col N="709" /> Various ages have been mentioned during the debate.  The ages of 12 and 14 were mentioned.  I could not give a view as to what it should be.  I will be guided in the main by the task force that has been established but I think there is no doubt but that it should be upped considerably. I will consider these and other possible options as far as the age is concerned.  The House can take it that it is my intention to raise the present age to a more realistic level.</P>
    <P>It is obviously scandalous that a young child of eight years of age should be held to be criminally responsible. I know there are difficulties and children of that particular age get into trouble but at seven or eight years of age I think it can create a very bad impression on them and certainly may do harm to their future lives by having them arraigned before a court, no matter how kindly the justice might be, and to have them tried as if they were criminals.</P>
    <P>I also intend, and again I will be guided by the task force, to look at the judicial institutions which should be available to deal with children and with juveniles.  There has been a great deal of criticism of our present court system for the hearing of children's cases.  Without intending any disrespect to the courts, a lot of the criticism, both direct and implicit, is pretty well justified.  The main theme of the criticism has been that the courts as they function are not adequately equipped to explore the needs of children as opposed to the matter of their punishment.  This is a particularly difficult area.  Even within this debate various suggestions have been made as to how children should be dealt with if they appear to break the law.</P>
    <P>I would like to assure the House and Deputy Andrews in particular that the task force will visit Scotland for the purpose of exploring the panel system to which the Deputy referred. This is a system that could be introduced in Ireland.  While I have not available to me the exact details of the system I understand that it is a court composed of lay people. Again, without any disrespect to the <Col N="710" /> judges or the district justices, there is the possibility that such a system whereby lay people would assess a young child before determining what should be done in regard to him, would be better than the system in operation here at present.  On the other hand, there is the possibility that we could have a family tribunal institution and this, I think, would be a more appropriate setting for children's hearings.  This tribunal would consist of a judge and lay advisers. The judge would assess the needs of the children rather than the punishment and I would visualise that the advisers would include social workers, particularly those in the areas from which the boys or girls would come, and that they would give relevant information as to backgrounds and so on.  I do not say that in the children's courts there are slot machine decisions but far more care and attention should be given not so much to the alleged crime but of what should happen to the unfortunate boy or girl coming before them.</P>
    <P>I will explore all the options available in this regard but the House can look forward to some modifications in the judicial institutions for children's hearings.  It is my belief, also, that I should take a look at the range of disposition options available to the courts when dealing with children.  There have been some interesting innovations in this regard that are in operation in other countries and I propose to have these examined. They would include such items as community service orders for convicted offenders, to mention but one possibility.  This type of therapy or rehabilitation would be to the advantage of the child and would probably give him a greater sense of responsibility if he were inclined to be a vagrant or if he were the child of a family over which there was not the utmost parental control.  The emphasis in disposition options must be tilted in favour of rehabilitation.  The emphasis must be on rehabilitation where these young offenders are concerned. I will look into the matter from that point of view.</P>
    <P>So far as the courts are concerned <Col N="711" />&mdash;I have referred to this before&mdash; greater use should be made of social inquiries when decisions are being taken in regard to the disposition of children.  In the event of the non-availability of social inquiry reports it is difficult for the courts to decide on the needs of the child and to dispose of his or her case accordingly. Therefore, the question of making social inquiry reports mandatory will be looked at in this connection.  However, reform in the courts and in the law is not the absolute answer and will not lead inevitably to major improvements in the services available to children.  The services need to be developed.  I am very conscious of this but I am conscious, too, that improving services is always costly and it is impossible at this stage to say how fast desirable improvements can be brought about but this should not prevent us from looking at the improvements that are desirable.</P>
    <P>Even if we cannot implement them all at once, it seems to me that the single most important area where services should be improved is in the community area.  This is where prevention can take place and it is highly desirable also that services be available in our community to maintain as many as possible of deprived children and offenders in their own community. The health board will have to play a very important part in this. It may be possible to create a situation in which reform of judicial institutions and our own health board staffs have a much closer formal relationship in dealing with the problems of deprived children and young offenders.</P>
    <P>Deputy Desmond referred to the question of children's allowances.  The Deputy was embarking on slightly dangerous ground here because it is very difficult to evolve a system in relation to payment of children's allowances or to decide on the type of person or what should be a person's income in determining eligibility for these allowances.  The Deputy suggested that salaries should be taken into account in the payment of these allowances.  Most of us from time to <Col N="712" /> time have experienced a little guilt in this connection.  There were times when it occurred to me that the allowance I received for my children, for which they are no longer eligible, could be put to better use by diverting them to children such as we are talking of now.  However, we had a rather odd experience when we introduced the clawback clause some time ago.  That move was not welcomed universally.  As Minister for Social Welfare my intention at the time was to try to give more to those who would be regarded as needing it rather than to give to those whose need of the money was less.</P>
    <P>I accept the motion before us.  I do not say that we could or should implement every provision in it but both the Government and the Opposition have a fairly clear idea of the direction in which we are going in relation to these matters.  As Minister for Health and as the one responsible for the establishment of this working party I will take into consideration the recommendations that are made by this eminent and expert body.  I am sure everybody will agree that they are eminent and expert in this field.  I hope that as a result we will have a different Children's Act and that we will be much more conscious of the need for the involvement of health boards and social welfare workers in looking after these people.  I am not sure what clause (b) in the motion is suggesting.  I was not here when Deputy Andrews spoke. He talks of the guaranteeing by the State of an adequate standard of living for all who have to care for children.  I presume he means the children we are talking of here and not children in general.  So far as the first part of the motion is concerned, the record of this Government can be applauded in respect of the people the Deputy mentions.  We have made a considerable improvement in this area.  During some general debate here recently I quoted figures showing where children's allowances were increased from, say, 360 per cent in respect of one child to 90 per cent for a family with ten children while at the same time in the period, mid-February, 1973, to mid-May, 1974, the CPI went up by 20 per cent.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="713" /> This was deliberate policy on our part.  Much more deliberate was the decision we took to give an increased amount to the child of the one-parent family.  We did this in two budgets. In respect of one of the categories mentioned by the Deputy, deserted wives, we reduced the qualifying period from six to three months and in July, 1973 we introduced a scheme whereby a social assistance allowance would be paid to unmarried mothers.  Another innovation which the House welcomed was the payment of benefit to deserted wives based on the insurance record of the deserting husband.  That was also introduced in 1973 and in effect gave the deserted wife the same amount of money as she and her children would otherwise get plus the increase for the children.</P>
    <P>We also made an improvement regarding the wives and families of prisoners by introducing a new allowance for them.  I do not say that the financial adjustments or improvements we made are the answer to the proposals in this motion but I can assure the House and Deputy Andrews that I and my colleagues, the Minister for Justice and the Minister for Education, are sympathetic as far as the general theme of this motion is concerned, particularly regarding the updating of the Children's Act, 1908 and these improvements will be carried out as quickly as possible.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMoore" hpid="Mr. Moore Mr. Moore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moore</NameTxt>
      <P>I have only a few minutes to speak on this motion but at least it will give me sufficient time to pay tribute to Deputy Andrews for initiating this discussion.  The welcome it got and the number who wished to speak on it in the limited time available shows how appropriate it is to the thinking of these times.  I join with other speakers in complimenting the Deputy on giving us the opportunity to speak tonight.  The whole theme of the motion is family law reform with the emphasis on family and while we look at the many social ills we suffer and the many problems of our society, I am sure we can point an accusing finger at ourselves for falling down on the job of protecting the family as a basic unit of our society and not ensuring <Col N="714" /> by legislation and otherwise that we would enshrine the family in its proper place in the community.  I trust that we who revere and wish to protect the family will give all the time, money and thought possible to the best way of doing it.</P>
      <P>I should like to pay tribute to the many organisations, some recently founded and some very old, whose aim is to help the less fortunate among us and which are doing such wonderful work in child and general family welfare.  If I single out the religious orders in this respect it is because they have been doing it longer than anybody else.  We know the wonderful work they do as in the case of unmarried mothers.  We had a man like Frank Duff in the Legion of Mary who, when it was not a popular thing to do, took this burden in hand and set up a home for them.  He looked after them and gave them help and assistance when it was neither popular nor fashionable.  The thinking in our society now is more advanced than it was some years ago and this may be explained by the fact that we are more affluent now and can afford to be more generous.  However, I think there is a greater awareness of the problems and Deputy Andrews' motion epitomises present-day thinking and I hope some good will flow from it.</P>
      <P>Deputy Haughey emphasised the need for legal aid for families of people in trouble.  Here, organisations like FLAC have been doing great work on a voluntary basis.  Young professional men or women cannot be expected always to continue to give their time voluntarily and therefore the State must come in with a proper system of free legal advice for those who need it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The children's court has been criticised over the years and while there has been some improvement I agree that it should be taken away from a place generally associated with courts, such as the Four Courts, and transferred where there are modern buildings and where modern techniques could be provided so as to give young offenders a better chance to recover from their misdemeanours. We cannot dissociate the social atmosphere from the young boy or girl in <Col N="715" /> trouble because if the Establishment has been remiss in allowing social problems to develop in certain sections of the people and if young people get into trouble, when they stand in court, I think we also stand indicated for our negligence, apathy and perhaps, laziness in not tackling social problems with much greater vigour and foresight.</P>
    <P>In a city like Dublin where we have many social problems we have, of course, battered wives.  This is a horrible description, perhaps so horrible that it compels us to do something. One society for which I do a little work has established a home for homeless men who have not much hope but, by voluntary work this has been made a self-supporting unit.  They now plan to provide a home for battered wives or, as I would prefer to say, maltreated wives.  However we describe them we know that these women who have been ill-treated by their husbands need help.  The husband needs something different and I would deal very severely with him.  If he has psychiatric trouble he should be treated for it; if he is just a bully he should be severely dealt with, but while this is being done we must ensure that the wife who has been ill-treated, and the children, get the best treatment society can give them.</P>
    <P>In Dublin where we have so many unfortunate women on the streets I am told by social workers who work among these women that there is a very high level of psychiatric disturbance among them.  This is something we do not normally think about in connection with these women but some religious bodies which are doing great work in that field tell me that many of these women have grave psychological problems.  In any programme for the care of women we must examine every possible aspect of the position and see what can be done to better the lot of these people.</P>
    <P>In conclusion I should like to pay tribute to the gardaí who in the city deal with various vice problems affecting women.  This section of the gardaí should be strengthened because there are gangsters in this city who are <Col N="716" /> using these women as a means of making money.</P>
    <P>I know the trouble the gardaí have, I know how dedicated the gardaí who are trying to curb this practice are, but in any Government policy on the care of women we must emphasise the prevention of the ill-treatment of women.  There are some names well known to gardaí and they prosecute occasionally but if we are to prevent a development of vice we should give the gardaí all the powers necessary to deal with such people.  At the same time, we should show those women that the State is aware of their problem and is very willing to help any woman or child in trouble.  The resources at our disposal may not be great but they are sufficient to ensure that no woman need be maltreated or deprived.</P>

      <P>I should like to thank Deputy Moore for allowing me a few minutes to speak on this motion.  It is a highly important motion.  I am very pleased that the present Government have delegated to the Minister for Health the responsibility of investigating, improving and up-dating the Children's Act, 1908.  It is seriously out of date in 1974 and it has created anomalies.  The sooner they are removed the better.  The vast majority of cases that come before the courts are dealt with as fairly as possible by our district justices.  They make every effort to be fair and reasonable. Nevertheless their hands are tied by the Act and it is necessary that the law should be changed to prevent serious difficulties arising.</P>
      <P>Pre-marriage courses are important but there is a responsibility on the Government to try to improve on the advice bureaux available to married couples and to families.  No matter what efforts are made to improve the legal framework, the important thing is to provide help and guidance for married couples and young boys and girls during difficult periods. If this were provided it might prevent some marriages from breaking down.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have, as a solicitor, represented people in cases such as were mentioned here today.  In cases of assault <Col N="717" /> between husbands and wives and other such cases there is a difficulty for solicitors and barristers if they are heard in public.</P>

      <P>Such cases should, if at all possible, be heard <i>in camera</i> so that family difficulties and background are not made public.  Having them heard in public is not the way in which justice should be done.</P>
      <P>If the legal owner of a house is the person who is deserting steps should be taken to prevent him from selling the family house.  In the case of children who are over 16 but require further education or help in their jobs the dependency should continue beyond 16 years.  At present there is a limit on the payment that can be allowed by the court.  It is £15 in the case of a wife and £5 for each deserted child. This limit should be removed.</P>
      <P>This matter is complicated, difficult and tedious.  The State should look into the matter of guaranteeing an improved legal aid system to see that solicitors and barristers who are engaged in this work are compensated. This is important.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DavidAndrews" hpid="Mr. Andrews Mr. Andrews">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Andrews</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to thank all the Deputies who contributed to this debate.  Let me thank the various Government Ministers who saw fit to make their views known.  One of the most refreshing and, indeed, helpful contributions from the point of view of information and the generous fashion in which it was placed on the record was the contribution of the Minister for Health.  He came in this evening and spoke on the motion in a decent fashion.  He did not wish, as we on this side do not wish, to have it made a political football.  Not only did the Minister for Health meet the motion in a generous fashion, he also gave his plans for the future in the context of what concerns his Department.  He mentioned that he intends setting up a <Col N="718" /> task force for child care and I should like to take the opportunity of congratulating him for setting up this very important task force.  The people who will be working on it will be working full time and that is as it should be. If these matters are to be taken seriously I believe, with no disrespect to the people who give their time volunarily, that the people engaged in this area should be engaged on a full time basis even if it is only for a year or two.  In those circumstances people will work a full day and a full week and, consequently, things will be dealt with much more speedily.  I agree with Deputy Desmond that the people appointed to the task force are undoubtedly people of merit and while we on this side of the House might quibble about their obvious political affiliations, they are people who are well versed in the subject to which they are about to set their minds, the area of deprived children.</P>
      <P>In contrast with the Minister for Health, the Minister for Justice came into the House too sensitively, looking for a fight, which we in Fianna Fáil did not intend to engage in, and took up the motion in the wrong spirit.  It appears that the Minister for Health accepts the social thinking of the Fianna Fáil Party, but the Minister for Justice rejected it and, therefore, the Minister for Justice rejects the social thinking of the Minister for Health.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMarkCooney" hpid="Mr. Cooney Mr. Cooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cooney</NameTxt>
      <P>That is the most convoluted logic I have heard for a long time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidAndrews" hpid="Mr. Andrews Mr. Andrews">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Andrews</NameTxt>
      <P>It is logic all right, and it is not convoluted.  If the Minister for Health agrees with me and the Minister disagrees with me&mdash;it is the triangle system of logic.  It is a very reasonable point.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMarkCooney" hpid="Mr. Cooney Mr. Cooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cooney</NameTxt>
      <P>There is neither premise nor deduction to it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidAndrews" hpid="Mr. Andrews Mr. Andrews">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Andrews</NameTxt>
      <P>I just deduced it and have given the premise for it.  The Labour Party are in agreement with us on what is required.  The Minister for Justice told us what he had done during his term of almost two years. <Col N="719" /> He could argue that he was not long enough in office at the time, but the Minister draws attention to two Bills that he brought on to the table of the House and which are now on the Statute Book, namely the Adoption Act, 1974, and the Maintenance Orders Act, 1974.  If the Minister is to hold these up as an indication of his will to engage in law reform, then God save us from the Minister's law reform programme.  The Adoption Bill, as we pointed out was in the pipeline in the Department of Justice when the Minister arrived there, as, indeed, was the Maintenance Orders Bill.  There is nothing particularly reformist about taking another party's prospective legislation, when they are in Government, putting it on the table of the House and pretending it is your own.  It is anything but the Minister's own.  This Minister who is a man of integrity and dignity and well capable of being Minister for Justice, nevertheless, has not discharged a number of promises made by his Government in the programme presented to the people at the last general election.  As the Minister for Health said, the Government were elected on a policy of social reform. The Minister for Health might believe that, but the Minister for Justice does not.  I would urge him to study the generous fashion in which his colleague met the motion proposed by me in the House.  The Minister for Health outlined what his intentions were.  On the other hand, the Minister for Justice, who quite clearly disagrees with the Minister for Health, does not appear to have any programme at all.</P>
      <P>To sum up the situation very briefly, when I spoke on this motion last Wednesday I referred to the nineteenth report of the Committee on Court Practice and Procedure.  There are so many reports available, including the Kennedy Report now that surely out of all these reports we should be able to produce legislation.  However, there is one sentence in that report which sums up what I have been saying for the last few years:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The present recommendations are made to meet the existing situation <Col N="720" /> and are believed to be capable of rapid implementation.</P>
    <P>To be fair to the Minister, he did initiate something when he asked the committee to report on maintenance and desertion, and, of course, when he was speaking the previous evening he had to have a sideswipe at the Opposition again and say what a great man he was for thinking this up and presenting it to the committee.  We give the Minister full credit for that, but if the committee consider that the recommendations made by them in that nineteenth interim report are capable of immediate implementation why, almost a year later, are we still waiting for those reforms?</P>
    <P>This Government have distinguished themselves by their abject failure in the whole area of law reform, not least in regard to social law reform.  The Minister mentioned that they had increased family allowances, that they increased certain provisions for deserted wives, that they introduced a new concept giving money to the wives of prisoners during the incarceration of their unfortunate husbands, and that a mother would receive payment in respect of illegitimate children.  I do not think the latter proposition is correct. It has been proposed but it has not been enacted&mdash;the provision of money for social assistance for the mothers of illegitimate children or single parent families, to use the current jargon.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMarkCooney" hpid="Mr. Cooney Mr. Cooney">

    <Speaker pid="DavidAndrews" hpid="Mr. Andrews Mr. Andrews">

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMarkCooney" hpid="Mr. Cooney Mr. Cooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cooney</NameTxt>
      <P>Of course, it was done. It was done in the budget in 1973.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidAndrews" hpid="Mr. Andrews Mr. Andrews">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Andrews</NameTxt>
      <P>I am talking about the specific care of children.  The Minister is mixing up the two things.  The Minister will recollect he made a promise to the CHERISH meeting in the Royal Marine Hotel three or four weeks ago, and that is the promise the discharge of which I want to inquire about.  I do not believe it has been discharged.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMarkCooney" hpid="Mr. Cooney Mr. Cooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cooney</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy quite <Col N="721" /> clearly said no payments were made to the mothers of illegitimate children. That is nonsense.  It has been law since 1973.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidAndrews" hpid="Mr. Andrews Mr. Andrews">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Andrews</NameTxt>
      <P>I think it is also fair to say that the concept of desertion and deserted wives, however belatedly, was introduced into the law by the Fianna Fáil Party and that any Government worth its salt should be extending what was provided by the originating Government.  The Minister for Justice on the last occasion apparently boasted about the increases in social welfare payments under the various headings.  How well the Minister might boast.  Would we not think very little of any Government that would not increase annually payments to social welfare recipients?  What is there to boast about?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMarkCooney" hpid="Mr. Cooney Mr. Cooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cooney</NameTxt>
      <P>We introduced new payments as well as increasing the existing ones.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DavidAndrews" hpid="Mr. Andrews Mr. Andrews">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Andrews</NameTxt>
      <P>They introduced one new payment and the Minister has mentioned it.  The Minister should concentrate on his own Department and stop concentrating on Social Welfare and Health.  What we would ask him to do is to come in here and give us some piece of original law reform produced by himself.  I believe the Minister wants such reform but there is such a backlog he cannot cope with the situation.</P>
      <P>For the fourth, and last time, may I assure the Minister that the Opposition will give him every assistance and every support in relation to any original piece of law reform he may introduce here.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>I shall not take all 55 minutes.  Before the debate adjourned I was speaking about the parlous hospital position in Cavan town.  I pointed out that the Fitzgerald Report had recommended Cavan town some years ago as the proper centre for a regional hospital.  That recommendation was considered by the North Eastern Health Board, representatives from Monaghan, Louth, Meath and Cavan, and democratically that health board decided the hospital should be sited in Cavan town.  I understand that Comhairle na nOspidéal considered the position and approved of Cavan town as the site for the regional hospital.  Visitors from the North Eastern Health Board who visited Cavan and were painfully conscious of the poor quality hospital service available recommended that the regional hospital should be erected in Cavan as a matter of priority.</P>
      <P>There is at the moment considerable anxiety in Cavan about the position.  There is a feeling that the seriousness of the situation is underestimated by the Minister and his Department and I understand that the urban council have asked for a meeting with the Minister, a meeting which will take place this week.  The chamber of commerce is also exercising itself in this matter.  The very fine team of doctors in Cavan town are perturbed and are working on the situation to try to improve it.  The people in general feel that the time for a decision by the Minister has come.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="723" /> In his opening statement the Minister said that £4.5 million were being spent on improving the hospitals.  I cannot understand why a position which was researched so thoroughly and a recommendation which met with such general democratic approval could not have been taken into account in this context.  In my opinion the Minister should have decided to start building the hospital this year.</P>
    <P>The Minister also said that he wished to have a national network of efficient, first-class general hospitals. I suppose one should really start with the general and move from that to the particular.  At the moment I am dealing with the particular and relating it to the Minister's general remarks. I cannot understand why this capital project has not got under way. I cannot understand why the Minister, having considered the expert evidence and the democratic decisions taken, cannot clear the way.  The situation is urgent.  This is not, as I said on the last occasion, an <i>ex parte</i> pleading; it is a genuinely urgent case.</P>
    <P>I agree that improving health generally so that pressure is thereby taken off the hospitals is the right approach. It is a sound approach.  When the Minister talks about improving the health services so that we do not have to continue to rely exclusively on hospital services, in the context in which I am speaking, this is no better than a sick joke.  The hospital services are totally inadequate.  They are a danger to the community.  The Minister says he will continue his work on the development of a general hospital plan for the future.  Considering the decisions that have been taken at democratic level and the recommendations that have been made, the Minister could find no better place to start with a general hospital plan than Cavan town.</P>
    <P>Later the Minister said:</P>
    <P>It is recognised that a hospital system which met the needs of the past will not necessarily meet the needs of the future because of the changing pattern of medicine and hospital care.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="724" /> The surgical hospital in Cavan has been condemned for a long time.  It may have met the needs of the dim and distant past.  It is certainly not meeting the needs of the present.  We need a decision from the Minister to go ahead with the building of the regional hospital in Cavan town. I say this in the context of the Minister's remarks about high-quality hospital care and reasonable accessibility. Both these factors were taken into consideration by the Fitzgerald Committee and by the North Eastern Health Board when they came down firmly and democratically on the side of building this regional hospital in Cavan town, giving it, in the words of the visitors from the North Eastern Health Board, priority.</P>
    <P>I shall not underestimate what the Minister refers to as the socio-economic importance of a general hospital in the town.  It is of importance but, at the moment what is exercising all the bodies and all the people I have mentioned is the provision of an adequate hospital service for the town.</P>
    <P>If I wanted to, I could be cynical about a paragraph in the Minister's speech.  The Minister said he is not prepared to rush his decision on this matter.  Seeing that the FitzGerald Committee, the North Eastern Health Board and Comhairle na nOspidéal considered the situation and all came up with the same opinion, I do not think anyone could accuse the Minister of rushing a decision on this matter.  The Minister also referred to consultations in areas in which disputes have arisen about the future of the hospital service.  I have outlined for the House what has happened in this area.  I have pointed out that democratic decisions were reached in the area.  I do not think there is any necessity to go beyond those to pick out spheres of minor disagreements in this area.</P>
    <P>I am sure the Minister is not talking about the North Eastern Health Board region when he talks about disputes which may impede or retard his decision making in a particular case.  I want to talk, not merely about the structure of the hospital, but about other problems which would be comic <Col N="725" /> were they not tragic.  There is the radiology situation.  There is now no radiologist in Cavan town.  A radiologist has to come down from Dublin each Friday to do the X-rays.  The X-ray plant itself is outdated and has been outdated for a long time.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanCorish" hpid="Minister for Health (Mr. Corish) Brendan Corish">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Health (Mr. Corish)</NameTxt>
      <P>For how long?  I am sorry for interrupting the Deputy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>I was trying to think. As the Minister knows, there has been a sophisticated development in the X-ray world and the hospital has not been kept in touch with that development. I am appealing to the Minister to attend to this when he is making the decision, which I hope he will make soon, on the regional hospital in Cavan.  Taxis have to be sent with films to Dublin in cases of emergency. Every day in the week either a bus service, or a taxi service, or an ambulance service, has to be used for taking X-rays to Dublin.  In a moment I will refer to the situation in regard to the laboratory and the House will see that it is absolutely ridiculous.  A time and motion man who had to consider the situation with regard to X-rays and specimens for the laboratory would get an ulcer within a week of studying the situation and, if he did, there would not be a bed in the hospital for him to get treatment.</P>
      <P>The specimens are taken to Dublin from the surgical hospital and from Lisdarn every day by ambulance or by special taxi.  The hospital staff spend a lot of time ringing up hospital services to get people to call to Busaras to collect specimens when the ordinary bus service is used.  Twice a day mini-buses are too-ing and froing from Lisdarn and the surgical hospital to the bus station.  Telephone calls have to be made to messenger services in Dublin to collect specimens at Busaras.  Telephone calls have to be made to find out the results of the tests.  You would not need to be a time and motion expert to see how chaotic the situation is in regard to the X-ray and the laboratory service. Any person with ordinary common sense could see that it is deplorable and ridiculous.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="726" /> I am asking for a rationalisation of the whole system.  This will all follow upon the Minister's decision with regard to the regional hospital.  The laboratory service can be set up.  The X-ray equipment can be modernised and the whole system nationalised as soon as the basic decision is made on the regional hospital.  The pressure on beds is high.  I understand that sometimes people have to be sent out after three days in the hospital and asked to come back to have their stitches taken out.  Of course, the surgeon decides this and I am sure he will not decide it unless it is safe to do so.</P>
    <P>When medical personnel are required it is very difficult to entice a man to come to a place like that to work.  Consequently there is a danger of a running down of the personnel numerically and even qualitatively.  For this reason the urgency of the need for a decision by the Minister is apparent. I am asking the Minister to make the decision at once.  One hundred surgical beds at Lisdarn as an initial step are absolutely essential.  I am sure the Minister as a reasonable man, and as a man concerned with the improvement of the health services in the area, will see when he examines the brief carefully, that my demand is a moderate one.  I am not making a case simply for the sake of making a case. The groups I have mentioned are really concerned about this issue.</P>
    <P>I should like to make a few general remarks on the Estimate before I sit down.  My main point was to deal with a particular case in the light of the general principles which the Minister enunciated in his Estimate speech.  I notice in the statistics, which are very valuable, that in the North-Eastern Health Board area the percentage of people over 65 years is 11.3.  This is the lowest percentage in the country apart from the eastern region.  I should like to speak briefly on a serious problem with regard to old people who are kept in their own homes and who fall to the care of in-laws, sons and daughters-in-law or <i>vice versa.</i>  There is a serious problem here.  The prescribed relative allowance paid by the Department of Social Welfare should be extended.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="727" /> At the moment if there is anybody other than the prescribed relative and the aged person in the house, this allowance is not paid.  It should be. The pressure that this should be liberalised should come more from Health than perhaps Social Welfare. When the person is very old, and consequently perhaps rather difficult, there is a serious social problem.  This is not something which occurs on a minor scale.  I am convinced from contacts with my own constituents and discussions with people in other constituencies that this is a major social and health problem.  If the in-laws find the burden too great these people have to be taken into hospital. Then the cost to the community is much greater than if there was a liberalisation of the prescribed relative allowance or some such allowance. I am talking about a social ill which should be examined and dealt with, preferably by the Department of Health.</P>
    <P>I am glad to see from the statistics that the North-Eastern Health Board area has the highest birth rate apart from the eastern area, which leads in everything and gets the greatest attention of course.  The marriage rate has improved.  People are marrying at a younger age.  These statistics are very useful to the practising politician because they help him to identify both health and social problems in his area.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>They will probably get a good football team out of that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>We are trying hard enough.  We got them before when the marriage rate was not so good and when the marrying age was later.  There may be a moral in that, I do not know.</P>
      <P>In Cavan town there is one physiotherapist employed to deal with 450 beds.  He is working in the Surgical Hospital, St. Felim's and Lisdarn.  I also recommend that the Minister encourage his health board to improve the physiotherapy service, not to mention the orthopaedic service and the ear, nose and throat services for the area.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>All these improvements, rationalisation, and dovetailing of services can <Col N="728" /> take place only when a decision has been made on the regional hospital. Again, I appeal to the Minister to make a decision to build a regional hospital in Cavan with all possible haste.  We will not be persecuting him about medical questions if he gets this under way.  All the people of the area this hospital will serve, not merely those of my constituency, will be eternally grateful to him for this.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnJRyan" hpid="Mr. J. Ryan Mr. J. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I compliment the Minister and the Government on their ever-increasing commitment to the care of our people, as the figure of £166 million in the budget proves. The Minister is anxious to provide facilities to cater for our sick, young and old people.  This figure represents 60 per cent of an increase on the budget of two years ago.</P>
      <P>This is a very difficult Ministry. The Minister's comprehensive report indicated his genuine concern for these people.  The fact that in this difficult year there is an increase of 7 per cent in expenditure speaks for itself.  In my own town great strides have been made in the care of the aged.  Recently a home for these people was opened and the atmosphere is conducive to their contentment. They are now able to enjoy their remaining years among their own people.</P>
      <P>I should like to refer briefly to two aspects of the care of these people. The first is the home care allowance. If there was more flexibility in the regulations to enable relatives to qualify for these allowances there would be fewer old people going to these homes.  This is worth investigating. I appeal to the Minister to look into this.  The second is the question of home help.  There is a very urgent need to develop this service, especially in rural Ireland.  In isolated areas, where many old people live alone, far from any person or settlement, they are left and not cared for.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I now come to one of the most important items, the general hospital services programme.  With an expenditure of £73 million this qualifies as an item of great importance.  I commend the Minister on his priorities. His objective is to have first class <Col N="729" /> units backed up by a viable community-based welfare system.  The question of outpatients clinics should be gone into urgently.  This will result in a better and more decisive treatment for the sick and will reduce considerably the number of beds used in our hospitals.</P>
    <P>I was delighted to note that the Minister disagrees with the terms of the Fitzgerald Report.  Since this report was published, I have opposed it at all levels because I consider it a city-orientated document prepared by urbanised specialists.  Dublin is not Ireland.  The Minister agrees with this statement when he says that there is a need for these hospitals in many parts of the country.  He has been attacked by members of the Opposition for his delay in resolving this problem and in coming to a decision on the recommendation. They forget that his predecessor also had this on his desk for five years.  I appreciate his detailed examination, because on his decision rests the future of the care and hospitalisation of our people.</P>
    <P>However I must take him to task on his suggestion that every town is looking for a hospital.  I speak as one who was vigorously opposed to the Fitzgerald recommendations from the outset. Our main concern is to ensure that our country hospital system is retained so that each unit can continue to serve the people of four or five large towns and the adjoining rural areas.  These 100-bed units cater for surgical, maternity and ordinary medical cases. They serve in most instances between 50,000 and 65,000 people within a radius of a maximum distance of 40 miles.</P>
    <P>Rural Ireland has suffered too much and too long, with the central authority designed destruction and closures of such essential services as Garda barracks, railway stations and national schools.  We in rural Ireland are determined to save our county hospitals which, with some additional senior staff, will serve the future needs of our people.</P>
    <P>Prior to the health boards being foisted on us by the previous Government, the county councils, knowing the needs of their people, had built up these institutions.  We will not accept <Col N="730" /> any interference from the central authority which will deprive rural Ireland of these services.  It is amazing how easy it has been, since the inception of the health boards, to have numerous senior executive posts on the administrative staff filled but then one witnesses tremendous opposition to the appointment of the necessary additional staff required to make our county hospitals viable, independent and sufficient to serve our people.</P>
    <P>I accept that there is, and always will be, a need for specialised services in the nearest regional hospital but the normal surgical cases should continue to be dealt with at county hospital level.  I appreciate the Minister's concern to meet and consult with every group interested in the future of our county hospital system.  It is a decided improvement on the attitude of the former Government to consultation.  Naturally I am concerned about the future of the county hospital in my home town, Nenagh. I have resisted at every opportunity the terms of the Fitzgerald Report relative to this institution and even though I am a Government back-bencher I will continue to ensure that the 55,000 in my constituency enjoy the facilities of a first-class county hospital in Nenagh.</P>
    <P>It is ludicrous to suggest, let alone to recommend, that the facilities now available, or even those envisaged for the regional hospitals in Limerick city, will satisfy my constituents in the years ahead.  One must remember that Limerick city is expanding and that it will require these additional services to cater for its own people and the people of county Limerick.  I find it difficult to obtain a bed in any city hospital for any case, specialised or otherwise, from my area.</P>
    <P>There are approximately 270,000 people in our region which consists of north Tipperary, Clare, Limerick city and Limerick county and with the expected population expansion, as predicted by the McCarthy Report, by 1986 this figure will have reached 350,000.  We must plan our hospital services for the future and that is what development is about.  In view <Col N="731" /> of these facts no one has the right to interfere with the county hospital system in our region which consists of a county hospital in each county.</P>
    <P>There is an obvious case for the immediate upgrading of these hospitals. Feeling is running high in my constituency and I can assure the House that there will be the maximum resistance to any effort made to interfere with a hospital of which we are rightly proud.  I will be in the front line, as I have been for a number of years past in the fight to retain this hospital.  I give this pledge to my constituents.</P>
    <P>My final remarks concern the Fitzgerald Report.  Rural Ireland must fight, and will fight, for the retention of the county hospital system.  Too much money has been spent and too much work and endeavour put into it by the staff of these hospitals to have them taken away by the health boards, through their executives, or by some senior executive in the Custom House.</P>
    <P>I should now like to deal with the child health services.  A tremendous amount of work has been done in this regard under difficult conditions and I should like to compliment those involved. However, I believe that to achieve the full and final objective of this service the scheme should be extended to cover children up to the age of 14 years, the most vital year in the proper and healthy development of a child.  This extension should also apply to the school dental service.</P>
    <P>On the community care programme I should like to congratulate the Minister on his efforts to improve this essential service.  I can see that every effort is being made to increase the number of social workers.  This is an urgent necessity because there is a serious shortage of trained personnel.  I know that the need is greatest in the isolated areas of rural constituencies where there are old people living alone miles away from settlements and dependent on the odd visit from a nurse or doctor or a friend.  This should be gone into urgently.  I urge the Minister to press ahead with his plans to ensure that these people are catered for and not <Col N="732" /> forgotten after years of service to the community.  I believe better results could be achieved if the community care team worked in conjunction with the county health advisory committee who are conscious of the needs of the people of the area.</P>
    <P>On the question of health education I should like to compliment the Minister on introducing the worthwhile project of educating our youth on the dangers of excessive smoking and of drinking, which has increased alarmingly. I suggest that this programme be extended and worked in conjunction with the Department of Education so that young people will be encouraged to spend their leisure hours at sporting pastimes and healthy outdoor exercises rather than excessive drinking and smoking.</P>
    <P>I should like to refer to the recommendation issued by the Department of Health to the effect that the mass X-ray units should be withdrawn from rural Ireland.  I appreciate that TB is on the decline but it is still prevalent and active.  Until such time as it is completely eradicated an X-ray unit should be stationed in rural Ireland. At health board level I expressed the desire that in order to cater for the south a unit should be stationed in Cork city.</P>
    <P>I should like to refer to an important issue the Minister has on his hands, resolving his difficulties with the consultants. There is a grave need for straight talk on this issue.  These 300 people, so vital to the well-being of our nation, have adopted a stubborn and selfish attitude, in the prolonged discussions with the Minister.  It is apparent that they do not wish to co-operate or reach a settlement.  I have my own views on their reasons for not doing so.  Often in the past we have heard criticism by the general public of small groups of craftsmen in essential services holding the country to ransom by withdrawing their services. Here we have an educated professional body, comparatively small in number, who are prepared to deprive our people of a service that means so much to them.</P>
    <P>I extend thanks and congratulations to the staff of our hospitals, the doctors, <Col N="733" /> the nurses and the wards maids. They have done wonderful work over the years.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnOLeary1965" hpid="Mr. J. O'Leary Mr. J. O'Leary">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not at all satisfied with the operation of the general medical services scheme.  I am not satisfied mainly because there are so many people who I think are entitled to this service and who are not getting it.  The eligibility limit for health cards should be raised at least once a quarter.  There is a guide scale laid down by the Minister for Health for health cards and this is operated fairly rigidly by the health boards.  This scale applies in respect of persons in receipt of wages or salaries but it does not apply to small farmers.  Each application from a small farmer is judged on its merits. The limit of £20 per week for a married man is unrealistic and should be raised immediately.  At one time the eligibility limit was related to the income of a county council road worker or labourer.  I am glad to say that his income is now in the region of £28 to £30 per week.  I believe that the income limit should be increased immediately from £20 per week to £28 per week, when more people could qualify for medical cards.  We know that persons in receipt of non-contributory old age pensions are automatically entitled to medical cards by the majority of health boards.  I would go further.  I would feel that persons in receipt of contributory pensions, particularly old age pensions and contributory widows' pensions, should be automatically entitled to medical cards also.  I base my case mainly on the fact that those people paid for their pensions. In the case of a widow, probably the husband paid during his life-time and, in the case of the contributory old age pensioner, he had paid into the pension fund himself.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I believe also that a certain allowance should be made in the case of a wife who has to take up part-time employment in order to supplement the income of the household.  I know of a number of cases in which, immediately the wife took up part-time employment, the medical card was taken from the family and the result of her employment was nil in so far <Col N="734" /> as the family then had to pay for drugs and medicines in addition to the fees of the local doctor.</P>
    <P>Every person in receipt of unemployment assistance, again, should automatically qualify for a medical card.  In this respect, I am thinking particularly of small farmers in receipt of unemployment assistance. I believe that each small farmer receiving such assistance should qualify for a medical card because in most cases there is a fairly rigid means test carried out by the local social welfare officer.  I have come across a number of people who have suffered a lot because they were incapable of purchasing drugs and medicines for themselves.</P>
    <P>There is another aspect of the general medical services scheme about which I am concerned.  This relates to persons holding health cards who receive a prescription from a specialist or, in an emergency, a doctor other than their own under the choice of doctor scheme.  That person cannot go to the chemist of his choice for the drugs and medicines prescribed.  Even though he holds a medical card, he must pay for those drugs and medicines himself despite the fact that had he got the prescription from the doctor of his choice he would have been entitled to have them prescribed free of charge.  The regulations should be amended to provide for such an eventuality.</P>
    <P>The time has come too, when persons who hold medical cards should also have a choice of ophthalmic optician.  There are quite a number of such opticians throughout the country and I see no reason why such a scheme could not be implemented initially, on a trial basis within the confines of some health boards.  I would advocate that such persons would have a choice of frames as well which would help in no small way to clear the huge waiting list at present in health boards in respect of persons seeking ophthalmic services.</P>
    <P>Of the total Supplementary Estimate amounting to something in the region of £4,600,000 £2½ millions relate to price increases.  There is no doubt that inflation has had a terrible impact on <Col N="735" /> the health services generally.  Certainly the cost of drugs and medicines to health boards has created financial problems for those boards.  There appears to be no real price control so far as drugs and medicines are concerned. The high cost involved cannot be understood by many people who believe that neither the Minister for Health nor any other Minister has any control over those prices.  I am informed that some manufacturers may be making exorbitant profit.  The time has come when a full inquiry should be conducted into the cost of production of drugs and medicines which cost the patient so much, wherever a prescription is prepared, whether it be in a chemist's shop, hospital or institution. I believe that if the income scale to be used by health boards in considering eligibility for medical cards is increased, if more people qualify, ultimately there will be fewer people seeking treatment.  I know of at least half-a-dozen people who have come to me in the past three or four months and told me they could take only half the quantity of drugs prescribed by their doctor because they could not afford to pay for them, and in one case a woman told me she could take only a quarter of the quantity.</P>
    <P>I have come across a number of medical card holders who were sent to private nursing homes for various reasons.  But the case I shall take now is one of emergency, or of a person being sent to a private nursing home for investigation or treatment of what may appear to the local doctor to be a minor ailment and which might ultimately involve a very serious operation. A few years ago when a case like that arose, provided the health board was satisfied that the case was genuine, as far as I know, a proposal was made to the Department of Health for ministerial sanction to enable the council, or health board, to pay either a percentage or the total cost of maintaining and treating that person in a private nursing home.</P>
    <P>I know of a few cases where sanction was issued.  Could this policy, which appeared to me at the time to be a very good one, not be carried <Col N="736" /> on?  It would certainly mean a lot to families where one member who appears to have a minor ailment, is sent into a private nursing home for investigation but later the patient may require major surgery and prolonged medical and hospital treatment.  The family, because that person is not in a general hospital, have to pay the full cost to the private nursing home.  I know of a case where a family were forced to put up their house for sale to pay for maintenance in a private nursing home.</P>
    <P>I would like the Minister to give some priority to the proposed new hospital for Tralee.  There has been undue delay in regard to the provision of this hospital.  In reply to a Dáil question recently no reasonable answer was given and no promise was made in regard to when this hospital would be erected.  This must not be put on the long finger, particularly when a badly needed new laboratory was completed recently in Tralee.</P>
    <P>I believe health boards should not trade in old ambulances when they are purchasing new ones.  They should give the old ambulances to voluntary organisations, such as mountain rescue teams, or local branches of the Order of Malta.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>Those discarded ambulances would not be very good.  I would not like to take them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnOLeary1965" hpid="Mr. J. O'Leary Mr. J. O'Leary">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>I refer to ambulances being traded in.  Even though they are not in good condition many of these voluntary organisations would be prepared to spend a little money on them and bring them up to a standard which would make them very useful for short runs.  They would provide an emergency service in many districts when the county ambulance might be 50 or 60 miles away.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Extensions to district hospitals in many parts of the country should be provided to cater for geriatrics.  I refer particularly to Kenmare and Cahirciveen, where by reason of the lay out of the existing hospitals and the staffing structure, it would not cost very much to provide extensions to cater for geriatrics in the area.  This would <Col N="737" /> be beneficial to elderly people who could be hospitalised locally.  Their relatives could call to see them frequently and they would live in their own environment with people they know around them.  The cost of providing such extensions would not be very great.</P>
    <P>I agree with the Minister that the organisation of community care in the near future, with particular reference to the role of voluntary organisations, requires close study.  This should certainly keep people out of institutions and hospitals.  I am not satisfied with the level of orthopaedic services operated by the Southern Health Board.  Quite a number of people are on the waiting list for admission to the orthopaedic units of hospitals.  The bed turnover is very low in these cases and if it were not for the few orthopaedic surgeons who work very hard over long hours this service would be in a very bad state.</P>
    <P>There is great delay on the part of the Southern Health Board in providing surgical appliances to people.  Some must wait for months after they have been measured.  By the time such appliances are supplied and fitted whatever treatment the patients received in hospital is of no use, particularly if a few months have elapsed.</P>
    <P>I regret that the Minister stated that he must cut back in the expansion of health services in 1975 because of lack of funds.  It will be very hard in future years to make up for this cut-back.  We all know that with ever-increasing costs it will cost far more in a few year's time to do what we could do next year.</P>
    <P>I am sure it is obvious to everybody in the House that there is an appalling lack of training facilities for girls who wish to train as nurses.  The vast majority of them must emigrate to England.  Extra places should be provided in the training hospitals.  The Minister should ensure that a training school is attached to the new county hospital in Tralee I hope such provision is being made in the plans for this hospital.</P>
    <P>There are also many complaints with regard to delays in waiting for X-rays and in getting the results.  This causes <Col N="738" /> worry to the people concerned and it means more visits to local doctors and probably having to take certain drugs in the meantime.  Every effort should be made to improve the service from the point of view of taking X-rays as soon as requested and also of sending back the results to the local doctors as fast as possible.</P>
    <P>The Minister will need a good deal of luck to reach the targets that he has set himself and I wish him every success in this regard.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JosephMcLoughlin" hpid="Mr. McLaughlin Mr. McLaughlin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McLaughlin</NameTxt>
      <P>At the outset I would refer to the problem of the provision of accommodation for mentally retarded children.  In the area from which I come we are fortunate in that a monastery has been purchased at Clooneymahon, convenient to Sligo, which will be used for accommodating mentally retarded children.  However I understand that it is the intention of the Department to bring to this establishment people from the constituency who are being accommodated at present in various other hospitals in Dublin and elsewhere. If that happens the accommodation for mentally retarded children will become a problem again.  As far back as I can remember this problem has been a burning one in the area.  I appeal to the Minister to ensure that the accommodation at this institution will be reserved for those people who are anxiously awaiting accommodation. I compliment the Department on having acquired this fine building in such a convenient and suitable area and I trust it will not be long until it is put into service.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I congratulate the Department, too, on the provision of a very fine home at Manorhamilton which will accommodate between 40 and 50 aged people.  There has been a great need for such an institution in that area for a number of years.  Up to now old people were sent to Carrick-on-Shannon which, for some of them, was as many as 50 miles from their own homes.  Very often relatives were not in a position financially to visit the aged there regularly with the result that as time went on there was a tendency to forget, and consequently the old people were deprived of the comfort <Col N="739" /> of these visits.  The provision of the new home will also relieve pressure on the county hospital.</P>
    <P>In the various hospitals I have visited I have noted that the staffs have been increased.  This step is to be welcomed.  In other days there might have been only one porter to do the heavy work in a hospital with the result that a considerable amount of heavy work had to be carried out by nurses and other staff.  Staffs today are well paid and they enjoy the work they are doing.  They receive the highest praise from the patients of the various hospitals.  However anything the Minister might do by way of increasing the salaries of nurses would be very welcome.</P>
    <P>Other Deputies have referred to the question of medical cards.  My experience has been that in recent times the means test in this respect has been eased considerably so that it is not so difficult any more to acquire a medical card.  Nowadays, too, all old age pensioners qualify automatically for this benefit.  This is of great help to all those people who have reached the age of 68 and we hope that this age will be reduced further.  Many of these people would not be in a position to pay doctors' fees.</P>
    <P>I notice, too, that disabled persons' allowances are paid regardless of means to those who are in poor health. I have been successful in arranging to have those allowances paid to necessitous persons.  This allowance means a lot in a home where previously there was great difficulty in making ends meet.</P>
    <P>A few years ago I happened to be a member of the committee of St. Columba's Hospital.  That was before the change to the health board system. At that time there was a great need for major extension works and repairs to be carried out in the hospital.  I am informed that very little of that work has been done in the meantime.  In those circumstances I appeal to the Minister to act as soon as possible in this matter.  The building is old but it is one that has given tremendous service as well as giving a fair deal of employment.  It has been known for its good doctors and other staff.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="740" /> Only last year the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister, Deputy Barry, officiated at the opening of a new hospital for old people at Manorhamilton, St. John's Hospital.  This replaces a very old and outdated hospital that had existed longer than I care to mention.  That is good progress. Previously it was sad to go through that hospital and see the old people in the old wards and dormitories with cold floors and whitewashed walls.  That is all changed and we now have a bright and lively hospital that gives satisfaction to everybody.  The patients are very comfortable with modern heating, lighting, cooking and transport.  It is a hospital of which any county could be proud.  With a bit of good luck and better times I trust the Minister will again go ahead with the good work which he has been carrying out.</P>
    <P>Another step in the right direction is community care, which is very welcome and essential.  Recently many people are being appointed to care for the aged in rural areas.  I remember not so very long ago when the aged lived in isolation and very few cared for them or bothered to see them. Occasionally they might visit the local shop.  Sometimes they were found&mdash; perhaps after a few days&mdash;to have passed away and nobody knew anything about it.  That is not the case now.  There are people to look after them.  I should like the Minister to ensure if possible that a local person be appointed in each area.  It is important that a local person work among the old people because he or she knows them, where they live and exactly the care and attention they need.  It is very important that such appointments be made on a local basis.  I know from experience that from among those interviewed it is always possible to get one or more people quite capable of doing this job well.</P>
    <P>There should always be good follow-up treatment and attention for mental patients leaving hospital.  A mental patient may go out in good shape after three or four weeks&mdash;it does not take very long now&mdash;but without follow-up treatment there is always the danger that that patient may become depressed, go down-hill <Col N="741" /> and, perhaps, be back in hospital again.  It is vitally important that a close watch be kept on discharged patients by the mental hospital staff.</P>
    <P>There was a very serious scare a few months ago throughout the county about the possibility that Manorhamilton hospital would close. A very largely-attended meeting was held because everybody was worried in case the hospital would close, from the point of view of the loss to patients and loss of employment.  The health board members arrived when the meeting was in progress and gave a very clear assurance that there was no danger of the hospital being downgraded or closed and that everything was being done to up-date it and make it more modern.  The money involved is very substantial and I must congratulate the health board and the Minister for having removed that worry from the community.  It was made clear that the hospital would be retained, that money was no object and that the hospital would not be interfered with on the grounds of finance.</P>
    <P>When the £7 charge came into operation we had a number of complaints and it was very hard for people to see why they should pay this sum. They now realise that it is the best insurance money they could pay.  If for any reason they have to go to hospital they are free there under £60 for an indefinite period.  That is a great consolation to many people, particularly in the western counties where valuations are not high and where there are many smallholders.  Fear and worry regarding hospital bills are almost written off as a result.  Some people may find themselves in difficulties due to a change of hospital or a change of doctor.  However, as a rule the health boards take a very lenient view and are very co-operative and, if at all possible, try to meet the wishes of a patient or a public representative to relieve worry and strain.</P>
    <P>My experience is that dental care is still a big problem throughout the country, although I must say that our dental surgeon in Leitrim is making good progress.  He is satisfied <Col N="742" /> that he has sufficient staff for the present.  At least that was the position at our last meeting.  But changes take place very quickly and many dentists come and go quickly.  The necessity for orthodontic treatment also causes much worry.  I think there is only one hospital for this treatment and that is in Dublin.  I strongly recommend that something be done in that connection. Many parents are worried about the attention their children need from that type of hospital.  Sometimes treatment must take place within a limited time and I again emphasise to the Minister the necessity to have this treatment available for children who require it.</P>
    <P>Recently I had people calling on me about allowances while their husbands were in hospital.  A man who has been receiving insurance or some sort of allowance may go to hospital, perhaps a mental hospital, and be there for a long time.  The allowance is discontinued while the husband is in hospital.  I have one particular case which I intend to bring to the Minister's notice before I go home.  The situation can be very serious for a wife and family with the cost of living as high as it is today.</P>
    <P>In my constituency the hospitals are doing an excellent job.  We have hard working doctors and surgeons.  People can be critical of doctors when they hear of a mistake being made but we are slow to compliment them on the many cases they put through their hands successfully.</P>
    <P>The Minister's Department are doing a very good job.  If one goes into a hospital in the morning the place is over-run with mothers and children. The children are being vaccinated against various serious diseases.  I must compliment the Minister on the amount of work that is being dealt with by his Department.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnCallanan" hpid="Mr. Callanan Mr. Callanan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Callanan</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to compliment the Minister on his very fine brief.  It was so comprehensive that it would take a long time to read and study all of it.  I believe he is carrying on the good work of his late predecessor. I believe he has the interests of the people in the lower and middle income groups at heart.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="743" /> The emphasis in the Minister's brief was on trying to keep as many people as possible out of hospital and rightly so.  Community care is most important in that regard.  I hope the Minister will not take too long to make up his mind about the rationalisation of the health services.  This is something that has been going on for a long time.  I agree that it is something on which one cannot reach a decision overnight. It will be a very important decision and no matter what it is it will be an unpopular decision.</P>
    <P>I come from an area in which there is great concern about this question. In my town we have a private hospital which caters for many health board patients.  It has 204 beds and the number of patients treated in one year is 5,178.  It is the most modern private hospital in the country.  It has an excellent training school for nurses. I refer to the Portiuncula Hospital in Ballinasloe.  It has a very large catchment area.  Until a decision is made the sisters there do not know where they stand.  I know everybody interested in health has recommended that this should be a general hospital.  I do not know what the health board have in mind.  The hospital is prepared to work anything within reason.  The people of my area are worried in case anything happens to this fine hospital. I would ask the Minister to make a decision as soon as possible.  We are leaving the matter to the good sense of the Department of Health.  We are not calling on the Minister every second day, bringing up delegations and talking loudly.  I hope we will not lose out because we are not making enough noise.  We believe common sense will prevail.</P>
    <P>I am one of those who did not agree with the Fitzgerald Report.  I know there must be very few well-equipped hospitals in the country but I do not believe in closing down too many county hospitals and making them county homes.  There are always emergency cases and people die on the way to hospital.  I would like to see as many hospitals as possible kept open and fully staffed and equipped.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="744" /> With regard to the means test for medical cards, I think the Minister has in mind full coverage for everybody. If I were the Minister I would not go that far all of a sudden.  I would be more inclined to bring up the limit to something like what Deputy O'Leary mentioned.  The means test for medical cards at present is unrealistic.  County Council workers were always eligible for medical cards until recently.  They earn around £30 now.  It is not realistic in this day and age to have a limit of £20 for a man and wife.  The State would save money by issuing medical cards to people with a higher income. In this way people would be kept out of hospital.  When one has a medical card one gets free service at home, at the dispensary, at hospitals and clinics. If a person is not very seriously ill and is not the holder of a medical card his people say hospital is the place for him because once he goes into hospital he does not have to pay.  That puts people who should be treated outside into hospital.</P>
    <P>As a member of the advisory committee of the Western Health Board, I recall the limit being £15 not so long ago.  We had it increased to £17.50 and then to £20.  I have been fighting for £25 but it has been refused by the CMO.  I do not know whether it is on his own initiative or on directions from the Department.  The present guideline of £20 is completely out of line with inflation, salaries and so on. That confines the health card to a very low income group, which is very bad policy.</P>
    <P>This also has a bearing on community care.  When community care was first introduced, the few pounds that were given for home help was meant for voluntary organisations with a nursing staff who would go around and take care of old people.  Take the case of a married woman with three or four children.  If there is an old person there and if someone comes in from outside she will be paid a few pounds for looking after that person. However, if the mother of the children happens to have a husband working and he is supposed to be supporting her, unless the patient is bedridden, <Col N="745" /> she gets nothing at all.  A person who is not bedridden can be much harder to mind.  At least a person with a house full of children knows that a bedridden person cannot go around the house and perhaps fall into the fire or hurt one of the children.  While the nurses who look after these people do a good job, when they have examined the patient and see how she is kept, they leave her there and it is the woman of the house who has to look after the patient.  As I say, if the woman has a husband supporting her she will get no home help.  Anyway £2 is no use. It should be at least £4.</P>
    <P>What happens at the moment, if the woman of the house is getting nothing, is that when the doctor comes, if the patient has a cold he is asked &ldquo;Is there any chance of getting her into hospital?  I have three or four children.  I think she would be better off out of here.&rdquo;  The doctor, quite naturally, tries to get the patient into hospital.  If the woman could get the £4, instead of being debarred because of the clause relating to support by her husband, it would keep people out of hospital.  I have seen some of these homes for the aged.  They are beautifully kept&mdash;we have one in Clifden&mdash; but there is a lonesomeness in these people for the environment in which they have lived all their lives.  Furthermore if people who are not too ill were kept at home, there would be more accommodation in hospitals for people who are genuinely ill.</P>
    <P>A free for all scheme may come eventually but, in the meantime, an improvement could be made.  More people should be taken into the middle income group.  I agree with every word Deputy O'Malley said about the voluntary health scheme, and this should be gone into.  However, take a farmer of £60 valuation.  While I am against valuations this is the way things are done at the moment.  A person of £60 valuation can have very poor land.  If the middle income group was expanded, eventually we might arrive at an overall scheme.  Of course, the Minister would want to give serious consideration to the question of whether there is accommodation to take everybody in.  I think it would <Col N="746" /> be better to move gradually towards that goal.</P>
    <P>There is nothing in the Minister's brief about mentally retarded children, for whom there is not sufficient accommodation.  I have visited houses where there have been children of that kind and I know what a burden it is. People have to wait a long time for accommodation and something should be done about it.</P>
    <P>Dental treatment is also very poor in some areas.  The excuse I hear is that there is a shortage of dentists.  I had a letter the other day from a qualified dentist who had an interview with the Western Health Board and was not called.  I cannot understand that, because I know people who are waiting for months and months for dental treatment.</P>
    <P>I do not like repeating what other people have said about the health services.  At the moment they are reasonably good.  I was opposed to regional health boards initially because I was afraid of what I describe as &ldquo;remote control&rdquo;.  I am always willing to admit that I have made a mistake. In this instance I was mistaken because, as far as the Western Health Board is concerned, everybody is very sympathetic.  In the old days one could approach the county manager in cases of hardship and the hardship clause would be implemented.  I must admit that the Western Health Board is working very well.  I was opposed to it and to the recommendations in the Fitzgerald Report because I believed that, if things became too big through amalgamation and so on, the ordinary Joe Soap would be nowhere.  That has not been my experience.  The board have been most agreeable to me and to everyone discussing problems with them.</P>
    <P>It would be a tragedy if the hardship clause were not in existence.  I know people who would be in a desperate position because of ridiculously unjust valuations were it not for this hardship clause.  I know the Minister is concerned for those who do not have too much of this world's goods and I would urge him to remind people that this clause is there to be implemented.  There are <Col N="747" /> people who, if they had to meet hospital bills, would be in a really desperate state mentally.  I have been told that there are some who are not inclined to implement this hardship clause and I would urge the Minister to insist on its implementation.</P>
    <P>I do not believe that the present system of home help will keep people out of hospital.  It looks grand on paper; it does not work in practice. If, for some technical reason, a relative is disqualified that relative will not be anxious to keep the infirm or aged person at home.  The whole trend of the Minister's thinking is to keep people in their normal environment. I suppose there is a certain materialism everywhere, though I do not think all are affected by it.  If a daughter-in-law is looking after an aged or infirm relative and the nurse comes in and makes rules and regulations, that daughter-in-law will not be encouraged to look after the relative if he or she becomes ill.  The patient will be put into hospital, occupying a bed that may be needed for someone seriously ill.</P>
    <P>With regard to the question of rationalisation, a decision about Ballinasloe Hospital is awaited in my county.  People are worried.  We expect our hospital will be classified as a general hospital, but we are still awaiting a decision.  We have a catchment area.  There are 204 beds and the average daily occupation is 168.  We have a training school for nurses.  It is one of the best in the country.  It would be a tragedy if this hospital were not classified under the proposed scheme of rationalisation.</P>
    <P>I congratulate the Minister.  He is carrying on the good work initiated by the late President Childers when he was Minister for Health.  I know he is concerned about the kind of people to whom I am referring.  I can assure him that every speaker on this side, including Deputy O'Malley, is not criticising for the sake of criticising. He is trying to be constructive.  He is trying to ensure that the best service is provided.  Health is not a political football.  All we want to do is to make certain that the services are improved.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="748" /> I have pointed out the snags in home help.  It is a bit selective.  The £2 is absolutely useless.  If the snags are removed the aged and infirm will be able to live out their lives in their normal environments.  Homes are excellent but, if one chats to these old people, they will be the first to admit that the homes are very good; they will tell you that it is grand but what would they not give to be at home.</P>
    <P>I compliment the Minister on his work and I appeal to him once more to make a decision with regard to rationalisation as soon as possible.  The country and particularly the area I represent are eagerly awaiting it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FintanCoogan" hpid="Mr. Coogan Mr. Coogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Coogan</NameTxt>
      <P>I find myself in agreement with much of what the previous speaker said regarding geriatric patients. It is very hard on unfortunate people from West Galway who, having given good service to the nation, have to &ldquo;live till they die&rdquo; in a home 25 miles away from Galway city or maybe another 40 miles away.  I am referring to patients who have to be kept in the County Home in Loughrea, County Galway.  The home is excellent but, in many cases, their children cannot afford to visit them. It is terrible that old people in their dying days cannot see their children. The Minister should consider the reopening of the Merlin Park section of the hospital.  At one time it was called &ldquo;the Mayo Clinic&rdquo; because patients were brought there from Mayo while city patients were sent to Loughrea.  I would ask the Minister to do something to meet the needs and wishes of these people.</P>
      <P>The Minister mentioned the drug problem and its effects.  He made a very brief reference to the greatest drug problem we have today, alcoholism. This is the &ldquo;in&rdquo; thing now. Television tells us it is the &ldquo;in&rdquo; thing to drink and, if you do not, you are a square.  It is costing £4 million a week. What could the Minister not do with that to improve the health services? Are we sweeping the problem under the carpet?  Are we ashamed of ourselves? If we are, what are we doing about it?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This is a greater problem than the drug problem we hear about and we are closing our eyes to it.  We do not <Col N="749" /> want to recognise it because so many of us are involved in it.  Many homes have been wrecked by it.  I hope the Minister for Finance will have a look at these tasty little drinks.  I often shook more holy water on my forehead than there would be alcohol in a glass, but it seems to be deadly. The Minister should consider what he might do in this respect in the coming budget.  They are grand tasty little glasses but they are dynamite.  They put people in great humour while they are in the pub but, when they go home, the home is wrecked.  We have accepted this for too long.  We would need about ten Father Matthews to come back and make us have a look at ourselves.</P>
    <P>I am disappointed that there is nothing in the Minister's speech about the treatment of alcoholics.  Are we leaving it all to Alcoholics Anonymous, who are doing great work?  The State should play its part.  Some hospitals in Dublin are geared to treat alcoholics, but have we got them throughout the country?  I am afraid we are just fiddling while Rome burns, fiddling with the whole problem.  During the Oxford debate the other day a Northern delegate said that he would not want to join the alcoholic South.  I must admit there is a lot of truth in that.  Shame on us.  The merry-go-round continues and we will not face up to it.</P>
    <P>The Department will have to take a stand.  Alcohol is a depressant.  It depresses not only the victim but also his family and all around him.  Give me the man who will take his pint and know when to stop.  I am not a pussy-foot. This is the type of man who should take a drink.  I should like to know what we intend to do to come to grips with this problem.  There is hardly a home in the country which is not affected in one way or another by it.  Are we to encourage it by doing nothing?  That is what it amounts to. We see it glorified on television.</P>
    <P>Young women are drinking.  I remember a time in my town when there was only one pub that women would go into.  All they took was a bottle of stout and they were the better for it.  They had their shawls over them and you could barely see <Col N="750" /> the glass because they had a certain shame in it.  Now we have the lounge bar, the &ldquo;in&rdquo; thing with the high stool and the music.</P>
    <P>We know of the carnage on our roads.  What is causing a lot of it?  I am not saying all of it.  If the carr bán, as we say in the west, the Garda white car, came out again at night it might sober up some people as it did before. People went home sober at 10.30 who might not have gone home until 4 a.m. when they would be &ldquo;nicely&rdquo; and would take the two sides of the road.</P>
    <P>I have referred to the hospitals in Dublin.  There is one in Kildare doing excellent work, but treatment is expensive.  People cannot afford to go into these hospitals.  Some patients should be put in and &ldquo;put in&rdquo; are the right words, because the vast majority will not admit they need treatment.  I should like the Minister to announce what he intends to do to solve this problem.  This week is dedicated to temperance.  I did not come in here to preach temperance.  I have been in bars with men at 2 o'clock in the morning&mdash;perhaps shame on me.  I did not take a drink and these men know how to take it.  Perhaps they should have been at home at that hour but they went home sober.  They were there for the &ldquo;crack&rdquo;, as we would say, and they knew how to drink.  I feel very strongly about this.</P>
    <P>When I was coming up today there was an accident in the street.  The Garda were called to the scene.  There was more damage done to the car than to anything else.  A lady had a gash in her shin.  An ambulance arrived and because she was not going into hospital her shin was not even properly disinfected.  I thought it strange that the ambulance should come when she was not going to hospital.  Something should have been done in that case.  First aid does not cost a lot.</P>
    <P>The effects of these loud, blaring, sounds described as music in dancehalls, are very dangerous.  Doctors have said that they are bound to mentally affect children.  They have been described as a drug.  By using amplifiers this music is heard all over the neighbourhood&mdash;&mdash;</P>

We will have to pay a very dear price if steps are not taken very soon to deal with it.  It can affect industry, the health of the children and the mental health of children to come.  The Minister should come out strongly on this subject on television.  I compliment him on bringing home some points, but he could not do it often enough. Five minutes later we will hear a song on television blaring at us.  One gets so much of this that it could drive one to drink.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GusHealy" hpid="Mr. Healy Mr. Healy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Healy</NameTxt>
      <P>Much has been said about the Estimate for the Health Services.  There are few, if any, motions which come before the House that create so much anxiety and interest.  The immediate reaction for many people to this Estimate is the alarming increase in the cost of the services year after year, notwithstanding the fact that people have evidence of inflation in many other walks of life.  When one sees millions of pounds being spent, one thinks of all the things which need to be done rather than the things which are being done.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I want to add my voice to those which have gone before in acknowledging the improvements which have been made possible in the health services during the last 20 years. Maybe if I reduced the number to 15 or 16 years, that would be nearer the mark.  To those of us in public life who have from time to time felt frustrated at the slow pace at which things are done, it is some consolation when we can look back and ask ourselves if anything worthwhile has happened in the last ten or 15 years. Looking at the health services one cannot but feel that a good deal has <Col N="752" /> been achieved with the resources at our command.</P>
    <P>It has been said here by the Minister's predecessor that there is no country in the world that can meet the health demands of its people. Those demands are insatiable.  There are so many facets of ailments and illnesses which need attention that one could not possibly supply all the money necessary.  As a small country we must spend wisely by allocating money properly and supervising its spending.  For that we must plan.  We must think not only of the present but also of future trends.</P>
    <P>No matter how much money we have to spend we cannot do all that needs to be done unless we can enlist a tremendous response from voluntary efforts and workers.  I have had much experience of asking for that help. Because I know the result one gets from such a response, I feel confident that if it is sought in the right way there is practically nothing one cannot get from our voluntary workers. We are blessed in that way.  Not enough is made of them.  They do not get as much publicity as others less worthy of recognition.</P>
    <P>We have the problems of restructuring the hospital services and system. The position in Cork is a very delicate one.  A good public relations service is needed there as well as the knowledge that one is doing something worthwhile.  We are dealing with institutions, some of which have been serving the community for more than 200 years.  They have given an unselfish and, to the best of their ability, a very adequate service.  This was at a time when the country was poor and few people thought of the health of those who could not afford to pay for those services.  Some of those institutions are now expected to welcome with open arms the changes felt to be necessary to ensure the advancement of the services in modern times.  That is not easy to achieve.  These institutions and their staffs, down through the years, have given a marvellous service.  Nobody could speak too highly of voluntary hospitals and institutions. Nowadays, change has come and the State, central or local government, are <Col N="753" /> paying 95 per cent of all the expenses of these institutions.  Some of the buildings are so old that they are fire hazards.  Some of them have not enough beds to be viable propositions.</P>
    <P>I am not here to defend the Fitzgerald or any other report.  In my view, the time has come when the specialist and the consultant&mdash;posts which are now regarded as imperative &mdash;will not apply for a position in a small hospital unless he is assured of a back-up service and ancillary staff. That means a bigger building and a more expensive outfit.  Eventually, it all comes down to a question of finance.</P>
    <P>I am sure any Minister for Health would like to see a super hospital, general or regional, in each county if it was warranted and if the country could afford it.  That is not even a pipe dream because the population governs what we can afford and where we can have such institutions.  It should not be done harshly or ruthlessly.  It should be explained to the people who are in the old institutions that there is still work for them to do, that their buildings are still required and that they can still contribute to the well-being of the community as they have been doing for up to 100 years.</P>
    <P>In Cork city there is one convalescent home, with about 20 beds, for women but no convalescent home for men.  The six hospitals in the city must keep those convalescing in beds that are required for acute operations and illnesses.  The ultimate aim of everybody engaged in the health services is to get the best possible results from the services at our disposal.</P>
    <P>In my view not enough emphasis is being placed on the need for children to care for their teeth.  It is understandable that if a child's teeth are bad every morsel of food that goes into the child is poisoned.  I wish somebody better qualified that I would explain to parents the effects decayed teeth have on the ears, eyes and other parts of the body.  It is imperative that of all parts of the body the mouth should be clean and healthy from the beginning.  The service we provide is only scratching the surface and that is <Col N="754" /> all it can do.  If we examined the school service we would find that we have not a proper follow-up service with the result that children are not given proper treatment.  The treatment and examination of children ceases too early in the child's life.  It should be maintained as long as the children are at school and until they know the importance of looking after their teeth. Children should be made aware that washing their teeth is as important as washing their faces.</P>
    <P>When this case was put forward the reply given was that we do not have enough dentists.  The Higher Education Authority, in the course of their report about the health of children, devoted only one paragraph to dental education.  They said the country was too small for more than one dental school.  This is absurd to anybody who knows anything about the position.  It is obvious that there was nobody available who cared to talk to this authority about the problem. Of course, I am plugging for the retention of the dental school in Cork. This school has turned out a number of dentists annually for the last 50 years.  However, because there is inadequate physical provision in the city the staff are uncertain as to their future.  The professors at that school are worried and there is an air of uncertainty.  The result is that it is not possible to replace staff who leave.</P>
    <P>The Minister referred to the regional hospital and informed us that he expects this will be opened in 1978. This hospital will cost about £8 million but on the same site there is provision for a dental hospital.  The estimates have been obtained and the schedule of accommodation is ready for this hospital but no decision has been taken.  It is only right that a dental hospital should be close to a general hospital.  The regional hospital is in the course of construction but when it has been completed and the workers have moved from the site I guarantee the House that some enlightened Minister will decide to erect the dental hospital. The work will have to start all over again and the hospital will cost at least ten times as much as it would if it was started now.  It is an absurd <Col N="755" /> situation and I ask the Minister, who has some influence in the Government, to press for a decision on this matter.  If the staff are told that a dental hospital will be erected in the not-too-distant future they will feel secure.  I am not saying that there should not be a dental hospital in Dublin but there is no site available in that city.  Of course, Dublin should have a dental hospital.  It is not possible to tackle one of the most important facets of the health service, the caring for teeth, unless there is a sufficient number of dentists.</P>
    <P>On the question of caring for handicapped children I should like to state that we are well catered for this in Cork.  The people there, like those in the rest of the country, are generous with their services and their money.  Voluntary services look after the handicapped child from the cradle to the grave.  They are subsidised by the health boards but if the State had to pay it would cost a lot of money. Nobody other than voluntary workers could carry out this work.  They are available every day and they do not count the time they put into it.  They get nothing but the satisfaction of knowing that the work they are doing is for handicapped children.</P>
    <P>Those involved in providing services for handicapped children meet regularly in order to ensure that there is no overlapping.  A great danger as far as voluntary organisations are concerned is that there would be overlapping. The organisations in Cork meet twice annually and discuss reports on the operations of the various groups.  I should like to mention that these organisations receive the utmost co-operation from the Southern Health Board.</P>
    <P>Has the Minister ever given consideration to the amount of money taken by the Revenue Commissioners from the sweepstakes fund?  A certain portion of the hospital fund is taken by the Revenue Commissioners and this seems foolish.  It is foolish to take the money from the Hospitals' Trust and then give it to the hospitals to help them make up their deficits.  If it were allowed to the Hospitals' Trust <Col N="756" /> people for the purposes of something like medical research, it would be invaluable.  We are a country that gives less to medical research in proportion to our size than do most other civilised countries.  If the miserable amount they get in revenue from each sweep was given to medical research it would make the sweepstake more palatable to the world in general and, certainly, would not do the revenue or the State any injury.</P>
    <P>I would appeal to the Minister to examine that aspect.  I wish the Minister well.  I appreciate fairly well the kind of job he has to undertake.  We could speak for days on the subject and there would still remain facets on which we could hear further.  I hope the Minister will have patience with us.  I would ask him particularly to see if he can do anything to expedite a decision with regard to the dental hospital in Cork.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Brosnan</NameTxt>
      <P>It has often occurred to me&mdash;as I am sure it has to many others&mdash;that the Tánaiste, the Minister for Health, is both fortunate and unfortunate in having had as his immediate predecessor a man of the calibre and outstanding talents of the late President Childers.  Comparisons are said to be odious but in the context of the recent death of President Childers I am afraid they are unavoidable and inevitable.  In that way the Tánaiste is certainly unlucky, particularly viewed in the aftermath of the ceremonies and the eulogies which followed the death of President Childers.  Tributes were paid to President Childers by all and sundry, tributes to his dedication, his ability, his vision and to the work which he put into whatever task, Ministry or job was assigned to him.  It was unanimously admitted, unreservedly, in fact, by the Tánaiste himself in the tribute which he paid to the late President Childers in this House that it was in the Department of Health he was most successful.  There is no doubt at all but that the late President Childers by his work left an indelible mark on the office of Minister for Health.  Not alone did he set down the programme, policies and structures for the great work he commenced, and <Col N="757" /> which the present Minister is trying to pursue, but he laid down also the structures, guidelines and patterns for future development, growth and progress.</P>
      <P>Unfortunately, I must say that the late President Childers' successor did not avail himself of the magnificent work done and the example given by his predecessor.  The original thinking and the groundwork done by President Childers were outstanding, but the present Minister failed to take full advantage of this.  Instead of the progress and development which should be forthcoming we now have a certain amount of stagnation on all sides.  In particular, we have disillusionment and frustration in many fields.  I refer in particular to the doctors and more recently to the chemists.  In his brief the Minister deals at length but not satisfactorily with his dispute with the doctors.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is extraordinary that in the same brief of about 40 pages he makes no mention at all of the dispute with the chemists, a dispute which he, his officials and the Department must have known well was brewing for the past 12 months.  One would imagine that the Minister would have learned a lesson from his dispute with the doctors, that at least he would have met the chemists and tried to avoid the pitfalls into which he fell in his dealings with the doctors.  There is no doubt that the chemists' dispute is now putting the whole health services in jeopardy.  I do not know what happened to the Minister.  Was it his inability to negotiate?  Was it his inexperience or was it his over-anxiety to please?  His colleagues in Government have shown on many occasions that they are incapable of and lacking in capacity to negotiate.  This has been demonstrated at many levels and in many fields from Ballydehob to Brussels.  I think the Tánaiste was over-anxious and over-ambitious.  I think he tried to out-Childers Childers; that he took on too much and that he bit off more than he could chew.  In particular, I think his free health services for all was certainly over-ambitious.  He cast his net too widely.  He tried to do too much without having the structures, trained <Col N="758" /> personnel and, indeed, the goodwill of all those involved.  He did not have all those prerequisites before launching into the scheme.  I think he would do well even now to study the techniques, approaches, know-how and the flair and capacity for negotiating which his predecessor displayed.</P>
    <P>Having so spoken, I should like now to refer to a few more mundane matters.  I agree completely with Deputy Coogan when he mentioned the problem of drink and alcoholism. As a person who takes a drink, a public representative for a long number of years and a lawyer, who has experience of the court, it is my opinion that drink is probably the greatest problem which we have at the moment.</P>
    <P>Deputy Coogan mentioned the high cost of drink.  I would prefer to refer to the cost of drink in relation to the damage it does to every facet of life, social, economic and health.  It is certainly responsible for broken bones as well as broken homes.  It is a disease and it is also the root cause of many other sicknesses. It is the root cause of practically most crimes, larceny, housebreaking, assaults of various kinds, including sexual assaults and fraud.  I have had experience of prosecuting and defending people where drink was very often the only element in the background of the serious crimes committed.</P>
    <P>I suppose it is appropriate that drink should be mentioned in this particular week.  Excessive drinking and alcoholism are very serious problems.  Like Deputy Coogan I am rather surprised that the Minister gave very scant attention to it in his brief. He mentioned it in the context of some advertising campaign but that is not sufficient.  It should be treated much more seriously.</P>
    <P>The Minister also mentioned that he proposes to extend the list of illnesses for which free drugs will be made available, irrespective of income. I seriously suggest to him that alcoholism should be one of those scheduled diseases.  Not alone should <Col N="759" /> drugs be freely available but treatment should also be available.  This may be expensive but that would be more than justified by the saving to property and to people by the reduction in crime.</P>
    <P>The Minister made very scant reference to drugs, which should be put on a par with drink.  I do not know much about the problem but it appears that it is something which needs more serious attention than the cursory attention which the Minister has given to it.  He has been very dilatory in introducing any legislation to deal with the matter.  He mentioned that he proposes establishing a bureau to deal with it.  I hope that next year, if he is in charge of this Estimate, that more attention will be given to the question of drugs and that not alone will the bureau have been set up but that effective legislation will have been introduced.</P>
    <P>I would like to refer to the home assistance officers and pay tribute to the work most of them do in spite of the fact that they work under appalling conditions in country areas. Some of the premises they use are completely obsolete, inadequate and in bad repair.  They do not afford any privacy whatsoever to the unfortunate people who have to visit them. Privacy is a very important factor in the work home assistance officers do. I know of places in east Cork where people have to queue up and parade themselves and their complaints to all their neighbours in the same queue. The Minister's Parliamentary Secretary can verify that there are a number of such places which are not suitable for dealing with confidential matters.  The number of people who have to resort to these places is growing.  We now have a category of people receiving benefits who were not in the habit of receiving them before this.  I know of a number of people entitled to social welfare benefits who, on account of the conditions under which they would have to make their applications to the social welfare officers, have refused to pursue their claims.</P>
    <P>I welcome the Minister's intention of providing training and employment <Col N="760" /> for the handicapped.  Deputy Healy dealt at some length with the situation in Cork.  I can assure the Minister that there is much goodwill in so far as these people are concerned on the part of industrial management in Cork.  Much good work is being done by the voluntary associations who cater for those who are handicapped physically or who are mildly mentally handicapped.  For a number of years I was chairman of a committee which was under the aegis of the old Cork health authority.  This committee dealt with the rehabilitation and training of some mildly handicapped patients in Our Lady's Hospital.  We found that most of those who received any training and who were able to go out among the public were employed in factories and in other establishments in the city.</P>
    <P>I wish the Minister well in his work. I appeal to him to consider an application that was made to him recently by the Southern Health Board to reconstitute the health advisory committee of that health board.  On a few occasions I was on deputations to the late Mr. Childers when he was Minister for Health and I approached him personally on a number of occasions about this matter.  However, he was adamant in his refusal to consider having this body reconstituted.  Earlier I made comparisons which, I said, were unavoidable, as between the present Minister and his predecessor.  However, I would be inclined to even up the comparisons if the Minister would consider sympathetically my request in relation to the reconstitution of this advisory committee.  At present the situation is that there is no advisory health body representing the southern committee of Cork County Council. Therefore, we as members of the southern committee have no say in health matters.  Indeed one might say that we are disfranchised where health matters are concerned.  In those circumstances I trust that the Minister will grant my request.</P>

      <P>At the outset I congratulate the Minister, his Parliamentary Secretary and the Department generally for the magnificent job they have done during the past 20 months. <Col N="761" /> Their performance has been most productive but in all work of a productive nature there must of necessity be some omissions.  An example of this has been the failure to make further progress on the lines suggested by the Fitzgerald Report and there has been also the delay in the printing of the Misuse of Drugs Bill.  I admire Deputy O'Malley's tenacity in having introduced the First Stage of that Bill on the 21st November but I would not laud him for his efforts because it is not much more than a blueprint of the Bill drafted by the previous Administration and that in turn was nothing more than a synopsis of the Reginald Maudling Misuse of Drugs Bill, 1972. Therefore, little credit is due to Deputy O'Malley for any ingenuity in this direction.  There are some sections of the Bill that do not appeal to me.</P>

      <P>I shall comment on it at an appropriate time.  Regarding the Minister's speech it is very heartening to know that there is an increase of 40 per cent in the health fund.  In the paragraph of his speech dealing with general hospital services, the Minister said that his objective is to set about the long-term reduction in the percentage of total expenditure devoted to hospital services and he went on to detail the ways in which he wished to expand the general medical services and to reduce the proportion spent on hospital care.  This is very well framed but it is important to realise that any improvement in medical care will result in earlier diagnosis, prolongevity of treatment and an elongated life spell.  This is the aim of a good health service but one of the factors associated with the achievement of that aim is further expenditure on hospital and diagnostic facilities, on treatment facilities and on hospital care.  Therefore, as the general care programme improves, the expenditure increases <i>pro rata</i>, if not at a higher rate.  There are two schools of thought on this. One is the Minister's and the other is that such as I have outlined.  Both <Col N="762" /> have been documented in great detail and both have merits.</P>
      <P>The Minister's approach is a sound economic one but whether it is sound medically, in the light of experience in other countries, is something that only time will tell.  I admire the Minister for having the courage to take one definite line of approach.  It is the line of approach which has the least resistance and which would give the optimum results from the contributions of all concerned in attempting to achieve the aim as expressed by the Minister.  In the long run it does not imply a reduction in the proportion of money allocated to hospital services. It can go hand in hand.  As I said earlier, if the medical health services improve, people will live longer and then there will be greater need for geriatrics and in-patient treatment and at the other end of the scale, as medical standards improve, a greater number of children will grow to maturity and be kept alive.  This will result in an increase in the number of cases of mental deficiency or retardation, spina bifida and so on.  In that way there can be greater need to have specialisation on the paediatrics sector. It is a vague general approach and I think the Minister has taken a line which I would wholeheartedly support.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>He went on then to mention the detoxification unit at Jervis Street hospital and the increase in facilities in St. Laurence's Hospital.  At the same time as he is spending money that must be spent on these hospitals there is a rationalisation programme going on on the north side of the city and on the south side of the city which will involve Jervis Street, St. Laurence's and the Mater Hospital coming together with Beaumont and Blanchardstown and forming the three major hospitals on the north side.  I am not sure if they are coming together physically or whether it will be just under one board but if it is intended that they should come together physically perhaps we could look again at the investment of money in specialist equipment in hospitals that may be out-dated in the near future. Personally, I would not like St. Laurence's Hospital to be amalgamated <Col N="763" /> with either Jervis Street or the Mater because neuro-surgery is a very specialised field and with the higher incidence of neuro-surgical accidents becomes of increasing importance.</P>
    <P>In or around 1943 land was purchased under the St. Laurence's Hospital Act on the Navan Road, quite a good acreage, and I should like to see the erection of St. Laurence's Hospital proceed with specialised treatment, diagnostic facilities and staff provided there.  Otherwise, we shall have to try to put similar units on the south side of the city and spend the same amount of money in Cork and possibly Galway and Limerick to provide this extra service.  In London there is a national hospital where all these diseases are dealt with and which provides central specialist treatment.</P>
    <P>I should also like to comment on what I consider to be the most important part of the Minister's speech.  He referred to the Fitzgerald Committee report in 1968 and the fact that there would be a tendency to concentrate hospital resources in a limited number of large centres.  Later on he said it was obviously impractical to suggest that each town in the country should have a general hospital.  This was the policy of the previous Fianna Fáil administration since 1930 when for some reason they provided a hospital in each county without regard to any population breakdown or percentage. In retrospect it represented probably nothing more than political expenditure of public funds.  Now the Minister must try to rationalise this because the fact that an area is a county does not necessarily mean that it requires a fully equipped hospital.  A disservice can be done in providing too many hospitals that cannot be provided with equipment, surgeons, physicians or gynaecologists.  When the Minister suggests therefore that a middle ground solution must be found I would be grateful if he would elaborate in his reply and confirm that this means that the Fitzgerald Report of 1968 is being jettisoned.  It does not appear that he is going to follow <Col N="764" /> the Fitzgerald Report and he is certainly not going to continue with the old Fianna Fáil method.  He must find a harmonious solution in between, I should like the Minister to amplify his ideas on this point because he may not realise the significance that different interpreters like myself would apply to such statements.</P>
    <P>The Minister says that Comhairle na nOspidéal have set up a special committee to examine the situation in the large urban areas.  This seems to be a duplication of what Dr. Fitzgerald did and could be put on the long finger even though the Cork results have come in.  Limerick have not agreed on a report as yet.  One must admire the tenacity of the Minister having regard to the amount of consultation in which he has involved himself here with due regard to the amount of work done by the Fitzgerald Committee and with regard to the fact that many members of Comhairle na nOspidéal were also members of the Fitzgerald Committee.</P>
    <P>I must congratulate the Minister on including in the list of long-term illnesses Parkinsonism, acute leukaemia, muscular dystrophies and multiple sclerosis and on his observation that this does not include all such illnesses.  But I would like him to give consideration to coronary artery disease, including post-cardiac conditions, terminal cancer patients, cardiovascular accidents and to investigate further the possibility in regard to asthmatics and people who suffer from rheumatism and to give consideration to ulcerous colitis which is a chronic type of illness that is now found to be very common in general practice.  I think that nearly 75 per cent of the child-bearing females in this country suffer from it to some extent and while they can get treatment while they are pregnant and immediately after childbirth, when it gives them trouble later the expense involved is considerable and they are not covered for it.</P>
    <P>In concluding, I should like to mention the need for a maternity hospital to cover the north city.  I know that the Rotunda Hospital is <Col N="765" /> taking over the Drumcondra Hospital but we should have a maternity hospital something similar to the Coombe Hospital because the north side of the city is expanding very rapidly.  The majority of such hospitals, St. Kevin's, The Coombe, Holles Street, Dún Laoghaire and Mount Carmel are all <Col N="766" /> on the south side and the Rotunda is the only one on the north side.</P>
    <P>Debate adjourned.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Defence the weekly pay increase applicable to non-craftsmen civilian employees in the Department of Defence on the operative dates mentioned in the reply to Question No. 226 of 14th November, 1974; and the notional figure applicable in each case which determines the substitution amount.</P>

      <P>It is assumed that the information sought regarding &ldquo;the notional figure applicable in each case which determines the substitution amount&rdquo; refers to the notional basic pay on which the first phase increase under the Employer-Trade Union National Agreement, 1974 is calculated in cases where, in accordance with Clause 3 (f) of that Agreement, the first phase increase was substituted for the second phase of the 1972 National Agreement.  The information sought by the Deputy has been compiled on this assumption and is shown in the table beneath.  In cases where substitution was not applicable, i.e. where the second phase of the 1972 National Agreement was applied prior to 1st April 1974, this is indicated in the table.</P>

      <P>The information supplied with the application in this case was incomplete.  The applicant was requested on two occasions to submit the required information but he failed to do so.  However, as the house has since been completed, a special inspection was arranged and arrangements have now been made for the early allocation and payment of a grant of £300.</P>
