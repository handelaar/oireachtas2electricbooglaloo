    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Minister for Finance (Mr. R. Ryan) Richie Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. R. Ryan)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move:</P>
      <P>That Dáil Éireann approves the following Order in draft:&mdash;</P>
      <P>Trustee (Authorised Investments) Order, 1974,</P>
      <P>a copy of which Order in draft has been laid before the House.</P>
      <P>The Trustee (Authorised Investments) Act, 1958, defines the investments in which trustees may invest trust funds unless expressly forbidden by the instrument, if any, creating the trust.</P>
      <P>The Minister for Finance may vary the authorised investments by order. The primary qualification for trustee investments is that they should be secure, and, subject to this, that they should give a favourable income to the life tenant.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The purpose of the order before the House for approval, is to add Bank of Ireland loan stock 1991-96 to the list of trustee authorised investments. The loan stock was issued to raise additional capital to provide for the future growth of the bank.  It will be repayable at par between 31st March, 1991, and 31st March, 1996.  In addition to interest at 10 per cent per annum, it carries subscription rights to capital stock of the Bank of Ireland. The capital stock of the bank has been a trustee security here and in Britain for over a century and the 7 per cent loan stock 1986-91 issued by the bank in 1966 was added to the list of trustee investments by the Trustee (Authorised Investments) Order, 1967 (S.I. No. 285 of 1967).  The new loan stock is quoted on the stock exchange and I am satisfied that it is a suitable stock for <Col N="1619" /> addition to the authorised trustee investments in this country.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Finance is obliged under the Act to consult with the following persons in regard to the terms of any order he proposes to make to vary the list of authorised investments &mdash;a judge of the High Court nominated by the Chief Justice, the Governor of the Central Bank, the Public Trustee, the Chairman of the Irish Banks' Standing Committee, the President of the Incorporated Law Society of Ireland and the President of the Stock Exchange (Irish).  I have consulted these persons and they have welcomed the proposal and raised no objections to the proposed order.</P>
    <P>As Deputies may be aware, I am considering some further widening of the investment powers of trustees. There is a strong body of opinion in favour of adding building societies to the list.  I hope to reach agreement with the Irish Building Societies Association in the near future on suitable qualifying conditions.  The other main area where change is desirable concerns banks authorised to accept trust funds on deposit.  Since the 1958 Act was passed there has been a considerable increase in the number of banking institutions operating here and there is now in force a comprehensive system of bank licensing and supervision under the aegis of the Central Bank.  I am satisfied that the list of banks should be widened subject to a suitable arrangement being worked out to take account of the position of the Central Bank as the banking supervisory authority.</P>
    <P>It is my intention also to have a more wide-ranging review of the operation of the 1958 Act to see if there is a need for amending legislation.  This will take some time.  I would point out to the House, however, that the Act does not affect trustees where the trust deed specifically provides wider powers than those set out in the Act. I understand that this is now the general practice.  Charity trusts also are covered by separate legislation&mdash; the Charities Acts.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1620" /> I am satisfied that the Bank of Ireland loan stock is a suitable security to be added to the list of authorised investments and that it is desirable that trustees should have power to invest trust funds in it.  I, therefore, commend the motion for the approval of the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>We on this side of the House are satisfied that the Bank of Ireland loan is a suitable security to be added to the list of authorised investments, and for that reason we are supporting this motion by the Minister for Finance.  There are, however, one or two general observations I would like to make.</P>
      <P>I note that the Minister refers, as he has referred previously, to the proposal to extend trustee status to Irish building societies.  We on this side have been urging this for some time, and I am somewhat disappointed that the negotiations to which the Minister refers have not yet been completed.  All I can do at the moment is to urge the Minister to do everything within his power to complete those negotiations as fast as possible.  While it is not by any means the complete answer, it would be of assistance in providing a greater flow of funds to building societies, and that, of course, is a very necessary development at this time.  I do not want to develop that theme, because it might well be irrelevant to the matter before us.</P>
      <P>While we are satisfied that the Bank of Ireland loan stock is a suitable security to be added to the list of authorised investments&mdash;indeed, just as suitable as any other which is already on the list&mdash;there is no doubt that at present the basic concept behind trustee securities is threatened, to say the least.  The Minister said:</P>
      <P>The primary qualification for trustee investments is that they should be secure, and, subject to this, that they should give a favourable income to the life tenant.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Having regard to the raging inflation and to the disastrous fall in the value of virtually all kinds of securities, it is difficult to say that any security now meets that requirement; in so far as <Col N="1621" /> any security does, the Bank of Ireland loan stock certainly will do so. If things continue as they are going at the moment, it may be necessary to look again at the whole concept of authorised trustee securities.  We have seen, fortunately not in this country but in Britain, a number of what were described as fringe banks, substantial institutions, in considerable difficulties and saved only by the intervention of larger institutions, sometimes State institutions.  The return on investment from most securities does not keep pace with inflation.  For that reason, if the situation continues as it has been going it may be necessary to take another look at the basic concept of trustee securities.  However, that is not a matter I could expect the Minister to do across the floor of the House today.</P>
    <P>I want to draw his attention to the fact that he ought to be keeping an eye on this matter if present arrangements continue.  There is no reason why the House should not agree to include the Bank of Ireland loan stock referred to in this proposed order.  I repeat it is not enough for us to continue simply adding suitable securities to that list because the whole basic concept in the light of the present financial and economic situation is out of date and may be misleading in suggesting that in authorised trustee securities there is a degree of security and return of investment which is not there, a degree that was there in the past but which is not there now in regard to income. Indeed, it is secure in the sense that if one waits for redemption with, say, the Bank of Ireland or similar bodies whose securities are included in this list, of course, the investment can be redeemed at cost.</P>
    <P>In the meantime the value of the trustee investments we envisage here will probably be below par in many cases, not necessarily in this case, which are included in the list.  In regard to national loans, the value is way below par.  Therefore, until redemption, to talk of security in authorised investments may be misleading and as I have already said for that reason it may be necessary to take a look at the whole situation. <Col N="1622" /> Given that the system of trustee authorised investments continues, there is no reason why the House should not agree wholeheartedly to the inclusion of the Bank of Ireland loan stock.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnGrattanEsmonde" hpid="Mr. Esmonde Mr. Esmonde">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Esmonde</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome this move by the Minister for Finance.  It seems to indicate the trend in the thinking abroad that one does not necessarily invest in something with a fixed coupon title to it and that there are better prospects for those people who want to get involved in the capital of an enterprise such as the Bank of Ireland which is as sound as any financial institution in the world.  I appreciate what Deputy Colley said about inflation. Fixed interest coupons are an irrelevant aspect with the type of inflation we have in the western world.</P>
      <P>I should like to discuss building societies.  If these societies are to be brought into the category of trustee investments and considered as a depository of trustee moneys, it is only right that they should be brought under the control of the aegis of the Central Bank like any other banking or financial institution.  The majority of financial institutions in this country are controlled.  There are arguments for and against this.  We have seen rather traumatic times recently in reference to the situation of building societies.  They do not have any right or claim to be in a privileged position in that regard. There may be other formulae for controlling building societies that emanate from the Department of Industry and Commerce under the Registrar of Friendly Societies and Provident Societies, but I do not think that that is sufficient in this day and age.  I feel very strongly that building societies should be brought under the same control as banks.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should like to deal with some of the difficulties which lawyers experience when dealing with funds loaned by building societies.  These societies were established as small investment co-operative clubs to provide a certain service for the not well off sections of our society.  The character and nature of these societies have greatly changed over the years.  One of the difficulties experienced by lawyers is the fact that <Col N="1623" /> these societies were prohibited by Act of Parliament from advancing moneys where there was a prior charge.  In other words, they could not advance money on security of property where there was a prior charge.  This has given rise to considerable difficulties where people tender their property and documents of title as security for a building society loan and the lawyer for the society must turn down the application on the ground until the charge, be it large or small, has been released and cleared for the title.  This has given rise to very unrealistic situations. The section which gives this trouble is section 13 of the Building Societies Act, 1896.  The only charge allowed, because there is a decision to that effect, is a Land Commission annuity.</P>
    <P>Latent charges in reference to estate and succession duties have given rise to considerable difficulties and congestion in the pipeline for money being advanced by building societies.  I am speaking from experience as I had the duty of advising one of our larger building societies on this matter.</P>
    <P>It has been a traumatic experience for a young married couple who have bridging finance to suddenly find some wretched charge or annuity that is fully indemnified by other property and they cannot get the loan because the Act specifically prohibts a building society from giving money on that property.  As the Minister is discussing building societies and trustee investments this is an opportune moment to look at this very needy reform.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Minister for Finance (Mr. R. Ryan) Richie Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. R. Ryan)</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to thank the House for the manner in which they received my recommendation and to comment briefly on the two topics which have arisen in the course of the debate.  I want to assure the House that as far as I am concerned there is no delay whatsoever in completing the necessary steps to make building societies a trustee security but the law and prudence require consultations with a number of people, not merely <Col N="1624" /> building societies but also the Central Bank and the judiciary.</P>
      <P>Several months ago we submitted to the building societies what were considered to be the rules which should be observed by them before they could enjoy trustee status.  These rules are such as to protect the public interest, which must be paramount as far as any trustee investment is concerned. The rules are such that some of the more recent arrivals on the building society scene may not be able to conform with them but that need not cause any public worry.  In fact, I think it might be very much to the public good if there was a tidying up of the whole building society situation.</P>
      <P>That will have to be dealt with primarily through legislation which the Minister for Local Government will shortly be promoting in the House, in the form of the Building Societies Bill.  In the meantime, as long as the disciplines necessary to protect the public interest are observed by building societies, and they indicate their willingness to observe them, then we will be able to confer trustee status on them which should make them a more attractive investment than they are at the moment.  They are a very attractive investment, having regard to the fact that a person will always be able to recover any money lodged with them at par.  They might be regarded as even more attractive than trustee investment and some of the other investments which Deputy Colley correctly pointed out might not be in some cases secured against loss in these traumatic days, to use Deputy Esmonde's words, in which we now live.</P>
      <P>The great thing about the stock exchange is that it never remains the same and a period of bear conduct is invariably replaced by foolish conduct and <i>vice versa.</i>  We should take some confidence out of the fact that the Irish Stock Exchange has behaved more sensibly than stock exchanges elsewhere including some of the major financial markets in the world.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>That would not be very difficult.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Col N="1625" />
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>It would not.  We all know how much stock exchanges react. They react even more irresponsibily at times than almost any other sector of the community.  They either are suffering from excess of depression or excess of optimism.  The Irish Stock Exchange has maintained quite a degree of equilbrium in very difficult times and it is very much to its credit that it has done so.  This particular investment on which we are seeking to have trustee status conferred is one which, as Deputies generally accept, is deserving of that status and of full public confidence.</P>
      <P>The points raised by Deputy Esmonde will fall to be dealt with in the Building Societies Bill rather than under any of the immediate responsibilities of the Minister for Finance but I want to assure him that the provisions in relation to trustee status will require the consent of the Minister for Finance to the interest rates which they offer and charge and will also require that he lay down the liquidity ratios which have to be observed.  I am sure these will be found to be sensible.  If they have to be modified, in accordance with disciplines of the money market at any time this can certainly be done.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Needless to say, the Minister for Finance will, in the course of coming to decisions in this matter, be consulting with the Central Bank so it will ensure that the whole investment sector in this country will be properly supervised in the public interest.  This can be done in a way which will restore the degree of confidence which the building society movement deserves. Deputy Esmonde was quite right in saying that building societies are now entirely different from what they started out to be.  They were at one time mutual benefit societies with a comparatively small number of people who collected their own savings together and lent them out to members. Nowadays they are like any other money agency competing against other financial agencies for money in the public market and then redistributing it again on a public basis, certainly not on a mutual trust basis which was the norm when the building society movement was originally founded.  They are <Col N="1626" /> playing a very useful part in collecting money in our community and investing it in one of the most necessary investments for the betterment of our society, that is in housing.  The steps we propose taking will ensure there will be public confidence in this highly desirable activity.</P>

    <P>Question again proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMoore" hpid="Mr. Moore Mr. Moore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moore</NameTxt>
      <P>When speaking on this Bill last week I asked what was wrong with CIE.  Each year we come here to vote bigger and bigger subsidies for them.  Four years ago the loss was £3 million and now we are voting £11 million in order to keep this concern going.  It looks as if we will have to do this every year if we want to keep CIE in being.  I do not accept that the management or staff of CIE are any less competent than other semi-State companies.  One must examine the question of whether the country is too small for CIE or whether CIE are too big for the country. A rail system in any country consists of thousands of miles of track but we have not got a densely populated country such as they have in the United Kingdom and on the Continent and there is less potential passenger traffic for CIE.  However, they must maintain tracks, the mainline tracks, stations and staff.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>CIE must be looked at within the context of the European Economic Community and in order to keep viable they have to look for an expansion of their services outside the country.  They are doing it at the moment with their tours and ferries but they have got to look east and see how they can expand their services there in order to collect sufficient revenue to subsidise the whole concern.  They cannot remain financially static.  They will have to have an ever-expanding outlook unless the Oireachtas is prepared to go ahead every year voting bigger and bigger sums to them.  That is not an attractive proposition.  I am sure the management <Col N="1627" /> of CIE would not accept this and I believe the Dáil would have to ask some very critical questions about what we would do with this concern.</P>
    <P>The Minister in an interjection said that 66 per cent of CIE's revenue went on wages.  I do not doubt what the Minister says but it seems an amazingly high percentage.  I intend to quote figures later which will not cast doubt on the Minister's statement but which will bring us down to earth when we realise the smallness of some of the salaries and wages paid and also the frightful pension position.</P>
    <P>I think this could all be ungraded. This being a particularly sensitive semi-State concern we should have, naturally, a management of professional people; but we should also enlarge the board to include representatives of the trade unions and the travelling public by having somebody from, say, the Consumers' Association. In that way we would get a broader look at the problems, the professional people on the board would be made more aware of the feelings of the public regarding the services and the trade unions would become more aware of the problems facing any concern involving so many trade unions.</P>
    <P>If the Minister appointed such a board he would find many people willing and competent to serve on it.  We should try anything rather than go on paying ever-mounting subsidies, which is not a healthy sign in any concern. We demand a service from CIE and in many cases we are not getting it. Therefore, we have a duty in this House to try to say where we see the faults and how these might be corrected.</P>
    <P>We had a very prolonged strike this year in CIE which caused grave loss of revenue to the management and resulted in grave losses in wages and salaries, particularly wages, to those involved.  The public took a very serious view of the whole matter and the Minister for Labour has set up an inquiry into this strike.  Strikes do not happen; they are caused by something <Col N="1628" /> and there must be some reason why CIE seems so prone to strikes.  There are rumours of another strike threat in a section of the bus service at present.  We might therefore consider why there is so much unrest among the personnel, particularly in the bus section, and why this city particularly can have its bus services disrupted so frequently.</P>
    <P>I have been speaking to some of those who man the buses and work in different capacities for CIE.  They have listed certain grievances which I accept as being genuine complaints because, for a man to drive a bus through the traffic of any city, and particularly Dublin, is a very onerous and tiring task.  I have not seen figures regarding drivers' health but I imagine that the incidence of illness is very high.  If, in these days of higher employment rates, CIE finds it difficult to recruit bus drivers this must bring home to the management that there is something wrong in that section.  I am also told that the condition of the vehicles leaves much to be desired and that is something that must be corrected right away.</P>
    <P>When a person has worked for many years he should be able to look forward to having a decent pension but this is not so in CIE.  The top pension I see on a list I have been given appears to be £7.50 a week for life; or, if a man wants to cut that short, he could have an increased sum for a small number of years and his widow would also get a gratuity provided he dies within five years of retirement. That seems to be a sort of penal clause because naturally a man wants to live but in this case he must die within five years of retiring or else there will be no lump sum.  These are annoying things.</P>
    <P>The pension for women is far worse. For instance, a woman who has worked all her life in CIE would, on retirement, get a weekly pension of £2.75 for life or she could opt for a ten year payment of £2.90 and afterwards get £2.53.  Can one imagine what a person could do with a pension of £2.53 a week today?  I presume she would have a State pension but she would have paid for that.  If there is <Col N="1629" /> something wrong with the industrial relations in CIE, and there is, I suggest that the personnel department examine the possibility of introducing an improved pension scheme, which I am sure could be negotiated with the unions.  If, instead of talking of industrial relations we spoke of human relations we might have a happier set of workers in CIE with a much better service generally being given to the public.</P>
    <P>I hope that when the Minister for Labour, when he is inquiring into the recent CIE bus strike, will probe the pension scheme there.  CIE have 20,000 employees among whom are many women who do manual work. Of the company's entire revenue, 66 per cent goes to wages and salaries and I note from the 1972 report that the maximum wage paid to a woman is £11.75 per week.  That is not a wage that will attract the best employees and I am sure that although they have got the benefits of interim national wage agreements, because of inflation the value of their wages is still far below standard.  This is something the management will have to remedy quickly if there is to be a satisfied staff and consequently an efficient service.</P>
    <P>On the Dublin scene, I suggest CIE's activities should not be left entirely to the Department of Transport and Power.  Other Departments, such as Local Government and Finance, are indirectly or directly involved. CIE have been examining the situation <i>vis-á-vis</i> planned new motorways in the Dublin area and there has been talk about the laying down of underground railways to ease city traffic.  I doubt if the latter proposition will ever come to anything, whether the population growth would justify it or the massive capital input would be worthwhile.</P>
    <P>In any case, traffic patterns in Dublin will change enormously in the near future and it is vital that CIE should not be inhibited through the interests of the two local authorities &mdash;the corporation and county council &mdash;and by the requirements of the Garda Commissioner.  It will become more and more necessary that there <Col N="1630" /> be co-ordination between all these bodies so that CIE will be enabled to give a good city public transport system in the new road pattern.  This co-ordination between the authorities concerned and CIE will also be necessary in cities like Cork, Limerick and Galway.</P>
    <P>This reminds me of the position in regard to the old Harcourt Street railway line.  Parts of it have now been sold; otherwise it could have been the site for a motorway or a busway.  In any case, it should be possible to provide some sort of CIE terminus at Harcourt Street from and to which suburban bus services could operate, thus easing the volume of traffic on the city perimeter.</P>
    <P>All of these things, I suggest, render it desirable that there should be an expanded CIE board of management. Ordinary people may think managing a body like CIE is a simple matter.  That is far from being the case.  There are many complex aspects to be considered, one of them being whether the public will accept the continuing necessity to subsidise CIE from taxation and at the same time have fares increased from year to year.  In four years CIE's losses have risen from £3 million to £14 million. We will find, following that pattern, that in six months the £11 million we are now voting to the company will have to be augmented by a considerable further sum.</P>
    <P>People may ask why there cannot be economies.  Economies generally mean a poorer service and this is not acceptable to the public who through taxation and higher fares have already been paying far too much for public transport.  We must remember that the vast majority of the public do not own motor cars and have to rely on CIE services, and one of these days increased subventions by the public by way of taxation and fares will cause them to cry &ldquo;halt&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>One of the strange contradictions of modern times is that as the country gets more prosperous the burden of travel increases.  In Dublin in the past few years we have found that some of the biggest industries have moved to the suburbs, to places like <Col N="1631" /> Tallaght on the south-west and Kilbarrack and Coolock on the north side. Unfortunately, we have not got such a perfect society that one can offer a man a house near his job.  So, he has to pay increased bus fares in order to get to his employment.  On my route the fare is 9p for a very short run into the city.  A man may have to travel from the south side to the centre and then to the north-side or to Tallaght.  The bus fares come out of the man's wages and that may represent a real problem for a family man.  Unfortunately, employment is not so plentiful that a man can choose a job. If his firm decide in the interest of efficiency to move out from a traffic choked city the man may be asked to pay CIE twice, namely, in taxation to provide a subsidy and through increased bus fares.</P>
    <P>I would ask the Minister to assure the House that an increase in bus fares will not be allowed.  This may not come under the Minister's direct responsibility. It is the responsibility of his colleague the Minister for Industry and Commerce.  A decision must be made that CIE are to be subsidised, as they are, and that lower paid workers will not be asked to pay twice, will not be penalised by having to pay increased bus fares.</P>
    <P>There is sufficient expertise in the Department to devise a system whereby persons who travel over certain distances to work will pay what used be called the workman's fare.  This system is in existence in Britain and other countries but not here.  The losses in the British transport system are not less than ours in proportion to size.  If we are to have a reasonable transport system and equitable distribution of paying the cost we must stop assuming that either all our people have cars&mdash;they have not&mdash;or that they are well able to pay the higher fares.  It may well be that a man will decide that it is not worthwhile to keep a job in the outer suburbs of the city if he has to pay ever-rising prices for inadequate bus services.  In principle I support national pay agreements.  They are the best thing for people.  We have to ensure that they are not eroded by <Col N="1632" /> increasing bus fares which penalise the energetic man who wants to rear his family by his own effort and who takes a job in the outer suburbs of a city and is then compelled to pay high bus fares.</P>
    <P>It may be suggested that the subsidy helps to keep bus fares down.  I suspect that there has been some little collusion between the Government and CIE in the matter of the subsidy. We know that CIE could do with a much larger subsidy but has there been any promise given that when we vote this money to CIE, which will fall short of their needs, increased bus fares will make up the deficit or will there be a curtailment of services which would not be acceptable?  It is an easy way out to curtail services. We are asking for a national transport system which will meet our needs. We are a reasonable people.  We do not always protest when there are delays in transport services but the time has come when big decisions on this matter must be made.</P>
    <P>I have already suggested that the day may come when bus services like water supplies will be free inasmuch as they will be paid for by taxation. The city streets are choked every morning and evening with motorcars carrying one or two passengers and the unfortunate bus driver has to take his juggernaut of a bus through the streets.  The bus may hold 70 persons who want to get home or to get to work.  Some inducement must be held out to the motorist not to bring his car into the city.  I am against any compulsion in this matter but I would suggest that the bus service should be made so attractive that the motorist would prefer to use it.  It is a chicken and egg situation.  People buy cars in order to get to their business because the bus service is so bad.  Every car on the street helps to create traffic chaos.</P>
    <P>The Government and CIE should consider how CIE should be financed. There should be an end to this stop-go business of filling a gap in CIE revenue by an annual subsidy.  It makes one rather cynical as to our ability to see ahead when one remembers the days when legislation was passed by this House which implied that CIE must pay their own way &ldquo;or <Col N="1633" /> else&rdquo;.  We never asked what the &ldquo;or else&rdquo; meant because we dared not. We realise that CIE must be maintained.</P>
    <P>There are many ways by which CIE could increase their revenue.  They could expand outside the country, which is not unusual.  In fact, they have started already and I commend them for their efforts in this respect but they could go much further.</P>
    <P>When peace returns to the north-eastern part of the country and when we have an upsurge in the tourist industry CIE will be much better off. We should turn the present situation to some good.  Now that tourists are not very plentiful the CIE management should plan how they might be attracted here in more normal times.</P>
    <P>Perhaps CIE are indulging in too many activities.  It may be said that their job is only one dealing with transport but I do not agree.  They have made commendable attempts to enlarge the scope of the organisation and in some cases it has paid dividends. However, they are not rethinking their policies sufficiently to ensure that this will be the last time the Dáil will have to spend time and money in subsidising them.  The pattern in the last few years has been that it is nearly automatic that CIE will ask for more money each year.</P>
    <P>It has been suggested that private enterprise should be given a chance of providing a public service but such firms would not attempt to run an organisation like CIE.  Naturally private enterprise will only consider a venture that gives promise of a profit.  I do not see anything wrong in that but we must accept the fact that CIE in running the bus, train and haulage services must pay the drivers, conductors and other workers the full trade union rates.  While it is possible that in some sectors private enterprise could do some of the work of CIE at a cheaper rate, the employees would suffer because they would not get the same rates or have the same conditions that obtain in CIE.  I have mentioned that the conditions of some of the personnel serving on the buses in Dublin are not what might be called a bed of roses but how much worse would it be if <Col N="1634" /> private enterprise were given the chance of running the bus services? Some of us recall when there were about ten different companies running a bus service in the city.  I do not know if we had an efficient service then but the Government of the day decided to amalgamate all the services. At least we have a more stable system but we are paying dearly for it.</P>
    <P>During the years CIE have brought in many consultants to advise on what should be done but nobody has come up with a solution to the problems and nobody ever will.  The whole pattern of public transport throughout the world is one of constant problems. Some countries have succeeded better than we have but, at the same time, I do not think there is any transport authority in the world paying its way without State subvention.  We must face the fact that CIE will never become a profitable concern but we object to being asked to pay through taxation for the very existence of the company.</P>
    <P>There has been much criticism of CIE management.  However, it is very easy to criticise management, just as it is easy to criticise politicians. Probably there is a grain of truth in the criticism but the full picture showing the shortcomings and the virtues of CIE and politicians is never given.  I should like the Minister to tell us his views on the future of CIE and to let us know if the Government have any proposals on the matter.  In this Estimate we are giving CIE more that £11 million and it would be nice to hear from the Minister that next year things will be better.  However, I do not think he will be able to give us that assurance and I am sure that next year the House will have to deal with this matter once again.</P>
    <P>The time has come to look at CIE in a new light.  We must start first with the management which must be enlarged to take in other interests besides professional men.  I appreciate the Government have appointed outsiders to the board but today we cannot ignore the voice of the people who use CIE services.  Let us try to make it a national body; in this context I mean a representative body where <Col N="1635" /> matters ranging from pension schemes to industrial relations may be discussed. We had a nine-weeks' strike not long ago; it was not a case of who does what but rather it was a struggle with the unions.  In my view, and this is shared by many others, there are too many unions in CIE.  At the moment the House is in the process of considering legislation regarding trade union amalgamation and I hope this will offer some hope to the unions to try to have one big union and thus realise the aim of one of the founders of the movement.  If we had such a situation the men and women trade unionists would be in a far stronger position and the management would be in a better position when negotiating. In addition, passengers would not have been deprived of a bus service for nine weeks and the men involved in the strike would not have had to exist on a starvation income while they fought a battle in which they believed.</P>
    <P>With the new board there could be a much fairer deal given to the general public and to the staff of CIE.  Perhaps the personnel department would examine many of the minor details.  Transport employees in Ireland and Britain are given what are called &ldquo;privilege tickets&rdquo; for free travel on holidays. In Ireland certain categories are given free or partly free travel in the EEC. It is a great attraction but certain people like busmen are denied this. Those are small things perhaps but they are the sort of irritants that build up and result in strikes which cause hardship to the people involved and to the general public and a loss of revenue to the company.</P>
    <P>If I were asked to state priorities I would say a beginning should be made in the personnel department to probe the question of what causes strikes.  I would then suggest that CIE should see how they can expand their business. They have certain monopolies. They claim they have not got enough and this may be true but they have an opportunity, under the new management, of coming straight to the public and telling them what they want and telling the Government what they want.  Let us have a straightforward deal on the future of CIE.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1636" /> With 20,000 employees it is a very important factor in our economy.  We cannot afford to have an inefficient transport service.  Competition is increasing every day from EEC countries. Our system must at least match theirs.  We must encourage CIE to expand rather than cut their services. It is only in expansion that there will be any hope for CIE.  If they cut back on their services they are not doing the job for which they were put there.</P>
    <P>I hope some of the things I have said will bear fruit.  Certainly CIE must change their tactics and the Government should prepare a proper transport plan embracing CIE, the Department of Local Government in so far as roads are concerned, the Department of Finance and even the Department of Justice which controls the Garda&mdash;the Garda being the traffic authority.  We should get all those together plus representatives of the travelling public.  They have as much right to be on the board as any other person there.  No man would speak as plainly as the Dublin bus traveller, who spends half an hour waiting at a bus stop on a wet winter evening, if somebody asked him what is wrong with CIE.</P>
    <P>The Government, of course, have greater power than any of the other bodies to bring about a change.  I hope the Minister will tell us what the Government intend to do.  I hope he will tell us too that having voted this money as a subsidy to CIE we will not be asked by his colleague, the Minister for Industry and Commerce, to sanction another increase in bus fares this year.  However, reading the background to the subsidy and bearing in mind the growing rate of inflation I fear CIE's next subsidy may come from the travelling public.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MauriceEDockrell" hpid="Mr. M.E. Dockrell Mr. M.E. Dockrell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M.E. Dockrell</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to congratulate the Minister and the Government generally on their courage in introducing this Bill because an extra expenditure of £11 million at a time like this is something no Government could contemplate lightly or with any degree of pleasure.  Yet in the sorry history of CIE down through the years it has become increasingly <Col N="1637" /> necessary to rescue it from what really are the effects of the invention and the spread of the internal combustion engine.  That, in a nutshell, is what is facing every railway in the world and has closed down many of them. We have had to close down branch lines and all over Europe the same thing has happened.  The work which was done so efficiently by small branch lines in their day is now being carried out to a greater or lesser degree of efficiency by buses.</P>
      <P>Large quantities of commercial goods used be carried by CIE. Now they are carried by the operating fleets of the firms concerned. They can in many cases do it more cheaply&mdash;perhaps not what appear superficially to be cheaper but cheaper in the sense that they can supply a service which a company like CIE would find it very difficult to emulate. They cannot do the same with their national spread of vehicles as a firm can do concentrating on carrying certain types of goods on varied local distribution basis no matter how far it may be from the manufacturing or distributing centre of the firm concerned.</P>
      <P>That is very much at the root of the trouble of CIE and that is echoed by every major railway in the world unless because of the poverty of the country concerned the people have not been able to make full use of the motor car or motor lorry.  That is the great difficulty and it seems to me to be almost insurmountable.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Moore in his good and constructive speech did not attempt to attack the Minister on this.  Of course, he could not because the Fianna Fáil Government were unable to solve the CIE problem and sometimes, in the course of their long periods in Government, they did things which we did not think were wise.  Certainly I did not think they were wise and I do not think time has shown the wisdom of some of the things they did.  Years ago they took over the tramway company which was operating very successfully. I admit there were not as many motor cars in the city at that time, but the trams were superb vehicles. They could carry very large numbers <Col N="1638" /> of passengers.  They were powerful. They were cumbersome and they were slow, but there might have been a further use for them had they been left on our streets.  They ran on electricity. They were replaced by buses, more convenient admittedly for the public but also more expensive.  They could not carry the people as efficiently as the trams did.  When the trams were on the streets one never saw long queues waiting for transport. Today one sees nothing but long, long queues.  Stand at the top of Dawson Street&mdash;it happens in other streets too but it seems to have a greater impact in Dawson Street&mdash;and one sees long queues waiting for transport out of the city.  Then suddenly a cavalcade of buses turns the corner at Nassau Street, at least three of which will be for the same destination.  That may not necessarily be a fault, but it is one of the defects in the system today.</P>
    <P>I am not advocating going back to the trams though I believe it was a mistake to do away with them.  They were taken off the streets just before World War II and, whilst we had our own electricity, it was increasingly difficult to get oil or petrol.  The same situation exists today.  Not everybody thought that the step taken by the Government at the time was a good step.  I believe the trams could have continued in operation for many years. Trolley cars operate in many cities on the Continent and they seem to be fairly efficient.  They certainly handle large numbers of people and one does not see in these continental cities queues waiting for transport, though trolley cars create traffic problems of their own.</P>
    <P>The point I want to make is that there is no royal road to the solution of this problem.  That is something no politician likes to hear.  The Opposition like to thunder at the Government and say that if the Government did such and such there would be no problem.  That very rarely is true.  We may blame CIE for all sorts of things. We may blame labour.  Labour can create very great difficulties through inter-union squabbling and fighting and the public can be held up unnecessarily to ransom, extremely <Col N="1639" /> cruelly; this is something that would not be tolerated from another body in a trade union.  Anything that helps to ease difficulties between unions or between union and management should have the support of Members on both sides of this House.</P>
    <P>CIE do their best to cope with the situation.  One of the difficulties is that people try to use a bus as they would a taxi or a private car.  Free transport for senior citizens is a very good idea but our senior citizens are not without their own little methods of using the buses.  I was in London within the last six months and on to the bus got a whole crowd of people who produced their cards.  The bus conductor told me he was pestered with these people because they used the bus in the same way as they would use a taxi.  He said that sometimes they travelled only as far as the next stop, a distance of 50 or possibly 100 yards.  Others were apt to go for long trips and he said: &ldquo;We find that regular passengers going to work, especially at lunch time, getting to lunch and back to offices and so on, find great difficulty.&rdquo;  He was humorous about it.  He did not think there was very much one could do about it, but sometimes it was a factor in overcrowding buses.  I merely mention this as one of the difficulties.  Not for one moment do I think that the solution lies in taking the free transport cards away from certain categories of elderly people, or anything like that. I mention it only because it is one of the difficulties with which a transport company have to contend. The personnel wish to be kind to the elderly, and are kind to the elderly, and they wish to do their duty in trying to get workmen back to their factories or to what I might call their lawful occasions during rush hours.</P>
    <P>This subject is very complex. Essentially it has arisen through our own inventiveness as human beings with the invention of the internal combustion engine.  Our city streets were not designed for this vast movement of traffic, of people in cars and in buses.  Except from a health point <Col N="1640" /> of view, I do not suggest that we should do what I saw in a South American city, the city of San Paulo in Brazil.  They have an enormous traffic problem.  There are vast roads in and out of the city.  They have fly-overs.  There seemed to be millions of people walking about the streets. They have a very beautiful climate which we have not got.  For instance, today nobody would walk very far in the rain for sheer pleasure.  It might do their health a great deal of good. That does not refer to people who have to get into work in the morning and are going home tired in the evening.  Those are the people we think of.  Those are the times when we have the difficulties.</P>
    <P>We must keep plugging along. Dublin Corporation must do their bit. I do not think that the corporation and the local authorities have done all they should in widening corners and widening streets to ease the flow of traffic.  I see traffic bunching up in the centre of the city.  An underground tunnel would do away with hold-ups in traffic.  I am thinking of Westmoreland Street and around O'Connell Bridge where one sees the traffic held up and people surging across the road taking their lives in their hands, but they have to get across.</P>
    <P>I remember speaking to an engineer some years ago.  He was near retirement. When people are near retirement they tend to take a conservative view.  He said it was quite impossible in many cases to provide these subterranean passages in Dublin because of electricity and water and sewerage services, but that applies to every city in the world.  Underground passages have interfered with these services but they have been provided successfully. The corporation should consider this to ease the traffic problems.</P>
    <P>A certain amount of work has been done on the approaches to Dublin. Everybody knows that a great deal of work is being done on the Stillorgan Road.  It is not being done for its employment content or because of the amount of Irish cement it uses.  It is being done to increase the flow of traffic and to help transport.  Work is about to be done on the way out to Lucan and that part of the county. <Col N="1641" /> That is a very slow road.  It is not a question of being able to thunder along at a fast speed.  Industry depends on the flow of traffic like the arterial flow of blood in the body. Traffic must be able to move smoothly for the benefit not only of industry but also of private individuals who have the right to get home as quickly as possible without their frustrations being increased enormously&mdash;or somewhat, according to their temperament &mdash;by being held up in a bus, or a lorry, or a private car.</P>
    <P>Increasingly the private car is being used by workers to an extent which was unknown even a few years ago, and a very good thing it is, too, to see new categories of our population able to afford what is not always a luxury, namely, a motorcar.  Where does that get us in relation to CIE? It gets us to the point that I have a great deal of sympathy with CIE. They have an almost impossible task. We are in a time of transition, a time of change.  There is evidence that a great deal of thinking is going on in CIE.  They are not a dyed-in-the-wool company.  They can bear comparison with transport companies in other much wealthier countries with a more concentrated population.</P>
    <P>We have a small population.  We have not got a great industrial population. We have widespread areas to which we have to send buses.  We have to serve focal points sometimes with railways, sometimes with buses from Cork, or Limerick, or Dublin or the other large&mdash;by Irish standards&mdash; centres of population.  With our small population that can only be done at considerable expense.  That is inescapable.</P>
    <P>With petrol and oil at such a high price the movement of goods and people by CIE is bound to increase. The Minister knows the details of that aspect better than I and CIE are aware of them also.</P>
    <P>In my view the solution, if a solution can be found to increasing costs, lies in inventions.  Just as an invention caused these difficulties, the invention of the motor car, an invention will also solve the problem.  At the time of the invention of the motor car the <Col N="1642" /> railways were booming and stock of railway companies was trustee security. It was regarded as being as safe as the most conservative bank in Europe but that changed in a short space of time.  In my view the solution to the difficulties may come more dramatically than we imagine through some invention.</P>
    <P>The use of electricity, the greater possibility of storage of electricity, the greater possibility of the cheap transmission of electricity are matters that can be considered.  An invention which has not yet been put to proper use in transport is a method by which electricity, by freezing, can be transmitted long distances with almost no loss of transmission power.  That invention has been referred to by one scientist&mdash;I do not know whether he was over-enthusiastic&mdash;as the greatest invention for mankind since the invention of the wheel.  The difficulty is that it has not yet been turned to real commercial possibilities.  It has been stated that any one Government spending a few hundred million pounds on this could achieve a real breakthrough.</P>
    <P>I do not suggest that our Government should spend that type of money on this invention nor do I suggest that CIE should consider this yet.  However I feel sure that they have their eye on it and that they have gone into the costings.  The day has not yet arrived when it is possible to transport oil or coal by plane at an economic price.  In my view very interesting possibilities lie ahead.</P>
    <P>I congratulate the Minister on his courage.  We have got to keep CIE going.  We have to make it as near an economic proposition as is possible. Government subsidies are not bad, but undoubtedly, fares will have to go up. The various local authorities will have to be encouraged to widen corners, to construct underground passages where advisable, or to build bridges so that people can cross busy roads without risks.  These will help to keep down the cost of transportation, which is tremendous.</P>
    <P>It has been stated that CIE are taking on too much.  Some people feel that the company should not be involved <Col N="1643" /> in running hotels or restaurants. My view is that it is very necessary for CIE to be concerned in the hotel business.  All CIE hotels are of a very high standard.  The CIE restaurant in Dún Laoghaire is first class. I am aware that it is not cheap but we should remember that no good restaurant is cheap.  CIE are also to the forefront in encouraging tourists.</P>
    <P>I have confidence in the Minister and I support him in his desire to give this extra money to CIE.  I accept that the taxpayer will have to meet the bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JeremiahCronin" hpid="Mr. Cronin Mr. Cronin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cronin</NameTxt>
      <P>The whole spectrum of CIE's operations has been fully debated here and Deputies have treated this matter very seriously.  That is as it should be having regard to the amount of money asked for and the continuing problem of trying to make the public transport system pay for itself. In fairness CIE down the years have played a very important role in the economic development of the country. But for the facility of the railways it would not have been possible to establish the sugar factories in the early thirties.  At that time the haulage of beet and beet by-products constituted a sizeable proportion of the income of CIE.  It is an interesting statistic that at the beginning of the sugar industry railway deliveries represented 80 per cent of the beet delivered to the sugar factories.  The other 20 per cent was delivered by road.  That pattern has been completely reversed and the bulk of beet is delivered by private hauliers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have also seen the phasing out of rail transport for livestock as part of the company's rationalisation programme and the withdrawal of freight facilities from a number of small stations.  Of course various factors have influenced this change, such as the additional handling costs, delays, and so on.  Perhaps it is seen that road transport is more efficient and speedier.  However, in the light of recent measures in regard to fuel prices, probably with worse to come, which will have the effect also of increasing the cost of road transportation, CIE should take another hard <Col N="1644" /> look at their position and make a more determined effort to attract people back to rail transport.  Of course the increased useage of roads in itself, creates problems, problems of maintenance, as well as increasing traffic on roads already overburdened. Naturally this makes for increased hazards and greater dangers.</P>
    <P>I am opposed to the withdrawal of rail facilities.  This would be a retrograde step.  There are proposals for the withdrawal of rail freight services at a number of East Cork stations between Cork and Youghal.  This is bad judgment in the light of the fact that East Cork is a highly industrialised area with enormous potential for further industrial development.  It is one of the most prosperous areas in the country.  With those prospects for CIE in respect of transportation, revenue for CIE would be considerably increased also.  I would ask CIE to examine further this proposal of the withdrawal of facilities, particularly bearing in mind the prospects of increased business in the future.  As well as that, I would regard this measure as being, the thin end of the wedge to the complete withdrawal of the services in due course.  Because of the reasons I have outlined already in relation to fuel problems, road hazards and so on&mdash;all inherent in the increase in road traffic &mdash;CIE's thinking should revert to rail transport again.  In a general way, in relation to rail and road traffic, CIE should not surrender so readily. Rather should their approach be an attacking one.  With the financial resources at their disposal it is a poor show on their part that rail freight has increased by only 1 per cent in the past 12 months.</P>
    <P>Another matter to which I should like to draw attention is the position of CIE pensioners.  When we speak in terms of subventions of £14 million, it is sad to reflect that CIE pensioners in my own town of Mallow, after 40 years' service, have as little as £3.68 per week pension.  This is a situation which should be corrected.  I have no doubt that the Minister is a sensible and generous man and will take whatever steps lie within his capacity to <Col N="1645" /> ensure that those people are suitably compensated for their many years of effort, under difficult conditions, in the provision of necessary services.  We all know a huge profit is being accumulated each year by way of contributions from employers, employees and on foot of interest accruing to the pension fund.  It is socially unjust that such a situation should be allowed continue.  Those pensioners have a strict entitlement to a better deal.</P>
    <P>I note that reference is not made to school transport in the Minister's speech.  I am wondering what is the significance of that.  Is it true that there is a deliberate move, afoot to cut back on this facility?  If so, I should like to be informed.  But, in the light of decisions taken in North-East Cork, in the areas I know well, it would appear there is a danger that there may be some tightening up or cut back on school transport.  Borderline cases are being rejected.  This is not what one would expect to be done in relation to the care and treatment of children.  I should be glad to hear from the Minister, what is the policy in relation to school transport.  I am aware of a situation in Cork where seven children who qualify for primary school transport are unable to receive that facility because the number involved would not justify the provision of transport for them.  This is all wrong because we should cherish all our children equally.  I would think that the number involved is sufficient to warrant a slight roundabout route to facilitate them in transportation to the national school.</P>
    <P>Having made those remarks, it is only fair to pay a compliment where it is deserved.  I do so to CIE in respect of their rail passenger services from the provinces.  This service, as I know it from Cork city to Dublin anyway&mdash; I cannot speak for the rest of the country but I take it that those services are on a par&mdash;is second to none. As my colleague, Deputy Crowley, said in his contribution on this Bill some days ago, the only complaint to be found in respect of the rail service from Cork to Dublin is the cost of food.  These costs are outlandish but are, I suppose, on a par with conditions generally.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1646" /> CIE's treatment of the tourist industry has been quite satisfactory.  I would not criticise the provision of grade A hotels.  This is a necessary amenity, one we should have and at which no criticism can be levelled. CIE have played their part fully in the promotion of tourism.</P>
    <P>Again, as was mentioned by Deputy Crowley in the course of his contribution, I was rather disappointed to find that a question we both had put down in relation to the transportation of livestock from Cork to Dublin was disallowed.  The question asked the Minister to look into the withdrawal of rail wagons from Cork to Dublin. The question was ruled out on the grounds that the Minister had no function in the matter.  This is a pity. The Minister should be in a position to answer a question on policy, which that was&mdash;a policy to withdraw a certain type of service&mdash;having regard to the amount of money which the House and the Minister through his Department makes available to CIE. The policy of referring matters back to CIE without the Minister giving a reply himself, is not a good one.  I would request the Minister again to examine that aspect of his responsibilities.</P>
    <P>It is easy to criticise CIE.  In fairness to them, very often they are placed in the position of being asked to provide uneconomic services.  We are all familiar with that aspect.  We cannot deny it.  It is a fact of life. Inevitably one finds that when a service is about to be withdrawn in any area, perhaps mainly a passenger service, there will be an immediate cry from the community for its restoration. Therefore, against all economic rules that service has to be restored.  CIE have to find some other way in which to offset the loss incurred in retaining that uneconomic service.  On the other hand, the appearance of restrictive practices in CIE is not helping their cause.</P>
    <P>In some instances it is considered to be a more viable proposition for CIE to engage private transport to undertake certain haulage jobs.  In any such arrangement CIE take 7 per cent in commission from the <Col N="1647" /> private haulier, but I am sure that it could be arranged for the company to handle this business themselves.</P>
    <P>Regarding the situation within CIE, there may be too many grades.  If people were more versatile there would be the prospect of a more efficient and economic operation.  If more common sense were applied at all levels within the company the losses might be reduced considerably.  From my experience of dealing with CIE personnel I know them to be responsible and decent people anxious that the company and their jobs be preserved.  However I would not be so complimentary in so far as the management are concerned. It is at that level that an example in leadership should be shown. There are not being provided the best possible measures to offset the wastage that is occurring in the company.  On the other side of the coin one hears of instances of CIE trucks being left waiting to take on a load of merchandise while other vehicles that arrived later are serviced first.  Very often the driver of the CIE truck is told to come back later only to find in the second instance that he is to be left waiting further.  The attitude seems to be that, like an insurance company, CIE can afford to wait.  These are matters in which the general public have a responsibility.</P>
    <P>In conclusion, I wish to register a protest against the occurrence of bus strikes in Dublin and I ask the Minister to apply himself in particular to this plague.  The strikes appear to occur at times that can do most damage to our tourist trade.  They have a damaging affect on the economy and on the morale of the people.  In recent years they have been occurring too frequently.  I am confident however that these strikes could be avoided if there were more communication and more common sense on the part of all concerned.</P>

      <P>We are asked here to vote millions of pounds to CIE but we will not have an opportunity of knowing how this money is spent.  As is the case in respect of some of our other boards, it is time that there was some examination at the headquarters <Col N="1648" /> of CIE.  We know that, after devoting a lifetime of excellent service to the company, workers are given only a miserable pension while those who made a mess of things were given a golden handshake.  If a worker were to create the same havoc in the company as was created in the past by some of the people who were at the top, he would not be there long enough to get any pension.</P>
      <P>The public should know what they are being asked to pay for.  The present system is one that the Minister has inherited.  Now is the time for change so that in respect of the boards of all these semi-State companies we would know how public moneys are being spent.</P>
      <P>The rail service is not paying, but that is not a situation peculiar to Ireland.  Indeed one might ask if any public service is paying, although the Dublin bus services are an economic proposition.  We know that roads have to be maintained and that often major reconstruction works are necessary. However, roads are essential and must be kept in order.  The same might be said of many other services too.  To get back to the rail service, the conditions of travel compare favourably with any other mode of travel.  New and better carriages are being fitted to trains.  However, I doubt whether the rail service is satisfactory to the majority of our people.  We must remember that our railways were not planned to cater for the needs of the population generally.  They were geared to meet the needs of the lords of other days and of the landed gentry who were in power then and who could dictate where the railroads would be built.  These people ensured that the service would facilitate them. It is hardly any wonder, then, that so many of the stations have closed.  All of that is past history but it is no harm to bear it in mind.  Those people the railways were built to suit wished to be kept far away from the ordinary people and that is why I say that the rail service does not suit the majority of our population.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If VIPs have occasion to travel by rail today they go first-class and we can assume that the best service is laid on for them.  The energy crisis will <Col N="1649" /> probably lead people to think more in terms of rail travel.  I might mention that many years ago, when we were switching from steam to oil, I warned here of the danger of being dependent entirely on one source of energy.  If the situation were to worsen we no longer have steam engines that could be put into use.  So far as I know there is only one of these vehicles available and I doubt if that is in any condition to be of much use.  What would be the position in the event of there being a complete cut off of oil supplies?</P>
    <P>Transport charges would make one think.  Only yesterday a man told me he bought two stone of seed potatoes here in Dublin and wanted them sent home.  It cost him £1.25.  How can CIE expect to get traffic back with those charges?  It is just as well he did not send the spade with them.</P>

      <P>If that was the case he would have to leave the potatoes to grow in the CIE sheds.  Reference has been made to the cutting off of buses in the event of the non-availability of oil.  Our trams were cut off in the past.  That was a retrograde step.  On the Continent you will see these trams all over the place.  They give a very good service, and they are not depending on oil.  It is about time that there was some imagination used in the provision by CIE of transport facilities for the public.  I warned previously about the oil shortage and the then Minister said a go-ahead authority would look after this.  I said that there would be no such thing as going ahead if there was no oil and that that day might come sooner than we thought.</P>
      <P>In the event of a cut off of oil, have we even one steam engine to take over, or will we have a Bianconi car? I do not think there will be even a horse available.  Then we shall be throwing up our hands in horror and asking: &ldquo;Where do we stand?&rdquo;  We shall be left standing.  I would like the Minister to use a little imagination in regard to the future set-up.</P>

      <P>This Bill has been debated at length, which shows the <Col N="1650" /> interest that Deputies from both sides of the House have in this service which is a national service.  Unfortunately, we cannot examine in greater detail the workings of CIE and its many ancillary services.  I would agree with the suggestion from both sides that the affairs of CIE should be examined by a select committee of all parties of this House. Perhaps it is not possible for CIE to run their business and make a profit, because it is providing a social service. Nevertheless, that should not give them a free hand to continue on the slippery slope on which we are today with a deficit of £11.67 million or, in a full year, over £14 million.</P>
      <P>It is depressing to note the progressive deterioration in the board's financial position.  Any firm or board involved in a situation like this would have to give an account of their stewardship at their annual general meeting.  We here, as watchdogs of the taxpayers, should be entitled to question the running of CIE and how this huge deficit has arisen.  The Minister says:</P>
      <P>The main reason for the excess of £4.7 million in the board's deficit over the Estimates provision was the decision of the Government to ameliorate the impact of the July, 1974, increases in CIE rates and fares by limiting the increases in Dublin city bus and suburban rail fares and provincial city and town bus fares to 20 per cent, instead of the 33 per cent increase proposed by CIE and approved by the National Prices Commission.  This, combined with a delay of three months in the implementation of the increases, resulted in a reduction of an estimated £3.3 million in the anticipated yield from the increased charges.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not think that kind of dilly-dallying should be allowed to continue. We have seen the proposals that were outlined during the year by CIE in the modernisation and development of the board's rail and road service.  Here, again, we see the position begins to get dangerous and a huge deficit in the running of the service is shown.  The board look <Col N="1651" /> around for places in which they can do some pruning.  There is no talk at all about starting to prune at the top.</P>
    <P>It is the workers, the people at the bottom of the ladder, who are always the first to be brought into the firing line when a situation like this arises. I remember talking to somebody who had worked in the railways some years ago, and he told me that at that time the whole western region from Limerick to Galway was covered by one engineer and I do not know how many clerks.  Now we have a regiment of these, and this is where the huge expense is incurred in running the board's affairs.  If there is any pruning to be done CIE should start there. There is no reason why they should put the ordinary working man's job in jeopardy, why they should create this anxiety for him and his family because there is a prospect of his losing his livelihood through modernisation or reorganisation.</P>
    <P>At present there is no Supertrain operating on the western line to Mayo. This line serves part of North Galway, Mayo and Roscommon, and so far I have seen none of those trains operating. They are operating on most other lines.  I cannot understand why the West should be left last.  We are entitled to the same treatment as the people in Cork, the Minister's county.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PeterBarry" hpid="Mr. P. Barry Mr. P. Barry">

    <Speaker pid="ThomasHussey" hpid="Mr. Hussey Mr. Hussey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hussey</NameTxt>
      <P>The people of Mayo and North Galway are also entitled to this facility.  I have travelled from Galway to Dublin on some of these trains and found them very comfortable. If I am to hand out a bouquet to CIE I would compliment them on these trains, because the facilities offered are very good compared with those on the old trains which are still in operation on the western line.  I hope before too long that we will see at least one of these trains operating on the Westport line which serves a large portion of North Galway, Roscommon and Mayo.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have had requests from people to have the gates of level crossings widened.  Some of these gates are only <Col N="1652" /> nine feet wide.  In one case I asked the Minister of the time and CIE to have this level crossing widened in order to cater for modern machinery.  A turf-cutting machine had to go through this gate to get into a bog but because the gate was only nine feet wide they could not get the machine through. For some unknown reason, CIE were reluctant to widen this gate at that time, and to my knowledge, it has not been done yet.</P>
    <P>Freight trains from the West travel almost empty.  Some time ago I and others suggested that those trains should be used to help industry in the West.  Industrialists who must transport their goods to Dublin for export could be accommodated on those trains.  The transporting of their goods should be subsidised by CIE.  This would not cost very much because the trains are already running.  Since industrialists in the West must compete with their counterparts in the East, they are at a disadvantage when it comes to shipping their finished product to Dublin for export.  Freight rates are very high, as Deputy Coogan pointed out.</P>
    <P>Deputy Cronin said that the railways provide a service for factories. This is very true.  If it were not for the rail service the beet factory in Tuam would be in serious difficulty because this year the acreage has dropped so much.  If CIE would subsidise the industrialists in the West to transport their finished product to Dublin, this would ensure that the trains would be used to the maximum capacity.  During the year there was some talk about the reorganisation of CIE, the downgrading of certain stations and the extension of others. This has caused a great deal of concern to interested parties, business people and industrialists alike.  There was talk of Tuam, Athenry, Roscommon and Castlerea being re-organised. CIE should make their plans known to everybody concerned so that there can be no doubt about the position of their stations in the years ahead.  They should be told in plenty of time in order to plan their businesses. I hope that some of the stations I have mentioned will not be downgraded.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1653" /> I attended a meeting in Loughrea with Deputy Callanan and a certain matter was brought to our notice. Apparently the engine which was operating in that station was not strong enough to move the wagons fast enough.  People have asked that we press for the reliable engine to be left there, otherwise the service will close down.</P>
    <P>In 1973-74, over 12.7 million passengers were carried by CIE rail services. This shows that people can be encouraged to travel by rail if proper services are provided and fares are maintained at a reasonable figure. This is very important.  In my view, the reason for the increase in the passenger service is due mainly to the three-day week train fares which have been very successful.  CIE should provide a cheap weekend service to the West&mdash;take the people home on Friday and back in time for work on Monday.  We have suffered migration from the West to the East.  Young people may have to travel to Dublin and other areas in search of employment because we have not sufficient employment available in the West.  It is important that our young people be encouraged to retain a link with their families, parish and community. CIE could afford to run this service without any great hardship.</P>
    <P>Industrial relations in CIE are a very important factor.  In the past year we have all seen the hardship caused to the people of Dublin city by the nine week bus strike.  It is unfortunate that this kind of thing is allowed develop. The whole structure should be looked into to see if anything can be done to improve relations between the management of CIE and the workers.  I know there are a number of unions and it is unfortunate that one union could not look after the affairs of all CIE workers.  I know this is a problem for another Department but it is something that should be investigated.  I know the Minister would be delighted to see one union in CIE.</P>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesBMcDonald" hpid="Mr. McDonald Mr. McDonald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McDonald</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to avail of this opportunity to make a few points.  I very much regret that the <Col N="1654" /> situation in CIE is rather difficult at present but I hope the Minister and the company will have a good look at the problems besetting that semi-State body.  Rather than repeat the &ldquo;cure&rdquo; imposed a few years ago of slashing off branch lines and curtailing services, they should engage in greater investment and try to win back a sizeable amount of our transport business in the country and in international trade.</P>
      <P>In the coming years a percentage of funds should be set aside to allow CIE to experiment in the introduction of new services.  A commuter service should be established from parts of the country to Dublin where many people commute by motor car.  This type of service might show a loss but it is something which CIE should engage in.  They should not only lay on a service for people but encourage them to change to a service that would ease the burden on our roads and be a saving on power and oil.</P>
      <P>CIE should seriously consider introducing a commuter service between Portlaoise and Dublin.  They could have a fast small train leaving at approximately 8 o'clock which would get into Dublin at 9 o'clock.  I know approximately 20 people drive from Portlaoise to Dublin every morning and return in the evening and even that number of people could be the basis for this service. I am sure a considerable amount of traffic could be picked up at places like Portarlington, Kildare and Newbridge. I do not believe these people would look for a cheap service.  They would prefer to be free from the strain of travelling at 50 miles per hour and spending 1½ to 2 hours on the road at peak periods.  This type of experimentation should be carried out without delay.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would like to see a massive injection of capital into our transport service.  During the past two years I have had the experience of commuting in each of the nine capital cities in the European Community.  I can see this city will become jammed before the end of this decade.  CIE should look closely at the progress that the Belgium railway company are making in Brussels.  I do not believe that it would be too costly to connect Dublin Airport with the rail permanent way.  A section <Col N="1655" /> of the track could be electrified between Dublin Airport and Dún Laoghaire.  Small fast trains could be run at 15 minute intervals.  CIE probably would not make a lot of money on the service but we cannot get away from the fact that while they have a monopoly in most areas of public transport their service must always contain an element of social service for the people.</P>
    <P>I would not like to see the Minister insisting that CIE should make a profit within X number of years.  We should instead urge on them the necessity to provide the best possible service for the greatest number of people.  Truck drivers should be encouraged to earn the maximum wage possible.  This would lead to greater utilisation of our transport fleet.  CIE need a better tie-up with continental services.  It is more regrettable that they have only got a tiny proportion of the very profitable market in the freezer trade.  We only control, between private enterprise and CIE, something like 17 per cent of this trade.  It is unfair to expect our meat industry to rely on this type of service.  There should be tie-ups with continental and UK services.</P>
    <P>There is a great future for deep freeze transport service.  I would like to see CIE building up to 20 million cubic feet of cold storage as part of a new complex which could hold Irish beef.  A greater percentage of our beef exports will be in the form of chilled beef.  CIE should be able to take whatever profits are to be made for the country out of this business.</P>
    <P>The rail services provided by CIE compare favourably with rail systems throughout Europe.  CIE are far ahead of British Railways, especially in the midlands, in the conditions of their rolling stock and also cleanliness.  The lack of cleanliness on the trains in the British midlands is deplorable.  I am glad CIE have better standards.  We should be able to provide even a limited service on the lines of the TE, the Trans-European expresses which are very fast.  They are small, relatively expensive trains which travel between the capital cities of Europe.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1656" /> I do not know if there is a market for that here but perhaps we could provide a less luxurious type of train that would commute between our cities and which would be very fast and give an early morning service. This would attract people.  So far as I know the earliest trains from the South arrive in Dublin about 11 a.m. and by any standards, especially European ones, this is not good enough.  Eleven o'clock in Dublin is a little after 12 in Europe and half the day is gone.  With time becoming more expensive it is more important that Irish people will be enabled to and will appreciate making an early start at 7 a.m. or 7.45 a.m. so reaching Dublin in time to do a good day's work.  Commuter trains for Dublin with better time schedules would attract more people.</P>
    <P>We should consider the type of cars run on the Paris underground or in Brussels.  They just provide a service with seats that are sometimes not even upholstered and offer mainly standing room.  The seats are left for war survivors or people who can show a card stating that they are injured.  I was once sitting comfortably in one of those cars in Paris when a man came up and flashed what I thought was an identity card.  I thought he was a policeman but what he wanted was a seat.  These people get priority.  We may not need that but we do want economic transport to get from one place to another, and if the journey takes only 15 or 20 minutes it does not really matter if passengers are seated or standing.  We should aim to provide this sort of service to ease congestion in the streets.  I hope the Minister will be able to finance CIE in a determined way so that they will not always have to think where they can make a saving.  CIE's job is to provide a first class service and while it costs money the important thing is to facilitate people in getting from one place to another in the shortest and most convenient way.</P>
    <P>I am particularly keen to see a rail link from the Clontarf area or from the Great Northern Line across the main Dublin/Belfast road and into Dublin Airport because the bus route <Col N="1657" /> from Busaras gives one an alarming and depressing tour of an area of Dublin which is not the most beautiful. In rush hours buses take all back streets and this gives the tourist or business visitor a very poor introduction and impression of our capital city. I would prefer to put some of those services underground, before things become too expensive.  Perhaps we could have one or two rail tunnels to make the service more viable and more imaginative.  They should look closely at the possibility of introducing electric trains at least in the city areas. I do not know what the economics of this would be but I assume it would contribute towards conserving energy to some extent.</P>
    <P>I was saddened to see such a large deficit in CIE this year but the public and Members of the House should not take a begrudging view of the situation. Many companies have good years and bad years.  We should encourage the workers and the management of CIE to raise their sights and provide a better service.  We must take a progressive step and have determined action to ensure that, if at all possible, by greater capital investment we can force CIE out of the present depression and provide a much improved service for the greatest possible number of people.</P>
    <P>I wish the Minister and the board every success in this work and I hope they find it possible to make an early decision regarding the transport of our beef to Britain and Europe.  I do not know whether the B + I service comes under the present Bill but they should provide a new cattle ship for both live cattle and container traffic so as to ensure that our main export will have adequate transport facilities available.  There is no point in trying to produce any commodity unless we can move it out quickly and economically.</P>
    <P>I do not know the present position in the European Transport Commission or when we can expect to get some funds from them.  I am glad our canal system is preserved and that we shall be able to use it in the not-too-distant future to both economic and social advantage from the tourist <Col N="1658" /> viewpoint.  If some economist in CIE suggests closing further branch lines or sections of the permanent way I ask the Minister, if that kind of proposal arises, if it is necessary to abandon the line, at least to leave the permanent way there for a number of years so that we shall not repeat the daft decision regarding the Harcourt Street line which most people now admit it was a mistake to close. Let us profit from the mistakes of the past.  I wish the transport service every success in the future.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnCallanan" hpid="Mr. Callanan Mr. Callanan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Callanan</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not believe it is possible for CIE to become a paying proposition.  I agree with the previous speaker that we should not give the impression to CIE that they are just moving along being subsidised and that they should not develop or expand.  I believe CIE could do a great deal that would probably improve the position. The idea is to get as many people and as much goods from road to railway but you cannot force people to travel or send goods by rail.  You can only entice them to do so.  Anything CIE could do in that regard would be worth doing.  CIE&mdash;and this is what annoys me&mdash;have a proposal which they did not call rationalisation but they called it CIE's proposal for railway development. There is a big map at the back of this paper which gives a supposed picture of future rationalisation.  As Deputy Hussey has said, whenever there is trouble in a company it never occurs at the top&mdash;it is always at the bottom.  Nine times out of ten, when rationalisation takes place we find that we begin to lose more money and that we get a worse service.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On this map are shown proposals for major developments and some minor ones.  I come from an area which Deputy Hussey mentioned.  The only major development I see scheduled for the west of Ireland is at Claremorris and Athlone.  Then there is mention of Tullamore, Portlaoise, Roscrea, Thurles, up to Clarecastle and Galway city.  We have a major station in Ballinasloe which is to be demoted, with possible redundancies.  For the life of me I cannot see how CIE can effect an efficient distribution of goods if they leave a whole vast area in the <Col N="1659" /> west of Ireland without development. We have often heard &ldquo;To hell or to Connacht&rdquo;, but CIE appear to have kept above the Shannon all the way and in Ballinasloe we are left with a major area which has to depend on Athlone for distribution.</P>
    <P>As I have said, there may be from 13 to 20 redundancies in the goods yard in Ballinasloe.  This always happens in rationalisation schemes: the workers always suffer.  Deputy Hussey mentioned the station at Loughrea which was supposed to be closed some years ago.  The people in the area made representations, local people promised their custom and the station was allowed to remain open.  What happened? A little engine was sent down to us.  It is only a ten-minute drive by car from Loughrea to an area I have in mind but it took that dud engine half-an-hour to do the trip.  Is that the way to keep a line open?  I agree there is a good engine there at the moment, but people will not spend half an hour travelling by rail if they can do the same journey in ten minutes by car.</P>
    <P>These are the things that stop CIE from going ahead.  I agree with the last speaker that the rail services we have are good, even if we have not got super-trains in the west of Ireland. Now, with the increased price for petrol, workers who could use public transport if it were suitable to their comings and goings from work would avail of it instead of using cars.  However, the bus services we have in my area run too late to suit the movement of workers and I urge on CIE to make them coincide as nearly as possible with the time workers go to and come from work.</P>
    <P>I come to a point raised by Deputy Moore.  In CIE there is an excellent basis for a true industrial democracy. All that is required is that the CIE board should have among their members representatives of workers and users.  On a number of occasions we have had too much theoretical thinking in CIE which looks all right on paper but falls down in practice.  If there were representatives of workers and users on the board we would find more practical application of development <Col N="1660" /> plans and improvements.  This also involves the social aspect.</P>
    <P>This brings me to the financing of CIE's losses.  I do not think this House should be asked to vote £11 million to a State company without having a say in it.  I would suggest that a select committee of the House be appointed to go into all aspects of State companies because, as Deputy de Valera has said, we created giants but they have turned back on us.</P>
    <P>I was astonished to see the type of pension scheme CIE have.  Their pensions are appalling in this day and age.  Still on the question of staff, the development document I have been referring to suggests that there is over-staffing. There is talk about reducing the staff in Galway.  My experience of the school transport office in Galway is that there is not sufficient staff even to answer a letter.  Perhaps staffing is top heavy at the top but when you go down the line we find there are not sufficient staff.  I am reminded of school transport in general.  Perhaps this is a matter for the Department of Education, and if the Chair says so I will stop.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Callanan</NameTxt>
      <P>All I will say then is that school transport is being curtailed. Deputies Cronin and Hussey mentioned the transport of beet to factories.  I have been associated with the Tuam factory since it was opened. Beet was taken in railway wagons. Then CIE switched to a lorry service, diverting the farmers from rail to road.  What they should have done was to provide shorthaul trucks to take the beet the five miles to the local station and then to the factory by rail, 30 miles away.  That would have kept the railways going.  There are so many heavy trucks on the roads these days that it is impossible for private vehicles to travel.  I urge that CIE be asked to make use of the railways, both freight and passenger, more attractive.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The west of Ireland will be adversely affected by the proposed railway development. I protest openly here and ask the Minister to instruct CIE that <Col N="1661" /> their policy should be to develop and to expand even though it costs money to provide a better service.  The railways are indispensable.  They must not be eliminated.  They may not be a paying proposition for some time except in the event of a scarcity of oil.</P>
    <P>I was annoyed when I saw the type of development proposed and concerned about the unemployment that would be caused.  I do not believe that CIE could be a viable concern but they should be efficient.  The money involved is considerable and the impression should not be given to CIE that they can spend as much as they like and then come to the House for funds.  There must be supervision over CIE by this House.  Those who pay the piper should call the tune.  It is a good thing that the House should have full discussion of CIE and other State bodies who expect the taxpayer to subsidise them.  We should be careful not to give the impression that CIE should cut back and stop expansion. That might do harm.  We may be appalled at the amount of money involved but curtailment of services might cause loss.  Expansion is required in CIE and there should be no redundancy.</P>

      <P>I should like to support my colleagues on this side of the House and in particular the spokesman on Transport and Power, Deputy Barrett.  My particular interest is in the city bus services.  On the last occasion that the Minister introduced a similar Bill seeking a supplementary sum to meet the mounting debts of CIE I urged that an inquiry should be held into the activities of CIE with reference to the Dublin city bus services. I regret to say that no attempt has been made to do that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The services in this city are steadily deteriorating.  Other speakers have referred to the sequence of strikes during the year that aggravated the situation.  I make a strong appeal to the management of CIE whom I <Col N="1662" /> charge with lack of supervisory services in the operation of the city services.  As one who travels by bus, I am most familiar with the deficiencies of the system.  While it may be excusable to have long queues waiting for buses at rush hours there is no excuse for the fact that it is virtually impossible at times to get a bus during what are regarded as off peak hours while at the same time buses are parked in the centre of the city.  I have seen eight to 12 buses parked in O'Connell Street where people were standing in queues.  In D'Olier Street buses are parked while people wait for buses.  There is a serious deficiency in the service, a serious lack of management control.  The Minister should address himself to the question of improving the city bus service.  There is a profit element in that service, as the figures prove.</P>
    <P>During the summer people are unable to get to seaside resorts and other amenity centres because of insufficiency of transport.  Persons have waited up to three-quarters of an hour and have had to abandon hope of getting to the seaside.  The management of CIE should have regard to the needs of the community.  The people living in housing estates six to nine miles from the city are isolated.  The service is infrequent and if a person misses a bus he may have to wait an hour for the next one.</P>
    <P>I am particularly concerned with services for persons visiting hospitals situated a distance from the city centre.  CIE do not seem to provide special services for them.</P>
    <P>There was the unfortunate interunion dispute that gave rise to the regrettable stoppages during the year. I have had personal experience of the grievous hardship caused to the families of busmen.  They were deprived of social welfare benefit because the conflict was between one section of workers and another.  The families had to rely on a small subvention from home assistance funds.  In addition, serious hardship was inflicted on the public.</P>
    <P>The Minister should ensure that the Dublin bus services are improved.  He should examine in particular the utility of the establishment of a long crossservice <Col N="1663" /> in the city.  There are a number of routes that I could name where people at intermediate stops cannot get buses.  It might be desirable to have a scheme of dropping people in the city centre and letting them go to other points to get buses to other parts of the city and county.</P>
    <P>I hope the Minister will harken to the appeals made to him.  The bus fares are high but the people could tolerate that if they had a more efficient service.  The whole structure of management seems to fall short of providing that service and there is a failure to take the public into confidence as to any difficulty in providing services.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PeterBarry" hpid="Minister for Transport and Power (Mr. P. Barry) Peter Barry">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Transport and Power (Mr. P. Barry)</NameTxt>
      <P>I want at the outset to say how very pleased I am at the length of the debate on this Bill to provide extra money for CIE.  I am pleased that so many Deputies have contributed to the debate.  It shows the interest of the House in the affairs of CIE and a realisation of the value of CIE to the economy.  What pleased me particularly was the attitude adopted by a number of Deputies.  They adopted a new attitude towards CIE. It was not a question of just criticising CIE and everything they do and of suggesting that they should be made to balance their books and be more efficient.</P>
      <P>In this debate I detected an appreciation of the value of CIE.  As a number of people seem to realise, to put it no stronger it is unlikely that CIE can be run in a profitable way and, for that reason, Ministers for Transport and Power will have to come back to this House looking for money to subsidise the company unless CIE charge rates that will help balance their expenses against their revenue.  Obviously, in that case there would be a level of fares that would be unacceptable to the general paying public, not only for freight rates but for passenger rates in buses and trains.  It appears to me that in the future Ministers will have to come to this House for subventions to ameliorate the effect of high fares on the public.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>CIE are the largest employer in the <Col N="1664" /> country; their employees number 20,000.  They provide rail, bus and freight services, they are involved in the tourist and in the hotel trades and they have many other activities.  When I was in Opposition I said that because the organisation is continually exposed to the public too many people criticise CIE.  There was an attitude towards the employees that they were putting their hands into our pockets and taking their wages.  I never agreed with this view and, since I have come into much closer contact with the company, I disagree even more with it.</P>
    <P>We should be proud of the fact that CIE provide so many services in such an efficient way.  Many Deputies have paid tribute to the company in this debate.  Deputy McDonald compared the train services here with those on the Continent and said CIE were way ahead.  Deputy Callanan compared them with British Railways and said our services were superior and Deputy Cronin remarked that the services provided by CIE were much better than those in other parts of Europe.</P>
    <P>Unless we are prepared to pay the full economic fares we should not be-grudge the money voted in this House to keep CIE services going.  They are an essential inter-connection between many parts of the country and although they cost a considerable amount of money the revenue can be found from two sources only, either from the fare-paying public or through this House.  I would not apologise, nor would I presume to do so on behalf of future Ministers for Transport and Power, for coming to the House for money to keep the services going.  By and large, the employees of CIE do an exceedingly good job.  They are practically operating in a goldfish bowl; any time one of them stops to light a cigarette members of the public see him and, perhaps, they make a complaint.  Similarly if a bus is ten minutes late a queue of people are conscious of that fact; if a train is not heated to the standard some people wish they may complain. There is a public awareness of the deficiencies but, equally, I think there is a public awareness of the value, courtesy and efficiency of CIE.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1665" /> A number of people have criticised the management of CIE but I think that is rather unfair because they are not answerable to the House.  They are individuals who have been employed by the board of directors to do a job and if there is a fault to be found the people who should be criticised are the board of directors who employed them.  If there was something wrong with CIE in that regard it would be my duty to fire the board and to install a new one.</P>
    <P>CIE have operated under certain constraints and a moral boost was necessary.  Part of this was recognised in the last 12 months by the Government when they gave an injection of capital, particularly for the freight side of CIE's operations.  CIE have been consistently losing trade to own-account carriers and to private hauliers during the years because the necessary money was not available to modernise and rationalise their activities.  Incidentally, I agree with Deputy Callanan's assessment of that awful word &ldquo;rationalisation&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>For many years CIE were taking individual packages and loading them on to a slow train whose average speed was 25 or 30 mph and unloading them individually when they arrived at their destination.  This will be changed when the modernisation of the freight programme is fully under way.  There will be unit load carriers, palletisation of goods, high speed trains travelling between fixed areas and the goods will be off-loaded and carried by road to their destinations.</P>
    <P>We all recognise the importance and value of the railways and while I am Minister this will remain the position. All of us appreciate the necessity of getting goods from the roads onto the railways.  The CIE service must be shown to be as efficient as the road transport service and, in fact, it must be in competition with their own road freight section and private hauliers and the people who use their own transport.  CIE must ensure that from the distributor's point of view it is as cheap in terms of time and money as the use of own-account transport.  The investment this <Col N="1666" /> year by the Government in the freight section of CIE will pay dividends in the future.  The injection of capital was necessary to allow them to compete efficiently with private hauliers and own-account transport.</P>
    <P>There were many suggestions from Deputies regarding the more efficient running of CIE.  If I do not refer to them individually in my speech, I should like to assure the Deputies that I will bring them to the attention of the board.  I will ask them to consider the suggestions and, where practicable, to implement them.</P>
    <P>A number of people were surprised when I mentioned that 65 per cent of CIE's expenditure was on wages.  I would remind the House that the principal item of the board's expenditure is labour costs.  In 1973-74 these costs, including pension and social welfare contributions, amounted to more than £40 million.  When we consider that more than 20,000 people are employed by CIE the House will not be too surprised at that figure.  It corresponds with 65 per cent of total expenditure and 79 per cent of operating revenue.</P>
    <P>People spoke about modernising and rationalising CIE and I mentioned the figure of 65 per cent because I wanted to point out to the House that the huge wages bill was something that would have to be taken into account, as would the number of people employed by the company, in any modernisation or rationalisation scheme.  It will not be possible for us merely to say that half of the people must be fired so that the wages bill will be reduced.  That is not rationalisation in the true sense; it is only disposing conveniently of people who are in employment.  The attitude of CIE is, and will have to remain, that in their modernisation plans for the railways there will be no involuntary redundancy, that where people do not wish to go they will not be forced to do so by the management of CIE.</P>
    <P>Deputy Barrett referred to the CIE management not having a dynamic approach to sundries traffic.  I am sure he has got a copy of the book <i>Proposals for the Development of the <Col N="1667" /> Railways.</i>  This shows that CIE management were concerned about the fact that their sundries traffic was, perhaps, not being handled in the way it should have been and needed a more modern dynamic approach.  By proposing this plan to the Government and this plan having been accepted by the Government they showed a realisation that there was something lacking.  It is an acknowledgement on the Government's part that what they said was true and that they needed help to put this plan into operation.  They are overcoming this problem of the sundries traffic by grouping of sundries traffic in pallets and having it transported in special trains at very much higher speeds than has been the case up to now.</P>
    <P>Deputy Barrett also asked about the development of rail commuter services.  Earlier this year the Government accepted in principle the recommendation of the Dublin transportation study and the McKinsey Report that these services should be developed to play the maximum possible role in the relief of urban congestion.  A special examination is being carried out by CIE, with the help of consultants, arising out of the recommendation of the Dublin transportation study that the existing suburban railway lines should be upgraded and that a feasibility study of a short underground railway network for central Dublin should be undertaken.</P>
    <P>Deputy Moore referred to the underground railway and said he did not think it was possible with the population of Dublin city to make this pay.  I might, and I am no expert on it, be inclined to agree with Deputy Moore but the fact that there is even a marginal case in Deputy Moore's mind and in the mind of other people would justify the undertaking of a feasibility study to see whether it is possible and let us put it aside until we can get the population level that will allow us to construct this underground railway. It is expected that this examination will be completed early in the new year and will be given to CIE who, no doubt, having done their study <Col N="1668" /> will come to the Government again with suggestions on it.</P>
    <P>In the meantime improvements in the existing services are being made where practicable.  Last year new cross-city train services were introduced for the morning and evening commuter peaks and services were increased from 43 to 74 per day.  This may answer Deputy Timmon's point about the necessity for cross city suburban train services.  A new suburban station was opened at the Bayside to cater for the developing housing area at Howth.</P>
    <P>Deputy Barrett asked what happened to the plans for the development of the railway.  I referred to this when I referred to the £27 million.  I think Deputy Barrett has been up but a number of other Deputies may wish to have fuller discussions with CIE on either the overall plan or on the sections relating to their own constituencies or areas.  If any Deputy either contacts CIE directly or through me I would be glad and, indeed, I would encourage CIE to see that public representatives, the travelling public, the users of the railway and anybody who is interested should have as much information as possible and know as much as possible about the future development.</P>
    <P>Deputy Callanan made the point that the west of Ireland had been ignored and not fully appreciated in this modernisation plan.  Modernisation and development work has started and is at various stages of completion at major locations&mdash;Cork, Longford, Waterford, Ennis, Ballina and Sligo. Two or three of those are west of the Shannon.  Work in connection with the development of 11 other locations is also in hand&mdash;Athenry, New Ross, Millstreet, Stranorlar, Letterkenny, Claremorris, Rathmore, Roscommon, Ballinasloe, Castlebar and Westport. A number of those are west of the Shannon.  The alteration of a further seven major railheads is expected to commence in 1975.  They are Kilkenny, Athlone, Tullamore, Dublin, Mallow, Arklow and Belfast.</P>
    <P>Deputy Timmons and a number of other Deputies referred to road passenger services.  Many people believe <Col N="1669" /> that the provincial bus services subsidise the Dublin city road services.  I am sorry to say that the provincial services are now also in a loss-making situation.  In the nine-month period of 1974 they are reckoned to lose £¼ million.  The Dublin city bus services from the 1st April, 1973 to 31st March, 1974, lost £967,000&mdash; almost £1 million.  The loss in the current nine-month period is £3,324,000. The provincial bus services in the 12 months ending 31st March this year made a profit of £289,000 and in the current nine months will have gone into a loss situation of £250,000.</P>
    <P>Deputy Geoghegan put his finger on it when he said that if I am dissatisfied the board should be fired instead of criticising the management underneath.  That was a valid point. He also referred to CIE becoming more efficient.  He spoke about the slow trains carrying sundries goods and other goods instead of fast trains carrying the one type of traffic.  It is proposed to replace the slow mixed goods trains by special block trains made up exclusively of one type of traffic, for example, bulk cement, fertilisers and goods of that nature. Those trains will be capable of speeds of 50 miles per hour which is almost double the speed of the existing trains and shunting and detaching of wagons en route will also be eliminated.  This specialisation of traffic will enable the railway to work with a freight fleet approximately one-third its present size.  Deputy Geoghegan wanted to know also where CIE were actually losing the money.  The rail loss was £10,200,000, the Dublin city bus services loss was £3,324,000.  I am now speaking of a nine-month period ending the end of this month.  The other bus services lost £250,000.  Road freight had a loss of £210,000.  The canals lost £190,000.  Vessels lost £60,000.  On their international activities there was a profit of £84,000 and on their catering services a profit of £20,000.  That is how the figure of £30,950,000 is arrived at.</P>
    <P>Deputy Taylor said there were rumours that CIE time tables were being adjusted.  It is customary for <Col N="1670" /> CIE to review time tables at least once a year.  That review is taking place at present and it will take into consideration the extent to which there is a demand for existing services and the financial and physical resources available.</P>
    <P>Deputy Staunton, Deputy Hussey, Deputy Callanan and Deputy Coogan referred to the poor standard of carriages in the west of Ireland compared with those on the southern route.  CIE are limited in their fleet of air-conditioned rolling stock, which was introduced two years ago, and this stock is allocated to trains on routes where their use can be optimised.  The remaining rolling stock, built between 1964 and 1968, has been allocated to the Sligo and Westport routes.  While it is accepted that this rolling stock suffers by comparison with the air-conditioned units mentioned, it is, nevertheless, superior to the rolling stock used on the non-air-conditioned train sets working on the balance of the southern route.  The south, therefore, has the first and third and the west has No. 2.</P>
    <P>Deputy Fergus O'Brien asked when steps would be taken by CIE to take advantage of the market opened up by our membership of the EEC.  Deputy Callanan and Deputy McDonald also referred to this.  I would assure the House that CIE are doing everything possible to increase their participation in this market.  They have established agencies in the European Economic Community countries for the development of direct road transport facilities between Ireland and the other EEC countries.  They have seven EEC quota licences permitting them to engage in multilateral road freight haulage throughout the member states of the EEC.</P>
    <P>Deputy O'Brien and Deputy Staunton raised the question of the transfer of the terminus for trains from the west from Pearse Station to Heuston Station. When replying to a point earlier made by Deputy Timmons I quoted the figures for the increase in the number of cross-city trains.  This increase meant congestion at Pearse Station, to such an extent that suburban trains, west of Ireland trains, the Dún Laoghaire boat train were all meeting there at <Col N="1671" /> certain times.  None of them was being operated efficiently so CIE took the decision to transfer the west of Ireland trains from Pearse Station to Heuston Station, leaving Pearse Station available for the trains to the south-east and for suburban rail.  By providing a more efficient service they would be very anxious&mdash;in this they would be encouraged by Dublin Corporation and the Dublin transportation study group&mdash;to induce more motorists off the roads and on to the trains by providing a more frequent and faster service.</P>
    <P>Deputy Gene Fitzgerald spoke of the need to guard against redundancy in connection with the rail rationalisation plan.  I would again like to point out that in July last year the railway staff were given an assurance by CIE that there would be no involuntary redundancies. CIE are, of course, pursuing a full programme in consultation with the trade unions in regard to the implementation of the rationalisation plans.</P>
    <P>Deputy Tom Fitzpatrick and a number of other Deputies referred to traffic congestion in Dublin from two points of view: one, the effect it was having on CIE time tables and the other is, of course, the necessity for a more combined approach to the problem of congestion.  Deputy Maurice Dockrell also raised this point.  This is not a problem solely for CIE or primarily for Dublin Corporation or the Department of Local Government. Its solution needs a coming together of representatives of all these groups. I would see nothing wrong with members of the travelling public being represented on such a study group for the purpose of finding a solution to the problem.  Many solutions are suggested which would, perhaps, assist but not necessarily solve the problem.</P>
    <P>When looking at this situation we must keep in mind our overall plans. One could follow the suggestion thrown out here by a number of people of having fly-overs, underpasses and underground railways after the pattern of cities in America and on the Continent of Europe.  There will probably be some necessity for <Col N="1672" /> some such investment to relieve congestion. The primary user should be the first customer on the roads for a number of reasons.  Public transport is more efficient fuelwise than private cars.  It can carry more people.  It causes less congestion.  It relieves local authorities to a certain extent of expenditure on roads to facilitate motorists.</P>
    <P>This, of course, is a case of a dog chasing his own tail.  If CIE could provide a more efficient transport service cars would not be on the roads but, because they are not providing the service, the cars are on the road. If we could break this chain it is possible we would see some progress. Perhaps bus lanes would be a solution. They were tried a number of years ago on one route in Dublin and there was considerable resistance to them. There was considerable anger on the part of the motoring public.  I believe the experiment ended too soon.  More time should have been allowed to see whether or not the experiment would work.  An Foras Forbartha are at present carrying out a special study of transportation needs in Dublin and I would hope this would be one of the areas that will come up for discussion. Perhaps one way of helping CIE would be to give buses a free run and, by their providing a more efficient service, enticing motorists out of their cars and on to public transport. That would relieve Dublin Corporation of the necessity for any great investment in roadways which will continue to be a burden because of the ever-growing volume of private cars.  No matter how many roads one builds there are motorists to fill the roads.  In the long term the car will obviously have to be catered for to facilitate those people who want to get from A to B as quickly as possible. However, in the long term, we must place a great deal more faith in our public transport system and ensure that it is as efficient and cheap as possible.  We must ensure that a good service is provided so that people will not be tempted to bring their cars out when they know there is a good transport system waiting for them.</P>
    <P>Deputy Geoghegan referred to the <Col N="1673" /> changing of the termini from Pearse Station to Heuston Station.  I have dealt with that point.</P>
    <P>Deputy Gene Fitzgerald and Deputy Callanan made reference to school transport.  It may not be appreciated, but it is probably known to many Deputies, that CIE do not operate the school transport system.  They act as agents for the Department of Education who decide what buses should run and who should be carried on them, and they pay CIE accordingly. The situation is the same in the case of social welfare beneficiaries.  Deputy Dockrell said that in London they occupy seats which should be available to people going to and from work. That cannot happen here because their passes are valid outside peak hours only.</P>
    <P>Deputy R.P. Burke spoke of the need for a circular bus route for the north city area.  In fact, CIE have made arrangements for a bus route serving Finglas, Ballymun, Santry, Kilmore, Coolock and Kilbarrack.  The introduction of this service is awaiting the widening of a road at Coolock lane, so that it can take the bus traffic.  After that it will be introduced as soon as possible.</P>
    <P>A number of Deputies referred to the bus strike in Dublin during 1974. As the Minister for Labour announced subsequently in the Dáil in answer to a question, Professor Brian Hillery is engaged in a study into the causes of this but has not yet reported to the Minister.  I will be very interested to see the results of that study and I will be discussing it with the Minister.</P>
    <P>Deputy Crowley, Deputy Cronin and other Deputies referred to CIE not providing sufficient scope for carrying cattle.  Deputy Crowley referred to the shipping of cattle.  Of course, that is a matter for the B + I.  CIE are quite willing to engage in any traffic if they can make a profit and provide a service.  In the years 1971-72 and 1972-73, the amount of cattle offered to CIE to be carried dropped by 50 per cent from 206,000 to 110,000.  I do not think the House would expect CIE to be on tap to cater for some emergency in the <Col N="1674" /> future.  If they got the trade they would be more than willing to engage in it, but the fact is that they have been losing that trade.</P>
    <P>Deputy de Valera referred to the day-to-day administration of CIE. Section 16 of the Transport Act, 1950, provides:</P>
    <P>The Board shall furnish to the Minister such information as he may from time to time require regarding matters which relate to its activities, other than day-to-day administration...</P>
    <P>This is written into the Act.  It seems to have been an effort to protect CIE from too much ministerial interference. Under that Act I am not free to tell CIE what buses should be run, what trains should be run, and where they should be run.  These are matters of day-to-day administration.</P>
    <P>Deputy de Valera also said that CIE's accounts were not subject to audit by the Comptroller and Auditor General.  Section 34 of the same Act provides:</P>
    <P>The accounts of the Board shall in each year be audited by an auditor or auditors to be appointed annually by the Board with the consent of the Minister.</P>
    <P>In that way the Minister has a say in the appointment by the board of the auditors to look into the affairs of CIE.  I have the name of the auditors here before me.  They are an extremely well-known and very competent firm. For that reason I accepted them.</P>
    <P>Deputy O'Connor stressed the need for CIE to look for modern handling equipment and to adopt improved transport systems for goods.  This is involved in the development plans for the railways.</P>
    <P>Deputy Blaney referred to the inadequate services to and from County Donegal.  The lower half of Donegal is served by CIE and the upper half is served by the Londonderry and Lough Swilly Railway Company.  The Government have approved a proposal to include in a Supplementary Estimate for my Department provision for a capital grant of £50,000 for the Londonderry and Lough Swilly Railway Company. Because of the troubles in Northern <Col N="1675" /> Ireland, this company have found themselves in a deteriorating financial position and the capital grant is being made for the purpose of assisting them in the renewal of their road passenger fleet.</P>
    <P>Almost every Deputy who spoke referred to the necessity for having a Committee of this House to look into the affairs not only of CIE but of all the semi-State bodies.  I would be most sympathetic to that point of view. The more transparency there is in the affairs of semi-State bodies the better. I do not mean the uninformed comments you sometimes see in letters to newspapers.  I mean transparency with regard to the Members of this House who have to vote money annually for CIE and for other State companies.</P>
    <P>A Committee of the House should be able to question the management and directors on their activities and the money they are using.  This matter is at present under active consideration by the Department of Finance and the Department of the Public Service.  I hope it will come about in a form which will be acceptable to the House and to the semi-State companies involved. I should like to thank the House for the reception they have given this Bill, and to say how much I appreciate the interest Deputies have shown in the affairs of CIE.  The suggestions made will be noted by CIE. Probably far more valuable in the long run for the company is the amount of praise, consideration and sympathy extended to CIE for their operations in the future.</P>

      <P>As the Minister said, nearly every Deputy who spoke emphasised the necessity for allowing a Committee of the House to look into <Col N="1676" /> CIE expenditure in more detail.  I was very glad to hear the Minister say that he was in total agreement with that.

      <P>I can count ten offhand. It is not only a matter of looking into the way the money is expended. Deputies and Senators could make worthwhile proposals and recommendations to the board of CIE because they are so familiar with their own constituencies that they can see things which the board could not possibly know about.  Some of these suggestions would mean very much to the board with regard to the spending of these huge amounts of money and we look forward to seeing this legislation being introduced.</P>

This is the subject of investigation by the Departments of the Public Service and Finance.  As Deputies are aware, it is more involved than merely telling a number of officials to have a look at CIE.  There has to be legislation, and control, in a certain way, but I am in sympathy with the views expressed by the Deputies that there should be an investigation.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickJLalor" hpid="Mr. Lalor Mr. Lalor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lalor</NameTxt>
      <P>Section 2 deals with a grant of £11.3 million in addition to the grants already payable to the board. In replying to the debate on this Bill the Minister, when referring to the provincial bus service, informed us that last year the profit was £289,000 but this year there is a loss of £250,000.  In <Col N="1677" /> this regard I should like to put forward a suggestion that might improve the income on the provincial bus service. When travelling to Dublin through Kildare and the Curragh I meet many soldiers thumbing lifts to their barracks. Some of them are due to commence duty in the Curragh at 9.30.  In this connection I should mention that because of the success of the recent recruitment campaign there is not sufficient accommodation at the Curragh for soldiers.</P>
      <P>I feel sure that the Minister for Defence would be anxious to facilitate these soldiers in getting to their barracks.  I have spoken to a number of these soldiers and have pointed out to them that an empty provincial bus, travelling from Portumna to Mountmellick and on to Dublin, had passed them but their reply was that they could not afford to travel by bus.  It is my suggestion that, as a step towards cutting the losses on the provincial bus service, CIE should offer a cut price ticket to soldiers in uniform travelling in any part of the country.  I am aware that the roads are cluttered with hitch-hikers but these soldiers are merely endeavouring to get to their barracks on time in the morning.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister for Defence regularly has advertisements inserted in the newspapers to entice young men to join the Army but I feel it is wrong that the State subsidised transport system should pass soldiers who are seeking a lift to their respective barracks.  I am not suggesting that they should be given free travel because anything given for nothing is never properly appreciated.  The same situation arises in other towns and I am sure the Minister for Transport and Power has seen soldiers hitching lifts outside Cork city.  A number of the army barracks do not have residential facilities with the result that soldiers are obliged to find accommodation elsewhere. In a number of cases this means living some distance from the barracks and very often there is no public transport service operating at the time they leave for work.  Consultations should take place with the management of CIE with a view to <Col N="1678" /> providing an economy ticket for soldiers in uniform.  This will help to reduce the loss on the provincial bus service.</P>

      <P>I understand that under past legislation the hotel section of CIE, Óstlanna Éireann Teoranta, was set up as a separate company to operate separately.  However, I understand that it is being reabsorbed into CIE.  If this is so, I should like the Minister to investigate whether this legislation under which the separate company was set up is now being ignored.  What is the position with regard to this company being brought back under CIE?  If this has happened without any reference to the legislation it is a very serious matter.</P>

      <P>No, there is no reason why they should be brought in. But the losses incurred by Óstlanna Éireann Teo. in the last few years have been quite extensive because of one large investment made about four years ago.  Consideration is being given at present to the question of whether these losses should be met through <Col N="1679" /> the ordinary CIE subventions, or whether there should be another method of financing them under the CIE hotels board.  There is no finality about it yet; nothing except a thought or consideration as to what is the best way to approach these losses.</P>

      <P>With the permission of the Ceann Comhairle I propose to take Questions Nos. 3 and 4 together.</P>
      <P>A scheme of extension comprising eight additional classrooms is in the course of erection at Shannon No. 3 national school.  A new 16 classroom school, Shannon No. 4, has already been approved by my Department. This with the existing accommodation should meet the needs of Shannon for the foreseeable future.</P>
      <P>My Department have sanctioned generous grants for primary school building at Shannon, and I regret that I am not in a position to increase the grant beyond what has been offered.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SylvesterBarrett" hpid="Mr. Barrett Mr. Barrett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Barrett</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister not agree that this new town should get special consideration for an increased grant because it is growing so rapidly?  Further, is the Minister aware that those living in this town are all young couples, with young families?  Projections are that the numbers will reach about 25,000 in not very many years.  For that reason, would the Minister reconsider the amount of money being made available, because Shannon should be treated as a very special case in view of the amount of money involved in the size of school needed?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. R. Burke Mr. R. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>I accept that it is a newly developing community.  But I would want the Deputy to understand that we have in fact stretched the limits of generosity here almost to breaking point.  I do not think I could hold out any hope for any increased allocation in respect of this school, even if I were to say that it is a special case.  In any event, might I point out that, whilst the majority of managers of schools have to acquire sites for their schools at local expense, the sites for the Shannon schools have been provided free by the Shannon Free Airport Development Company, which in effect means that this additional help has been provided from State funds?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SylvesterBarrett" hpid="Mr. Barrett Mr. Barrett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Barrett</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware that the manager of the schools is <Col N="1682" /> just not able to raise the amount of money he is supposed to raise? Further, is the Minister aware that the banks because of previous commitments&mdash;he has said this publicly himself&mdash;are not prepared to advance the moneys and there is a very serious problem here with regard to the local contribution because the amount of money is so great?  In view of this alone, would the Minister not consider that it should receive special consideration?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. R. Burke Mr. R. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>I am aware of the points made by the Deputy.  I think he would be fair to the Department in acknowledging that the grant in this respect has been pushed to the upper limit possible under the circumstances. In view of the fact that there were no expenses involved with regard to the site, I think we have reached the limit of what he can do in the matter.  I acknowledge the strongest representations from various interests but there is no point in my suggesting that there is any further help available in this respect.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SylvesterBarrett" hpid="Mr. Barrett Mr. Barrett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Barrett</NameTxt>
      <P>Could the Minister say if there are any means under which he could permit the Shannon Free Airport Development Company to make a contribution towards the building of the school because I understand that the legislation under which they were set up precludes them from so doing?

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. R. Burke Mr. R. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>With the permission of the Ceann Comhairle, I propose to circulate with the Official Report a <Col N="1683" /> document which sets out my policy in this matter.</P>
      <P>Following is the document:</P>
      <P>Amalgamation of National Schools.</P>
      <P Just="Center">A Statement of Policy.</P>
      <P>It is not the intention&mdash;in normal circumstances&mdash;to build new one-or two-teacher schools or to provide new premises&mdash;or to undertake major reconstruction or improvement work&mdash;for schools of this size. The necessary provision for replacement would be made on the basis of amalgamation with other schools in larger units.  A new school premises is an investment for the future and it would be altogether inappropriate and unreasonable to replace a one- or two-teacher school with a school of the same size which would be obsolete in terms of educational requirements in a relatively short period of years.</P>
      <P>The same general considerations as in the case of a one- or two-teacher school apply to a threeteacher school when there is a declining average enrolment and the prospect were that it will not remain a school of that size.</P>
      <P>In normal circumstances as the opportunity offers the educational interests of the children may require that recognition should be withdrawn from a one-teacher school and suitable arrangements made for its amalgamation with another school to form a larger educational unit.</P>
      <P>Parents of pupils should be informed of the advantages for their children of attendance at schools of suitable minimum size and they should be encouraged to agree to amalgamation where suitable arrangements may be made by use of free school transport to bring the children to a larger school.</P>
      <P>It needs to be emphasised that as well as providing better educational opportunities for the children, larger schools contribute to a more equitable distribution of the total number of teachers available for all schools and, accordingly, to an improvement of the pupil/teacher ratio in areas of particular need.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1684" /> It is necessary for the State in the general good of all to have advertence to this fact.</P>
    <P>In connection with a proposal for the amalgamation of schools in any area, the particular circumstances of the individual schools must receive the fullest consideration and an opportunity must be afforded for all aspects of the case to be examined and discussed.  Due regard must be had to the wishes of those in favour of amalgamation as well as of those opposed to the proposal.</P>
    <P>Parents are concerned for the welfare of their children and anxious to provide them with the best opportunity for their development and advancement. At the same time they are fully conscious of their obligations as citizens and are prepared to consider the requirements of the common good in connection with the decisions that require to be made. It is in the full recognition of such considerations that suitable and equitable decisions may be made in relation to the amalgamation of schools.</P>

      <P>With the permission of the Ceann Comhairle, I propose to take Questions Nos. 18 and 19 together.</P>
      <P>A special task force has recently been set up by the Tánaiste as Minister for Health to examine the whole area of legislation affecting children.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Department of Education have appointed a representative on the task force and I have arranged with this representative that the task force will consider the school attendance legislation <Col N="1703" /> in conjunction with the other legislation.</P>
    <P>When the report from this task force is available the Government will consider what new legislation is required in this whole area.  No application has been received from Dublin Corporation for approval to appoint the specialists mentioned in Question No. 19 but it would seem preferable in any event to await the outcome of the task force's report before deciding on additional appointments.</P>

      <P>In view of the fact that the Parliamentary Secretary has responsibility for physical education, for outdoor pursuits, for sport in general, I put down this question asking if he will consider the establishment of an outdoor pursuits centre at Letterfrack.  I do not think his reply relates directly to the question I put to him.  Would he consider the establishment of such a centre as being praiseworthy and, worthwhile and if so, would he examine the lands and buildings available there and then consider seriously the establishment of such a centre?</P>

The parish is divided by the largest lake in County Clare.  At the other side of the lake one school has been retained, the Drumindoora school.  Prior to the building of the new school, the children of Lannaught and Killanena had transport facilities which were taken from them.  There are at least 20 children&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>There is no suitable primary transport service for these children.  They have been offered transport on a post-primary service which passes close to their homes. This service would mean a waiting time of approximately 25 minutes before the school opens in the morning and 45 minutes after the school closes in the evening.</P>

      <P>Owing to an increase in the number of children availing of this service, a larger vehicle&mdash;45-seater bus&mdash;had to be utilised from September last.  This vehicle is unable to negotiate the laneway leading to the homes of the children in question so that they have to make their way over distances in the range of 0.7-0.8 mile to the nearest pick-up point.

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. Bruton Mr. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>This child resides in the area of Ballinalane national school which was closed and amalgamated with Firies national school in 1971.  She is accordingly entitled to free transport on the service which operates from the closed school area to Firies central school.  In view of this, and in view of the fact that the school authorities in Firies national school objected very strongly to the suggestion that she should be given transport to any school other than the central school, transport to Faha national school for her was refused.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. Bruton Mr. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>This is quite an involved situation.  The area where the children reside belongs to the Firies national school because Ballinalane national school was amalgamated with Firies and the idea of an amalgamation is to ensure that there will be sufficient pupils in the central school to maintain numbers and teacher strength in that school&mdash;Firies in this case.  It would appear that, as the Deputy indicated, prior to the closure of Ballinalane national school the other family got transport to Faha national school.  This seems to have been an irregular decision but as these children are near the end of their school career it is probably as well that they should be allowed to continue in the school in which they started even though that may have been on the basis of a decision that was irregular at that time.  But the child in which the Deputy is interested is commencing a school career and, at least on the face of it, it should not be a great hardship to that child to attend the Firies school. As I indicated, a convenient transport service to the Firies school is available to that child and I hope he or she will be able to avail of it.</P>

This includes three families.  If an error were made at some time&mdash;and I do not believe it was&mdash;there is a case to be made for this child.  There is great local resentment due to what has happened.  I made representations in this case in September and I got no reply from the Department of Education.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>Although the distance may be six miles&mdash;I am not in a position to dispute that&mdash;there is convenient transport available to take the child that six miles.  When this amalgamation was made of Ballinalane school, which is the school area in <Col N="1710" /> which this child resides, with Firies school, the arrangement which was made in 1971 and not by the present Minister, was that children from the Ballinalane area would go to the Firies school and that transport would be available to them.  If the Deputy was concerned about it, he should have taken it up then.</P>

      <P>I have recently introduced a concession for pupils attending national schools who are basically eligible for free transport and for whom there is no transport available to their nearest school.  Under this concession, such pupils may avail of transport on a fare-paying basis to the next nearest school if a suitable service is in operation to that school and provided they make their own way to the boundary point between the two school districts.  This concession is subject to the condition that there is room on the bus after the eligible children availing of transport to their nearest school are accommodated.</P>

        <i>(Cavan)</i>: The annual grant paid from the Garda Síochána Vote to the Dublin Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals was increased from £1,000 to £2,000 as from 1st April, 1973.  I am not considering a further increase but I should like to draw the attention of the Deputy to two amendments that have been put down by the Minister for Local Government for the Committee Stage of the Local Government (Planning and Development) Bill, 1973. One amendment proposes to extend the powers of planning authorities to enable them to assist, in money or kind or by the provision of services or facilities, a body or person providing homes or shelters for stray or unwanted dogs and cats.  The second amendment proposes to empower planning authorities to provide and manage buildings or structures for the purpose of providing such homes or shelters.</P>

    <P>As the board's dental staff is not yet sufficient to provide adequate treatment services for all eligible persons in its functional area, its staff are concentrating mainly on services for children rather than adults.  I am advised that, in general, there is very little waiting time for extractions for children or adults.  The waiting period for conservative treatment, mostly fillings for children, varies considerably over the board's area&mdash;from almost a month or less in Tipperary North Riding to several months in other <Col N="1737" /> parts of Mid-Western area with priority being given in special cases. The average waiting time for dentures for adults is about four to six months in Clare and North Tipperary and about 12 months in the Limerick area.</P>

      <P>On a strictly proportional basis, related to the present use and cost of the service, the cost of extending the choice of doctor scheme to a further third of the population would be about £13.5 million a year.  The cost of extending it to the entire population would be about £26 million a year.  There are a number of factors which would affect the actual cost of extending the service.

Nevertheless, there has been in recent years a gradual but significant improvement in these services, particularly the dental services for children, by the expansion of wholetime dental staffs and the provision of improved clinic facilities by health boards.  The extent to which further improvements can be made in the coming year, having regard to the available resources, is at present being reviewed.</P>

      <P>Would the Parliamentary Secretary agree with me when I say that the people I mention here&mdash;medical card holders and their dependants and primary school children&mdash;have a statutory right to full dental services and they are not being provided with these services at the moment?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>While the secretary-general of the Irish Pharmaceutical Union has been directed by its National Executive Committee to initiate procedures whereby pharmacists will cease to supply drugs and medicines under the general medical service, no date has yet been determined from which such action would begin.  The Deputy will be aware that pharmacists are required to give three months' notice of their withdrawal from the scheme.</P>
      <P>As I made clear in the statement I issued yesterday I am still hopeful that the union may agree to have this matter resolved by submitting it to arbitration and I am willing to arrange further meetings with the union should it appear that these would be of value.  A matter which might again be clarified at such a meeting, since it appears from their Press statement to be still a source of concern to the union, is my decision not to make an offer in response to their claim which was for an overall increase from 20p to 78p.  It does not seem to be appreciated by the union that where such a great gap exists between a claim and what may be offered, there is frequently no specific offer made and the matter is left for determination by an impartial body.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1746" /> I have, as a matter of prudence, directed that preliminary consideration be given to alternative methods of providing drugs and medicines for eligible persons should the pharmacists ultimately decide to withdraw from the service but I am not in a position, at present, to give the Deputy details of my specific proposals in this regard.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RichardBarry" hpid="Mr. R. Barry Mr. R. Barry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>With the permission of the Ceann Comhairle, I propose to take Questions Nos. 59 to 62 together.</P>
      <P>The figure of 67,931 experiments on living animals to which the Deputies refer includes both medical and veterinary research.  None of the experiments was in the sense implied in the question performed in connection with purely commercial and industrial research tests and only 6,330 of these were carried on outside of university or other institutes of research.  In this respect I should point out that no experiment may be carried out under a licence issued by the Minister for Health under the Cruelty to Animals Act, 1876, except with a view either to the advancement by new discovery of physiological knowledge or of knowledge which will be useful for saving or prolonging life or alleviating suffering or with a view to the acquisition of such knowledge by persons attending lectures in, for example, medical schools, hospitals or colleges. The 6,330 experiments to which I referred earlier were carried out in a commercial premises to ensure that the surgical products produced at that premises were fit for use on humans in respect of pyrogenicity and toxicity.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In granting licences to applicants under the Cruelty to Animals Act, 1876, consideration is always given to the issue as to whether the knowledge sought, and so on, can be obtained <Col N="1748" /> without recourse to the use of living animals.  My advisers in the Department of Health keep themselves informed of developments in relation to alternative techniques.  I cannot at this point in time give Deputies any precise estimate of the numbers of experiments performed in the present calendar year&mdash;my Department will not be collecting the returns until January&mdash; but such information as I have leads me to believe that there is unlikely to be any significant alteration in the number of experiments carried out.  I have no information either which would enable me to make predictions about trends in future years and I regret, therefore, that I cannot assent to the Deputies assumption that the downward trend will continue by reason of the adoption of new techniques.</P>
    <P>The total amount of grant made to the Medical Research Council for the year 1973 was £206,000&mdash;of which one-third approximately was spent on experiments involving living animals. The amount of grant allocated to the Medico-Social Research Board was £114,670 for the year 1973-1974 and none of this money was expended upon research or experimentation involving live animals of vivisection.  No other funds are made available by my Department for medical research.</P>

      <P>Would the Parliamentary Secretary agree that it is unsatisfactory that a Deputy should have to resort to the rather expensive method of getting information in this way and will he ensure that, when a Deputy makes representations in these cases, his representations are dealt with quickly and that he is informed in a reasonable time?

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cluskey</NameTxt>
      <P>I would not agree with the second part of the Deputy's supplementary question.  I certainly agree that representations made by Deputies, or any member of the public, should be dealt with as speedily as possible.  In the second part of the Deputy's supplementary question he referred to undue delays or reinvestigations particularly in his own constituency.  The Deputy has submitted quite a number of questions along the general lines of this question and, almost invariably, I have found on investigation that the matter has been protracted and the decision delayed because there was concealment of rateable land or other means by the person making the complaint. In fact, this applies to the present case as it has to so many more which the Deputy has submitted in the past.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LiamCunningham" hpid="Mr. Cunningham Mr. Cunningham">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cunningham</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cluskey</NameTxt>
      <P>I did not say in all cases, but in a very large number of cases submitted by the Deputy.  I <Col N="1750" /> replied to the Deputy's supplementary question in which he implied that there was some sort of a conspiracy against him or his constituency by the Department.  I thought I was justified in stating what I have stated, which is true, in order to inform the House what the circumstances were and why the Deputy was apparently experiencing this difficulty.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LiamCunningham" hpid="Mr. Cunningham Mr. Cunningham">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cunningham</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Parliamentary Secretary agree that today's Order Paper indicates that I am not the only Deputy who is having this problem?  Similar questions are down with names and addresses supplied by other Deputies.  This has become the pattern of parliamentary questions to the Department of Social Welfare put down not by me but by many other Deputies over a period?  Would he not agree with that?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrankCluskey" hpid="Mr. Cluskey Mr. Cluskey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cluskey</NameTxt>
      <P>I think the Deputy will agree that I have never maintained that the Department are never at fault.  Undoubtedly there are occasions when they are.  If the Deputy looks at the record for the past 20 months he will see the number of times I have come into the House and accepted responsibility for what I described as unjustified delay.  With regard to other questions on the Order Paper, undoubtedly with the large volumes of claims paid and processed there are delays due to human error on the part of members of the staff of the Department.  I accept full responsibility when they occur.</P>
      <P>I still maintain that what I said with regard to a number of questions along these lines submitted by the Deputy is true.  In his supplementary question he insinuated that there was some sort of conspiracy against him or his constituency. The majority of questions the Deputy has submitted along these lines have shown that the cause of the delay lies with the claimant.  I will go further.  In some cases the Deputy has already been informed by letter of the exact circumstances which caused the delay.</P>

On 29th October I wrote to the Department and, by return, I received an acknowledgment. In my communication I gave the British and Irish insurance numbers.

It happens that if no reply is received within two months unless a row is kicked up it is not followed up. The Parliamentary Secretary should instruct the officials in the unemployment and disability benefit section of his Department to follow such queries more assiduously.</P>

It would be very hard luck on somebody who, say, became eligible for a benefit on the 1st January to find <Col N="1758" /> that practically £1 million had been spent in this way.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>I have seen a report in an evening paper of the 28th November, 1974, that, according to the Construction Industry Federation, &mdash;I quote&mdash;&ldquo;the Government's plan to build 7,250 council houses as part of their 25,000 housing target this year is in serious trouble&rdquo;.  If such a statement, with which I strongly disagree, was made by the federation, they should not have made it without finding <Col N="1762" /> out the facts.  While completions to 30th September, 1974, amounted to only 2,031, the very high level of work in progress throughout the year, rising from 9,478 at end of December, 1973, to 12,438 at 30th September, 1974, should ensure that the target of 7,250 completions for the 12 months to the 31st March, 1975, will be met. I might add that a review of probable completions which I have made with local authorities suggests that the figure of 7,250 will be exceeded.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>With the permission of the Ceann Comhairle, I propose to take Questions Nos. 81 to 92 together.</P>
      <P>On road planning generally, it is the Government's policy to effect the optimum improvement of the road system, taking account of all the relevant factors, including present and potential traffic demands, the range of resources likely to be available and so on.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As to the standard of improvement of a particular route, this again will depend on all the relevant factors. As I indicated to the Deputy on 7th February, 1974, construction to motorway standard will be considered if projected traffic flows indicate that this type of road would be the most efficient and economical.  The Local <Col N="1768" /> Government (Roads and Motorways) Act, 1974, provides local authorities with the necessary powers to construct and operate such roads.</P>
    <P>As regards the construction of particular motorways, I would refer the Deputy to the terms of the 1974 Act. No scheme for a motorway under the Act has been submitted to me and in view of my functions under the Act, it would be inappropriate for me to comment in advance on any possible scheme.</P>
    <P>It is not possible because of the number and variety of influencing factors, to give a standard figure for the estimated cost of constructing a mile of motorway.  Location, ground conditions, cost of land and property, spacing of interchanges, number and type of underpasses or overpasses are some of the factors which would effect considerably the cost of a motorway. The cost in an urban area could be more than the cost in a rural area.</P>
    <P>As to preliminary investigations into a proposed new road, including a motorway, this is a matter for the local authority or local authorities concerned.  I have not got details of the expenditure incurred on specific investigations into such proposals, although I am aware that the local authorities concerned with the approach roads into Dublin have the subject under active consideration. Road Fund grant allocations for 1975 have not yet been determined, but in their determination due account will be taken, <i>inter alia,</i> of the need for advance planning of specific routes.</P>
    <P>As regards the condition of the Dublin-Kinnegad route, no doubt sections of it are inadequate for present, and for future, traffic, as indeed, as the Deputy will be well aware, are sections of other national routes.  The overall requirements of the road system will be taken into account duly in the allocation of Road Fund grants.</P>

Could I ask the Minister who does he expect will submit him a scheme for a motorway on this road, bearing in mind that the Department of Local Government are now paying 100 per cent of the grants for primary roads and that the proposed motorway or major highway would traverse several counties? Whom is he expecting to take the initiative in this if it is not the Minister and the Government?</P>

      <P>If Deputy Molloy had not been Minister for Local Government for a period I could forgive him his supplementary question, but I am quite sure that having been there and knowing what the rules are, he must know, or he should know, that the initiative must come from the local authority or local authorities.  I have no power to tell local authorities that they must construct a motorway. When they come to me I shall deal with them fairly expeditiously, I can assure Deputy Molloy.  Deputy Molloy is aware from another instance very recently that it is not a question of simply telling a local authority: &ldquo;All right, you go ahead and do this, because this is the way I want it.&rdquo; The Department of Local Government cannot initiate either a motorway or a bridge.  They must wait for the local authority to introduce it first.</P>

      <P>Could I ask the Minister if he is aware that the initiative for the preliminary work that was undertaken in determining a route for such a road came from the then Minister, and that the local authorities in question would not act unless they had an assurance that the move was going to be supported by Government funds, in this case 100 per cent of the cost; and that a decision from the Minister, with the backing of the <Col N="1770" /> Government, is required to give the guarantee to local authorities that they can involve themselves in detailed planning and in heavy expenditure involved in such a project?  No initiative has been taken by the Minister.</P>

There were absolutely no efforts made by the Department of Local Government because they had no power to make these local authorities prepare a motorway.  It is up to the local authorities&mdash;and I have told them so&mdash;to make their own proposals, and they do not need any guarantees from this Government, because this Government have made it quite clear that they will pay 100 per cent of the cost when the local authority produce an acceptable scheme.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>It is my policy and practice as Minister for Local Government to promote road safety by all the means at my disposal.  The Deputy is of course aware of the various measures taken, with continuing effect, for the improvement of the road system, for the safety of vehicles and for the correct use of the roads by pedestrians, drivers and other road users.  I can assure the Deputy that these measures and programmes are kept under continuous review by me.</P>
      <P>As regards current developments, I would mention that priority attention is being paid in the annual programme of works to sections of roads found to have been high accident locations. On the vehicles side, studies are in progress regarding the introduction of a vehicle inspection scheme in due course.  I am satisfied too that the driving test is continuing to help in the creation of a safer body of vehicle users.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Road safety education and publicity also play a big part in the prevention of road accidents.  The functions of my Department in this area have been assigned by me to the National Road Safety Association to secure greater co-ordination of road safety activities with the maximum possible involvement of the community at all levels. The association have already taken a major step in this direction with the introduction of the &ldquo;Safe Cross Code&rdquo;, which though primarily aimed at children involves their parents and <Col N="1776" /> the schools.  The association is pursuing a vigorous programme aimed at all sections of the community to promote a greater awareness of the need for safety on our roads.</P>
    <P>I hope that all these measures will serve to maintain the downward movement in the accident statistics that has been in evidence in the past two years.</P>

Consideration is also being given by my Department to the further measures which may be necessary to comply with an EEC directive on the disposal of waste oils which was approved by the Council of Ministers on 7th November, 1974.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>The introduction of a broadly based tax is not a matter for my Department.  I do not know of any major difficulty in the way of general application of the polluter pays principle in the sense in which this is being advocated in the EEC and with appropriate exceptions as envisaged.

    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>

I believe that no matter how rich a person is, if he does something that is wrong he should not be able to buy his way out of it.  I understand what Deputy Lemass has been saying because it has been introduced in some countries already.  If we introduced this people would do things because they felt they could get away with them by paying a fine afterwards. This would be wrong.</P>

    <Speaker pid="NoelTLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">

      <P>Could I put to the Minister the kind of situation that can arise where a relatively small industry perhaps are guilty of causing pollution and where it would cost more money to stop the pollution than the industry could afford?

I would prefer to deal with it in another way rather than establish a precedent by allowing somebody with a very big business to claim he should get away on the grounds that this had been done previously.  That danger is in it. I have not closed my mind completely to it, but what I have said is correct. I am not enamoured with the idea.</P>

      <P>For a full account of the environmental work of my Department over the period referred to I would refer the Deputy to my Estimate speech of 17th and 18th July last and to the information given in reply to various questions since then.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I propose to confine myself now to <Col N="1783" /> a brief resumé of the main activities.</P>
    <P>The strengthening of the physical planning system is provided for by the Local Government (Planning and Development) Bill, 1974, which is at present before the House.</P>
    <P>Work on drafting legislation for the better control of water pollution is at an advanced stage.</P>
    <P>Other aspects of pollution control legislation are being kept under review and any further measures that are needed will be introduced.</P>
    <P>There has been a major increase in the capital allocations for the sanitary services programme, which includes provision for treatment works.</P>
    <P>Air pollution control inspections under the Alkali etc.  Works Regulation Act, 1906, have been intensified. Local authorities have been asked to review and extend their air monitoring operations with particular reference to ensuring enforcement of planning conditions. Similarly advice has been provided on interim measures for water pollution control.  Progress on the preparation of local contingency plans for dealing with oil pollution has been maintained.</P>
    <P>It has been recommended to local authorities that they should examine and modernise their waste collection and disposal services and they have been given specific advice on how to do this.  I have written to local authorities on a number of occasions asking them to step up their efforts to control and reduce litter.</P>
    <P>The ongoing programmes of my Department in matters relating to housing, road development and provision of swimming pools and amenities also contribute significantly towards the improvement of the living environment.</P>
    <P>New arrangements have been made to promote better liaison and co-operation between Departments in environmental matters.  A new inter-departmental environment committee has been set up with an important advisory role in this regard.</P>
    <P>Arrangements are being finalised for setting up the Water Pollution Advisory Council, which is expected to have <Col N="1784" /> their first meeting early in the coming year.</P>
    <P>My Department are taking an active part in the EEC Environment Programme. In November I attended a council meeting of Environment Ministers at which a number of important matters were considered.  I also attended a meeting at ministerial level of the OECD Environment Committee as a means of keeping in touch with international developments generally in this area.</P>

      <P>Is the Minister aware that one of the biggest problems in relation to litter facing all local authorities, particularly urban authorities, is the disposal of the refuse and litter?  Have his Department any suggested plans or have they investigated the various ways of disposal and the cost of same?  Have they given any guidance or made suggestions to local authorities?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>We have and we have not been able to find a cheaper or better method of disposal than the very much maligned dump, which is being used at present.  We have asked all local authorities to try to modernise the collection system so that when it is dumped it will be done in such a way that it will take up the least possible area.  We have appealed to people&mdash;and I now appeal to them again&mdash;not to put newspapers or other types of paper into the refuse collections because they are throwing away very valuable material.  If they do not want it charitable organisations would be only too glad to collect it if they make arrangements or leave it outside their gates to have it collected.</P>

      <P>Most local authorities have reasonable dumps.  It is difficult around the cities, because most of their dumps are almost full up at present.  I am not getting complaints about the existing dumps.  I am getting complaints about people who do not believe in dumping in a proper way but who feel that outside somebody's gate or along the side of the road is the proper place to dump. This is what is causing trouble and we are trying to get local authorities to increase their efforts to prevent this type of thing happening.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>The applicant in this case applied on the basis that he had undergone a test already and so need only pay a fee of £1.  It was not possible to confirm this, despite correspondence with him.  Further investigation was undertaken which did not prove any more fruitful.  In all the circumstances, it has been decided now to arrange a test for the applicant on 17th December on the basis that he had claimed, and he has been notified of this arrangement.  I may add that in correspondence <Col N="1790" /> the applicant forwarded a further £1, but the total of £2 forwarded by him was still less than the fee of £3 for a first test.</P>
      <P>I understand that the Deputy's letter of 15th October was mislaid.  I regret this and have instructed that arrangements be made to avoid a recurrence. The Deputy wrote subsequently on 9th December and a reply to this letter was being prepared when he put down his question.</P>
      <P>I may say that it is a pity that so much delay and confusion has occurred in this case, to the inconvenience of the applicant and the Deputy.  In fairness I should say that the section dealing with driving tests carries a heavy volume of work and have a very good record in their dealings with the public.  I apologise to Deputy Lalor for what happened.  It should not have happened even though it was simply a question of a file being mislaid.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for the Public Service when it is proposed to introduce legislation which will help to centralise responsibility for matters concerning conservation and the environment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Since matters concerning conservation and the environment arise as an integral part of the work and statutory responsibilities of many Departments and agencies of Government, each Department has primary responsibility for the environmental implications of its own programmes. Legislation to centralise responsibility for such matters would raise serious operational problems. Instead, arrangements have been made for co-ordination and review in relation to environmental matters between the Departments concerned.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>There is, in fact, practical centralisation from day to day because of co-ordination between <Col N="1793" /> the multitudes of agencies which have different degrees of responsibility.  I would not think it would necessarily be any better if it were to be institutionalised and, indeed, it might have the reverse effect.</P>

      <P>Will the Minister not agree that it would be desirable to have one person, either a Minister or one of the Parliamentary Secretaries, to advise the Government and to centralise information on all matters concerning the environment so that there will be no clash of interests between one Department and another which can very easily happen and, indeed does, and happened in the previous Administration also?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for the Public Service if he will place greater emphasis on citizen participation in policy formation at all levels.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>As the Taoiseach said on the day the Government came into office:</P>
      <P>This Government were founded in a spirit of co-operation and I believe that that spirit of co-operation will influence their work and guide their activities.  We will seek the co-operation of the groups of citizens in the community who have come together to further a particular improvement in dealing with their social ills.  We will seek in addition the co-operation of the trade unions and the employers in order to bring greater harmony to our industrial relations. We will also co-operate with farmers' groups and vocational interests with a view to increasing living standards for all our people, and with regional groups who are rightly concerned to diminish regional inequalities which exist.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Government are in favour of extending citizen participation in policy formation at all levels and a few <Col N="1794" /> examples of action in this area may help to indicate progress.  The recent White Paper &ldquo;A National Partnership&rdquo; is a typical example of the Government's plans to evoke public co-operation; the White Paper on Capital Taxation, which I published as Minister for Finance in February last was another illustration of the Government's desire to seek a positive contribution from the public at the prelegislation stage.  The process of consultation was extended on the Government's initiative in the recent meetings with unions, employers and farmers and it has been institutionalised by our setting up of such bodies as the National Economic and Social Council and the Public Service Advisory Council.  In consumer affairs, the recent establishment of the Post Office Users' Council provides a headline.  At the level of grass roots participation, the current developments in regard to committees of school management are also indicative of concern with citizen participation.</P>
    <P>In the course of ordinary day-to-day contacts and correspondence and in receiving deputations, Ministers regularly obtain suggestions on policy matters from citizens.  Due consideration, of course, is given to all such representations and, where appropriate, points raised are taken into account when policy is being formulated and arranged.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>For the year 1973-74 the amount of income tax in respect of interest payments on deposits with building societies is estimated at £1,850,000.  I might add that tax concessions to building societies, their depositors and members cost in the region of £4 million annually and the Exchequer subsidy to enable the interest rate on loans to be 1¼ per cent less than it would otherwise be, amounts to £2.4 million per annum.  Thus, building societies enjoy a net profit annually at the expense of the Exchequer of £4,550,000.</P>

      <P>I do not share the Deputy's pessimistic view on the unemployment situation.  As stated in the recent white paper on the economy, Government policy is to give priority to the maintenance of employment and the preservation of living standards. Already I have announced an increase of 18 per cent in the provision for voted capital services in 1975 as compared with 1974-75.  Expenditure on arterial drainage will be 28 per cent greater in 1975 compared with 1974-75.  No scheme of public works on the lines the Deputy mentions is held up for lack of finance.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Finance if, in view of recent developments concerning farm prices, he will make a statement in the light of his reply to Question No 102 of 3rd May, 1973.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>In my reply of 3rd May, 1973, I spoke of the Government's anxiety to balance the opportunity of improvements in farm incomes with the equally important objective of controlling inflation.  This is still a basic concern of the Government.  I also spoke of the important role of agriculture in our economy and the national interest requirement that we obtain the best possible prices for our exports, including exports of farm produce, in order that we be in a position to pay for our imports.</P>
      <P>As Deputies know, 1974 was a difficult year for some farmers, both here and in other countries, due to low cattle and beef prices and steeply rising costs of production.  The difficulties of agriculture throughout the EEC led to the Council of Ministers agreeing to a special &ldquo;package&rdquo; of measures implemented on 7th October, 1974.  In our case, this package provided for an increase in farm prices of approximately 16 per cent through the general increase of 5 per cent and the Irish green £ adjustment of 11 per cent and consequential reduction in monetary charges on our exports.  As a result of these measures, Irish agriculture will benefit by £50-£60 million a year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the White Paper, &ldquo;A National Partnership&rdquo;, the Government have pointed out that the balance of payments problem is an extremely serious one and that in 1975 we must make a start in reducing the deficit which will be about £300 million this year.  Part of this deficit is, of course, attributable to low cattle and beef prices; for next <Col N="1805" /> year, the improved prospects for our agricultural exports generally and particularly as a result of the EEC package will be an important factor in this regard.</P>
    <P>While the price of certain food items has risen as a result of the arrangements agreed to, I am satisfied that the package will have an overall beneficial effect on our economy as a whole.</P>

      <P>In the case of CIE contractors using petrol driven vehicles on school transport operations, I understand that it has already been decided that, as in the case of previous fuel cost increases in December, 1973, and February, 1974, those contractors will be compensated by CIE for the recent petrol cost increase and, therefore, the question of granting a reduction in the tax on petrol, as suggested by the Deputy, does not arise.</P>

      <P>A national programme of arterial drainage is proceeding as rapidly as resources allow on the basis of settled and published priority lists.

    <Speaker pid="JohnGrattanEsmonde" hpid="Mr. Esmonde Mr. Esmonde">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Esmonde</NameTxt>
      <P>There seems to have been a fair amount of sound and fury in relation to this Bill providing for increased health contributions and one must, I think, look at the matter in the context in which it arises.  One can see that the present contribution of £7 per year or 13p per week has been in existence since 1971 and there is no doubt that the cost of the health services has almost doubled since 1971-72. This has been partly due to increased costings and partly to improved services and I think we should take a realistic view of this contribution which is now asked for of 26p per week or £12 per annum.  In effect, what these contributors are asked to <Col N="1829" /> pay is less than the price of 20 cigarettes per week and bearing in mind the increased and better services, it is a small amount to ask people to pay. I know that times are difficult and costs have risen right across the board but for people to get excited about the fact that they are being asked to pay less than the price of 20 cigarettes per week just does not seem sensible, having regard to the excitement that is being generated from the Opposition benches.</P>
      <P>The health contribution to date brought in £5 million per year and this will bring in £3½ million, and if one estimated it, one would probably find that the actual benefit which people in this category receive when related to what they are asked to contribute is something like 10 per cent, if even that.  As the Minister rightly pointed out, the contributions to date bear very favourable comparison with those required in other voluntary insurance schemes, be they run by private institutions or by the Voluntary Health Board.  I personally have always been an advocate of contributions towards mental services and I think that viewpoint is gaining strength in the country.  One hears a lot of criticism about people wastefully and unnecessarily availing of medical services.  If there is this situation, it means that unnecessary and increased costs are being visited on the nation and this ultimately has the effect of restricting the availability of health services, institutional or otherwise, which could be made for the rest of the nation and preventing other categories being brought in for what one might call subsidised benefits.</P>
      <P>One must look at this Bill in the light of the Estimate for the Department. One sees that the Estimate shows a 40 per cent increase and this means that money has to be found. The average person today would not be prepared to accept the medical services and the medical treatment provided ten years ago.  People now demand a better standard of treatment and they demand services on a much wider scale than were heretofore considered sufficient.  I was glad to hear the Minister when introducing his Estimate refer to community care.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1830" /> I can look at medicine from what is a slightly privileged position being the son of a family doctor.  I can see the tremendous improvements that have occurred in medical science. Cases that were utterly hopeless and untreatable, except in a palliative sense, are now treatable; conditions that would have incapacitated people years ago can now be corrected and those treated can live normal lives. I was very impressed on visiting a hospital outside the city environment to see people well over 70 years of age undergoing major bone surgery, people who prior to treatment were hardly able to move.  They had every guarantee that, if they underwent major surgery, they would be vastly improved physically but, even more important, they had every guarantee they would survive the surgery.  This is just one piece of evidence of the improvement in medical care and medical surgery.  Many of my constituents have availed of the service in the hospital to which I refer.  They pay the contribution of £7 a year under the Health Act.  In return they are provided with a truly wonderful service for this very small sum.  I am a contributor to the VHI because I do not come within the £7 a year category. I do not begrudge the money I pay to the VHI though the contributions are a great deal higher <i>per capita</i> than would be the case if I were in the category paying £7 a year. This bears out what the Minister said; the requirements of this Bill compare very favourably with the payments under the voluntary health insurance scheme.</P>
    <P>It is becoming very apparent that re-thinking will be required in the implementation of the health services at all levels.  One has only to walk through the corridors of this House and discover for oneself how many Deputies are carrying antibiotics in their pockets.  We are living in an antibiotic age.  If a person develops a sniffle he runs to the doctor and asks for an antibiotic.  He does not wait for the doctor to prescribe.  I am told by doctors that patients actually name the medicine they require. The doctor is in a difficult position because he has got to keep the confidence <Col N="1831" /> of his patient.  This is vital in all aspects of medicine.  There is wide and wholesale abuse of antibiotics and one now actually hears people inveighing against antibiotics and their abuse.  Over-usage is amply demonstrated in the huge range of antibiotic drugs available and in the enormous sums of money made by chemical firms churning out antibiotics.  I do not know what the figures are but it would be a useful exercise&mdash;it is information the Minister might be able to obtain for the House&mdash;to make a comparison of the quantity used and the money spent on antibiotics today as against ten years ago.  Even making allowance for inflation and increased costs I believe there would be a very large figure as a multiplier to explain the difference in the figures.</P>
    <P>The Minister, when introducing his Estimate, referred to his ambitions in respect of general surgical hospitals and general surgical treatment.  I assume that includes physician treatment. This is a vital service that must be provided.  I know there are difficulties. I know there are competing interests.  I know that people want hospitals.  I know this is under investigation. It is a thorny problem because one is dealing with humans, with local loyalties and local history.  The service is a vital one.  It is one that must be maintained at the highest possible level and it is in relation to this service that this payment is required to provide some sort of subvention towards the service.</P>
    <P>I have been told over and over again by constituents that they regard the £7 a year as very, very cheap indeed.  When one bears in mind the cost of a fully paid patient in a general hospital at today's prices, this payment is minute in relation to the actual cost.  One does not need to produce statistics to prove that.  Every family is aware of it, particularly those families which have had to bear the cost of surgical medical treatment in a general hospital, not to talk about a specialist hospital.  On many occasions, in my capacity as a public representative, I have had to make representations <Col N="1832" /> on behalf of constituents because they were not in a position to meet the bill presented and a system of instalment payments had to be arranged.</P>
    <P>We should be realistic in our approach to this Bill.  We should realise what it means and what it will provide for those who come within the ambit of the scheme.</P>
    <P>In relation to general hospital costs and expenses I believe, and many other people believe, that sometimes there is an undue demand on the hospital services, a demand which need not necessarily be made and, if not made, would not harm the patients. There is an undue demand on the X-ray service for comparatively minor injuries which could be diagnosed and dealt with clinically in the doctor's surgery.  I also believe that a great deal more minor surgery could be done by ordinary practitioners instead of referring the patients to hospital.</P>
    <P>I have in mind in particular the suturing of patients after accidents. It seems to have become a regular procedure that, if a person has a would, he is referred to hospital for suturing.  That used not to be the case years ago and many doctors still do their own normal suturing in accident cases.  A tremendous number of the medical profession are referring these patients to general hospitals. Very often the suturing which is carried out in these hospitals is done by young doctors who have just qualified.  I cannot see why general practitioners with years of experience behind them cannot do this work themselves.  If they did, they would be taking a fairly substantial load off the expenses involved in the running of general hospitals and particularly out-patients' departments.</P>
    <P>We are all aware of the congestion in the out-patients' departments of general hospitals.  Many of the patients in the out-patients' department need not be there and should not have been sent there by doctors.  I know the general public have direct access to the out-patients' department after accidents. When they have gone to a suitably qualified doctor, an able doctor, <Col N="1833" /> I do not see why that doctor cannot carry out minor surgery himself in the nature of suturing and ordinary repair work of that kind.</P>
    <P>I have already said that I regard the too free dispensation of antibiotics as a bad thing.  We are going through this period at the moment.  It is world wide.  It is rather frightening to see the difference in the prices of antibiotics. A first-class book is available to every medical practitioner.  It is freely availed of and freely used by practitioners.  It is a little book called <i>Mims.</i>  I understand that a Deputy of this House is responsible for its production, its design and up-dating.  It is a most efficient publication.  General practitioners, public health officers and doctors avail of this book.  It is produced regularly.</P>
    <P>If you look at this book you will find that it puts the various drugs and antibiotics under various headings, says what they are used for, also gives their contra-indications.</P>
    <P>It also states&mdash;and this is where I take issue with the medical profession in the use of modern drugs&mdash;the price of the drugs at retail level to a patient. I have seen a difference of from £1.20 to £5 in the price of antibiotics used for exactly the same condition.  Just because one happened to be the most recent one it was being used as the new thing.  It was not called penicillin; it was called something else.  It was a new name.  There is a sort of game of keeping up with the Joneses, keeping up with the new stuff.</P>
    <P>I take issue with certain doctors who say they want to do clinical trials on a new drug to satisfy themselves that it is the right one for the purpose. Surely these drugs were tested before they were put on the market.  Surely there is information in medical literature on what they can and cannot be used for.  Why should a general practitioner indulge in this sort of clinical trial?  The main offenders are the younger brigade of general practitioners. I am not saying they are necessarily doing wrong, but they are increasing the cost of the medical services unnecessarily.  They are doing work they may not be fully qualified to do.  If the drugs have been passed <Col N="1834" /> for a certain purpose, they should be used for that.  They should not just pick the expensive drug.</P>
    <P>Where there is a difference of from £1 to £5 for pills or antibiotics for a certain condition, the doctor should stop and think and have regard to the cost and, if the cheaper medicine can do the job, it should be availed of. There might be a tendency where medical card cases are involved, and where there is free medicine, for doctors to avail all too freely of these expensive drugs which are not necessarily required for the condition being treated.  Unfortunately all of us are being made to pay for that.</P>
    <P>I know I would be severely criticised in medical circles for suggesting this, but it is time that we started to think about a national formulary.  If a booklet of 100 pages or so can be produced by a private concern which is regularly availed of and used by the medical profession, I do not see why something cannot be done at national level and only certain drugs made available for free medicines.  This can be done.  It would help to control the situation.</P>
    <P>It is very hard for the Government in a small country like this to control the price the manufacturer puts on a new drug.  It could be controlled by the process of exclusion and inclusion in a national formulary.  This message should be brought home to the doctors. I mentioned this at a public meeting recently and a certain medical man took issue with me and said it was not feasble.  He did not give any reason.  I should like to know why it is not feasible to introduce a national formulary.  Under the old dispensary system a code of that nature was used. Doctors have told me that was the position.  Even making allowance for difficult and rare conditions that can occur, when a special drug has to be used the doctor can prescribe it and a claim for reimbursement can be made.  It must be justified in the circumstances of the case.  This loose prescribing in the sense of not having regard to the costings involved has in large measure increased the costs of the health services.</P>
    <P>I know the Minister is very keen <Col N="1835" /> on the community care programme. I should like to see something being done in conjunction with the community care programme in relation to education on health.  Many of us have been reared on the basis that to talk about health is being neurotic, that one is a hypochondriac if one takes an interest in health.  The view has been: leave it to the doctor on a sort of witch doctor basis.  It is about time that our education should bear in some way on the fundamental of physiology, on normal good health and on how people can manage themselves.</P>
    <P>If people were educated on health to a better extent than they are or could be by reading articles in newspapers or magazines many of them would not have to have recourse to doctors.  If anyone asks the average family practitioner what percentage of his patients have a sort of nerve condition and are given tranquilisers or reassurance and yet have not got a physiological problem, one finds that the percentage is very high.  That is largely born out of ignorance and fear.  I am speaking from a slightly privileged position in this regard being the son of a doctor.  I have seen cases, heard of cases and spoken to patients on this matter of health.  I have come to the conclusion that if one can reassure such patients they are new people.</P>
    <P>When one considers the contribution called for by this Bill one must bear in mind that in 1972-73 £36 million was provided out of the rates for our health services.  In 1974 that figure was reduced to £13½ million. This has meant a tremendous load off the rates and that will be to the benefit of many people who are contributors under this scheme.  However there is more to it than that, because certain counties are better off than others.  Some counties have been able to find money easier for health services in their own administrative area. Putting the money on the Exchequer has meant an evening up of the general health service across the country. It has meant that there is no discrimination between the wealthy area and the poor area.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1836" /> Deputy O'Malley referred to the fact that contributors to the Voluntary Health Insurance Scheme, in order to qualify for benefit, must spend 24 hours in hospital.  I understand that is still the position.  It was the position some years ago when I availed of the service.  At that time I had to go into hospital for a test which could have been done in a matter of hours but, in order to avail of the scheme, I had to be booked into the hospital for 24 hours.  I regarded this as unnecessary.  The Voluntary Health Insurance Board would be doing a good service to medicine in general if they had another look at this aspect of their scheme because this means that people are unnecessarily occupying beds in general and other hospitals.</P>
    <P>I know that an ENT specialist in order to save money for the parents of a young person who had had his tonsils removed arranged to have a taxi waiting outside the out-patient department of the hospital so that the child could be sent home immediately after the operation.  When the parents sought recoupment from the Voluntary Health Insurance Board they were told they could not qualify because the child had not spent 24 hours in hospital.</P>
    <P>I may have been critical in my contribution in relation to the use of antibiotics but I can plead a certain amount of bias because for things like the common cold and so on I do not avail of antibiotics, I use herbs.  Many people consider that peculiar, but herbs were good enough for my grandparents and, because they give me the desired results and alleviate me of the aches or pains, they are good enough for me. The old and tried remedies can bring the same, if not better, results and in many cases a much quicker cure than the standard antibiotic type of treatment.</P>
    <P>At the outset I said that I was in favour of contribution for a service but I believe also in involvement by the public in our health service.  This has been very apparent in relation to mentally and physically handicapped people, particularly young people. <Col N="1837" /> There has been a wonderful surge of interest in this regard.  The movement started on a purely voluntary basis and, although it has been only a few years in operation, a tremendous amount of voluntary work has been done in those fields.  I do not think that the present care for handicapped people would be at the stage it is today were it not for the impetus given by voluntary workers.  In this regard the State is a latecomer to treatment of these people but, even though the State has since become involved, those who worked in a voluntary capacity in this field have not backed out or sought to do less work. The contrary is the position.  There has been an increase and ever growing interest in this field.  There is a lesson to be learned from that and it is one that might be applied when we come to consider the community care programme the Minister has in mind.</P>
    <P>If there was voluntary participation by people that scheme could be far more successful.  When people are voluntarily involved in a scheme of this kind such a scheme tends to be more successful.  I am certain that there are many married qualified nurses who would be prepared to assist in such a scheme on a purely voluntary part-time basis.</P>
    <P>If these people were allowed participate in such a scheme, it would get off the ground much quicker and be far more successful.  I know people will argue that one might be doing somebody out of a job.  I do not think there is any fear whatever of that allegation being made in relation to community care services because, certainly at the beginning of this proposed scheme, there will be less than is required; the demands will be far more than can be met.  There is plenty of room for voluntary involvement at that level.  That, coupled with health education, could improve the general health of the nation and redound to everybody's benefit.</P>
    <P>I see also that the Minister is taking a very keen interest in child health services.  This is something that should be given the utmost support because a lot of illnesses have their seeds sown in the young age groups and, if not <Col N="1838" /> attended to at that age, can have very deleterious and serious effects on people in later life.  We are aware of that in regard to heart cases.  Modern heart surgery has brought a lot of light to bear in this regard.  We are also aware that kidney complaints can ultimately result in a severe mental handicap.  These are all recent developments in medicine.  Therefore, the original child health service provided in national schools was insufficient in the light of present-day knowledge.</P>
    <P>I am glad to note that the Minister is taking a particular interest in this field because children cannot protect or provide for themselves.  It has got to be done by an outside agency.  The all-seeing eye of a good health service is required in this regard.  One could talk for a long time on the subject of health, which is a rather emotive one but I think I have said enough.  I would ask the Opposition spokesman&mdash; I know Deputy G. Collins is full of fire and brimstone and will rise to his feet when I have concluded&mdash;to remember that there has been no increase in the charge to contributors since 1971 while wages, costs, everything has risen, the new charge called for is less than the price of 20 cigarettes.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GerardCollins" hpid="Mr. G. Collins Mr. G. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>First, I should say that the Minister for Health is welcome into the House with this legislation, it being the first he has introduced since he became Minister for Health.  At the outset, one is temped to ask the Minister why it took him 20 months to bring legislation before this House.  Members of this House, the medical profession and the public at large know full well that there is much the Minister for Health could be doing.  A lot of what can be done can be done only when it has been passed in and approved by this House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are those who say that the Minister for Health is slightly nervous in coming into this House with legislation, possibly afraid of criticism not alone from this side of the House but from Members on his own side and, in particular, from members of his own party.  I shall deal with Deputy Esmonde's contribution in a very short time but may I say that, in the period <Col N="1839" /> of 20 months during which Deputy Corish has been Minister for Health, we have had the minimum discussion on the affairs of his Department, despite undertakings given by him that full discussion would take place.  Naturally, one asks oneself the question: &ldquo;Are these public undertakings to be uttered when forced to be given and to be forgotten when the time comes for discussion?&rdquo; I know that the Minister for Health, during his time in public life, has taken his share of criticism, publicly of course, from the Opposition whether or not this party were in Government. But I do not think our criticism would be sufficient to prevent the Minister coming into this House and affording the people here the right which is theirs, the right to discuss health matters.  Perhaps the Minister is super-sensitive to the criticism he knows he is getting, publicly and privately, and will get publicly from members of his own party.</P>
    <P>This Bill has been described as fraudulent and hypocritical by members of the Labour Party.  I would refer the House to the contribution made by Deputy O'Connell when this Bill was introduced by the Minister yesterday.  One would never think, having listened to and read what Deputy O'Connell said, and having listened to Deputy Esmonde from Wexford, that they were talking about the same thing.  Indeed, Deputy Esmonde, in concluding his contribution, inferred that I was not too comfortable looking in my seat here, that I was waiting for the opportunity to get in and express some of the opinions I hold.  Of course, he was right.  In the course of his contribution, which lasted practically 45 minutes, his opening and closing sentences only dealt with the matter before this House.  Let me add further that his opening and closing sentences were exactly similar, that is, that the percentage increase required can be dismissed instantly because of its smallness.  He likened the increase to the price of a packet of cigarettes and left it at that.  As for the remainder of his contribution, it would appear that he had an obsession <Col N="1840" /> with antibiotics.  I suppose he can be allowed an opportunity of registering his personal dislike for their use any time he likes.  But it is difficult to understand how he felt that this was the right time and place to do so. Everybody who has come to the use of reason knows that antibiotics are given always on prescription.  Certainly I have enough faith&mdash;if Deputy Esmonde has not&mdash;in the medical profession to issue antibiotics only when necessary, on prescription, to those in need of them.  Might I point out another criticism he had to voice which was one levelled at the demand on the hospital services?  It would appear from the approach of Deputy Esmonde that any person, for any reason, could walk off the street into a hospital and demand service, demand a bed, room and doctors and nurses to look after him.  Of course, that is not so and Deputy Esmonde&mdash; who is in the privileged position of being the son of a country general practitioner&mdash;should know at least that doctors have a very great say in sending patients to hospitals for care and attention.  Might I say further, for fear his fellow-countyman, the Minister for Health, might be influenced by him, that the advice he gave that people injured in accidents should not be brought to hospital for treatment, that there should be treatment provided in places other than hospitals, is something I cannot accept in the bland fashion we heard it expressed.</P>
    <P>Deputy Esmonde is very wrong in his thinking on this.  He is very wrong when he says the patient would only be attended in hospital by young doctors.  I want to say to him, if nobody else from his party or the party tied up with them say it to him, that the people owe a big debt to the young doctors who have been running our hospitals for us.  Deputy Esmonde's contribution is no more than a smokescreen to try to cover the fact that this Bill is nothing more than a tax Bill.</P>
    <P>There are people who believe that this Bill, seeing it is doing what it is planned to do by those promoting it, could have waited until the budget day although the last week would <Col N="1841" /> lead one to believe that budget day on 15th January next is not really that day as we knew it but that we are having a budget every day.  This is the third blow in less than a week to a very weak sector of the community, who are not as well organised as one would want them to be if they were to speak up on their own behalf and protect their interests.</P>
    <P>The penal taxation measure by the Minister for Health, together with other actions of the Government in recent days, the unbelievably high increase in the price of petrol and the very steep increase in the price of a pound of butter, which we learned of yesterday, all add up to a large increase in taxation.  The people most affected by these new demands on them are those whom, I am sorry to say, the Minister for Health and members of his party are at great pains to tell us they represent.  My interpretation of representation is different from that.</P>
    <P>Almost every day in recent times we find increases in the price of goods of all types.  The natural consequences of these varied prices is that it is becoming increasingly more difficult for the poorer sections of the people to eke out a living.  The Labour/Fine Gael Government are guilty of grave indifference to the problems of the poorer section of the community. Those people who have supported the Labour Party and what they stood for have now the feeling of being let down with a bang.  They have the feeling of being neglected and thrown to the wolves but they are not as gullible as some of the people on the opposite benches think they are.  They will not exonerate the Government and blame the Arabs, as they are told to do, by the well-geared public relations section of the Labour/Fine Gael Government.</P>
    <P>It is easy for those who want to play with figures to say that the increase is only a matter of pence.  That is not so because the people involved had no say in the matter.  They were not consulted and their co-operation was not asked for.  When I say that I am reminded of an answer given by the Minister for Finance at the <Col N="1842" /> end of Question Time today, when he spoke rather loudly but with his tongue in his cheek, in regard to a statement made by the Taoiseach in this House during the first days of the Labour/Fine Gael Coalition when he said that consultation with all sectors was to be the key word of the new administration.</P>
    <P>We will find, when the Minister for Health has his Bill tucked under his arm when he leaves this House and goes to the Seanad, that the working man will have had no say whatsoever, will not have been asked whether he minds about this increase in his contribution for health.  It will be taken from him, whether he likes it or not, because it will be taken out of his pay packet.</P>
    <P>The people I referred to in the category who will now pay £12 a year contribution under this Bill&mdash;it was £7 before this&mdash;are the small farmers who are in a slightly different position from those who will have money stopped at source.  They will have the opportunity of being notified that their subscription is due and will be able to think about the sting when they have to pay the high percentage increase demanded of them.  It was said in recent times that difficulties were being experienced in the collection of moneys in lump sums.  If difficulties existed in getting sums of £7 from those who were participating in the scheme there will be real difficulty now in collecting this money particularly from the small farmers who can see practically everything going against them.  They can see they are always being used by the Labour/ Fine Gael Government when it suits them and not when it suits the small farmers.  Their incomes have been reduced to a very low amount.  Many of them are experiencing conditions which they thought they left behind them in the thirties when they suffered a loss as a result of the economic war.  Now, because of the failure of the Government in many fields, because of their action in some instances and lack of action in other instances these people are in extremely bad financial difficulties. Despite this they are being asked for <Col N="1843" /> increased contributions by the Minister for Health.</P>
    <P>I see real difficulties.  If the Minister agrees that the poorer sections of our community should be hit for more taxes, then he is not the man I thought he was, because you never hit a man when he is down.  The people who are being hit or who will be hit in their pockets when this Bill is law are the people who at present are down pretty low.  The small farmers who are eligible to participate in this scheme are low down and the working man must be down because of the fantastic and innumerable increases that have taken place over the last so many months.</P>
    <P>People are punch-drunk nowadays from increases.  They do not know where it is going to stop.  If the Tánaiste and Minister for Health wants proof of what I am saying, I can give it to him openly and clearly, and I shall do it now, in that those who supported him and his party from that sector of the community have clearly indicated their dissatisfaction and displeasure with the people whom the Minister for Health leads in this House.  Proof of this was seen in the most recent test we had with the electorate in North-East Cork.</P>

      <P>The election results take some time to analyse and study. Perhaps the Deputy who said &ldquo;We held our own&rdquo; has not completed his study.  However, the Deputy who said he held his own, a Deputy who supports the Coalition Government, is not in this instance speaking for the Labour Party, because they did not hold their own; they got a hammering in the most recent test at the polls.  There are people who are being hit hard, if the utterances of the Labour representative, Deputy Dr. John O'Connell, are to be believed, and let the Press take note that Deputy O'Connell was for a long time the spokesman appointed by the Tánaiste to deal with health matters when they were on this side of the House.  He has criticised things that have been done, and, let that be <Col N="1844" /> recognised as a very clear and very powerful warning that things are not well if they continue to operate as they are doing.</P>
      <P>Deputy Esmonde glibly but unsuccessfully, in the same manner as he dismissed the percentage increase in charges, tried to dismiss the contribution to this debate by our spokesman on health matters, Deputy Desmond O'Malley.  I have read more than once the unrevised reports of what Deputy O'Malley said in this debate for my party.  While he was highly critical, as rightly he should be, his remarks were very fair, constructive, and to the point.  It was with regret I listened to the third Limerick man who participated in this debate&mdash;a member of the Minister's own party, a man who is publicly known for his political indiscretion, his coarseness and earthiness&mdash;and who, following the fine contribution of Deputy O'Malley, descended, even for him, to a new low level in his criticisms and in his personal attack on Deputy O'Malley.</P>

All I can say is, having listened to him and having read what he said, that his laboured efforts showed his small-mindedness and his pettiness and that there is <Col N="1845" /> more to it than meets the eye.  Perhaps it is that he is very sensitive in his present political limbo and that he is also aware of the fact that Deputy O'Malley commands the respect and support that he does in Limerick city and the part of the county that joins with it to make up that constituency. Those who are in glasshouses should not throw stones.  I am sorry, Mr. Chairman, that you were not here yesterday to hear his contribution.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Power</NameTxt>
      <P>This is the first opportunity I have had to compliment the Minister on his good work.  I thank him for his courtesy and interest in any problem with which I approached him during the year.</P>
      <P>I am not happy with the provisions of the Bill.  In essence, it is a scheme to raise money in the best possible way&mdash;not the best from the health point of view but in a manner which is less politically painful and more politically palatable to the electorate. That is the guideline the Minister used when setting about this Bill.</P>
      <P>The increase to 26p per week, or £12 per year will bring in £3½ million. Who will pay it?  It is the working man who can least afford it who will be called upon to pay.  Admittedly, the £7 scheme was a good form of insurance for the ordinary man.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1847" /> The Irish Hospitals Sweepstakes charge £1 for their sweep tickets and have done for a long time.  To increase the charges might not be the best thing to do.  To increase the contributions to £12 might not have been the best thing to do either.  While people might have found it hard to contribute £7, to find £12 is another kettle of fish. Smallholders and small farmers whose incomes have dropped will not find it easy to get £12.</P>
    <P>The thinking behind the Bill is completely at variance with Coalition promises.  They promised that health charges would be removed from the rates.  That would have been good if it could have been implemented.  I agree that efforts have been made to implement it and it is being phased over a period.  In my view this measure will put a greater individual health tax on the worker or small farmer.  I cannot reconcile that with the thinking and promises of the National Coalition parties before they came into office.  To my mind those promises were never backed up with a determined, constructive and continuous policy geared towards funding its removal.  They should have known what was going to happen.  If the implications of their promises had been analysed they would have seen that a great deal of money had to be found.  This stop-gap measure proves that they did not plan for this. It also convinces me that there is no continuity of policy in the Department.</P>
    <P>Before the Minister took up his portfolio, the Department was under the aegis of the late Mr. Childers. At that time the Department of Health was in a healthy state.  Great strides were made then.  Better conditions were obtained for all members of the medical profession.  Big problems were seriously tackled, such as the setting up of the health boards. That was a formidable task.  There appears to have been dialogue at all times.  There seemed to be an air of &ldquo;I know where I'm going and I know who's going with me&rdquo; so far as the Department of Health were concerned during the Fianna Fáil administration. The theme song of the <Col N="1848" /> present administration is something of a more modern nature, more in keeping with the socialistic ideology of a Government health scheme for everyone whether they want it or not. &ldquo;Any dream will do&rdquo; would appear to be an appropriate theme song for the Minister and the Coalition.  The dream they had when they were in Opposition has turned into a nightmare now that they find themselves unexpectedly in Government.</P>

      <P>This doctrine of a central taxation funding health is to be bolstered up by greater individual taxation.  This is a policy whereby the poor person is paying for something he has already free.  Holders of GMS cards will be contributing 26p each week for something they already have for nothing.  It might be well if the Minister would look at the policies we are asking him to examine and see if there is not some merit in the suggestion that those who find themselves immediately above the income limit for a GMS card are the people who are hardest hit.  Is there not some merit in extending the net to include them?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have been approached recently by a number of people who are greatly perturbed by the notices they have received informing them that they are no longer eligible for free general medical services.  I hope that this is not the situation generally throughout <Col N="1849" /> the country.  It must be a cause of great anxiety for persons whose incomes are only slightly above the limit to be told that the services will no longer be available to them.  For a person with a take-home pay of £30 per week, the imposition of having to pay a doctor's fee might be a great hardship.</P>
    <P>While the 26p per week contribution towards health services may not appear to be significant, when added to all the other items in respect of which deductions are made, it could bring a person to the stage where he would ask himself if he might not be better off on social welfare benefits. Anything that would bring about a situation in which it would be more lucrative to avail of unemployment benefit than to work, would be deplorable and the Minister should ensure that no such circumstances will arise.</P>
    <P>Legislation such as this proves that there is a wavering policy so far as health is concerned.  If our doctors were to carry out a diagnosis of the health portfolio at present I think they would agree that there has been a rapid deterioration in this sphere.</P>
    <P>I agree with the principle of some contribution being paid towards the health services.  From my experience in another area I can say that when free books were given to school-children or, even when hurleys were given free to school teams, there was not as much appreciation of these services as there was in the case of those people who had to pay for them. The same can be said of medical treatment.  Doctors have told me that when treatment is free it is apt to be abused&mdash;for instance by patients taking up too much of the doctor's time unnecessarily and very often not bothering to take the medicines prescribed for them.  When there is an element of contribution there is less likelihood of wastage.</P>
    <P>Our policy should be to care for those people who are most in need. Fianna Fáil have always been consistent in their approach to these matters.  It would be very foolish of <Col N="1850" /> the Minister to sacrifice such aspirations for any doctrinaire considerations such as free health for all.  This may have sounded fine in opposition, but I am sure the Minister will agree now that it is not something that can be attained easily.  Indeed we might ask ourselves if such a change is really necessary.</P>
    <P>It is essential that we continue to develop our hospital resources.  There is room for much improvement and extension of services in hospitals such as Naas, for instance.  The Minister is to be complimented on continuing the groundwork laid by the previous administration in this regard.  However, while there have been many improvements at Naas Hospital, there is need for a geriatric unit there.  The Minister tells us that money is scarce. I suppose this means the non-availability of the capital expenditure required for the further development of hospitals but let us not lose sight of the fact that people must be our prime consideration.</P>
    <P>I would be concerned lest civil servants in any Department would draw a circle of, say, between 30 and 50 miles from Dublin and say that the necessary services are available within that area.  That has not happened so far but we should ensure that there will be no move in that direction.  I am happy with the functioning of the health boards but we must guard against decisions being taken that would mean the centralising of services, thereby, denying people in the peripheral areas the services that should be available to them.</P>
    <P>The care of the aged is very important and every effort should be made to make it possible for people to be kept at home in so far as is possible rather than to be sent to hospitals or institutions.  I know of many patients who are occupying beds for long terms in hospital because there is nowhere else for them to go.  To give an instance of this, I was speaking to a man on Sunday last who told me that because he has no house he has been forced to stay in an institution in our county for some time past.  He appeared to be in perfect <Col N="1851" /> health and told me that he was 54 years of age.  He was hoping to get a pre-fab erected for him.  Some greater liaison should be seen to be working between the Departments of Health and Social Welfare to provide people like him with alternative accommodation rather than to have beds in hospitals, possibly needed for surgically ill people, taken up in that way.</P>
    <P>I realise that home care will cost a lot of money but I am positive that money will be spent in keeping people out of hospital.  It will require a complete change in the health service structure and a great deal of concentration not only on home care but on health centres and on the rechannelling of qualified personnel.  But I am positive it will pay off financially, socially and medically.  It will mean big capital outlay initially but I think this is something that will appeal to the Minister.</P>
    <P>In this matter of co-operation between the Departments of Social Welfare and Health, a lot needs to be done.  The Minister finds himself in the unfortunate position of having responsibility for both.  I suggest that health on its own is a very big job and perhaps the two portfolios should be divided to enable the Minister to give his undivided attention to health.</P>
    <P>I take the Minister to be an honest man who feels he is right, that he is giving a better service to more people. We on this side feel that he could give an even better service to those who need it most and that those who are able to pay should be asked to do so.  Because money is not unlimited, we cannot do all the Minister wants to do.  The position Fianna Fáil have outlined consistently is that we should do the best we can with the money available.  It is with a view to that that we appeal to the Minister not to increase health charges.  He should think clearly that his main job is to look after health, that his main business is the health of the community. He should be guided by the proverb that health is better than wealth.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JosephBermingham" hpid="Mr. Bermingham Mr. Bermingham">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bermingham</NameTxt>
      <P>One thing about the debate so far which has amazed <Col N="1852" /> me is the terrible sense of acrimony in the whole thing&mdash;people arguing with one another&mdash;while the point at issue was not debated at all.  What the Bill is about is an increase in health contributions from 15p to 26p per week or from £7 to £12 per annum.  The contribution system has been there since 1971.  I know I am correct in that because before I entered the House I was contributing the £7.  I do not think the increase being sought now, considering the cost of the services now and the way they have risen, is extravagant.</P>
      <P>I am not so sure that the contribution system is worth while because the contributions seem so small in proportion to the overall cost of the health services.  Therefore, I do not think it is worth all the talk we have been having yesterday and today and all the bitterness it seems to have provoked.  I realise this is one more addition to the ever rising cost of living but I do not think it is a great hardship on most of the people who have been contributing £7 to have to contribute £12 a year.  This contribution system was introduced in 1971 and that being the case I find it hard to see how you can argue that the increase to £12 is excessive, that is, if you accept the principle of a contribution at all, and I am not so sure about it.</P>
      <P>Speaking about self-employed people and small farmers, the small farmers have the advantage of paying the contributions yearly.  On the other hand, there is a type of small businessman or tradesman who operates as a self-employed person.  I know of one such person who has a family of seven and who would not normally be liable to contribute.  He was in a small tin-pot way of business, he did not keep records and did not clear his position with the Revenue Commissioners.  If he had done so he would neither have to pay tax nor a health contribution. He never bothered about his health contribution because, unlike a small farmer or any other type of self-employed person, he is obliged to make his contributions through the Revenue Commissioners.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are many people like him.  For many years people in small businesses <Col N="1853" /> such as blacksmiths, garagemen in a small way and so on, have not declared themselves to the Revenue Commissioners. They have been terrified at the suggestion that they would have to pay these contributions.  They are fearful of going near those people to clear their cases.  In most of those cases they would have had no difficulty but there is this inbred fear of going to the Revenue Commissioners.</P>
    <P>My colleague from Kildare has said that medical card holders might be asked to pay this 26p.  That is not correct.  A medical card holder is entitled to produce his card to his employer who will not then stop the contribution.  If such a person does not wish to disclose his position to the employer, he can get a refund from the Revenue Commissioners.</P>

      <P>I do not go in for rows.  I say what I honestly think and I do not go in for cross-talk like that which has been going on here during the last day or two.  It has not been too edifying.  A person with a medical card is not asked to pay this contribution.</P>
      <P>The contributions are to be increased and that is what the Bill is all about. I am now asking the Minister to examine whether it is worth all the bother of collection and all the trouble being put on people to stamp cards. However, the base was laid in 1971 and the Minister was entitled to look for an increase, not that I think the contribution system is the correct way.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am not altogether satisfied with the operation of the Health Act and with the health boards.  I am a firm believer, as far as County Kildare is concerned, at least, that the system under which <Col N="1854" /> the county councils operated gave a far better service&mdash;that we lost something since we came under the colossus of the Eastern Health Board.  In those days, the health services were administered by people who were in touch with the local communities and who understood their circumstances, people who knew those entitled to free hospitalisation.  Particularly in the southern end of County Kildare, we now have to deal with a lot of faceless people in the health board.</P>
    <P>We heard a lot about choice of doctor soon after the Health Act was passed.  To my mind it leaves a lot to be desired.  I am not saying the old system was better, and when the choice of doctor was introduced, in my innocence I thought it would be good for the people.  However, people who are just outside the medical card money, as I would call it, a man and his wife with £20.6 per week, for instance, are not eligible.  In this respect one thing that worries me is that there is no obligation on a doctor to attend such people in any circumstances.  It frightens me.  A person might be able to pay for a doctor.  Such people, in my hearing, have been advised by an official of the Eastern Health Board, to register with a doctor, but people with a weekly income of £21 or £22, just outside medical card eligibility, do not go to look for a doctor until they need him.  Such a person might live 12 or 13 miles from a doctor and might have to go to such a doctor in the middle of the night but there is no obligation on that doctor to attend him.  If a new Health Act is necessary to remedy such situations, then we must have it.</P>
    <P>If a person is qualified for a medical card and if he wants choice of doctor he should have it.  The doctors were the people who originally imposed the condition that a doctor would have to be practising for two years in a certain place.  I say that any qualified doctor who sets up a practice should be able to take a medical card patient if one attends him.  I am a strong believer in that and I do not mind who agrees or disagrees with me.  That is what free choice of doctor means.</P>
    <P>On the question of hospitalisation, a person might prefer, if he is a short-term <Col N="1855" /> patient, to stay in a nursing home, a cottage hospital or some such institution.  Such a hospital would not be as costly to run as one which would have surgical and other facilities, and I have a feeling that such a patient with such a preference might not get as good value for his contributions as a person who would go to the other type of hospital.</P>
    <P>I should like to refer to the Naas Hospital where, unless the situation has been corrected recently, there is not a registrar.  This puts the physician in that hospital, Dr. Waldron, in the position that it is only those of the young doctors who are left that he can choose from to staff the hospital. That is because he has not a registrar. This is something that should not happen. Only the best young doctors should be appointed to those hospitals. I am not suggesting that the men who are there in the Naas Hospital are not the best, but they are only what is left after the hospitals who have registrars have been supplied.</P>
    <P>I do not think the contributions now being asked for will make any significant contribution towards paying for the health services.  I would be prepared to go along with a hugely increased contribution if that would give free medical services and free hospitalisation to the people entitled to them.  The principle has been established of contributions towards the health service.  The Minister is entitled under circumstances of expanded service and increased cost to seek an increase in the contributions.  It would be a wonderful step forward if there were a contribution that would pay even half the cost of the complete medical card.  That may not be feasible. I should like to hear some figures as to the amount of contribution that would be necessary both from the Exchequer and from the contributors to bring about that situation.</P>
    <P>A free-for-all hospital service is a good thing.  I do not think it is vitally necessary but it is good and is something towards which we should strive. I think the Minister has this in mind. I do not think that we have the necessary services available at present that <Col N="1856" /> would make this possible.  It might impose too great a burden on, say, persons in the hospital services.</P>
    <P>It has been suggested by a speaker from this side of the House that there should be some control as to the kinds of drugs doctors would prescribe for patients who come under the Health Act.  I dissociate myself from that suggestion.  I do not say that the Deputy who made the suggestion had this in mind but the suggestion could be interpreted as meaning that only the cheaper drugs would be dispensed for Health Act patients.  This would be a terrible reflection on the service.</P>
    <P>Once there was a contribution in the original scheme the Minister is entitled at this time to increase it.  I do not think he is increasing it greatly but perhaps the increase is substantial enough.  I am doubtful if what the Minister will get out of it will be worth while.  The money must be provided either by general taxation or by a scheme such as is now proposed.  It has been suggested that the money is now being taken from the poorer section. If the money were raised by general taxation it could be argued that it was being taken from a still poorer section, the unfortunate old age pensioner who might purchase tobacco or a small drink.  Therefore I am not too sure that to raise the money in taxation would be better than the system adopted by the Minister.  I am prepared to accept what the Minister is doing.  I am not too sure that all the talk and all the bitterness that we have had about it over the past few days is justified.</P>
    <P>In conclusion, let me say the Minister should review the Health Act which requires to be amended and updated.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RayBurke" hpid="Mr. R.P. Burke Mr. R.P. Burke">

      <P>I have no doubt that in the middle of next week when this Dáil session concludes and the Government are asked for an account of their stewardship and are asked by the Press and by the public the reason why they did not introduce major legislation in this session the Parliamentary Secretary to the Taoiseach will list a number of Bills that were brought before the House and will say there <Col N="1857" /> was a Health Bill introduced in the session from October to December.  The only resemblance between this Bill and a proper Health Bill is in the title&mdash; Health Contributions (Amendment) Bill, 1974.  The only connection it has with health is in the Title.</P>
      <P>This is another form of taxation being imposed on the people by a bankrupt Government, bankrupt in ideas, bankrupt financially and trying to bankrupt the people.</P>
      <P>I might not agree with the Minister politically but he is an honourable man.  At least he had the guts and the respect for Parliament to introduce a Bill to take this extra money from the people, unlike his colleagues.  We had the spectacle last week of a device being used by the Minister for Finance to take nearly £30 million from the people by way of an increased charge on petrol.  We had the increased cost of butter.  Even today there was the ludicrous spectacle of the Minister having one of his backbenchers put down a question about dog licences so that he could announce an increase in the cost of dog licences. How low are the Government prepared to go in trying to take every last penny from the unfortunate taxpayers? For once, Fianna Fáil were not blamed for increasing something such as the dog licence.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. R.P. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>I bow to your ruling.  I am heading in that general direction.  The Minister for Health has introduced this Bill to take extra <Col N="1858" /> taxation.  That is what this £3¼-4 million is.  This is being asked of the people at a time when there are approximately 100,000 unemployed and at a time when people are not in a position to pay extra taxation.  The small farmer is one person who will be hit at a time when he is very badly off.</P>
      <P>I would ask the Minister to consider not just the points made by Members on this side of the House but by Deputies on his own side. Deputy Bermingham, who is a decent man, queried the expense involved in the collection of these contributions and he wondered if it was really necessary.  He also queried whether this measure would make any contribution to the health costs in general. This was from a backbencher of the Government party, a member of a party of which the Minister for Health is leader.</P>
      <P>Deputy O'Connell is conversant with health matters and he was spokesman for health on behalf of the Labour Party.  The Minister for Health said a lot about review bodies and we had the startling announcement from him after nearly two years in office that another review body was to be set up.  I agree fully with Deputy O'Connell who stated that the review body should have been set up when the Government came into office, not two years later.  Of course we are familiar with the practice of the present regime.  Whenever there is a problem that needs a decision they set up a review body.  Whenever there is a thorny problem before the Cabinet that would necessitate anyone making a decision they set up a commission and put off the matter for another two years, knowing in their hearts they will not be around to make the decision when the time comes because they will be on this side of the House&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>In this context health contributions are a form of taxation at a time when the country is in a worse state than any period since the mid-fifties when the last Coalition were in office.  We might ask what are we getting for these contributions. The explanatory memorandum states that it entitles people to hospital in-patient and out-patient services. Any Deputy in the Dublin region will know what were the Minister's promises with regard to hospitals.  We were told at four different Press conferences that the Minister had cured the hospital problem in Dublin. Probably there will be further Press conferences after Christmas but so far we have not seen any hospital.  There has been much talk about a hospital in Beaumont which is adjacent to my constituency and which would probably be used by people in my constituency and in other areas also.  I had expected to be invited to the opening ceremony but I am afraid it will be the year 2,000 before construction will be commenced.  Notwithstanding that, I am sure we will hear about this hospital from the Minister at least every six weeks at various Press conferences.</P>
      <P>What are the emergency services like in the Dublin region?  The services, particularly as they affect the area where I live in north County Dublin, leave much to be desired. There is no emergency ambulance based in that area.  In St. Ita's Hospital, Portrane, it would be possible to establish an emergency unit for accidents. It is on the stretch of road from Dublin to Drogheda that has a high accident rate and it would be appropriate to have a central location for such an emergency unit, or at least have an ambulance there that could be used for all emergencies.  I should like to see some of the money being used for such a unit.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should like to pay tribute to the staff of St. Ita's Hospital for the tremendous work they are doing in <Col N="1860" /> trying conditions.  They are very concerned about and work hard for the people under their care and, for that reason, I should like to pay a tribute to them in this House.  They are not being paid adequately for the work they are doing.  I hope the Minister will review the whole wages and salary structure for hospital staff, particularly the nurses, rather than make appeals for moderation in income demands as he did in his opening speech.  He is appealing for moderation of income when all forms of taxation are increasing.  We have had taxation of £45 million recently, including the £15 million in respect of the postal charges imposed by the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs, all without a vote in the House.  At least we have the opportunity of voting in this case and I have no doubt that the Members on the other side who spoke against it will vote with us and bring about the fall of the present regime.</P>

      <P>I would ask the Minister to reconsider his attitude with regard to medical cards. Although I have been in this House for a short time only, for many years prior to that I was a member of Dublin County Council and made many representations with regard to medical cards.  However, in recent months a very considerable number of people have been coming to me who have been refused renewal of their medical cards despite the fact that they have held them for a number of years.  This is happening at a time when there are many financial demands being made on them, when husbands are unemployed or are on a three-day week, and when they need all the assistance they can get.  They are being deprived of things to which they are entitled.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would appeal to the Minister not to be niggardly about the issue and renewal of medical cards.  In these days of raging inflation he should send out an instruction to the various <Col N="1861" /> health boards to raise the eligibility limit for medical cards.  Many people are living one step above the poverty line in the present economic situation. The lie should be nailed once and for all that this is all a result of world economic pressure as the Minister put it in his introductory statement. The only people who are convinced by the talk of world economic pressure are the Government themselves.  I do not think even their own backbenchers believe it any more.  If the Government want to find out exactly how the people feel let them go out and meet the people in the housing estates around Dublin.</P>

It is very serious when a Government come in day after day and demand extra taxation from the people who cannot afford it.

    </Speaker>
    <P>There is a reason for the decrease in the number of medical cards which the Minister has not admitted publicly but of which the medical profession are only too well aware. The Minister in his negotiations with the medical union after Christmas will want to make the point that the number of medical cards has decreased and that, therefore, the medical union's case for extra money is not valid because they are not dealing <Col N="1863" /> with as many patients.  The people are entitled to the medical services that were introduced by successive Fianna Fáil Governments, in particular by the late President Childers, when he was Minister for Health.  He was responsible for some far-reaching extensions of the medical services.  He was responsible for the major legislation which set up the various health boards.  His memory is entitled to greater respect than to be destroyed by the Health Contributions (Amendment) Bill, 1974 which should be called the Fourth Taxation Bill of mid-December, 1974.</P>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesBMcDonald" hpid="Mr. McDonald Mr. McDonald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McDonald</NameTxt>
      <P>I support this Bill. I have been sitting in the House for a couple of hours and, as a farmer coming from a farming constituency it sounds peculiar to me to hear the Opposition urban Deputies so concerned, though I welcome their concern, for the small farmers and the poor farmers.  I am well aware of the difficulties many of them are facing but I want to put it on record that the poorest of those small farmers would prefer to pay the new 23p per week charge for the services they are offered under this Bill than to lie in bed, as they did before 1971, worrying how they would pay their hospital bills. It is a very good insurance for those people, whether they are lower paid people or people with small holdings, whether they are paying a weekly contribution or an annual contribution of £12 and I am not minimising that.  The sum of £12 is small but it is quite a hefty sum if you have not got it and that will be a problem for some people. Nevertheless, it represents a contribution this year of £5 million for services which are estimated to cost £120 million in this year and it is unfair of the Opposition to avail of this opportunity to castigate the very fine health and hospital service we have. The Irish health services and the people running them can stand up to comparison with those of any country not only in Europe but in the world and I fail to see why at every opportunity speakers, not necessarily from the Opposition, display the Irish tendency always to be critical and to knock.  I <Col N="1864" /> do not know what our motivation is&mdash; I cannot say that I am any different myself&mdash;but it is certainly not a European practice because one never hears Europeans knock their services and as a matter of fact, they dress them up in such grandiose language that it is difficult to recognise them, so well presented and spiced up are they.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McDonald</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to take the opportunity to compliment the Minister, his Department and the fine body of dedicated professional and lay personnel who operate our services for the very fine service they give to the people.  It has already been pointed out that charges have gone up.  Since the service was introduced by the previous Minister for Health, the late President Childers, go ndéanna Dia trócaire ar a anam, the cost of the scheme has increased from 1971 when it was £63 million to over £120 million this year.  I feel that the people who are asked to pay these contributions will not object and I believe people are sufficiently well aware of the situation nowadays to realise that they cannot expect to receive a good service unless the contributions they are asked to pay and the cost of the services go up all the time.  It is something which we must not dramatise and certainly not in any way that could be regarded as injurious to the morale of the people who are so unselfishly providing the very fine professional services we have.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should like also to mention the matter of community care.  This is a theme which the Minister has on many occasions spoken of and encouraged. I think there should be a concerted effort between the Department, the health boards and the county councils to step up on community care and a very determined policy to erect a number of maisonettes, chalets or flatlets on the ground floor, adjacent to our district hospitals, and to extend this kind of care that we have here in a number of private institutions in and around the city of Dublin, so that elderly people can have a flat, living outside of a hospital or a home, and having a common diningroom where they can <Col N="1865" /> get for their weekly contribution a solid mid-day meal and fend for themselves for breakfast and supper, in addition to being looked after by the professional staff in the hospital, convent or home.  We should try to extend this kind of service to every town where we have either a county or a district hospital.  It would be a great advance in community care.  It would bring elderly and slightly incapacitated people into care in a semi-community way, giving them the independence of their own home, with the advantage of, perhaps, releasing more houses for newly-married people and houses which some of the older people do not feel able to continue to run.</P>
    <P>I ask the Government seriously to consider extending this type of service which has proved to be so valuable in the private sector at present, and there are a number of very wonderful places of this type in Dublin and we ought to try to have our county councils operate something on similar lines. The older people wish to retain their own hearth and home and we should make a big effort to meet this trait in the Irish character.  I do not think it would be all that costly because a nice flatlet for a single elderly person would not cost so much and would be quite easy to maintain and there is no reason why it could not be very well operated in conjunction with our district hospitals in many parts of the country.  In this sphere as well, unlike the retirement villages or cities or homes which one finds in Miami, it would be a small community which would be quite a breakthrough in the care of the old, leaving them their independence and at the same time giving them the care and comfort they have earned down the years.</P>
    <P>I was quite amused by some of Deputy Collins's contribution but I join in his tribute to the junior doctors.  I am glad to note that he is a convert, even if a late convert, to the recognition of the wonderful contribution which these young people are making to the hospital service.  I am sorry he did not recognise that contribution earlier when he was in power and in a position to do so.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1866" /> I should like to mention also the facilities in relation to mental health and the strides and progress made over the past number of years.  In this field we have a service which everyone, whether taxpayer or ratepayer, can be justly proud of, although it is something which we seem to pass by and fail to notice, but in every community there are people who are motivated to give of their time, their energy and, perhaps, financially, to show their desire to help people who are afflicted with mental handicap.  This is something we must recognise and I wish to compliment the Minister and the Department for the encouragement they are giving in this sphere but there is, nevertheless, some leeway to be made up.  We need more beds for severely handicapped children.</P>
    <P>I do not know if the Department have been looking at the progress made in the care for mentally handicapped in parts of the United States.  There the wheel seems to have come full circle.  They have progressed further than we have but they now seem to be back almost where they started in their thinking with regard to day centres or institutional care.  I compliment the Government on the concessions given by way of income tax to those with handicapped children.  As taxpayers, we should encourage the Government to continue this kind of aid to those burdened with what is a very heavy cross in many instances.  Unless one is closely associated with such organisations as the Friends of the Mentally Handicapped one does not appreciate the scope of the problem or the magnificent work done by voluntary organisation.</P>
    <P>I take this opportunity of complimenting the Minister and his Department on the progress made this year in Europe.  I am very happy about it.  I and my colleagues in the European Parliament played a role in having projects such as the provision of sheltered workshops and facilities for training the mentally and physically handicapped included in the European Social Fund. This was a considerable achievement. It seems to have passed unnoticed here even though we stand to gain.  I believe some institutions have already received <Col N="1867" /> considerable benefit from this social fund.  I take this opportunity, too, of thanking the Minister and his Department for the briefs and information so readily made available to me when I asked for them early in the spring.  We succeeded in making this breakthrough. Heretofore money spent on retraining could only be spent on those from whom an economic return could be guaranteed.  I am very glad we had the opportunity of bringing our Christian principles into social thinking in Europe.  Where materialistic social policies were the order of the day there is now a new spirit of social concern. Even though we are a small country we have a great deal to offer because of our democratic background.  It is difficult to appreciate this until one experiences a somewhat different approach and finds oneself co-operating with people who have not quite the same respect, perhaps for democracy. Despite certain drawbacks, we have here a more democratic society and a greater respect for democratic institutions than will be found in any other country.  It is an experience to come up against the different systems and it is an achievement to be able to introduce Christian thinking and social theories and have them accepted.</P>
    <P>The Minister might give us some information on progress in regard to mutual recognition of diplomas and degrees in the medical sphere.  There is a commission sitting on this somewhere in Europe and its work should be of great interest to many of our people.  We have a tradition here, well recognised and appreciated, of producing a very fine type of professional medical personnel, imbued with Christian social medical ethics, and it is important that our degrees and diplomas should be recognised in the other eight member States of the community. Here it takes two years longer for an undergraduate to become a doctor than it does in some European countries.  The Department should insist on our retaining the very high standards with which we have been credited.  Indeed, the aim should be to increase the quality of the training and education.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1868" /> Over the last few years considerable difficulty has been experienced in finding places for student nurses.  The victims seem to be young girls who have got their leaving certificates a year ahead of schedule.  They go in for children's nursing and, having done that course&mdash;I see the Leas-Cheann Chomhairle looking at me&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McDonald</NameTxt>
      <P>The Bill is very small and it is hard to stay on the straight and narrow path, but I will do my best.  Part of this money is being spent on hospital in-patient and out-patient services.  A few weeks ago there were sizeable headlines in the paper about a GP who earned a considerable salary last year.  Ordinary people like myself down the country jumped to the conclusion that all GPs are in this category and, being true Irishmen, we lacerated him from head to foot.  In the rural areas an effort should be made to encourage GPs who give an excellent service&mdash;most of them are overworked and find great difficulty in keeping abreast of their work&mdash;to organise group practices.  If at least two doctors were working together, one could work one night on, or one week on, as the case might be, <Col N="1869" /> and he could look forward to a number of nights, or a number of weeks, when he would not have to answer the telephone or the door.</P>
      <P>Many doctors are grossly overworked and this must be a considerable strain on them.  I know there are many general practitioners in group practices but, in the less densely populated areas, this is not very practical. We must ensure that there is a reasonable service available especially at weekends and at night in the rural areas.  I should imagine that it is easier to organise a group practice in the city and in the urban areas.  In my own locality these people have to work very long and ardous hours.</P>
      <P>Under this Bill people are entitled to these out-patient services.  The Minister might consider asking the health boards to provide more public health nurses.  We cannot be always looking at the cost of the services.  It is more important that our people should be well looked after and well cared for. Most people abhor the thought of extra taxation or extra contributions, as we heard tonight but when a patient, whether he be young or old, is lying on the broad of his back what he wants is a good service.  We are all the same and we tend to recover more quickly if we know we are getting a good service and that payment for the service will not present a problem when we have recovered.</P>
      <P>I support this Bill.  I do not see any reason for some of the outlandish criticisms which were levelled against the Minister and his Department and against the doctors and the hospital services in general.  This is an error we should not allow ourselves to fall into.  Most Irish people do their best, irrespective of their station in life.  It is an Irish trait to look at everything from a negative point of view.  I do not wish to lecture my colleagues on the other side of the House.  I am as Irish as they are and I suppose I have the same tendencies.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I wish the Minister well and I hope the services his Department provide will continue to develop and progress. I hope we will be able to keep up the momentum and keep up the high standard to which our people are <Col N="1870" /> growing accustomed.  Great credit is due not only to the Minister but to his predecessors and to successive Irish Governments who have given our people such good service and such good value for money.</P>
    <P>I have not made up my mind on the contribution the health boards have made.  I know the expenditure on health in my own county.  I was on the county council for 16 years before the health boards were introduced.  I do not think there are any extra doctors or nurses in my county.  The administrative staff have been increased. There is a new staff in the headquarters for the region in Tullamore.  Perhaps it is necessary to have a big administrative section now organising a comprehensive health service, but I would prefer to see a greater proportion of the money being paid to professional people to help those who are ill.  I hope there will not be a further escalation of administrative staff.  Perhaps I am being like the type of Irishman I mentioned a few minutes ago.  We must recognise the fact that our health services are second to none and can stand comparison with the services in any country we have the honour to work with in Europe.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JosephDowling" hpid="Mr. Dowling Mr. Dowling">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dowling</NameTxt>
      <P>I listened with great interest to the previous speakers. Deputy Bermingham summed up the situation by saying that this Bill is about the contrbutions.  Bascally, that is what it is.  It falls far short of what we would desire.  It is a fleecing operation. Possibly if the Minister were on this side of the House he would call it a mini-budget.  It has been called many things in the course of ths debate.  It is a means of extracting further money from the hard-pressed sections of the community.</P>
      <P>This is an ever-changing world and people are demanding additional and better medical services.  It costs more money to provide these services but the people are confused by the statements made in relation to them.  They have been told that there is a free health service but they do not know what the health services are about. They do not know if the service is free or not.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1871" /> After this debate the people will know that the health services are not free and that more money will be extracted from them.  This is a budget in itself but it is not a very honourable way to do things although we have almost become accustomed to this method.  This is the fourth increase pushed upon us in the last week. The Minister has been given credit for indicating to the House that he required this money and for not using the backdoor method adopted by the Minister for Finance in relation to the petrol situation but it is still a further extraction of finance from the people.  It appears that the Government need a large transfusion of cash and every device is being used in order to extract it from the people.</P>
    <P>The present Minister has made many improvements in the health service and I applaud all his efforts because the improvements are necessary and desirable to keep pace with the general trend and the greater demands of a more civilised society. I should like to pay a special tribute to some of the hospital authorities for the excellent service they provide. Some of them have been criticised and there is no doubt that some are deserving of criticism.  I should like to pay tribute to the staff of St. James's Hospital in Dublin.  For a number of months prior to his death my father was a patient in this hospital. He was a very old man but, nevertheless, he received excellent treatment from a wonderful staff.  I want to discount the criticisms about the treatment of old people in this hospital.</P>
    <P>I had a similar experience in Cashel hospital.  The old people there are well looked after by a very efficient staff.  Anybody who has a parent in need of hospitalisation need have no fear if that parent is sent to St. James's or Cashel hospital.  To the staff of these hospitals I extend my appreciation.  During the by-election campaign in Cork I had occasion to visit the hospital in Fermoy and I was saddened to see the condition of that hospital which caters for old people.  That hospital is no credit to <Col N="1872" /> any Government or to any of us but I will not single out the present Minister for criticism in this respect.  My visits there left a sad impression on my mind.</P>
    <P>Where old people are concerned I hope that an active and determined effort will be made to ensure that the people who made such a great contribution to this State will be able to end their days in relative comfort and are given the attention and treatment they deserve.  I am not saying that the treatment administered to those in Fermoy hospital was bad but the condition of the hospital was not good.  The same applies to some of the hospitals I visited as a member of various boards.  Some hospitals where old people are patients are fire traps and fire-hazards.</P>
    <P>With parrot-like precision the Minister used the expression that has been hackneyed through the House for a considerable period, &ldquo;the House is aware of the current world economic situation which threatens all economies with recession of major proportions&rdquo;.  The current world situation seems to be responsible for everything.  I do not know how the Minister for Finance will attribute the increase in dog licences announced today to the world situation but I am sure he will find a way around that. We are told that every problem has been brought about by the current world situation.</P>
    <P>As Deputy O'Malley indicated, this Bill falls far short of what we require. The deception in the introduction of it, the extraction from the people of the finance, particularly those who were hard hit in the past and are in for a tougher time in the future, is to be deplored.  The limits for medical cards were set 12 months ago when quite a number of people did not qualify.  However, we see in this evening's newspapers from the consumer price index that the cost of living has gone up by 20 per cent between November, 1973 and November, 1974.  Because of this steep increase in the cost of living quite a number of people are now entitled to medical cards but they are debarred because the limit was set 12 months <Col N="1873" /> ago.  In my view the cost of living index should be a factor in bringing people within the scope of this scheme.</P>
    <P>The Minister did not indicate that an immediate revision would take place but there are changing circumstances. Much of the increase in the cost of living can be attributed to the Government.  They had a misleading effect on the public 20 months ago and I do not think we deserve the type of Government we have got.  I hope the Minister will endeavour to tie the limits for medical cards to the cost of living so as to ensure that those who are entitled to these services are not deprived of them.</P>
    <P>There has been a lot of talk about the failure of the Minister to reach agreement with the doctors and we have been told that we may be able to have the extended medical service when agreement is reached.  The question of agreement between trade unions and employers is an ongoing problem.  Agreements have to be reached.  One sits down and tackles the problem and, if one is really sincere about one's concern, one remains until such time as agreement is reached.  Why should some people have to suffer indefinitely because of a failure to reach agreement?  The Minister has a positive responsibility in this respect to pursue finality of agreement as quickly as possible with the people with whom it would appear he is in dispute.</P>
    <P>The people are quite certain now that the free health services about which they were told are not free, that there is nothing free about them. But they are entitled to the services they were promised.  Were this an industrial dispute or one of another nature, one would have to sit down and work out a solution acceptable to all parties.  I do not think that beyond the limit of the capabilities of the Minister.  There are two sides or points of view to be taken into account in any dispute and their respective problems must be examined, analysed and agreement reached suitable to both sides.</P>
    <P>If the cost of living spiral is maintained at its present rate there is no <Col N="1874" /> doubt that additional hospital and medical services will be required for the many people who will be suffering from malnutrition for want of foodstuffs the price of which, as the papers point out, have increased very substantially over the past 12 months.  If people are unable to obtain food, they will be very prone to sickness and then the question of provision of medical services is a very real one indeed.</P>
    <P>If this Bill is an example of socialism in the seventies, then I am glad I am not a socialist because I, and the members of my party, feel that this type of Bill is far short of what is required today, apart altogether from the backdoor method of extraction of the finances.</P>
    <P>A point has been made about the insistence of the Voluntary Health Insurance Board on a 24-hour stay in a hospital which takes up many beds perhaps needed for urgent cases.  These beds are taken up by people who in the ordinary way could remain in their own homes but who are compelled to go into hospital because payments will not be made to them unless they remain there for a 24 hour period.  These beds are now known as the beds with the golden legs.  The only outlay on those beds is the clean pair of sheets used each day in respect of which the hospitals receive a substantial return.  These beds are required from time to time by people in distress who need to be accommodated in hospital but who are unable to obtain beds.</P>
    <P>I hope a change will take place in this respect whereby people, so insured, can get a service and be maintained in their own homes without taking up necessary beds and depriving the more needy section of the community of the medical services to which they are entitled.  It is the weaker section of the community about which I am concerned.  I am not terribly concerned about the man who can pay for his own medical services. But he must be able to obtain such services.  No doubt there are people at present who can afford to pay but who are still unable to obtain medical services because of the present situation. I hope this will be remedied in <Col N="1875" /> the future and that we will have a type of service which will provide for the necessities of the people in need of medical attention.  This insistence by the Voluntary Health Insurance Board that people remain in hospital for a 24-hour period deprives the weaker sections of the community of much-needed beds and discriminates against them.  This is something that must receive serious and immediate attention.</P>
    <P>I listened here yesterday to Deputy Coughlan.  I am sure the Minister was just as disgusted as I was at some of the remarks he made.  Deputy Coughlan spoke about the mid-west. One would have thought he was in the wild west listening to him and to the various remarks he made.  Certainly they were not the remarks of what could be regarded as a normal, sane man.  It is possible that Deputy Coughlan needs medical attention because it would appear to me, and to many other people here yesterday listening to him, that he was a man in need of immediate medical attention. He made a number of references, particularly in relation to doctors, that if one were to examine doctors' accounts it might reveal something substantial.  This type of reflection on the medical profession, who are giving valuable service to the community, is one over which nobody could stand.  It might well be that some particular doctor abuses the situation.  But if Deputy Coughlan is aware of such abuse when he speaks in this House and infers that a revealing situation would be thrown open if doctors' accounts were examined, then he should come forward and correct the situation.  We have an obligation to ensure that where people seem to be carrying on sharp practices in some form or other, they be properly exposed.</P>
    <P>But to cast a reflection on the entire medical profession is entirely wrong because the public at large might be tempted to point to every medical practitioner and say &ldquo;Is it he?&rdquo;  Deputy Coughlan must be made to indicate clearly the people concerned in this sharp practice, if in <Col N="1876" /> fact they are so concerned.  Such remarks are unfair to that responsible section of the community doing such excellent work, sometimes in very difficult conditions, very irregular hours, resulting in a disruption of their home lives and being called out at all times.  Possibly the demands made on them are greater than those made on us because of the uncertainty of their hours of rest.  I do hope that on the next occasion on which Deputy Coughlan comes into the House he will either, as it was put today, &ldquo;put up or shut up&rdquo; because I think it wrong that people be vilified in the manner in which Deputy Coughlan vilified the medical profession yesterday.  They are honourable men, and if there is one amongst them who is carrying on some type of sharp practice then the whole group of them should not be suspect.  I would appeal again to the Minister to extract from Deputy Coughlan, privately or otherwise, the information he alleged he had here yesterday in his wild west speech.</P>
    <P>I shall not delay the House much longer.  I appreciated the views expressed by many Members here, forthright and honest views expressed, whether by Members of my own party or by Members of the Government parties.  I was glad to hear a colleague of mine, Deputy Dr. O'Connell, being very forceful here yesterday, indicating his views in very clear terms.</P>
    <P>If a supporter of the Government expresses dissatisfaction with the situation, one can hardly blame us for expressing our total dissatisfaction. Deputy O'Connell's approach to the problem was very honest.  It would have been better if the entire debate had been approached on that basis because in that way the Minister, or any Minister at any time, would become more aware of the real problems affecting the ordinary people, those who constitute the majority of our population.  In Dublin some people on re-applying for medical cards have been informed that they are no longer eligible.  These decisions have been reached without account being taken of the 20 per cent increase that has occurred in the cost of living.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1877" /> The Government have raided the housewife's purse.  They have done the same to the motorist.  We can only hope that advantage will not be taken of the Recess to indulge further in tactics of this nature.  Our complaint concerns the deceptive way in which these extractions have been imposed. However earnest the Minister may be, we cannot support him.  The situation here arose, I presume, as a result of a Cabinet meeting at which he was pushed into the situation.  I consider the Minister to have some semblance of socialism, but the approach here has no element of socialism; or at least, if it is socialism, my socialist principles are far greater than what I understood them to be because this measure is far short of what is required.  We can rest assured that, given the opportunity, the public will express their dissatisfaction with the Minister and his colleagues.</P>
    <P>During a debate on another topic last evening the Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries saw fit to introduce some matters pertaining to health.  We are wondering whether he consulted with the Department of Health in regard to the quality of certain foodstuffs and whether there is a necessity for people in the interest of their health to reduce their consumption of butter.  The Minister seemed to suggest that the people would be much healthier if they consumed less butter. We would like to know if it is the policy of the Department of Health to encourage reduced consumption of butter.  This is an important question because it relates to a wide area of health.</P>
    <P>The Minister can be assured of the support of this side of the House in any contribution he may make towards a better health service for all.  He has made some contribution in this area. We appreciate this, but the ever-changing circumstances of our time demand constant progress so as to keep us abreast of any new developments in drugs, techniques and so on.  The Minister for Health at any time has a duty to ensure that the health services are kept up to date.  We are aware that there is the question of finance, but <Col N="1878" /> it is the method of extraction with which we disagree.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickHegarty" hpid="Mr. Hegarty Mr. Hegarty">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hegarty</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to make merely a few points in relation to this Bill. First, I compliment the Minister on the excellent job he has been doing in the Department at what can be regarded as a very demanding time.  Our health services are excellent.  That is not to say that we should be satisfied with them.  Nothing is ever perfect, so we should strive always towards improvement. That is what the Minister is doing.  Perhaps the reason for any delays that may occur is that the Minister is taking his time so that he can have available to him all the advice possible to help reach the right decisions. However, I would make a special appeal to him in respect of Mallow hospital.  I trust that the right decision in that regard will be reached as soon as possible.</P>
      <P>The contributions being asked for in respect of the health services are not significant.  If possible, I should like to see the general medical services scheme being extended.  Of course we must realise that nothing is free: in the final analysis everying must be paid for.  It is difficult to adjudicate who is entitled to medical cards, because what applies in one case might be irrelevant in another.  In other words, there is need for more flexibility in the system. A man whose children need regular medical attention can be in a very difficult position in so far as paying doctors' fees is concerned.  It is not enough in such a case that the only concession would be free drugs because the doctor's fees could be a real burden.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Perhaps the criteria applied in respect of applications for medical cards is not as strict in all areas but I have made representations in respect of what I considered to be very deserving cases only to be told that the people concerned did not qualify.  I wish to register my protest at the inflexibility of the method of determining qualification. There was one case in my area of a pensioner whose wife was neurotic so that she required a doctor very often.  Admittedly, the combined pension of the man and his wife was <Col N="1879" /> greater than the income limit laid down for qualification for a medical card.</P>
    <P>This man has been refused a medical card for his wife.  The very fact of having a medical card would probably mean that he would not call in the doctor at all.  I know this is a very unusual case but this is the sort of instance that should and must be met.  If the whole system of medical cards could be extended to embrace a much wider section, again with some contribution, I am sure the people in the higher income bracket would not object to a little more for this insulation of having a medical card when needed.</P>
    <P>I should like to praise the doctors and nurses for what they are doing in the various hospitals.  I should like to see an extension of the district nurse service.  Much of the load would be taken off the GP if we had many more of these excellent nurses.  They are really doctors in themselves.  They do fantastic work, but we have not nearly enough of them.</P>
    <P>In that connection, I should like to appeal to the Tánaiste and Minister for Health to have more and more young girls trained.  Every year we have this set-up at St. Finbarr's Hospital in Cork&mdash;I am sure it is the same everywhere&mdash;where they can accept only 50 applicants out of about 1,500 girls attempting to enter the profession.  We should give these girls an opportunity of devoting their lives to this worthy profession.  They should not have to go abroad to be trained. They come to us as public representatives to see what we can do.  Getting into these hospitals is nearly like winning the sweep.  Something must be done in this regard and quickly, and the health services generally will boom as a result.</P>
    <P>I have reservation about giving permanency to married nurses.  I do not think this is such a great idea. When they were kept on in a temporary capacity I think they were happy enough.  These interviews that are taking place for permanency are causing confusion and disturbance, with single girls who have been nursing <Col N="1880" /> for a number of years being told they will not qualify for permanency, that they did not succeed at the interview; yet nobody found fault with their performance of their duties.</P>
    <P>I would appeal to the Minister to make more money available in respect of geriatric patients in private hospitals. I have in mind the Bon Secours Hospital in Cobh where the nuns are doing great work, and what they are getting for these patients is a mere pittance.</P>
    <P>The previous speaker mentioned flatlets.  That is a great idea and should be extended to the public sector where old people would have the best of both worlds: they would have some privacy and the expertise needed for old people, especially old people who have nobody to look after them.  We should not be in such a hurry to push our old people into homes.  One of the criticisms of this modern age is that we are too much inclined to hand over our parents and our old people to the care of the State.  When old people became ill and needed a lot of care, this care was always provided in the Irish home.  We have that responsibility and if we are Christians we will not try to pawn them off on the State.</P>
    <P>I should like to compliment the Minister and the Parliamentary Secretary, who is from my own constituency, on the performance of a very difficult task.  Their life would be much easier if they had the wherewithal to do all the things necessary, but within the limits of their resources &mdash;and we must be honest and recognise the resources are limited&mdash;they are doing fantastic work.  They both work very hard.  Good work was also done by previous Ministers.  Reference was made tonight to the late Erskine Childers.  He, too, was a great man, but he has been succeeded by an equally good man in the Tánaiste and Minister for Health.  He probably inherited many of the problems, but I am not saying the problems were not dealt with&mdash;the problems are continually growing and will always be great in this field because there are more and more demands as society becomes more sophisticated.  However, I am <Col N="1881" /> confident the Minister will deal with them and continue to give the good service he is giving.  The fruit of the Minister's work and of his decisions will not show up immediately.  When he gets down to the problem of upgrading hospitals and deciding in a logical and businesslike way where they are to be put, it is then we should all see the wisdom of his decisions.</P>
    <P>As I promised I would not detain the House very long, I shall conclude by thanking the Minister and hoping he will be spared for many a day.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasHussey" hpid="Mr. Hussey Mr. Hussey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hussey</NameTxt>
      <P>It is unfortunate in the present economic situation&mdash;at a time when our people are faced every other day with increased costs for foodstuffs and everything else&mdash;that this Bill should propose an increase in contributions under the Health Act from £7 to £12.  It has one good effect, that at least it gives the House the opportunity of discussing some aspects of the health services which we Deputies did not have an opportunity of doing heretofore.  Health is something that interests all of us. Whether we are doctors, lay men, TDs or whatever else, we are all involved in the health services.  We are all involved in endeavouring to provide the best possible service for our people.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Will this Bill have the desired effect of raising the contributions by £3½ million?  My experience has shown that even when the contributions were only £7 a year and times were better, the health boards found it very difficult to collect this annual sum.  In recent months I have seen bills going back over three years which were sent for payment.  Apparently the people have not paid their fees for that time and were confronted with bills for £21.  If it was difficult to collect £7 a year, I dread to think what it will be like, in the present economic situation, trying to collect £12 a year. Everybody, particularly the farming community, has been very hard pressed for the past 12 months.  Many people thought that perhaps they were entitled to a medical card.  They could <Col N="1882" /> not be blamed for exploring every avenue to get the medical cards.  When the health boards found that they were not entitled to a medical card, bills were sent for £7 or in some cases £14 or even £21.</P>
    <P>I do not know if the health boards have made any serious efforts to collect these bills.  To my knowledge nobody has been brought to court or received a solicitor's letter.  People merely got a notice from the health board indicating the amount due and asking that it be paid forthwith.  In many cases those notices have been ignored.</P>
    <P>No matter what objections we raise to the increasing of this amount, I realise that eventually it will be brought into law by the vote of the Coalition Parties.  That being so, all I can do is indicate where I would like to see this money spent.</P>
    <P>Many suggestions have been made to improve our health services.  One of the biggest problems today is the patients in long-staying hospitals, that is, geriatric, psychiatric and mentally handicapped.  The programme for the replacement of the psychiatric hospitals has a long way to go.  The policy of erecting welfare homes should be speeded up as much as possible.  As resources permit we should reduce the overcrowding in our county homes and psychiatric hospitals.  We should also remove from the latter the geriatric patients who should never have been accommodated there.</P>
    <P>I compliment the Western Health Board, and in particular the CEO, Mr. Hannon, for the wonderful work they have done in trying to provide homes for our elderly citizens.  They have devoted themselves to this problem and deserve our full support and congratulations on their achievements to date. The following accommodation is available in the county: in St. Brendan's Home, Loughrea, they have 350 beds; in Merlin Park Hospital, 150 beds; St. Anne's Home, Clifden, 42 beds.  This gives a total existing accommodation of 542 beds.  They also have public projects planned: a home for the aged at Newcastle, Galway, 40 beds, the foundation stone of which was laid <Col N="1883" /> on 30th September, 1974; a home for the aged at Carraroe, advertised for tender, 40 beds; a home for the aged in Galway city, in Tuam, Ballinasloe and Loughrea, 160 beds.  This makes a total provided and planned of 782 beds.  They also propose to set up a geriatric assessment unit in Merlin Park.  The physician/geriatrician who has been appointed by the board will be taking up duty on 1st January, 1975. This is a great achievement by a board who have been in existence for such a short time.  I admit that there is still room for further improvement.</P>
    <P>As I said before, one of our main problems is the provision of accommodation for our elderly citizens.  Our existing homes are very overcrowded. In addition to the overcrowding of our psychiatric hospitals, which makes it very difficult for nursing and other medical staffs, there is also the serious problem of our adult mentally handicapped. In that respect I welcome the announcement made on 14th December, 1973, at Brigid's Hospital, Ballinasloe, where the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Health stated that he had approved the provision of separate additional accommodation outside the psychiatric hospitals for the adult mentally handicapped. This announcement did not come one day too soon.  I request that the proposals already with the Minister in this regard be approved as speedily as possible.</P>
    <P>There is still the very serious burden of handicapped children.  The efforts of voluntary organisations deserve greater support from the health boards and the Minister for Health.  They are to be commended on the tremendous work they have been doing down through the years for these children.  I am of the opinion that each health board should have their own director for the mentally handicapped.  Otherwise it will be impossible to provide an adequate service. It would be wonderful if there was one person to co-ordinate and be responsible for all the services.  In that way we would get better results from the voluntary organisations and <Col N="1884" /> others involved in providing this service.</P>
    <P>The dental services are the Cinderella of the health services.  There seems to have been a slight improvement in the recruitment of staffs in recent years but the service is still not nearly as good as I would like.  At present those people are confined to or they are taken up largely looking after children, expectant mothers and so forth, who hold medical cards.  This is one service that calls for improvement and I ask the Minister seriously to consider proposals made by the Western Health Board in this respect.</P>
    <P>They propose that the board be allowed to engage the services of private dentists.  I agree with this proposal because if it were accepted and if private dentists were engaged at the same scale of fees as dentists are paid for the treatment of adults under the social insurance scheme&mdash;I see no problem in that respect: I do not see any difficulty for the Minister to pay dentists the same fees for looking after medical card holders as they are paid for treating people insured under the social insurance scheme&mdash;it would help to relieve the backlog of applicants for dental treatment.  There is a terrible backlog and unless something like this is done I can see no easy way of eliminating the long list of people waiting for dentures and extractions.  It should not be a great problem for the Minister to balance these things out, particularly as he holds the double portfolio of Health and Social Welfare.</P>
    <P>In recent years there has been a serious shortage of public health medical staff caused by retirement. Because of this the school medical service has not been maintained, not to speak of being improved.  This scarcity of medical staff can only be eased by improvement of the system for recruiting doctors, and the best incentive towards this is adequate salaries and job satisfaction.  This service is one of the most important of all from the point of view of expenditure on health services, yet it is more noteworthy for its decline rather than its development.  It is an unfortunate <Col N="1885" /> situation because it is vital that children should be examined and their health properly looked after.</P>
    <P>District nurses scattered all over the rural areas are doing a great job. However, they are hampered by scarcity of numbers.  The ratio of nurses to patients&mdash;4,000 per nurse&mdash; permitted by the Department is far too high.  Particularly in rural areas, difficulties are encountered because of bad communications, difficult terrain and sparseness of population.  I suggest that the ratio of population per nurse should be reduced.  Not alone would it be good from the point of view of health service costs&mdash;it would keep people out of hospitals&mdash;but it is good socially.  The best way to achieve this is to provide an adequate staff of nurses.  We are all anxious that people be kept out of hospitals and where possible treated in their homes.  At present many of those who are in hospitals should not be there and they would not be there if we had an adequate district nursing service.</P>
    <P>I would draw the Minister's attention to the apparent conflict between people covered by Voluntary Health Insurance and others.  Deputy O'Malley said the other day that one of the requirements under the voluntary health scheme is that a patient should spend at least 24 hours in hospital. I agree that this is wrong because it is contributing to hospital overcrowding.  The Health boards and the Department are concerned with keeping people at home where possible.  Here we have the Voluntary Health Board encouraging people to go into hospitals.  This is something that should be looked into.</P>
    <P>In most health board areas there is a shortage of physiotherapists, social workers of different kinds, occupational therapists and speech therapists. An effort should be made by the Department to make such staff available where they are required.  I see no reason why patients in Galway or Roscommon or elsewhere in the west should have to travel to Dublin to get specialist service.  Such services should be available in the regional hospital in Galway and in the other health board areas.  This would eliminate <Col N="1886" /> the necessity to bring patients by ambulance or helicopter to Dublin or to Cork, in that way subjecting them to the rigours of travel and making it difficult for their relatives to visit them.</P>
    <P>One problem I have heard people mention is in regard to operations for brain haemorrhage or brain tumor. Apparently such operations cannot be done in Galway and most of our patients have to be transferred either to Dublin or Cork.  Again, this causes hardship for the patients and their families from the point of view of visiting.</P>
    <P>We have heard a lot recently about alcoholism and its effects on young people.  It is time the Department of Health did something constructive about it because it has been left more or less to Alcoholics Anonymous and other such bodies to highlight its terrible effects.  It was only recently that it was brought home to us by the bishops when they devoted one Sunday to temperance.  They outlined the amount of money that is being spent on alcohol and the damage it was doing to young people.  We should all be involved in trying to remedy this problem but the lead should be given by the Department through advertising on television and radio the dangers to young people of alcohol. Publicans, too, should be exhorted to keep within the rules and not to serve drink to anybody under the age of 18.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMoore" hpid="Mr. Moore Mr. Moore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moore</NameTxt>
      <P>The maintenance of good health services is the most basic need in society.  I agree with Deputy McDonald that we have fairly good health services.  This is due to the fact that during the years we have had dedicated Ministers for Health.  The present Minister is playing his part in trying to improve the service, but he is being very much hampered by lack of money from the Government and by general apathy, from the Government point of view, in regard to his efforts. One can say that, despite the advance to the present state of our health services, a great amount of work must still be done before we could be satisfied that even the weakest person in our society is assured of treatment, <Col N="1887" /> hospitalisation, or outpatient or medicinal treatment.  We are not happy with the present position.</P>
      <P>Under this Bill added taxation is being imposed and it may well mean that in paying this extra money many a person will have to deny himself some delicacy or something he likes. While they will subscribe to the State's scheme of medicine they may be affecting their health through being deprived, perhaps, of some food when they find that the taxation which is now increasing weekly is almost unbearable.  I want to make the plea that the Department of Health should probe the various categories of our society and not just accept that because somebody lives in a suburban area and may appear to have a fairly high standard of living he is all right but to realise that behind that facade there often lies dire poverty and that we must shape our health services to cover such people.</P>
      <P>We must take to task the Government and the Minister for their attitude regarding the issue of medical cards.  It may be said that this is a matter for the health boards, in this case the Eastern Health Board, but that is only half the story, because if a direction goes out to cut down on health services so as to save money the medical cards will be affected.</P>
      <P>Over the years we could have done much more to keep people out of hospitals rather than to drive them into hospitals.  Today, with improved housing standards, the vast majority of houses in the city have hot and cold running water and I suggest that minor operations could be performed in people's homes.  This would have a big social benefit.  For example, where a mother may need a minor operation, instead of taking her away from her children into hospital, that operation could be carried out at her home, allowing her to remain with the children and also reducing the heavy cost of hospitalisation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With the end of the dispensary service I felt that we might well have used the dispensary buildings for mobile teams of nurses, physicians and <Col N="1888" /> surgeons who could go out to people's homes where the treatment required was essential but not serious enough to entail hospitalisation.  The example is there in the maternity hospitals in Dublin.  They are, and have been, operating a mobile service for years which is very efficient.  The comfort it would bring to a woman with any sort of psychological problem would be enormous if she knew that a mobile team could be at her house within minutes of her doctor requesting them.  Why can this principle not be extended to other branches of surgery instead of sending everybody to hospital where it costs a fabulous amount even for a week?  Why could the home not be used as a base and so allow the mother, or the father, to stay there?</P>
    <P>This is not cheese paring.  This idea was put forward by a famous English doctor some years ago.  It has been followed in this city to some extent and put into practice.  But I want to see it used on a much wider scale because, apart from anything else, we can save a good deal of money on it which would help to prevent extra taxation on people who find it difficult to meet the present burden.</P>
    <P>If one requires treatment at the Dublin Eye and Ear Hospital one must wait months for a bed.  Only tonight an old lady with a cataract on one eye came to see me.  She is to have an operation in the hospital but she must wait until next March before they can take her in.  That is no reflection on the staff of the hospital or the authorities, but we have a grave shortage of beds.  It is fair to say that this is no recent development; it has existed for years.  Admittedly, the delay has been reduced, but here we have a case in December where an old lady must wait until March before she can have her operation. This is quite wrong.  We cannot boast of our health services until that type of grievance is removed when a person whose vital faculties are affected must wait months for treatment.  I hope the Minister in replying will give us some hope that the waiting period will be cut down.  Especially in the case of old people, life with <Col N="1889" /> bad eyesight must be a misery and they should not have to wait and worry.  This old lady, who lives alone, must worry all the time over the delay and in the end she will have to face the ordeal of the operation.</P>
    <P>This is one sector of our hospital service which demands investigation. If it is shortage of skilled personnel or beds or buildings we should tackle the problem as it is a basic blot on the health service.  It would make taxation more palatable if the service was adequate but we shall pay the extra taxation and still have people waiting many months for admission for treatment.  This may apply to other branches of surgery&mdash;I do not know&mdash; but I can assure the Minister that the case I have quoted is genuine and I can supply details if he wishes.  I am sure he gets similar cases from Deputies and from people in his own constituency and on a national basis.  The Minister who will be able to have it recorded against his name that he cut down the waiting queues for eye treatment will need no other monument to his memory.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Moore</NameTxt>
      <P>Yesterday, I and two other Deputies asked a very simple question about conditions in Rathmines College of Commerce in Dublin because for many years we have known that it has been very much overcrowded and from time to time we have seen student protests on many matters.  I seldom feel in sympathy with student demonstrations or the occupation of buildings&mdash;which I am totally against&mdash;but I want to make clear that where we come across a case like Rathmines College where there is gross overcrowding, it is our duty as Deputies to pursue the matter and try to ensure that we remove the grievance of the students which in this case is justified.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1890" /> My colleagues, Deputy Briscoe and Deputy Gibbons, had asked in their questions that space be given in a new building being built very near the college by a private developer and the Minister in reply said he had received representations about the needs of the college and that he would be happy to provide prefabricated accommodation with a view to alleviating the present situation&mdash;which is quite acceptable and I am very glad to hear that.  Then he said that in regard to Ardee House the intention is that when the premises are leased to the State portion of the building will be made available to Dublin Vocational Education Committee for renting should the committee so desire.</P>
    <P>I take the Minister's word that he believed that when he gave this answer on 11th December, but on 6th December the Minister for Finance wrote on the matter and he said:</P>
    <P>I have your letter, addressed to the students, of 26th November, regarding accommodation at the College of Commerce.  The Dublin Planning Authority and the owners of Ardee House are not prepared to allow the building to be used for anything other than offices.  The Central Statistics Office urgently require every square inch of space available in Ardee House but at my request they have agreed to allow the College some office space in the building as a temporary measure. This will, I hope, reduce the pressure on accommodation in the College for the next couple of years. I have already told the Principal of the college that the proposals to develop the college have my full support.</P>
    <P>Here is a case of two Ministers, the Minister for Finance and the Minister for Education, not knowing what they are doing about the Rathmines College of Commerce.  It makes me very uneasy about our whole educational policy when we have one Minister saying that the students may have part of Ardee House and the other Minister saying that they can only have it for offices. To shift the offices from the college of commerce to the new building so as to make room for students is just &ldquo;not <Col N="1891" /> on&rdquo;.  We have sufficient remote control in education where students cannot communicate with the authorities and we do not want to bring about a situation where we have students at school in Rathmines Road and, quite a distance away, we have the offices.</P>
    <P>I also want to quote from a document which was sent by the owners of the building in May in which they said they would consider an application from the VEC for the letting of the entire premises at Ardee Road.  There we have three different versions.  In May the owners said they would let the whole building to the VEC.  On December 6th the Minister for Finance says that the owner and the Dublin planning authority are not prepared to allow the building to be used for anything except offices.  Then in this House yesterday the Minister for Education said in regard to Ardee House that the intention was when the premises were leased to the State portion of the building would be made available to the VEC for renting.</P>
    <P>It was not office space the college required; it was accommodation for students who are still trying to work in grossly overcrowded conditions.  I accepted, and still accept, the good faith of the Minister in the answer he gave yesterday about the prefabricated accommodation and this will relieve the position, but the Minister for Education has been misinformed by somebody regarding Ardee House.  Should we not ask then that the Minister for Finance get in touch with the Minister for Education and say exactly what is happening?  In this case the students are justified in making their protest. It must erode confidence in the Department of Education and in the Government generally when we have two Ministers, not at variance, but not in communication on this vital matter.</P>
    <P>The College of Commerce was in the area served by Deputy Ryan, Minister for Finance, and he had promised the principal that the proposals to develop the college would have his full support. I do not know what support he has given.  Has he ever discussed this with the Minister for Education?  Had he discussed it, it would immediately become <Col N="1892" /> obvious that there was a difference of opinion or, even more, that somebody had blundered badly when the Minister for Education had been informed that Ardee House, or part of it, would be made available to the students but the Minister for Finance said that it would not, that portion of it would be let for offices only.</P>
    <P>It may well be that the Dublin planning officer would not permit a change of use for the building to act as a third level college but why was this not discovered at the beginning? Is it not a simple matter to inquire about the building and its suitability and ask the Dublin planning officer if he has any objection?  If students are to go into any school the planning officer must be satisfied that there are certain safety precautions and that the place will not go on fire some day and result in the maiming, or worse, of some of the students, but there seems to have been no thought on this issue. The Government should be ashamed of this exhibition of inefficiency and a very inept attempt to provide a little more space for the 3,000 students who are trying to study at the Rathmines College of Commerce.  Students are often blamed for demanding too much or being too vocal&mdash;or even physical&mdash;in their efforts to redress their wrongs.  Here is a matter between the VEC, the Minister for Education and the students but somewhere along the line the whole thing has gone awry.  One can imagine the cynicism it breeds in students who want to study.  Many of the parents are put to the pin of their collar to send their children to the college.  We should be able to demand a higher standard of performance from both Ministers involved.</P>
    <P>How can we hope to implement a good educational policy if Ministers cannot agree on a simple matter like this?  I believe the Minister for Education made his statement in good faith but surely it is possible for him to ascertain through his officials whether Ardee House will be available as a third-level college or if it will simply be available to some of the officials. Probably the officials are overcrowded <Col N="1893" /> also but there are far fewer officials than students and the conditions for them are not quite as bad.</P>
    <P>When the Minister told me part of Ardee House would be available, naturally it was assumed it would be available for classrooms, common rooms or for the use of students. However, that does not appear to be the case.  There will be some space for offices but I am told that even if some of the offices were transferred from the college it would not ease the situation to any extent.</P>
    <P>Surely education is one of the most important aspects of society and from a Government who boast of many educationalists in their ranks we were entitled to expect a better performance. The boys and girls in Rathmines college will eventually enter commercial and industrial life.  We believe that as a result of the good training they receive from the excellent teachers in the Rathmines college in later years they will help to develop the economy of the country.</P>
    <P>Yesterday I asked the Minister if he could guarantee that the college would not be moved.  Apart from the rather ancient building and the cramped conditions, there is also the threat that the college will be transferred to the north Dublin area.  This would not be desirable.  The college of commerce has been in Rathmines for a long time, and the building is part of the community and the area as much as the houses of the people. Therefore, to put an extra worry on students and parents that some day they will have to move to the outer suburbs of north Dublin is not fair.</P>
    <P>I realise it is necessary to have regional colleges but I will not accept the blunders of the two Ministers involved here.  The Ministers for Finance and Education are very important Ministers.  The Minister for Education has his office in Marlborough Street and the Minister for Finance is in Merrion Street, but between 6th December when the Minister for Finance wrote about this matter and 11th December when the Minister for Education replied to a question put down by Deputies <Col N="1894" /> Briscoe, Gibbons and myself they could not meet to discuss the matter. If the students become cynical who can blame them?  Is there such a chasm between students and the Government that they do not bother to communicate?  Equally, is there such a chasm between the Ministers for Finance and Education that they do not communicate?</P>
    <P>We can fear for the development of our educational system if on this small matter&mdash;it is small in the context of the national need for education&mdash;we cannot tell the students and the college authorities that it is planned to give them more space.  The Minister for Education has promised the authorities that he will give them prefabricated buildings.  That would be of some help but it will not be a solution to the problem.  To suggest, as he has done, that part of Ardee House will be given over to the college, presumably for the students, misled me.  However, representatives of the student body came to see me and pointed out what the Minister for Finance had said earlier.</P>
    <P>The third document I quoted was from agents for the owners and they stated that the building could be given to the college or sold to them.  Despite that, the Minister for Finance has said the Dublin planning officer will not allow this change of use of the building.  The agents, a well known firm in the city, have said that they realise the building will be used as a third-level college.  The Minister for Education has said that the intention is that when the premises are leased to the State portion will be made available to the VEC, if the committee so desire.  The joke is in the last four words; the committee are put to the pin of their collar in their efforts to alleviate the frightful overcrowding. I can assure the Minister they want the premises but whether they want them for offices is a different matter.  They need space for the 3,000 students.  In this instance we have different versions from the agents for the owners, the Minister for Finance and the Minister for Education. Whose word are we to take in all of this?</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1895" /> It is my opinion that the Minister for Education has failed in his efforts to find a solution.  I hope he will be able to give me some information on this matter.</P>

      <P>The basis of Deputy Moore's case is a misunderstanding or a misreading of the answer which I gave in the House yesterday and which I now quote:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With regard to Ardee House the intention is that when the premises <Col N="1896" /> are leased to the State portion of the building will be made available to the City of Dublin VEC for renting should the committee so desire.</P>
    <P>The Deputy, a few minutes ago, allowed us to understand his misunderstanding by saying &ldquo;presumably for the students&rdquo;.  That was his understanding of the words I used in the reply.  I have got the verbatim report here which indicates that none of the Opposition Deputies pursued that specific point in their supplementary questions.  Therefore, to understand from the reply which I gave that I was making available portion of the building for the students was a misunderstanding which was not warranted by the answer I gave.</P>
    <P>Therefore, there is no conflict between the Minister for Finance, as quoted by Deputy Moore, and myself. The Minister for Finance said that some space for office accommodation will be made available.  I said that portions of Ardee House will be made available and my understanding, and I am now stating it categorically was that the portion will be made available not, as Deputy Moore says, presumably for the students but for office accommodation.  Therefore, there is absolutely no basis for the point made by the Deputy that there is misunderstanding between the Minister for Finance and myself.  In fact, when the questions were being pursued yesterday I had information concerning the Office of Public Works and the Department of Finance but I was not asked for it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy must not now try to put a gloss on his contribution which would indicate that I in any way deceived him.</P>
      <P>Let me bring the Deputy back to the origin of the problem of providing satisfactory accommodation at the College of Commerce, Rathmines.  In March, 1965, the then Minister for Education sanctioned an extension to the college.  During the following seven years successive Ministers grappled with the problem but failed to come up with the final solution. The problem is now mine.  It is a complex one as is evidenced by the fact that it has been in the pipeline since 1965.</P>
      <P>There are two issues involved&mdash;one, the question of moving the third level students from the present building to a new college of commerce and the other, the extent of the provision which is required for second level students in Rathmines.</P>
      <P>With regard to the first issue, this is tied up with the medium-term solution of the provision of third-level education in the Dublin area generally. There could be no question of taking a decision with regard to one aspect of third-level education in isolation, without reference to all aspects of the overall problem.  As I said in my supplementary answer on Wednesday, the Government decision in relation to the structuring of third-level education will be announced as soon as possible.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Moore raised the point that the college should not be transferred elsewhere because it is part of the local community facility and that any change would be resented by the people of the locality of Rathmines. I would remind the Deputy and those who waxed so eloquent today about another institution in another area, that decisions in principle had already been taken by my predecessor to transfer the college to a new location. In the autumn of 1970, my immediate predecessor commenced negotiations with the World Bank for a loan for educational purposes, including a loan for a new college of commerce in a new location.  His application was successful. I am now negotiating with the <Col N="1898" /> World Bank so that the money for the project may be transferred to the second World Bank loan.  The period for taking up the second loan will expire in December, 1978.  My objective, therefore, is to have the new college building completed by that date at the very latest.  That is my medium-term solution&mdash;to provide a new college on a new location by December, 1978.  There could be no question of leasing the entire Ardee House as a permanent solution without reference to the overall plan for third-level education in Dublin.</P>
    <P>Pending the erection of a new college on a new location what are the options open to me?  I have already authorised the rental of Ardee House by the City of Dublin Vocational Education Committee to accommodate the administrative staff of the college of commerce, thus releasing space in the college itself for classroom purposes.  This should be a significant contribution to the problem of inadequate accommodation.  To provide classroom accommodation in Ardee House would not be feasible as there could be considerable delay involved, due to the need to get planning permission and also the agreement, if indeed such would be forthcoming, of the vendor of Ardee House.</P>
    <P>As a further short-term solution I am happy to provide prefabricated classroom accommodation if the City of Dublin Vocational Education Committee would accept it.  In this regard, I understand there is space available for prefabricated rooms.  The experience of my Department over the past ten years is that prefabricated classrooms are quite suitable as a temporary measure.  They provide good, wellheated accommodation.  I was glad the Deputy did not force the issue of prefabricated buildings too far and was willing to accept them as a short-term solution.  Therefore, I will not enter into any defence of them.</P>
    <P>The second issue to which I referred in my opening remarks is the extent of the provision which is required for second-level students.  Having regard to the student potential in the area, <Col N="1899" /> present indications are that when the third-level students transfer to a new building, the existing accommodation, subject to minor modifications, might prove adequate.  This issue of the extent of the accommodation for second-level students will be examined by my Department in consultation with the Dublin Advisory Committee on second-level education in good time so that a satisfactory medium-term solution for these students can be provided.  In the meantime, the short-term solutions I have already referred to will meet their needs.</P>
    <P>May I reiterate the point I made in the beginning that this is a complex problem and not easy of solution?  It has been with us now since 1965. Many things have been around since the middle sixties and it is my duty to take up these pieces and try to bring some kind of pattern out of the chaos.  I am proposing that a new college of commerce which, as I have already indicated must be completed by December, 1978, will be erected. Pending the erection of that college I have authorised the rental of portion of Ardee House and the supply of prefabricated rooms.  I intend to keep the matter under review and to give as much assistance as possible to the VEC to meet any further difficulties that may arise.</P>

      <P>The number of public holidays remained unchanged until the first day of January, 1974 was declared a public holiday for the purposes of the 1961 Act.</P>
      <P>On 1st April, 1974 the Holidays (Employees) Act, 1973 came into operation.  This Act increased the annual entitlement of industrial workers to three working weeks and reduced the qualifying number of hours required to be worked during the leave year to 1,400, or 1,300 if under 18 years of age.  In the 1973 Act the same public holidays were listed as had been shown in earlier Acts.  The Act was passed in the autumn of 1973 before the new public holiday on January 1st was announced.  It was, therefore, necessary to make a regulation under the 1973 Act&mdash;the Holidays (Employees) Act, 1973 (Public Holiday) Regulations, 1974 (S.I. No. 341 of 1974)&mdash; appointing the 1st of January a public holiday in future years.</P>
      <P>The present position is, therefore, that industrial workers who work the qualifying number of hours are entitled to three weeks' annual leave and to seven paid public holidays.</P>
      <P>The laws relating to paid leave for agricultural workers are administered by the Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Labour (Mr. M. O'Leary)</NameTxt>
      <P>I have examined the document in question.  This proposal by the Commission, if adopted by the Council, would recommend that member states take the necessary steps to ensure by national legislation or, where approprivate, by collective agreements, the implementation by 31st December, 1975 of the principle that the normal working week should not exceed 40 hours and by 31st December, 1976 of the principle of a minimum annual paid holiday of four weeks.</P>
      <P>The draft recommendation, as at present worded, would apply to &ldquo;all sectors and throughout the Community&rdquo; and this would necessitate detailed consideration and consultation by the various interests concerned in the matter of its implementation.</P>
