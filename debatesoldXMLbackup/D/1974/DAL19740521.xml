      <NameTxt>Minister for Health (Mr. Corish)</NameTxt>
      <P>I have not yet completed my examination of the comments received from the various health administrative bodies and local health committees on the recommendations made on the future hospital development programme for the country as a whole by the joint working parties representing Comhairle na nOspidéal, the regional hospital boards and the health boards. Until I have completed my examination of the views submitted by the various bodies concerned and have taken account of all the factors involved in this complex study it would not be appropriate for me to make a statement relating to a particular hospital. I can assure the Deputy that I will make a statement on the hospital development programme as soon as I can do so.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>The Mid-Western Health Board recently made arrangements to have tuberculosis patients from their area treated in the sanatoria at Merlin Park, Galway, and Sarsfield's Court, Cork.  The discontinuance of the unit at St. Camillus' Hospital, Limerick, was decided on because of the decreasing number of tuberculosis patients being treated there and the need to utilise the accommodation for other hospital purposes.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="BrendanCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>I can appreciate the Deputy's concern and I think anybody in such a situation who would have to travel to Galway or Cork would also be concerned.  I am not quite sure whether this can be done.  It is done in respect of children: a certain <Col N="1762" /> number of vouchers is issued in a period of six or 12 months.  This is a matter for the Mid-Western Health Board and I shall put the Deputy's suggestion to them.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Mr. Molloy Mr. Molloy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware that Dr. Cedric Woods of UCG has given it as his opinion that such effects are taking place due to pollution on the Continent?  Would the Minister ensure that the information available to him is properly researched in relation to Irish conditions?  I appreciate that the Minister would be interested in the results of international scientific research into this problem but I think local research would also be necessary to ensure that we are protected.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>Over the past 10 years there was a noticeable increase in winds with an easterly component. Possibly for nine of those years it could have been for a different reason. <Col N="1763" /> In fact, what Deputy Molloy said is that because somebody has made a statement my Department may not have the correct information.  I can assure him that every attention is being given to this matter and we are keeping abreast of developments.  The fact that somebody makes a statement does not alter facts.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>An international body is carrying out the research.  So far my Department have not taken part in this international body.  Perhaps that is as well because Deputy Molloy would probably have a question down asking how much money we were spending on it.  We are keeping in touch with the matter from here and the Deputy and the House may be assured that everything possible that has to be done is being done.</P>

      <P>Would the Minister not agree that this bank, being one of the most important institutions in the country, is entitled to have the type of building that would meet our national aspirations and in view of the fact of the very heavy cost now involved to bring it back to what is required, would he not consider giving the necessary permission?  It does not appear to be out of line from O'Connell Street or from any places around with other tall buildings.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not know what our national aspirations have to do with a breach of a planning application but I can assure the Deputy that a proposal to carry on building in a manner contrary to the planning permission given cannot be allowed.  In view of the fact that there was a lengthy oral hearing as a result of which my decision was taken, I do not think I should be asked to comment further on it.</P>

      <P>In view of the fact that the planning authority of Dublin Corporation in the early stages granted permission for a building 176 feet tall and that there is a fairly widespread feeling among the people of Dublin that it would be a major inconvenience and an unnecessary expense, to lower the building now that it has been put up to this height, would the Minister, now that he has asserted the validity of our planning laws, consider as a <i>deus ex machina</i> intervening and endeavouring to bring about some compromise which would obviate the expense and the inconvenience of lowering this building?</P>

The first is that anybody who wanted to make representations, such as Deputies O'Connor and Haughey have been making here, had his opportunity to attend the public oral hearing where he could have said what he felt should be said.  Secondly, I do not believe that because an organisation is very rich they should be allowed to break the planning laws and, thirdly, I do not agree that I should be asked in this House to make a decision on or to make a comment on something which was done or was not done by Dublin Corporation before this planning appeal came before me.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MarkAClinton" hpid="Mr. Clinton Mr. Clinton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Clinton</NameTxt>
      <P>That is something that I would not wish to be pinned down on because a lot of factors enter into this.

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MarkAClinton" hpid="Mr. Clinton Mr. Clinton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Clinton</NameTxt>
      <P>Directive 159 requires that in order to come into the development category, a farmer must have farming as his main occupation in the sense that it occupies at least 50 per cent of his time and yields 50 per cent of his income.  In addition, on completion of his farm plan, the farm must be capable of yielding the full comparable income for at least one labour unit.  Beyond that, up to 20 per cent of the earned income of the farm may come from non-farm activity.</P>
      <P>For transitional farmers, there is no provision either in the directive or in the farm modernisation scheme as to the amount of time or income that may be attributed to non-farm activity.  Part-time farmers will thus be eligible for the aids open to this category so long as they continue to work their farms and to get any significant part of their income from farming.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O.J. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries the schemes of agricultural grants and aids which were abolished when the EEC directive on farm modernisation became operative; whether, in view of the current crisis in Irish farming, he will consider reintroducing some of them; and if any special new schemes of grants and assistance to Irish farmers are permissible under EEC regulations and, if not, if he will state the clauses in the Treaty of Accession to the EEC and the relevant EEC directives and regulations which prohibit them.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Clinton</NameTxt>
      <P>Grant aid is available under the farm modernisation scheme for all the categories of capital investment on farms which were previously covered by individual schemes, except for capital investment in poultry and egg production, aid for which is not now permitted.  In addition the farm modernisation scheme extends aids to certain works, including fixed equipment on farms, which did not hitherto attract grants.  Since these aids continue to be available the question of reintroducig them does not arise.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Aids towards capital investment on farms are now governed by Directive 159/72 on the modernisation of farms <Col N="1773" /> and are subject to the conditions in that directive.</P>
    <P>Any new measures of assistance to farmers which might be proposed by a member country would be subject to examination and approval in accordance with Articles 92 to 94 of the Rome Treaty.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O.J. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>Having regard to the fact that the way of life of Irish agriculture is different from that in every other European country, is the Minister quite satisfied, beyond all shadow of doubt, that the farm modernisation scheme now in operation does not warrant early review? Furthermore, has he had any consultations with farming organisations in relation to the practicability of the scheme?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MarkAClinton" hpid="Mr. Clinton Mr. Clinton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Clinton</NameTxt>

      <P>asked the Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries the circumstances in which a report was circulated by his Department to the effect that intervention beef would be released to hospitals and charitable institutions at 12 per cent below the intervention price, in view of the fact that no decision has yet been taken by the EEC; when he expects such a decision, if any, to be taken; and the approximate proportion of the intervention beef in cold storage which he expects to be affected.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MarkAClinton" hpid="Mr. Clinton Mr. Clinton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Clinton</NameTxt>
      <P>My Department circulated no such report.</P>
      <P>On 9th May the Department issued an announcement about the commercial sale of intervention beef at prices determined by the EEC Commission as owner of the beef.  This was misinterpreted in certain sections of the Press as relating to the sale of such beef at reduced prices to non-profit making institutions for social purposes, although the announcement drew attention to the previous tendering system for such commercial sales. These Press misinterpretations were pointed out in a further announcement by my Department on 13th May.</P>
      <P>The question of the sale of intervention beef at reduced prices for social purposes is still under consideration by the EEC Commission but I expect a decision will be taken thereon very shortly.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries whether he has given approval to any private companies to apply for grants from the Industrial Development Authority to enable them to construct additional storage premises for intervention beef; and, if so, if he will indicate the names of such companies, the amount of the grant applied for in each case, the amount of the storage capacity mentioned and details of the scrutiny procedures conducted by his Department in vetting such applications.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MarkAClinton" hpid="Mr. Clinton Mr. Clinton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Clinton</NameTxt>
      <P>My Department made representations to the Industrial Development Authority with a view to facilitating the provision of extra cold storage by commercial interests, <Col N="1776" /> with particular reference to the requirements of such storage for intervention beef.  The authority agreed to make grants available in that connection within an overall total of 5,000 tons extra storage and 15 extra blast-freezing tunnels.  My Department conveyed this information at a meeting with representatives of the public cold storage companies concerned, who were advised to make their applications direct to the Industrial Development Authority.  The consideration of applications so made is a matter primarily for the Industrial Development Authority whom my Department are prepared to assist in any way requested.  My Department are not involved directly with the individual applicants.</P>

    <Speaker pid="OliverJFlanagan" hpid="Mr. O.J. Flanagan Mr. O.J. Flanagan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O.J. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>Having regard to the fact that the Industrial Development Authority is not under the jurisdiction of the Department of Agriculture, is there any way by which the Minister could make available the names of such companies? There is a substantial sum of public money involved and it has been the practice to release information about grants available from the IDA by the Minister for Industry and Commerce. In view of the fact that this information is of vital concern, having regard to the circumstances, would the Minister undertake to have the names of these companies made available to the House?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MarkAClinton" hpid="Mr. Clinton Mr. Clinton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Clinton</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O.J. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>When the grants have been approved and, since the IDA have indicated numerous sources through which they have made money available, will the Minister be prepared to ask the IDA to make the identity of the companies concerned known to the Government?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MarkAClinton" hpid="Mr. Clinton Mr. Clinton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Clinton</NameTxt>
      <P>My answer to that is: &ldquo;No, I will not&rdquo; because it would be wrong to depart in specific instances from the normal practice of publishing <Col N="1777" /> this sort of information in the annual report.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MarkAClinton" hpid="Mr. Clinton Mr. Clinton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Clinton</NameTxt>
      <P>The additional charges refer to the cost of moving our beef from approved Irish intervention stores to approved intervention stores elsewhere in the Community, in view of the limited storage available here.  The cost involved so far is about £400,000.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MarkAClinton" hpid="Mr. Clinton Mr. Clinton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Clinton</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O.J. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister does agree that, from his statement, this does not portray a very high standard of intelligence on the part of those responsible in Brussels.  Does he seriously consider that the meat concerned should be exported from this country, put into storage and then brought back again to be sold here at a reduced rate?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MarkAClinton" hpid="Mr. Clinton Mr. Clinton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Clinton</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="OliverJFlanagan" hpid="Mr. O.J. Flanagan Mr. O.J. Flanagan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O.J. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries whether the pig population is now only 60 per cent of what it was before entry to the EEC, despite the predictions of expanded production; whether under EEC regulations pig producers who do not grow 35 per cent of their barley requirements on their own land are ineligible for grants; and whether, in view of this, he has devised any ways by which the livelihoods of Irish pig producers, especially the smaller producers, might be sustained as well as business and employment in the bacon factories.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MarkAClinton" hpid="Mr. Clinton Mr. Clinton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Clinton</NameTxt>
      <P>As regards the first part of the question, there was in fact an increase of 2.8 per cent in pig numbers in December, 1973, as compared with December, 1972.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As regards the second and third parts of the question, the EEC regulation regarding grant aid towards capital investment by pig producers requires that the farm be deemed capable of producing that proportion <Col N="1779" /> of the feed requirements of the pig enterprise, not that 35 per cent of their barely requirements is actually grown on the land.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnCallanan" hpid="Mr. Callanan Mr. Callanan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Callanan</NameTxt>
      <P>My question refers to the smaller pig producers in the west and the north-west.  The Minister is well aware that in the main pig producing areas it is a great hardship to ask producers to comply with that regulation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MarkAClinton" hpid="Mr. Clinton Mr. Clinton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Clinton</NameTxt>
      <P>The intention behind this is not to be aiding what would be regarded as industrialised pig production where there is no need for a farm at all.  It is to ensure that the man who is getting the aid is a farmer.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MarkAClinton" hpid="Mr. Clinton Mr. Clinton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Clinton</NameTxt>
      <P>The answer to Deputy Brennan is that the slaughterings do not indicate that.  Deliveries of pigs to bacon factories in the first 17 weeks of 1974 were 662,910 as compared with 656,966 last year.  In other words, more pigs were delivered to factories in the first 17 weeks of this year.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries the effect he estimates the abolition of An Bord Gráin has had on meal prices in the Republic, especially in so far as feeding barely for pig producers is concerned; and whether he has any proposals for preventing private speculators from cornering large amounts of barley and selling it at monopoly prices.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MarkAClinton" hpid="Mr. Clinton Mr. Clinton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Clinton</NameTxt>
      <P>Because of the withdrawal of quantitative import controls on our accession to the EEC, An Bord Gráin could only have engaged in the marketing of feed grains on the same basis as a commercial organisation.  Its continued existence on this basis would have had little or no effect on the prices since paid by pig producers for feed grains.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is a free market here both in <Col N="1781" /> home-grown and imported grain and the prices are related to world prices. As these prices are subject to wide fluctuations from time to time both losses and gains can be incurred by the traders concerned.  In these circumstances competition in the trade should be sufficient to prevent a monopoly situation arising.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MarkAClinton" hpid="Mr. Clinton Mr. Clinton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Clinton</NameTxt>
      <P>With the permission of the Ceann Comhairle, I propose to take Questions Nos. 26 to 30, inclusive together.</P>
      <P>Official statistics are not yet available for imports of tomatoes in 1974. I understand however that the only tomatoes being imported at present from EEC sources are from the Netherlands.  Imports from the United Kingdom earlier in the year were not significant.  Notwithstanding the imports from the Netherlands, prices received on the home market by Irish producers so far this year compare very favourably with prices received in the same period in recent years.</P>
      <P>There is a prohibition on imports of tomatoes into Ireland from third countries from 15th May until the marketing of the Irish crop is completed. Imports of tomatoes from EEC countries are subject to duty at the rate of 16p per 12 lb tray from the United Kingdom and 24p per 12 lb tray from the other member countries.</P>
      <P>The implementation of the recent judgment of the Court of Justice of the European Communities should result in a compensatory amount&mdash;inclusive of import duty&mdash;of approximately 44p per 12 lb tray being charged on imports of tomatoes from EEC countries, other than Denmark, from 11th June to 21st November, 1974.  Irish exports to such EEC countries and to third countries should qualify for a compensatory payment of a similar amount which in the case of exports to the EEC countries would be augmented by the amount of any import duty payable.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am aware that the increased costs, particularly the rise in the cost of fuel oil resulting from the energy crisis, have caused problems for Irish <Col N="1783" /> horticultural producers.  Representations made to me by the industry for financial aid to meet increased fuel costs are under active consideration.</P>

    <Speaker pid="OliverJFlanagan" hpid="Mr. O.J. Flanagan Mr. O.J. Flanagan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O.J. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>Can the Minister say if information which I received at a meeting in London is correct, to the effect that the glasshouse industries in Britain, West Germany, Holland and Denmark, have received substantial financial assistance in order to meet the increased fuel costs?  If this is so, what is the cause of the delay in making similar funds available here?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MarkAClinton" hpid="Mr. Clinton Mr. Clinton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Clinton</NameTxt>
      <P>It is so that the countries mentioned by the Deputy have received aid at various levels.  I have said the matter is under active consideration.  We have to collect data in all those countries so as to ensure exactly what they are being given.  The Dutch growers are mainly dependent on natural gas and they have got special subsidies for the changeover from oil to gas.  It is hard to estimate these things and the effect of them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardCollins" hpid="Mr. G. Collins Mr. G. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister say what the exact loss would be to Irish tomato growers as a result of the Government not introducing a subsidy scheme to cover the increased fuel costs?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MarkAClinton" hpid="Mr. Clinton Mr. Clinton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Clinton</NameTxt>
      <P>This is the sort of misrepresentation of the position that can arise at Question Time.  If we look at the prices we get an indication that from 1st to 10th May, 1973, the price for 12 lb trays was £1.99p. This year the price is £2.49p.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MarkAClinton" hpid="Mr. Clinton Mr. Clinton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Clinton</NameTxt>
      <P>The price of oil has gone up approximately two-and-a-half times what it was but it does not indicate that there is a substantial loss involved here.  In addition to this, the court case which we fought in Europe is going to procure a substantial advantage for Irish producers. In addition to that again, they have monetary compensatory amounts which will help so the level of aid here would not need to be as great as that in Holland or in Britain, for that matter.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister be prepared to accept from me that, in my personal experience, not far from where I live there are growers whom I am satisfied will go bankrupt unless the Minister intervenes quickly and positively in the matter of an oil subsidy?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MarkAClinton" hpid="Mr. Clinton Mr. Clinton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Clinton</NameTxt>
      <P>I am aware that there are growers in the area generally described by Deputy Haughey who have borrowed heavily in recent times to build their houses and who have that additional overhead on top of normal growers' costs.  I feel that consideration must be given to their problem.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickPower" hpid="Mr. Power Mr. Power">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Power</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister not consider that there is something wrong with his stand when he has refused up to now to give a subsidy to Irish growers?  He is well aware that the Dutch people have given a package deal to their growers who are in direct competition with ours.  The figures would show that after March, 1974, they are paying 10.48p per gallon as against 15.20p in Ireland.  Is the Minister further aware that his <Col N="1785" /> stand in being reluctant, to say the least, to give assistance to our growers is placing them in a frightful position?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MarkAClinton" hpid="Mr. Clinton Mr. Clinton">

      <NameTxt>Minister for Foreign Affairs (Dr. FitzGerald)</NameTxt>
      <P>The Commission of the European Communities is not separately preparing any proposals for the Law of the Sea Conference.  It does, however, assist member States in their efforts to secure the co-ordination of positions where possible by submitting proposals at co-ordination meetings. Ireland is, of course, represented at these meetings.</P>
      <P>Our representatives have spared no effort in presenting our position fully and where appropriate have submitted detailed proposals in pursuance of our special interests.</P>

    </Speaker>

      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>The State will be represented at the forthcoming Law of the Sea Conference by a delegation of approximately ten persons led by Mr. C.C. Cremin, former Permanent Representative of Ireland to the United Nations.  The delegation will include officers from my Department and from the Department of Agriculture and Fisheries, Industry and Commerce and Finance.</P>
      <P>An interdepartmental committee has been working at the formulation and preparation of a policy for the conference.  I hope to put recommendations to the Government within a very short period.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister not accept that it is a grave discourtesy to the American people, to the Kennedy family and, indeed, to <Col N="1792" /> the Irish people who had such respect for this Irish-American President that this Government should take such a decision without having any consultation with either the American Government or the Kennedy family?  Can the Minister explain why such discourtesy should have been offered to those particular interests?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Dr. FitzGerald Dr. FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think that any discourtesy is involved or was intended. The decision was taken as to the action to be taken in this case.  I have no request to provide a channel of communication on this matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister will recognise that this was this nation's tribute to a great Irish-American President made by the Government at that time.  The Minister will accept that, at least in common courtesy, any Government should have had consultation in advance with the American Government and possibly with the Kennedy family as well.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Dr. FitzGerald Dr. FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not feel that was the case.  We have, in fact, commemorated President Kennedy in various ways.  This particular project has, for reasons known, not come to fruition.  I do not think it would be expected of us that in relation to each project we should consult the United States Government.  Each country has in its own way tried to commemorate this great President.  The particular way in which it is done in the nature of things would not always be a matter for consultation with the American Government.  The American Government would not expect that that would be the case.</P>

      <P>Proposals from the Commission of the European Communities for the establishment of a Regional Development Fund and the conditions under which it will operate have been tabled before the Council of <Col N="1793" /> Ministers which has not yet come to a decision on the matter.</P>
      <P>Until agreement is reached on such matters as the eventual size and the manner of distribution of the proposed fund's resources, it is not possible to say what projects in Ireland would benefit from the fund.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>In view of the fact that some people are alarmed about the long delay in the provision of money for the Regional Fund would the Minister like to say when he thinks a final decision on the size of the fund and the distribution of moneys will be taken?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Dr. FitzGerald Dr. FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>We are all very disturbed by the delay that has taken place in this matter.  I wish I could give a firm answer to that question but I cannot.  The whole problem has got bogged down at the moment. We will do anything we can to bring it forward to a successful conclusion. The difficulty is that if one presses it too hard at the wrong moment one might get a fund that would be unsatisfactory from our point of view. I am sorry I cannot give a more satisfactory answer.  We are in the position here where it requires the concensus of nine countries to reach agreement.  That concensus has not yet been forthcoming for a project on the scale and on the terms that we in this country would find satisfactory. We can only continue to press this and hope that it will emerge in the course of the months ahead.</P>

    <Speaker pid="LiamCosgrave" hpid="The Taoiseach Liam Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>Members of the House have asked to be associated with the expression of sympathy already tendered by the Government to the victims of the bombings in Dublin and Monaghan last Friday and their relatives.  I have received similar messages of condolence from <Col N="1794" /> the British Prime Minister, Mr. Wilson, the Leader of the Opposition there, Mr. Heath, the Chief Executive Minister, Mr. Faulkner and many other leaders of Church and State who have asked that their sympathy too should be made known to the victims of these mindless outrages and their relatives.</P>
      <P>Nothing I can say will adequately describe the feelings of shock and horror caused by the destruction of human life and hope last Friday.  It was without exception the worst single outrage in these islands&mdash;measured in terms of human death and misery, caused deliberately by man against man since the end of the Second World War.</P>
      <P>As a result of the bombings, more than 30 men, women and children alive on Friday afternoon are now dead.  More than 100 are injured. The persons caught up in this calamity bore no malice towards those who destroyed or maimed them. Their lives were no threat to those who treated them as enemies.  But because they happened to be in certain streets at certain times, they are now dead&mdash;or disfigured for life. Those responsible have reaped their grim harvest.</P>
      <P>What do they hope to gain?  What does any man of violence in these islands hope to gain?  For the blood of the innocent victims of last Friday's outrage&mdash;and of the victims of similar outrages in the North and in England&mdash;is on the hands of every man who has fired a gun or discharged a bomb in furtherance of the present campaign of violence in these islands&mdash;just as plainly as it is on the hands of those who parked the cars and set the charges last Friday.  In our times, violence cannot be contained in neat compartments and justified in one case but not in another.  Those who practise it must anticipate an answer in kind.  What they are creating in the end is a world where reason and compassion are dead and only might is right.  To them I would say that the only unity they are capable of creating is the unity, in opposition, of all decent men and women, to their values and methods.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I said last Friday that it was on <Col N="1795" /> occasions like this that we appreciate the dedicated work of the Garda, Army, fire, medical, nursing and other emergency services.  The Government look for and will give all possible support to the forces in their efforts to apprehend the perpetrators of last Friday's outrage&mdash;and of all crimes of violence in this island or elsewhere.</P>
    <P>It only remains for me to ask the House to rise in expression of sympathy with those killed or injured last Friday and with their relatives and friends.</P>

      <P>On behalf of the Fianna Fáil Party I join with the Taoiseach in extending sincere sympathy to the relatives of those who were killed so cruelly and suddenly and whose lives were so suddenly cut off in last Friday's bombings, and to those who were injured and their relatives.</P>
      <P>Like the Taoiseach, I find it difficult to find words that adequately express my feelings and those of any decent and responsible person.  It is difficult to express our feelings of sympathy, horror and condemnation. Every person and every organisation which played any part in the campaign of bombing and violence which killed and maimed people and destroyed property in Belfast, Derry or any other part of our country and indeed in Britain over the past five years, shares the guilt and the shame of the assassins who actually placed these bombs on the streets of Dublin and Monaghan last Friday.</P>
      <P>Not only must we make every effort to identify and bring to justice those responsible but we must do all we possibly can to create a climate between all Irish men and women which will eventually eradicate fears, suspicions and hatreds that generate such callous and cowardly acts of violence.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I join with the Taoiseach in expressing appreciation to the Garda, the Defence Forces, the medical and nursing profession, as well as to the <Col N="1796" /> ambulance men and the volunteers who not only offered blood but who were actually on the spot.  I understand that a Member of this House was one such person who gave aid and succour to the victims.</P>
    <P>I want to assure the Government on behalf of the Fianna Fáil Party that they will have our support in implementing measures that will best achieve the aims we seek.</P>

      <P>This amendment is essential and desirable.  If a person takes her claim for equal pay and is successful, she should be reinstated in her former position.  It would be a weakness in the Bill if one could be successful in a claim and at the same time lose one's job.  This would discriminate against the female worker. I hope the Minister will accept my amendment and so strengthen the Bill.  The amendment will ensure that where an equal pay claim succeeds one will still have one's job.  An employer might feel that an easy way to dispense with the services of such an individual would be by paying the required amount.  As I said, it is essential and desirable that this amendment be adopted by the Minister in order to ensure that the person who makes the claim is fully and adequately protected.</P>

      <P>As I mentioned the last day, there were difficulties.  We had considered such a provision when the Bill was being drafted but we were advised, on discussing this with the Attorney General, that certain constitutional questions relating to such a provision could be raised.  This is mainly why such a provision as Deputy Dowling would desire is not included in this Bill.  However, such possibilities of unfair dismissals arising because of the holding of a union office or for some other reason will be covered in legislation which I have already announced.  This legislation <Col N="1801" /> would not be coming into effect until December, 1975, whereas the other legislation will be coming into effect, I would hope, once this House has given permission later this year.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JosephDowling" hpid="Mr. Dowling Mr. Dowling">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dowling</NameTxt>
      <P>I fail to see how the Minister can say he is prepared to bring in legislation in another Bill to cover precisely this same aspect and yet say it would be unconstitutional in this Bill.  The Interim Report of the Commission on the Status of Women says in section 147:</P>
      <P>Certain European countries have, however, experienced a reduction in female employment after embarking on programmes of equal pay.</P>
      <P>It goes on to indicate in section 154:</P>
      <P>It is necessary to note, however, that the advantages of equal pay are likely to accrue mainly in the long term, while most of the adverse effects occur in the phasing-in period.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is quite clear from the experience of other European countries and from the examination done by the <Col N="1802" /> commission that there are dangers in the phasing-in period.  Therefore, it is desirable that there would be some protection.  It is certainly not an anti-discrimination Bill, assuming there is no other legislation introduced, if an employer can dismiss a person and merely pay the amount that the court would find due in relation to arrears of equal pay.  Such dismissal would certainly be a discrimination against a female.  I can see no logic in the suggestion that another Bill would cover the point in precisely the same way and that it would not be unconstitutional, whereas it would be unconstitutional to put it into this Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMoore" hpid="Mr. Moore Mr. Moore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moore</NameTxt>
      <P>It would be very easy to cover this matter if the Minister would insert a clause in the Bill saying that an employee's position may not be worsened by any action she takes in order to achieve equal pay. In any kind of negotiations or in the transfer, let us say, of civil servants or local authority officials from one place to another, it is common to write in that their conditions of employment will not be worsened.  This is a basic right.  We cannot worsen people's position if they avail of our legislation to better themselves.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOLeary" hpid="Mr. M. O'Leary Mr. M. O'Leary">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Dowling raises the point, if there are constitutional difficulties in the present case, how the same constitutional difficulties will not occur in the drafting of later legislation.  That is a fair question. This problem obviously will not go away.  The difficulties about legislation in relation to reinstatement will arise in that later legislation, but in that later legislation we shall attempt to put in statute form certain protections against unfair dismissals which should go a great deal of the way to deal with the temptation towards unfair dismissals.  The same difficulty will still obtain about reinstatement.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>However, while these difficulties do exist and mainly relate to interpretations of what the Constitution states in this area, I undertake to have this whole area re-examined in time for this unfair dismissals legislation which, as I have told Deputies, may still involve the same problem as we <Col N="1803" /> are faced with now.  I already considered this amendment myself in framing this legislation, but the legal advice available to me suggested it could be questioned on constitutional grounds.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JosephDowling" hpid="Mr. Dowling Mr. Dowling">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dowling</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister agree that the title of the Bill is an impediment to acceptance of this amendment?  If the legislation was called the Conditions of Employment (Pay) Bill, 1974, could it not be made a condition of employment that the person would be so reinstated?  The Minister is well aware that the re-instatement of the person is an absodute necessity.  The Bill is farcical if an employer can dismiss a shop steward or someone else whom he sees as a threat and merely pay him the arrears of equal pay.  It could well be that the employer could concede an equal pay claim to everyone else in the establishment except the one person. That person would have to proceed to court and, while winning his case, he would lose his job.  Therefore, the legislation discriminates against the worker.  Some undertaking will have to be written into the Bill to ensure continuity of employment for people and that they cannot be discriminated against in the way I have outlined.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMoore" hpid="Mr. Moore Mr. Moore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moore</NameTxt>
      <P>The non-acceptance of Deputy Dowling's amendment may result in this legislation being negatived from the beginning.  It will not encourage workers to seek equal pay if they think some kind of penal clause is hanging over their heads with regard to their employment.  I suggest to the Minister that he might withdraw the Bill and have this legislation included in the omnibus Bill which has been referred to.  In this way he would keep sacrosanct the principle of Deputy Dowling's amendment and we would have a real piece of legislation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The title of the Bill is clumsy.  The measure has been attacked on all sides, although I support the principle of the Bill.  The Minister should bring forward the promised legislation or defer this measure until he is in a position to guarantee the right to workers that if they take action under <Col N="1804" /> legislation passed by the Oireachtas they will not be penalised.  We owe this to the workers.  If the Minister deferred this Bill until more complete legislation was ready, the House would surely speed the passage of such legislation.</P>
    <P>This Bill has been criticised by the ICTU, the employers and, strangely enough, by some women's organisations. The Minister would be doing a service to the workers if he would defer this measure, expedite the new legislation and include the principle enshrined in Deputy Dowling's amendment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOLeary" hpid="Mr. M. O'Leary Mr. M. O'Leary">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>The constitutionality of the title of the Bill does not involve us in any difficulty.  We should keep a sense of proportion in this matter.  While we may not be able to include this provision in the present legislation because of difficulties I have already mentioned, and while I undertake to see whether the difficulties that relate to the constitutional area of interpretation can be removed for later legislation, there is no guarantee of that so long as we have the present Constitution.</P>
      <P>However, we must remember that an employer who is found guilty will be liable on summary conviction to a fine not exceeding £100 and on indictment to a fine not exceeding £1,000. He will be liable to payment of £10 per employee per day for each continuing offence.  It will be an expensive breaking of the law for the employer who sets out to break the provisions of this legislation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JosephDowling" hpid="Mr. Dowling Mr. Dowling">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dowling</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Moore has made an excellent point, that if a person felt he would be dismissed because of bringing an equal pay claim before the courts he might not grasp the advantages contained in the Bill.  There must be adequate protection to ensure that, freely and without fear, a person may be able to have a claim processed without fear of losing employment. On weighing up the amount of retrospective pay a person would receive as against loss of employment, on many occasions that person would accept the lesser of the two evils, namely, to work at a lower <Col N="1805" /> rate of pay.  This may not happen to a great extent in the cities but the situation could arise in the more remote parts where employment is scarce.</P>
      <P>The commission reported that the estimated displacement of women workers in the manufacturing industries in response to the full impact of equal pay will be about 10 per cent. They estimate the phasing-in period at about five years and this would give 2 per cent per year.  The figure of 10 per cent represents a substantial amount of female labour.  If employers thought they could evade their responsibilities, or if people could be threatened with the loss of their jobs as against the extra remuneration, in many cases they would accept the lesser of the two evils.</P>
      <P>The Minister must ensure that the employers do not evade their responsibilities, that an employee will not be afraid to make a claim because he fears the loss of his employment. The commission have stated there will be adverse effects during the phasing-in period and that there will be considerable difficulties with regard to female labour.  We sympathise with the Minister in his desire to get the legislation through.  We will not impede the passage of legislation provided it is reasonable and gives the necessary guarantees that people cannot and will not be victimised.  No such guarantees have been given by the Minister in this legislation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Each piece of legislation must stand on its own.  If there are constitutional difficulties envisaged in another Bill, which the Minister has indicated, it means that when this Bill becomes an Act there will be considerable vagueness in its provisions and there will be no guarantee that people will be able to retain their employment.  This is an important amendment.  The Minister must examine this aspect of the matter and assure the House that the person who takes a claim will be adequately safeguarded and that people will not be afraid to take claims because of fears regarding their jobs.  Would the Minister give us a full indication regarding the <Col N="1806" /> constitutional problems?  He outlined this matter in a brief way.</P>

      <P>I will give the necessary headings in that area.  I am sure the Deputy does not want to go into case law; I would not be qualified to go into that area of interpretation. It relates to difficulties between Articles 40.3.1 and 40.6.1.  Article 40.3.1 provides that the State will guarantee in its laws to respect, and, as far as practicable, by its laws, to defend and vindicate the personal rights of the citizen; the other Article guarantees liberty to exercise rights to form associations and unions. Based on case law, and relating to those constitutional provisions, I am informed this could be tested.</P>
      <P>I undertake that in later legislation I will re-examine this area.  This difficulty will still be there but in that legislation we should be able to limit the area of danger of an employee being dispensed with by an employer for any particular reason.  The offences in this area are pretty large; an employer who broke the law in this area would be subject to heavy fines.  I do not see it as a widespread problem but I undertake to look into the matter further in the later legislation.</P>

      <P>The question of the right of association is not a factor to the retention of employment.  From the interpretation of the Constitution by the Minister it does not appear to me that there is a constitutional problem.  It is merely the question of the retention of employment.  This is good business and is written into most agreements.  It is farcial to put a Bill through this House, which gives no guarantee to the person that he will retain his employment.  Surely the Minister could devise some formula to ensure continuity of employment for people who win their claims in court.  He has already agreed that is desirable.  As Deputy Moore has pointed out, this may impede people from seeking the benefits which the Minister so rightly envisages will be available under the Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This negatives the Bill.  There is no <Col N="1807" /> doubt that unscrupulous employers will take advantage of it to get rid of certain employees at the minimum expense to themselves.  It provides them with an easy way to dispense with employees, much easier than giving them notice or dismissing them.  As the Minister is aware, at the moment dismissals are minimal. The Minister will have to re-think this section.  If there is no safeguard the Bill will be the Discrimination (Pay) Bill, 1974, rather than the Anti-Discrimination (Pay) Bill, 1974, because it will discriminate against the female worker who has her claim processed successfully and loses her employment.  This is a weakness in the Bill.</P>
    <P>The Minister said there is a constitutional problem here.  If there is a constitutional problem in future legislation, what we intend to do will be negatived.  If he tries to correct the situation in another Bill it will probably be found unconstitutional too.  Before we pass from this section I would ask the Minister to include a section giving this necessary and desirable guarantee to female workers. Otherwise there will be discrimination and the Minister will be asking us to divide on a section which is discriminatory in itself.  I do not know how the Minister can get around this problem, but something should be written into the Bill.</P>
    <P>This difficulty must be corrected in the Bill because there is no guarantee, apparently, that the same thing will not apply in future legislation. If the Minister cannot find a suitable formula this legislation is a useless document, and it will be abused by unscrupulous employers.  If there is no covering clause in the Bill, it will give an employer an undue and unfair advantage over workers.  That is not the Minister's intention.</P>

      <P>One cannot envisage a prominent &ldquo;women's libber&rdquo; being penalised under this Bill, but it could happen that a woman who merely wants to better herself and get equal pay for the job she is doing could be <Col N="1808" /> penalised.  She would not be very vocal and she would be more likely to be penalised by an employer than a leading light in some women's liberation movement.  We should cherish all the workers equally and we should not countenance for one moment the possibility of passing legislation which would allow an employer to inflict any hardship on one of his workers.</P>
      <P>The Minister said it might be unconstitutional to accept the basis of Deputy Dowling's amendment but I submit that it would be far more unconstitutional to enshrine in our legislation a provision under which somebody could be penalised.  I would have serious reservations about supporting this provision.  Surely it is a basic civil right that no injury should be done to these women and that their position should not be worsened by any legal action they may take under this legislation.  I would appeal to the Minister to defer this Bill until the new legislation is ready or to accept Deputy Dowling's simple amendment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JosephDowling" hpid="Mr. Dowling Mr. Dowling">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dowling</NameTxt>
      <P>This creates a problem for people making a claim for equal pay.  I do not believe it was the Minister's intention to introduce legislation under which a person making a claim would be at a disadvantage. Possibly there would be a revolt if legislation were enacted giving the employer the rights which he would have under this section.  We would need a stronger assurance from the Minister than the vague one he gave to the House to the effect that he will embody it in other legislation but he still thinks it is unconstitutional.  That is a very unreasonable attitude for the Minister to adopt in relation to the protection of a female worker who makes a claim.  She may be afraid to make a claim because she may lose her job.  This situation is created by the Bill and we must get an assurance that it will be remedied to our satisfaction.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not see where the question of the right of association comes into this at all.  People have that constitutional right.  This is purely a question of the reinstatement of a person in her <Col N="1809" /> former position.  Perhaps there could be provision in the Bill that, after the passing of the Bill, employers would have to have a written agreement that where successful claims were made there would be a right to retention of employment.  We cannot pass legislation in this House which discriminates against the people we are endeavouring to help.</P>
    <P>In the Congress submission to the Commission on the Status of Women they indicated that the EEC Commission found that the problem was not that member states lacked legislation on the subject of equal pay but that it had not been fully enforced. That may well be what will happen here.  We want to see fully enforced legislation which will protect the rights of the people who should be protected.</P>
    <P>In some EEC countries they had the same type of section giving a commencement date which they were not able to implement because of the defects in some of the legislation that went through.  It is desirable, now that we have time, that we should perfect this and produce a useful piece of legislation that will protect people rather than discriminate against them. This section is open to abuse.  There should be some formula used, either that or an insertion that each employer should have a written agreement prior to the coming into operation of this Bill so that the right of reinstatement in cases such as this would be guaranteed to the individual. The fact that the Minister can give us no indication is a serious defect because it leaves the way open for people who want to avail of the vagueness of this Bill to siphon off, at small cost to themselves, workers who they fear might cause them some problems such as trade union officials or shop stewards.</P>
    <P>This is a serious defect.  Some absolute assurance must be given and we must have in this Bill provisions to ensure that there will be no discrimination. This is a section of discrimination and it is a contradiction in terms to call this the Anti-Discrimination (Pay) Bill when it contains a section which does not afford to a worker who makes <Col N="1810" /> a claim the protection to which she is entitled.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMoore" hpid="Mr. Moore Mr. Moore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moore</NameTxt>
      <P>Sixty years ago James Connolly chided the Irish women for the fact that up to then the attitude of Irish women was one of submissiveness to the conditions in which they lived.  It is sad to think that we would, after 60 years, consider adopting legislation here which discriminates against a person who would have the courage or the audacity to claim equal pay for equal work.  This is the whole basis of the Bill but the Bill has this Achilles heel whereby a shop steward might well suffer dismissal from a firm because she claimed as her right under this Bill equal pay for equal work. Having won her case, she would then be dismissed.  The Minister&mdash;I am sure he is acting on the best advice he could have&mdash;suggests that the Bill could be unconstitutional if we were to insist that she be reinstated.  When one considers the many changes in the Constitution effected by the Supreme Court in recent years one wonders whether what is constitutional and what is unconstitutional depends entirely on the learned members of the Supreme Court and how they interpret the law.  We should include Deputy Dowling's amendment in the Bill and let the savants, if they want to, contest the Bill in the Supreme Court.  The employers would be in a much better position to do this than would a working woman.  Why should she have to go to the Supreme Court to have this matter tested?  Let the employers, through their wealthy associations, contest the Bill after we have passed it here.  If some combination of employers feel that it is unconstitutional, they can go to the Supreme Court but it is only fair that they should have to bear the costs.  Alternatively, if we want full equity, I suggest that if any person contests this Bill with Deputy Dowling's amendment included in it in the Supreme Court the State should bear the costs.  In that way we would be fair to everybody.  My personal view is that if we pass the Bill with Deputy Dowling's amendment in it and if an employer feels it is unconstitutional, he has a remedy and if the Supreme Court rules that it is repugnant <Col N="1811" /> to the Constitution then we must accept that, they being the final arbiters in our scheme of things.</P>
      <P>The Minister cannot go wrong by including Deputy Dowling's amendment. An employer has got a redress but what hope has a woman working in a factory and being paid £15, £20 or £25 a week, who claims that she should be paid the same as the male doing the same work, of going to the Supreme Court with the very high cost that would entail?  Why impose this on her when there is a very simple way out of it?  If the Minister does not do this, I am afraid this Anti-Discrimination (Pay) Bill will be very discriminatory and there will be very little respect for it among the people who work in the factories, offices and shops.  The Minister has two choices.  He can accept Deputy Dowling's amendment or he can withdraw the Bill and bring in a comprehensive piece of legislation which will do all the things the Minister has said he hopes for and will include this vital guarantee for the woman who has the audacity, temerity or courage to claim her rights under this Bill.  We must ensure that in our democracy she will not be discriminated against.  If the Minister does not do this, the Bill will not be a true reflection of the thoughts which we thought were behind it.</P>

      <P>I am satisfied that this legislation is certainly an improvement on the present situation against the possibilities of dismissal. The penalties and fines involved make it a very expensive matter for a recalcitrant employer and that combined with the strong trade union presence in the country.  I am satisfied that by the end of this year the legislation that will be on the statute books will give almost total defence to any employee in any part of Irish industry against unfair dismissal.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JosephDowling" hpid="Mr. Dowling Mr. Dowling">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dowling</NameTxt>
      <P>Surely the Minister could include an unfair dismissal clause in the Bill?  The systematic downgrading of women is one of the weapons that employers have used in other countries and can use here with <Col N="1812" /> the protection of this section.  It is undesirable to have a section under which there can be a systematic downgrading of women without fear that the Bill offers any resistance to unscrupulous employers.  We know from our experience of legislation that has been enacted elsewhere that there has been this systematic downgrading of women.  I am not sure that other legislation was as vague as this but I am positive that if this Bill had been introduced by us the Minister would have sought to have the protection of the worker enshrined in the Bill, and rightly so.  This is an employer's section.  There is little protection here for the worker.  The problem of loss of employment is of major importance.</P>
      <P>The Minister should tell us how he will deal with the systematic downgrading of women.  If it is not possible to insert in the Bill the necessary safeguards he should indicate that he will enshrine them in further legislation. This Bill must be comprehensive and complete.  It should give the benefits we all hope females will enjoy after this Bill has been passed. If we leave the door open, as in this case, we will have some employers who will downgrade their staff; we will have the worker who is afraid, because of the loss of his job, to make the claim and we will have protection for the employer who wants to dispense with the services of a person in a very unscrupulous way.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister must be able to embody, somewhere in this Bill, the safeguards he hopes to embody in another Bill.  There is no guarantee, when we pass this Bill, that the Government will ever bring in further legislation with the safeguards the Minister spoke about.  It may well happen that other pressing matters will come before the House so it could be quite a long time before we get down to the type of legislation which the Minister envisages.  No one knows what is likely to happen from day to day or from month to month. We all know the many good ideas and intentions which Government Ministers have had in relation to legislation <Col N="1813" /> for the benefit of workers that were nullified in some way by the time factor.</P>
    <P>Would the Minister consider inserting a section on Report Stage that will give the type of cover I mention?  He need not bring it in in my terms but in some terms that would be acceptable to this party.  Could the Minister insert some type of protection so that workers will not be left in the unsatisfactory situation they will find themselves in if the Bill is completed in its present form?  If the Minister gives this indication now we could deal with the remaining sections of the Bill fairly rapidly.  We have no intention of holding up legislation which will benefit workers and I am quite certain the Minister wants to have such legislation enacted.  However, we cannot agree to this aspect of the Bill which is discriminatory.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMoore" hpid="Mr. Moore Mr. Moore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moore</NameTxt>
      <P>From time to time we hear pleas from the trade unions and the employers, in particular, that they want to attract women back into industry. They also tell us that because women have left employment to get married their work force is rather limited.  Employers hold out certain inducements to bring women back to work in factories and offices.  The women complain that income tax rates are too high and they prefer not to work.  We have a case here where women would think twice before going back to work in an office or factory.  They might feel if they sought equal pay with men in that factory or shop they would end up being dismissed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have certain reservations about attracting women back into industry. We have a very high rate of male unemployment.  At the same time I hold that women must have equal rights with men in the matter of wages and salaries.  I regard this as their basic right and I cannot but think that (a) this part of the Bill was hastily drafted or (b) that the whole Bill was hurried, as has been suggested in other places.  Therefore, one could hardly expect Deputy Dowling or I to accept it without putting up as stern a fight as we can on <Col N="1814" /> behalf of the women whom we feel will be discriminated against.  We will not stand for cut-price labour backed by State legislation.  The Minister should accept Deputy Dowling's amendment or rule that a woman's position will not be worsened by the fact that she sought equal pay with a man who is doing the same type of work.</P>
    <P>This should be a basic civil right. What is the Bill all about if it falls down on this very important point? We hear platitudes about equal rights but when it comes down to legislation it appears that we are powerless to ensure that the very basic right we are claiming for women can be guaranteed by the State.  We have studied this Bill very carefully. Deputy Dowling went to the trouble of tabling important amendments on this point.  I believe the Minister actually agrees with our point.  He may say that to insist that the women be reinstated would be unconstitutional.</P>
    <P>We have suggested to the Minister that he include this provision in the Bill and let those who seek to make it unconstitutional bring it before the Supreme Court.  If they rule that it is unconstitutional we will accept it.  At least we could say we went the whole way in trying to vindicate the rights of women.  It would be very wrong of us to accept this meekly because the Minister says that somebody has said that it is unconstitutional. We have our duty in opposition to scrutinise all legislation that comes before the House.  We scrutinised this legislation in our committee rooms and we are satisfied we have to press for the inclusion of some guarantee for womens rights in this instance.  I know that there are not many unscrupulous employers but the fact that they are there means that we should guard women against them.  We would be hypocritical if we urged women to go for their full rights in industry and then told them, we passed legislation which might cost them their jobs if they pursued the matter.  We have been discussing this matter for over an hour and we should decide to put in <Col N="1815" /> a small guarantee of a woman's right to claim equal pay.</P>

      <P>Will the Minister give us an assurance that between now and Report Stage he will formulate some form of cover to ensure continuity of employment to a person who makes a claim under the Bill?  Our claim is very reasonable.  We have all seen how this matter can be abused. The Bill is a failure if we agree to it and we find that it discriminates against the very people we are trying to help.  Apart from the systematic downgrading of women there could be other factors that would arise which might entice the employer to evade his responsibilities.  Does the Minister intend, as suggested in the commission's report, to repeal section 16 of the Conditions of Employment Act, 1936 which prohibits the employment of female workers in certain forms of industrial work?  As there have been no orders enforced under this section of the Act, they feel it should be repealed at the earliest opportunity.  Perhaps under this section an employer would seek to discriminate and all we want to do is ensure that there is a reasonable safeguard for the person making the claim.  Would the Minister give an undertaking that between now and Report Stage he will endeavour to get some formula that will give the necessary and desirable protection?  We can assure him that we will not impede any progressive legislation or legislation that we believe is a help to the workers and we will give him every support to ensure that such legislation is implemented at the earliest possible moment.  Nevertheless, we do not want to be a party to legislation that would in any way discriminate against workers as this subsection does.  If the Minister gives us that assurance, I think we can move on.  This is a reasonable request because every reasonable person will agree that with this defect the Bill is useless at present.</P>

      <P>The Commission of Inquiry on the Status of Women came to the conclusion that women would not be displaced from employment because of any legislative provisions regarding equal pay.  They examined the whole area exhaustively in the Irish context and that was their final opinion.  I would also draw the Deputy's attention to section 6 (2). Under it, where it is not reasonable to expect the employee concerned to refer a dispute in relation to such a post to an equal pay officer, the matter may be referred to an equal pay officer by me.  In other words, where the employee has reason to think that retribution might follow if he or she looked for what is his or hers under the law, the machinery is there whereby in such a case the law may be invoked without any ill effects for the employee.  I assure the Deputy that I think the women of Ireland in Irish industry will be safeguarded comprehensively in regard to equal pay when this Bill becomes law.</P>
      <P>I also assure him that the comprehensive legislation dealing with unfair dismissal, which I hope will be before the House shortly, should further improve the situation.  It would be dishonest if I undertook that the Constitutional difficulties to which I have already referred would disappear between now and Report Stage.  Deputies must have regard to the Constitution; and where our advice from the best authority is that any provision in any legislation could be held to infringe constitutional provisions we must pay due regard to that advice.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dowling</NameTxt>
      <P>Surely the Minister does not mean to imply that in some section or sections of the Constitution there is discrimination against workers. I thought the reverse was the case. If the Minister is now advised that it can discriminate against workers as he has indicated, I think the matter must be left open to further examination. I do not think the Constitution is so unfair or unjust that it would discriminate in this way against workers, that if the question of the retention of employment is embodied in a written agreement it is an unconstitutional clause in the agreement. <Col N="1817" /> Most, if not all, written agreements with which I have been concerned from time to time contained this clause concerning retention of employment where a claim was being pursued.  I think every union would insist on this desirable protection. Personally I cannot see that our Constitution is so unjust that it would tend to discriminate against Irish workers, but if that is so the Constitution should certainly be amended to ensure that this discrimination is eliminated. I do not believe it is there. This would be a good matter for a referendum.  I am positive that nobody would vote against the protection of the workers if such a discriminatory clause exists.  As a layman, I cannot see it.  Somewhere in the Bill there must be a safeguard.  I do not think it is provided in section 6 to which the Minister referred.  It is true that the Minister has power to refer to the equal pay officer, but the Bill must contain a built-in guarantee that the person who makes a claim and is successful in it will retain his or her employment.  I see no constitutional problem there; it is only common sense that the person would retain the employment if successful.</P>
      <P>It is news to me that we have a Constitution under which there can be discrimination.  Now that this is widely known among employers the Minister must take immediate measures to have the Constitution amended so as to ensure that the discrimination which he is advised exists is eliminated as early as possible.  Otherwise employers will avail of this section or sections of the Constitution to relieve themselves of responsibilities they probably felt they had up to now. This is the most serious aspect of the debate so far: that discrimination is built into the Constitution against workers.  I believe that is not the case and the Minister should look for additional advice on the matter and come back to the House on the Report Stage with some formula to safeguard the rights of workers adequately.  This is just and what is just must carry.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the interim report on equal pay in August, 1971, it was indicated that the estimated displacement of women workers in the manufacturing industries <Col N="1818" /> in response to the full impact would be about 10 per cent if it was phased out in over a five-year period, 2 per cent each year.  The phasing-in period is slightly different here and we can expect that if the 10 per cent figure mentioned is valid there will be a serious situation for the women.  I have no doubt there will be problems in the initial stages of the Implementation of the Bill and for this reason we should not create any further problems.  It must be possible for the Minister to find a suitable formula to deal with this problem.  If he undertakes to have another look at this section between now and Report Stage we will not hold the Bill up any further.  There is no doubt that this is an undesirable situation.</P>

I pointed out on Second Stage that there was a danger of this Bill becoming a discriminatory Bill rather than an anti-discrimination Bill because a lot of female workers were employed simply because they were cheap labour.  If there is in a Bill which is supposed to give women their rights something which prevents them from getting them then this House should accept Deputy Dowling's amendment.</P>
      <P>If a female appeals under this law and wins the appeal no law should prevent her from going back to her employment because she only sought what she was entitled to.  If there is such a provision in the Constitution it is not just.  If it is there the Bill has no meaning because there will be employers who will get up on their high horse because a person looked for what she was entitled to under the Bill. Such employers, if the employee is successful, might use the big stick, if employers can use the big stick in such a fashion then we should accept Deputy Dowling's amendment.</P>

      <P>There is no problem at all about a woman looking for her rights under this legislation.  This legislation protects her if she looks for her rights and includes penalties if the <Col N="1819" /> employer refuses to grant her her rights.  Deputy Dowling sought in his amendment a right of reinstatement and I referred to certain problems about reinstatement after wrongful dismissal. The constitutional clauses on which legal opinion rests state that we may not force a particular employer to take on a particular person in a work contract.  That relates to that particular constitutional provision relating to freedom of association.  Legal opinion inclines to the belief that this freedom of association includes freedom in the sense that the State cannot force an employer to employ a particular person. That is the kernel of the constitutional provisions involved.</P>
      <P>The chief aim of the Bill is to make it a very expensive business, by including heavy fines, for any employer who breaks sections of this legislation.  It makes it difficult for an employer and it heavily penalises the employer who does not carry out the provisions of this legislation.  That is the chief hope of this legislation.  We will have officers to carry out this work.  We will have provisions in this legislation whereby if an employee feels nervous about prosecuting a claim on her own I may do so on her behalf.  I can assure the House that this gives a very big advance legislatively to women in Irish employment.</P>
      <P>There is a difficulty of interpretation relating to the reinstatement and that difficulty relates to the freedom of association guaranteed under the Constitution.  I undertake to examine this area to see what other possible action is open to me in legislation dealing specifically with unfair dismissals, legislation which I will have before the House shortly.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the comparable British legislation on equal pay there is no section whatever on the whole area of dismissal.  Looking at the provisions of this legislation I am satisfied that Deputies can be at ease that there is a solid gain here for women in Irish employment.  The idea that there will be some extraordinary victimisation of women consequent on the passing of this legislation is not <Col N="1820" /> shared by the Commission on the Status of Women who went exhaustively into this over many years.  I do not see that there is a basis for fear that this will happen when I consider the general situation in the country, the strength of our trade unions and the provisions in this legislation. There will be a great disincentive to any employer to break the provisions of this legislation.</P>

      <P>Then I am afraid women will call the Minister the chief male chauvinist if he starts a case on behalf of a woman who finishes up being dismissed.  The story was told about our Constitution that it drove our women back into the kitchen, something which it did not do, but while it did give women the dignity of employment we cannot ensure, 40 years later, that a woman will not be dismissed.  I accept that the people can only change the Constitution but the Minister can alter this Bill to ensure that women get their proper rights.  It would be less expensive to give the women their rights under this Bill than to hold a referendum on a change in the Constitution. I suggest the Minister do this by accepting Deputy Dowling's amendment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JosephDowling" hpid="Mr. Dowling Mr. Dowling">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dowling</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister has indicated that under the Constitution we have no right to force an employer to take a person into his employment. This is not a question of taking a person on; it is a question of the retention of a person in specific employment rather than reinstatement.  If the term was &ldquo;retention&rdquo; would the Minister accept that was constitutionally in order?  There is no question of forcing an employer to take on somebody against his will.  What I am concerned about is a person who may have been in employment for 20 or <Col N="1821" /> 30 years.  In my view there is a basis for retaining such a person in employment if that person brings a claim under this legislation.</P>
      <P>It is absolutely necessary that a person should be able to take this action and retain her former position. I can see no justification at all for anything to the contrary.  According to the last census 287,900 women were gainfully employed here, and in Dublin the figure was 110,600.  This is a substantial figure.  The introduction of this Bill will create problems but we must have the necessary safeguards built in.  When this Bill passes through the Oireachtas many women will be seeking parity of pay with males.</P>
      <P>If the amendment is not suitable perhaps the Minister could suggest a more appropriate type of wording which would be acceptable to all of us to ensure that this right will be given.  If there is some difficulty about the Constitution&mdash;I certainly did not know of this before, but Deputy Moore referred to it&mdash;then the particular Article should be erased at the earliest possible moment.  The Minister apparently agrees it is not desirable in legislation to leave this kind of outlet for an employer to discriminate against a worker.  If this amendment is not made the Title of the Bill will be a contradiction in terms.  I am sure the Minister has at his disposal people who will be able to advise him on this so as to enable him to amend the Bill in such manner as to give or guarantee the desired cover to employees who might be affected.  That is the very least that should be done to ensure there will be no discrimination.</P>

      <P>The function of the Bill is to attempt to prevent or discourage dismissals by making it an offence to dismiss a woman who sought equal pay by providing penalties in respect of such an offence and providing compensation to any woman so dismissed.  This approach is in line with the proposed European Economic Community Directive on the application of equal pay which provides, in Article 5, that member states shall take the necessary measures to prevent any dismissals.  The matter which worries <Col N="1822" /> Deputy Dowling and other Opposition Deputies relates to the question of the freedom to associate.  I suppose an argument can be put.  It is plain that under our Constitution it could be argued that freedom to associate includes the employment contract and, that being so, it could equally be argued that an employer would make the argument under the Constitution that, if he were forced to employ a certain worker, then equally that worker could be forced to work for a particular employer.  This would be taking the argument in the other direction.  Many of us would not care for this to be written into legislation and neither would anybody reasonably ask for such a provision to be written into our legislation.  I mention this merely to underline certain difficulties in connection with framing legislation where you have a written Constitution. This is our predicament.  The Constitution lays open the possibility that freedom of association be interpreted in this way.  This renders it impossible to have the amendment the Deputies opposite wish to have included in this legislation.</P>

      <P>I do not see where freedom of association comes into this at all.  Nobody need work for any particular employer if she does not want to.  I do not think there is anything in the Constitution to the effect that a worker is under any compulsion to work for any particular employer. We are discussing the case of a female worker who makes a claim for equal pay, wins her case and her employer refuses to take her back.  There is nothing wrong with her work.  We maintain that such an employee should be reinstated in her employment. I do not see where freedom of association comes in.</P>

      <P>The situation is not on all-fours.  I think we are on the right course.  The employer will be heavily penalised.  The employee will be fully vindicated.  In 99 per cent of cases an employee would not wish to return to her employment, I believe, in such conditions.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JosephDowling" hpid="Mr. Dowling Mr. Dowling">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dowling</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister argues on the premise that there is a highly organised labour force from a trade union point of view.  Of the 288,000 females in employment I believe the majority of them are not organised. Some of them would be employed in remote parts of the country and they would actually be disadvantaged by the Minister relying on the trade union or some other organisation to ensure reinstatement in the circumstances we have been discussing. Incidentally, if the worker insisted on reinstatement would she be acting unconstitutionally?  That would appear to be the case from what the Minister has told us.  That would be a very serious matter.  Admittedly highly organised workers can force an employer to do almost anything.  I believe, as I say, that the majority of female workers are not highly organised.  Indeed, that runs right through the report of the commission. This is a factor&mdash;that they are not organised to the same degree as male labour.  Heretofore they could be subject to pressure from the male labour force but now they will be subject to pressure from the employers as well.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister said the Bill is designed to prevent dismissals but we are concerned about areas where dismissals will have taken place, where there is a new situation altogether. It is not a question of forcing an employer to accept a particular worker; this is where the worker has been in employment for a number of years.  Then there is the situation where it is not a question of forcing an employer to take on somebody against his will.  This section gives a right to an employer to dismiss who <Col N="1824" /> he likes and he can meet his obligations under the Bill by conceding retrospection.  Six months' remuneration is a small amount to an employer and if the employee goes to the equal pay officer and ultimately to the court, is it still not difficult for the employer to meet his obligations. Indeed his minimum requirement may be two months' or one month's remuneration.  The court would give a quick decision and the employer, at very small cost, can dismiss who he likes and has the protection of this Bill to do so.</P>
    <P>This reminds me of the Banks Bill whereby the banker was immune from imprisonment while the ordinary worker, the porter or the charwoman, could be imprisoned for impeding the appropriate officer.  Here we are giving absolute freedom to the employer, and nobody on this side accepts that he should have that freedom. What we are seeking is an assurance from the Minister that he would embody in the Bill on Report Stage the protection we are anxious to see.  I am sure the Minister feels there is a weakness here that should be corrected.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesCTunney" hpid="Mr. Tunney Mr. Tunney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tunney</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to put one question to the Minister.  The section aims to give protection to any lady who might feel disposed to exercise her rights under this legislation and my question to the Minister is whether the protection is not completely illusory.  Surely he accepts that in the case of a lady who would pursue her rights to the point that she was dismissed, before doing so she would naturally consider the consequences to herself in the matter of seeking subsequent employment elsewhere. This is not in my area but I am wondering does this excuse the employer from redundancy commitments.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Without drawing considerations like that into it, if we are contending in this legislation the giving of new rights to ladies, we must accept that what is in the Bill in this regard is only a sham.  What it is presumed in this Bill would occur, would not occur very often, but any lady who <Col N="1825" /> would pursue her rights to the point of dismissal by one employer would have a very poor recommendation going with her to a new potential employer.  Because of that she would be more than reluctant to pursue her rights of protection under this section.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOLeary" hpid="Mr. M. O'Leary Mr. M. O'Leary">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>I would emphasise once more what I have said in relation to the person who found herself dismissed unfairly and out of work&mdash;this minority of cases.  The presumed reluctance of such a person would hold much more strongly where there was no organised work force.  In a single small employment the employee would have even less reason to return to work to the same type of employer.  The penalties here are heavy&mdash;up to two years' remuneration and fines of up to £1,000. They are very heavy penalties for an employer who wishes to break the provisions of this legislation.</P>
      <P>I have promised that this whole matter will be dealt with in a comprehensive piece of legislation dealing with wrongful dismissals.  I will certainly give very great attention to a re-examination of this whole constitutional area.  The problem will still be with us but I can certainly undertake to the House that we will control, in as comprehensive a statute form as possible, this employment contract between employee and employer.</P>
      <P>Of course, the point is made that, in collective bargaining arrangements, it sometimes happens that the trade union concerned looks for reinstatement of the employee but, as Deputy Dowling well knows, the whole area of collective bargaining is not quite the same thing as statute law being passed by this House.  We are all aware of where this has happened in real life situations.  In setting down legislation in this House we must ensure, by our best endeavours, that no provision we bring before the House could be questioned afterwards on constitutional grounds.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Finally, I would point out that it is significant that the Commission on the Status of Women did not recommend powers of reinstatement.  I would also point out that similar British legislation has no such provision nor do any <Col N="1826" /> of the EEC directives.  Our main reliance is placed on heavy penalties attached to the employer who breaks the law.  That puts the position as succinctly as I can.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Tunney</NameTxt>
      <P>Perhaps it is not correct for me to press the Minister on this but maybe I should indicate my attitude.  I remember, when I was operating as a schoolteacher, I always told students that the foolish question was the one they never asked.  Perhaps the Minister could state what would be the position of a worker <i>vis-á-vis</i> his protection under the Redundancy Act if an employer dismissed him in the fashion provided for in section 9.  Would it be a way open to an employer of circumventing his obligations, under the Redundancy Act, of depriving an employee of his or her rights under the same Act?</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelOLeary" hpid="Mr. M. O'Leary Mr. M. O'Leary">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>The job loss envisaged under it does not arise here but, in answer to the Deputy, the job loss envisaged under the redundancy legislation would be job loss in the normal, say, rationalisation system; it would not arise by this will of the employer in relation to breaking the law.  Therefore, I do not see how the situation would arise at all.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JosephDowling" hpid="Mr. Dowling Mr. Dowling">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dowling</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister imply that an employer could dismiss all the females in his employment and just meet the compensation aspect? Apparently this is a right the employer now has.  He can contest it in court and concede them the pay to which they are entitled.  If he had a large labour force, he could clear out his entire establishment and recruit new personnel at a much lower rate.  I think it very important that the employer should not have this protection.  An employer could dismiss all his personnel, especially if they had reasonable wages, and claim under this Act that it was constitutionally correct.  He could give them up to six months' remuneration which the court had deemed necessary and he would then be constitutionally protected from re-instatement and could employ new labour at a much lower rate.  Would this not leave a loophole whereby an <Col N="1827" /> employer could avail of this section of the Act to obtain cheap labour at the cost of many people pursuing their just rights?  I think this is a very important aspect, he could dismiss all his female labour force, particularly if it was a large one.</P>
      <P>The Minister indicated that the Commission on the Status of Women, in their report, did not indicate reinstatement. I believe the commission would have assumed the necessary safeguards for reinstatement would be incorporated. The Minister speaks about EEC legislation and says that nowhere in that legislation is there mention of the question of reinstatement.  If there is nothing incorporated in EEC legislation to cover reinstatement, then I think that that is bad legislation also and needs to be amended to ensure that there is adequate protection for the worker.</P>
      <P>It is a bad comparison to make, to say that we are in line with them, if there is this defect in both the report of the commission&mdash;which is not accepted in full by the Minister: there are certain aspects of it he did not accept, the commencement date being just one&mdash;and in EEC legislation. I do not think for a moment that the Commission would have envisaged that legislation would have been enacted which would deprive women of their employment.  Had they envisaged such a situation, I feel they would have recommended necessary protection in that respect also.  In relation to EEC legislation, I feel it must be built in somewhere because I believe that workers' representatives throughout Europe would have put this point to protect females in claiming their rights.  For that reason it is not good enough for the Minister to say: &ldquo;I will look at it in further legislation.&rdquo; The rights of workers must be fully and adequately protected in this legislation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>All we are seeking is an assurance between now and Report Stage.  We do not want to impede the enactment of this Bill in any way or its passage through the House.  But if we do not get that undertaking from the Minister, we could not attempt to discuss the Report Stage until we would have <Col N="1828" /> had an opportunity of examining the constitutional aspects the Minister now raises and this might take some time.  Therefore the Minister should take this into consideration.  If he does not feel it is very important to get it through straight away, then we would have an opportunity of having it examined by some constitutional lawyers who would be able to give us information on the two sections of the Constitution which he claims are discriminatory against workers.</P>
    <P>At first glance I feel they are of no concern.  It is a question of retention of employment and not a question of forcing an employer to accept someone he dislikes.  If the argument the Minister puts forward is that we cannot force an employer to accept somebody he does not wish to employ, then it is admitting that the employer can dismiss people he does not like and have the necessary constitutional backing for not re-employing them.  I do not think that was ever intended by the Constitution.  I could not interpret it that way.  The Minister now has the option of indicating that he will seek a formula for giving this protection between now and Report Stage, or give us an opportunity of having this particular aspect fully examined by constitutional lawyers from whom we will seek advice.  This may take some time and, as I have already said, we do not want to impede the passage of this Bill in any way.</P>
    <P>The Minister has two choices open to him and, whichever is the lesser of the two evils, will suit us.</P>

      <P>This is equal pay legislation.  I am satisfied that all the material is in this legislation to ensure that women in employment will get equal pay for work of equal value. I am convinced also that the penalties to be invoked against employers who do not carry out the provisions will be heavy enough to ensure there is no abuse.  There is later legislation, which I have undertaken to introduce, on unfair dismissals in which I hope to put, in statutory form, the employee's right to his job in his place of employment, but that is not appropriate at this point.</P>

      <P>The Minister has not really met us at all on the question of the worker here.  If that is the ultimate here, that we must press it to a vote or withdraw the amendment, I do not want to embarrass any person in this House by having to vote for bad legislation, or having to vote for a penal clause in a Bill going through this House.  I do not want to force the Minister.  This is a penal section.  It deprives the female who has won her case in court of the right to reemployment. If the Minister cannot see his way to giving us an undertaking that he will try to find some solution, we will look for an opportunity of examining the constitutional position in depth so that on Report Stage we will be able to put down the amendments which we will be advised are constitutional.  It is our duty to protect the people who are entitled to concessions under this Bill.  It would be unjust of us to allow a Bill to go through the House which would contain such a section.</P>
      <P>I know that the Minister is anxious to have the Report Stage of the Bill at an early date but it would not be possible to deal with it until we have had an examination made of the constitutional position of the worker.  The Constitution is not so unjust that it would tend to deprive Irish workers of their right to reinstatement.  The trade union movement would not be happy with a section in the Bill which would so deprive workers.  We must have an opportunity of examining the Bill in detail.  We must protect the position of the workers.</P>

      <P>I have given an undertaking that in the legislation concerning unfair dismissal which should have its First Reading in this <Col N="1830" /> House within some weeks the matter of the constitutionality of reinstatement will be considered.  It will be foremost in such legislation.  There will be ample time for the Deputies to consider that legislation and to consider reinstatement in the context of that legislation.  The current piece of legislation deals with equal pay. Reinstatement and dismissal are not dealt with in the comparable British legislation or in the requisite EEC legislation.  I do not think that the Deputies' comments in relation to reinstatement are quite valid in the context of this legislation.</P>

      <P>I do not think we should be guided by defective legislation in Britain or the EEC.  Our legislation must endeavour to ensure that problems such as we envisage do not arise.  If Britain or the EEC are prepared to accept a situation in which an employer has the right to dismiss and not to reinstate a person after her claim has been justified, we should move away from British or EEC legislation.  It is the Minister's duty to ensure that there is the necessary cover here.  If the Minister has this other legislation prepared, could he not find a section in it which is appropriate and introduce it into this Bill here now?  There is no guarantee that the Minister will get that other legislation through the House anyway.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMoore" hpid="Mr. Moore Mr. Moore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moore</NameTxt>
      <P>My objection is that we should have a situation here in which the State initiates legislation to encourage people to seek equal pay and having done so we cannot then guarantee them that they will not be dismissed and made pay a penalty for seeking equal pay.  Having encouraged them to take this action, we cannot guarantee that they will not be dismissed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This is a foolish situation.  The Minister says that in Britain they have not got this claim for reinstatement. In Britain employers can be forced to take a number of handicapped people.  The British comparison is not a good one.  I have never yet accepted the fact that the British <Col N="1831" /> legislation is the be all and the end all of progressive legislation, or that the EEC legislation is perfect either. The EEC is still in a formative state. In a free society an employer has the right to hire and fire employees.  In a totalitarian state the State takes on this function.</P>
    <P>We must ensure that a person who has worked in a firm for years has accumulated rights in that firm.  If such a person takes the opportunity of acting under legislation passed by us, we must ensure that he is not punished for that action.  This is one of the things which brings democracy into disrepute.  In the case of a person who claimed equal pay and won her case and was then dismissed by an employer, the unions might say: &ldquo;Under the legislation we cannot insist on you being reinstated&rdquo;.  The employee could have a word with the shop steward who would then blow the whistle and there would be an unofficial strike.  Then that worker would be reinstated.</P>
    <P>It is a mockery of democracy where State legislation cannot guarantee a woman reinstatement in her job but where the people by their unofficial strike can give her that guarantee. There is enough trouble in the industrial world at the moment without encouraging unofficial strikes in order to afford rights to people.  The fact that such strikes would be unofficial does not take away from the merits of a woman's case.  We will get no thanks from the trade unions who seek to ensure that the unofficial strike is outlawed as far as possible.</P>
    <P>In such a case I would be inclined to talk to the people working in the same job and to point out that I was being penalised, asking them what they are going to do about it.  If one person stands at a factory gate with a placard saying that a trade dispute is in progress, very few people will pass that picket.  In this Bill we would be forcing such a woman to claim her basic rights but the State cannot then protect her but if she appeals to her fellow-workers to take unofficial action they can protect her.</P>
    <P>Our legislation must be progressive. It must not encourage people to take <Col N="1832" /> unofficial action while seeking their rights.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesCTunney" hpid="Mr. Tunney Mr. Tunney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tunney</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to agree with the previous speakers and to express my concern for what is pretended to be here in section 9.  It appears to me that section 9 is a non-event.  The title of the Bill is the Anti-Discrimination (Pay) Bill.  It shows that discrimination existed and can be shown to have existed over the years but it was accepted at a given time as not being discrimination at all.  In the light of new approaches we are setting out in a piece of legislation to remove any form of discrimination whatever.  Section 9 in layman's language means that any unfortunate lady who would be so bold as to contest what might be regarded as her right under this legislation does so at the peril of losing her employment.  The legislation almost guarantees she will lose her employment and the only compensation she will get will be £100 from her employer. We are doing this with what might be described as malice aforethought. The discrimination, which already exists, is there without our blessing.</P>
      <P>Deputy Dowling has directed the Minister's attention to this injustice and he is required to listen sympathetically. Otherwise the section is a facade. We are pretending to do something on behalf of the ladies, but that is not the case.  Can it be shown under any legislation that, if a male employee pursues what may be regarded as his right, he will lose his employment?  I may be wrong, but I do not think such legislation exists nor is there anything in the Constitution which covers the point.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister asks us to accept that if there is an omission here&mdash;and I am sure he is as convinced as the Members on this side of the House are that there is&mdash;that it will be provided against in some future legislation There is an obligation on the Minister and us to ensure as far as possible that legislation is complete and precise. Certain precautions should be included in this legislation.  It is a poor excuse for the Minister to say that he will introduce separate legislation to do this.  Surely this is relevant and appropriate to the legislation now <Col N="1833" /> before the House.  It is necessary that the amendment proposed by Deputy Dowling be accepted.</P>
    <P>It is said that under the Constitution no employer may be forced to reinstate a certain worker.  If legal men put that interpretation on the Constitution, one cannot deny that right to them.  Every day over the past years we have been accepting situations where workers had the right to contest their positions against any employer. Having won their case they were entitled to remain in their employment. I do not see how it can be contended that anything different or contrary to that principle is envisaged in Deputy Dowling's amendment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JosephDowling" hpid="Mr. Dowling Mr. Dowling">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dowling</NameTxt>
      <P>Two very important points were raised by Deputy Moore and Deputy Tunney.  As Deputy Moore pointed out, this could be the cause of an unofficial strike.  It is generally accepted by the employers that people on unofficial strike automatically dismiss themselves.  If we had an unofficial strike the workers would automatically dismiss themselves. It would be unconstitutional for anyone to force the employer to take back the striking personnel.  This is a very important point.</P>
      <P>Deputy Moore pointed out that the unofficial strike was the only weapon available to the persons concerned. We are putting legislation through this House where the only solution will be an unofficial strike in order to be reinstated.  It would be unconstitutional for anyone to put pressure on an employer to re-employ all or any of the people on strike.  This matter should be looked at in great depth. The interpretation of the Minister and his advisers has given us food for thought.  This does not apply only to female employees.  This is an anti-discrimination pay Bill and applies to male and female workers.  Section 10 reads:</P>
      <P>...shall be construed as applying equally, in a case converse to that referred to in those sections, to a man in relation to his remuneration relative to that of a woman.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This means that men can be affected <Col N="1834" /> also.  Will the breadwinner be protected by this Act?  A breadwinner proceeding with an equal pay claim could find himself on the labour market without any redress and the employer would be backed by the Constitution.  I do not hold that the interpretation given by the Minister of the Constitution can be applied in this situation because this is a question of retention.  Men and women will be debarred from employment because the employer wishes to avail of section 9 of the Anti-Discrimination (Pay) Bill, 1974.  The Minister will have to go further on this in order to ensure that neither males nor females will be unjustly dismissed.  How will the Minister deal with unjust dismissals?</P>
    <P>If we bring in legislation which indicates that the only way to solve the problem is by strike action, then I think the legislation is very defective. The other point is that where, say, a whole concern would automatically dismiss themselves, this might be to the advantage of the employer.  If there was a large labour force available and if the employer wanted to have a general tidying up, he has a loophole here, and it would be unconstitutional for them to be taken back, having dismissed themselves. This applies not only to an equal pay claim but also right across the board to other aspects as well. Therefore, not only the women of the country but the men, the breadwinners, would be affected by this defective piece of legislation.</P>
    <P>We could have the same prolonged discussion on section 13 as we are having on section 9.  We want to ensure that when we get down to section 13 this defective provision, which leaves it open to an employer to dismiss a person unjustly, will have been modified.  There is no guarantee that the Minister will ever introduce another Bill.  It may well happen that pressures and future problems will be such that they will demand the entire time of this House. If this Bill were taken in conjunction with the other legislation and we could discuss both measures together, that would be a different situation. <Col N="1835" /> We must be satisfied that the type of legislation which is to follow this Bill will be adequate to deal with the problem.  There is no point in rushing into the House with piecemeal legislation.</P>
    <P>If we were to follow that practice, we could just bring in one or two sections of this Bill today and next week we could have the third, fourth and fifth sections.  What is needed is a comprehensive Bill that will include the required safeguard.  What we want the Minister to do, even at this late stage, is to embody in the Bill before it goes through this House finally some wording that will cover the question of unfair dismissal, which is different altogether from the right to associate or from the right of the employer not to employ.  This is the question of retention of employment and some safeguard should be written into the Bill.</P>

      <P>The Chair has been very patient and has had to listen to a great deal of repetition, and repetition is not in order.

      <P>I would like to say a few words, Sir, before you put the question.  In these days of multi-national companies and huge combines a case could arise where a woman, or a man for that matter, would claim equal pay.  Whether the claim was successful or not does not matter; the employee would then be dismissed and word could be sent around through that multi-national company or combine that that person is not to be employed again because she might set an example for other employees to follow that line.  If there was a provision in the Bill that she must be reinstated or that that should be pressed as far as possible, it would then show these huge combines and multi-national combines that they just cannot get away with that here.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We who have to attract so much capital and outside interests, while we welcome these people, must show them that we regard the dignity of the person as being foremost in our thoughts and that our legislation is based on this principle.  Deputy Dowling, Deputy Tunney and myself have been very chivalrous this evening in that we have been defending the rights of women all the time but when we come to section 10 we shall have to defend the rights of men.  Can you picture anything more pathetic than a situation in which a man, having claimed parity in salary with a woman, not only loses his case but, worse still, is then dismissed.  Is it not pushing it too far to ask us, in our free society, to claim parity with women and to suffer the ignominy of dismissal?  The Minister should withdraw the Bill, as Deputy Dowling requested, or to include on Report <Col N="1837" /> Stage some provision that will meet our wishes.  Otherwise we will land ourselves in a lot of trouble and we will be accused of passing legislation that is discriminatory.</P>
    <P>Not alone should our legislation be just, it should be seen to be just.  We are not trying to hold up the Bill.  It is a short Bill and it gives many safeguards to women; in fact, section 9 contains four subsections while section 10, which applies to men, has only one section.  We give the Minister credit for thinking this Bill was necessary.  However it should be an effective piece of legislation.  It is no use our saying all workers are equal but some are more equal than others. Neither a man nor a woman can claim immunity from the wrath of a boss who wants to sack them.  There is one way to deal with that kind of employer but it is not by legislation. In any dispute the trade unions would have to support the law&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>It provides that if an employer does not comply within two months with an order of the Labour Court awarding compensation to a woman dismissed because she sought equal pay, he shall be guilty of an offence.  Section 9(4) permits such an employer to appeal to the Circuit Court against the order of the Labour Court.  It is possible that the hearing of such an appeal could take longer than two months and, in the circumstances, if he had not obeyed the order of the Labour Court the employer concerned could, in theory, be deemed to have committed an offence even though the case was the subject of an appeal.

      <P>In page 6, after line 25, to insert the following new subsection:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(3) (a) Where on a conviction for an offence under this section the court is satisfied that a person (in this paragraph referred to as the plaintiff) would be entitled to recover in a civil action arrears of remuneration, the court may, if it thinks fit and the plaintiff present or represented consents, impose on the convicted person, in addition to any other punishment, a fine not exceeding the amount which in the opinion of the court the plaintiff would be entitled to recover against the convicted person in respect of such arrears of remuneration.</P>
      <P>(b)  The amount of a fine imposed under paragraph (a) shall be paid to the plaintiff.</P>
      <P>(c)  The payment by a convicted person of a fine imposed under subparagraph (a) shall be a good defence to any civil action brought by the plaintiff in respect of the arrears of remuneration referred to in that subparagraph.</P>
      <P>(d)  Without prejudice to any right of appeal by any other person, the plaintiff shall have a right of appeal limited to the amount of the fine, either (as the case may be) to the High Court or to the judge of the Circuit Court in whose circuit the district (or any part thereof) of the Justice of the District Court by whom the fine was imposed is situated, and the decision on such an appeal shall be final.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A similar provision already exists in section 8 (3) (a). Under section 9 (2) of the Bill an employer who does not comply within two months with an order of the Labour Court awarding compensation to a woman dismissed because she sought equal pay will be guilty of an offence.  To recover the compensation due to her, the woman involved would have had to take a civil action in the law courts.  The amendment prevents this situation arising by providing that in a prosecution of an <Col N="1840" /> offence under section 9 (2), the court concerned may award to the woman the arrears of remuneration she would have received had she taken a separate civil action in the courts.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JosephDowling" hpid="Mr. Dowling Mr. Dowling">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dowling</NameTxt>
      <P>When people are dismissed for legitimate reasons they accept their dismissal but the case could arise now that a person in this position could come back after six months and claim that dismissal was because of equal pay.  On the Second Reading I said that it would be desirable that a written document be agreed between the union and the employer regarding the basis of dismissal where there is likely to be claims for equal pay.  The Labour Court should not be saddled with the responsibility of long and tedious examination of cases if the dismissals were not because of equal pay.  If my suggestion were accepted, the work of the officers dealing with these matters and the burden on the court would be lessened.  They could make a realistic assessment of how dismissals took place.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If people can make a claim in retrospect after a period, the way is left open for people who were dismissed for one reason or another to claim that it was on the basis of equal pay.  Can the Minister provide in the Bill that, as from the passing of the Bill, when a dismissal takes place, there should be an agreed document between the unions and the employer stating the precise reason for which the dismissal took place?  This would ensure that there <Col N="1841" /> would be no time-lag in genuine cases and that genuine cases would be dealt with more rapidly than cases which were brought in the full knowledge that the claim would be lost.</P>
    <P>In the early stages of the operation of this Bill there will be confusion. There will be a considerable number of claims, possibly, over the first six to 18 months.  It is desirable that there should not be frivolous claims so that those who are entitled to the concessions in the Bill would be able to obtain them at the earliest possible moment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOLeary" hpid="Mr. M. O'Leary Mr. M. O'Leary">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>It would be quite easy in each case for the court to find out when the dismissal took place, and when the last payment was made to the employee.  On the wider question of the reasons for dismissal, and so on, that would be appropriate to the unfair dismissals legislation which will be coming before the House in a matter of weeks.</P>
      <P>Question put and agreed to.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JosephDowling" hpid="Mr. Dowling Mr. Dowling">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dowling</NameTxt>
      <P>The same thing applies to section 10 as applies to section 9 in relation to dismissals. Males can be victimised in the same way as females.  That is undesirable. We will have a look at the constitutional position to see if there is a way around it and we will put down our own amendments for Report Stage. There can be discrimination against males and females.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMoore" hpid="Mr. Moore Mr. Moore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moore</NameTxt>
      <P>There is no need for section 10.  If the Minister would amend &ldquo;Where a woman complains&rdquo; to &ldquo;Where a person complains&rdquo; in section 9 (1), he would obviate the necessity for having section 10 in the Bill.  I hope section 10 will never have to be used.  I know of very few cases where women earn more than men doing comparable work.  The Bill could do with a bit of tidying up and section 10 is hardly necessary.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not know whether the Minister <Col N="1842" /> visualises this section ever being used.  I cannot imagine any industry or employment to which it would apply.  Under this section a man could claim equal wages with a woman for equal work and, if he lost his claim, he could be dismissed.  This brings us back to the basic weakness in the Bill.  The State cannot guarantee a man's basic right to be re-employed. In a free society we accord to employers the right to hire and fire, subject to certain regulations.  In a totalitarian State the State would take that right to itself.  This is not a case of hiring.  A man may have worked for 30 years in one job.  He then claims equal pay and he is dismissed. The State has legislated to ensure that he will be dismissed.</P>
    <P>At present when the establishment is under great pressure and is often criticised, it is very necessary in a democracy to show the people that the State, in its wisdom, is legislating in the best possible way for its citizens. This Bill encourages a man to seek equality in the office, or shop, or factory, and because he decides to use the legislation passed by the Oireachtas he could be dismissed.  He is foolish enough to believe that the omnipotent State guarantees him certain protection but he could be dismissed from his job.  He may be too old to be employed somewhere else and the State says: &ldquo;Sorry.  We did our best.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>This is not good legislation.  The man could not be protected by his trade union who would have to support the law of the land.  The Minister said it would be unconstitutional to write into this Bill a section compelling an employer to re-employ that worker.  That man would speak to his colleagues in the factory and say he was being dismissed, whereupon somebody would blow the whistle and there would be an unofficial strike.  In this age, very often an unofficial strike is successful.  It would probably be successful in this case, too, but that is not the point.</P>
    <P>The point is that through bad legislation the State is encouraging a man to take certain action and, having taken that action, he can be penalised.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1843" /> The State can offer no protection and his trade union can offer no protection. He has to take illegal action to achieve his purpose which he set out to achieve legally under new legislation. A man of 55 or 60 years of age may have to take unofficial action to save his job.  This is one of the worst pieces of legislation ever introduced into this House.  I accept that the Minister's intention was good.  We should not have cut price labour anywhere. Under this Bill we are encouraging people to take certain action which may lead them into trouble and which may cost them their jobs. The State says it cannot do any more for them.  Therefore, the moral of the story is: &ldquo;Do not mind what the State says in its legislation unless you want to lose your job.&rdquo;</P>

      <P>I am sure the Minister has taken into consideration the concern in the commission's report in relation to the phasing-in period. Does he envisage any problems arising from the fact that this will take effect as from 31st December next year?  The commission felt that a phasing-in period of five years would be necessary. Does he envisage any problem in regard to the shortness of time?  Why did he chose this date?  Was is because of EEC legislation or was it because the British Act comes into operation at approximately the same time?</P>
      <P>In the various reports in relation to the implementation of equal pay we find that everywhere there are problems.  The British equal pay provisions come into operation on 29th December, 1975.  A period of rather less than five years was considered appropriate in Britain for the implementation of the principle of equal pay.  Ours is a little over a year. The commission found that the problems in the EEC were not that member States lacked legislation on the subject of equal pay but that it had not fully been enforced.  Will the Minister ensure that this legislation will be fully implemented by the 31st December?  According to the various reports the date is the one problem that caused concern.  Even where the date of commencement was specified a large gap still exists and many people have not got what they are entitled to.  It says in one of the reports&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>The Title Anti-Discrimination (Pay) Act, 1974 is certainly not appropriate because section 9 is a section of discrimination against the worker.  We consider this a reasonable amendment.  Most of the legislation that has gone before in this field has been termed conditions of employment and to ensure that there is no confusion and that it will be readily identifiable we feel the title of the first Bill the Minister introduced in the House would be the most appropriate.</P>

      <P>I move:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>The sole purpose of this short Bill is to extend for a further period the provisions of section 2 of the Prisons Act, 1972.  That section makes provision for the transfer of prisoners from the civil prisons to military custody and for related matters.</P>
      <P>We on this side of the House were reluctant to agree to the enactment of the 1972 Act but we were persuaded that there was no alternative in view of the terrible destruction that had been caused in Mountjoy Prison during the riot in May, 1972.  The prisons simply could not hold the prison population at that time and the only course open was to transfer some of them to military custody.  Those transferred were persons requiring a high degree of security or who promoted or actively engaged in seriously disruptive activities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The damage to Mountjoy prison caused in the riot of May, 1972, was made good, for the most part, well before the end of 1973.  The repair work restored the prison substantially to its pre-riot condition but there remains the extensive work of renovation and restructuring which is essential if Mountjoy is to become a reliably secure and well serviced prison with increased emphasis on rehabilitation.  This long-term work is already under way.  However a new factor has emerged in the overall situation which makes it necessary to continue the present arrangement. This is the emergence of well organised disruption within our prisons and the consequent need for <Col N="1849" /> the careful segregation or grouping of prisoners.  The problems involved in maintaining secure custody for the full range of our prison population have been compounded since 1972 by the increased number of subversives in our prisons.</P>
    <P>At present there are 32 prisoners in the Military Detention Barracks at the Curragh.  This represents a very small proportion of the total prison population&mdash;about 3 per cent&mdash;but I am satisfied that they cannot be accommodated securely in the ordinary prisons without grave risk of disruption.  I do not want to comment in detail on this since it is not my intention to discuss individual prisoners here.  I will confine myself to saying that only prisoners considered to represent a serious threat to the security or good order of a prison are transferred to military custody.</P>
    <P>I was of the opinion in 1972 that the Curragh Detention Barracks could be taken over by the prison administration and operated as a civilian prison. I am satisfied now that it could not. Apart from the basic objection to having a civilian controlled enclave in the heart of a military complex, there are not adequate staff resources in the prison service to run the Curragh Military Detention Barracks and at the same time meet current and prospective commitments in the civil prisons.</P>
    <P>I should say, of course, that I would much prefer to be in a position to have facilities to house these prisoners in civil custody but the simple fact is that, as of now, there is still no suitable high security unit to keep these prisoners. As long as the total prison population remains high there is no possibility of rearranging the use of existing prison accommodation in order to meet the need.  I have decided, in fact, that it is necessary to build a special unit to house prisoners of the type now in military custody.  This will be a high security unit capable of housing up to 30 high risk prisoners and will be located in the Portlaoise prison complex. Preliminary work has started but it will, however, take up to three years to complete this project and while it may be possible to dispense with military custody for civilians before then, <Col N="1850" /> I am afraid that it is essential to provide for the possibility of military custody for a further three years.</P>
    <P>I should like to pay a tribute to the Defence Forces for the way in which they have discharged the task of accommodating these prisoners. At the present time this is an additional burden on the Defence Forces and I regret that it should be necessary to prolong it.  However, I shall do all I can to relieve them of it at the earliest possible date.  I know that they are doing everything possible to provide as good a regime as possible for prisoners in military custody.  For example, in liaison with my Department, educational classes are being provided in the Curragh Military Detention barracks by two teachers made available by the County Kildare Vocational Educational Committee.  Recreation facilities to the maximum feasible extent have been provided.  All these facilities will be kept under review.</P>
    <P>I commend the Bill to the House, being fully satisfied that the security of our prison system makes it necessary.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DavidAndrews" hpid="Mr. Andrews Mr. Andrews">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Andrews</NameTxt>
      <P>There was some doubt during my absence on the Order of Business today about the time at which this Bill was received by me in my capacity as spokesman in Opposition for the Department of Justice.  The Taoiseach stated that he understood a copy was sent last week to Deputy Andrews and that the Minister for Justice was in touch with him about this.  The Taoiseach did not say, of course, what day last week I was contacted by the Minister's Department as distinct from the Minister. I received a copy of the Bill on Friday last with a complimentary slip from the Parliamentary Secretary to the Taoiseach.  I have the main heads of the Bill which I received on Friday which the Minister is now asking us to give a Second Stage reading to.  On Monday I was contacted by the Minister's office.  In fact, I did not have an opportunity to phone back to his office until about 4.40 p.m. that afternoon. The Minister was unavailable at that time, which is fair enough, as <Col N="1851" /> he cannot be in his office at all times. However, neither can I be waiting around on the good graces of the Minister.</P>
      <P>I had to go to the funeral of one of the victims so savagely murdered last Friday and it was not possible for me to contact the Minister yesterday. I said I would contact the Minister's very courteous secretary or assistant secretary this morning but again, I did not have an opportunity to do so. My point is that the first sight the front bench of the Fianna Fáil Party had of the actual Bill itself, the headings of the Bill, was this morning.  It was my intention then to clear the Bill with the front bench.  However, again due to my absence from the front bench meeting, it was not possible for them to do so.  The Fianna Fáil Party could not have decided, therefore, what attitude they would take to this Bill until this morning.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In addition to that, the Minister introduced the Bill at 4 o'clock this afternoon and three hours later he introduced the Second Stage.  All Deputies in the House are entitled to a copy of the Bill.  They are as much entitled to a copy of it as I am.  I know it is a matter of courtesy to the front bench spokesman on any topic that he should get a fairly lengthy period in which to study a Bill before it is actually introduced. Nevertheless, the Government had an opportunity to introduce this Bill quite a considerable time before now. The Minister in his short introductory speech said that one of the main reasons for his extending the time of the Bill from 31st May, 1974 to the 31st May, 1977 is that it is now necessary to build a special unit to house prisoners of the type now in military custody.  He stated that this will be a high security unit capable of housing up to 30 high risk prisoners and will be located in the Portlaoise prison complex.  Shades of 1972 indeed.  Shades of Tuesday and Wednesday the 23rd and 24th May, 1972 when the then Minister for Justice, Deputy O'Malley came into this House and sought the legislation, which is before us, and was met with <Col N="1852" /> a barrage of prevarication from the then Opposition.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Justice, however, now has to come along here, two years later, and in the nature of things has to eat humble pie.  What concerns us was properly articulated by our Leader today when he raised this matter on the Order of Business.  He said:</P>
    <P>I would like to protest.  It was known that the necessity for this Bill was there.  It was known that the existing legislation would run out in a day or two.  This Bill should have been introduced sooner so that adequate time would have been made available for discussion.</P>
    <P>While I had reasonable time, in view of the fact that this is a small Bill, if it had been a comprehensive Bill &mdash;undoubtedly it is an important and urgent Bill&mdash;I do not think Friday would have given me reasonable time, as Opposition spokesman on Justice. The Leader of our party, Deputy Lynch, was quite correct in pointing out the haste with which the Bill was introduced : it was introduced in haste. The Minister is now seeking an exten sion of three years from 31st May 1974 to 31st May, 1977, allowing himself nine days before the 1972 Act falls in.  This is a matter of grave concern to the House.  We believe it is another example of the Government's inability to introduce legislation in an ordinary way.  As spokesman on Justice, I should like to add my protest to that made on the Order of Business today by Deputy Lynch.</P>
    <P>The Minister has come here belatedly with this Bill and asked for the co-operation of the House.  In 1972 when the Minister for Justice, Deputy O'Malley, introduced the 1972 Prisons Act he was met by a considerable amount of doubt and we had what might be called the litany of the then liberals who are now in Government and find themselves supporting legislation which they could not find it in their hearts to support then.  It is my function and duty to point out what was said on that occasion by these people.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1853" /> We understand the necessity for the introduction of the 1974 Prisons Bill in Opposition as we understood the necessity for the 1972 measure when we were in Government and I assure the Minister and the Government that there will be no prevarication on this occasion.  We know where our duty lies and we have no hesitation in supporting the Government in urgent, responsible and reasonable legislation.</P>
    <P>In introducing the 1972 Act the Minister, Deputy O'Malley, expressed a reservation about a civil prison within a military establishment when at column 78 of the Official Report of 23rd May, 1972, he said:</P>
    <P>Moreover, there are serious objections to having a civil prison within a military establishment. Accordingly, it is necessary to make provisions for the transfer of prisoners to military custody.</P>
    <P>Nevertheless, he saw clearly where his duty lay and, having regard to the times that were in it, it was his function as Minister for Justice to introduce the 1972 Act.  At column 77 of the same debate he said:</P>
    <P>I regret that a situation has arisen which compels me to come to the House and ask it to pass this Bill, the main provision of which is to authorise prisoners to be transferred to military custody in certain exceptional circumstances.  This emergency&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <P>and this was the reason for the introduction of that Bill then</P>
    <P>&mdash;&mdash;situation has resulted from the destruction carried out in Mountjoy on the night of 18th-19th May.&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <P>that was in 1972</P>
    <P>&mdash;&mdash;The destruction was on such a scale that approximately 180 prisoners had to be transferred.  Not all of them could be accommodated in the other prisons at Portlaoise, Cork, Limerick or in St. Patrick's Institution and I had to arrange, in consultation with the Minister for Defence, to take over the military detention barracks in the Curragh <Col N="1854" /> for use as a prison to accommodate some 40 prisoners.  These have since been under the control of two senior prison officers, with the help and assistance of the military.</P>
    <P>He then goes on at some length to justify the introduction of the Bill at that time.  The present Minister for Justice, Deputy Cooney, who was then Opposition spokesman on Justice, is reported in the Official Report of 23rd May, 1972, at column 83, as saying:</P>
    <P>...He comes to the House with a Bill at a time and in a climate which must make one suspicious of some of the terms and the phrases used in this Bill...</P>
    <P>First, there is the haste with which it has been introduced.</P>
    <P>The Minister must now understand that on that occasion the Minister for Justice had to introduce the Bill as a matter of urgency and yet Deputy Cooney queried it on the grounds of haste.  We ask the present Minister for Justice who has now been in office considerably more than a year, why in that year he did not introduce this Bill now before us.  Why even in the last month did he not introduce it?  We are asked to accept an amendment extending the life of the 1972 Bill to 1977 effectively, nine days before the 1972 Bill goes out of existence.  That is the extraordinary situation in which the Dáil finds itself.  The Minister talked about haste in 1972.</P>
    <P>There are some other important quotations from both the Minister and others to which, with the indulgence of the Chair, I hope to refer.  It is not my intention to quote at length from any of the speeches made on that occasion, quite the contrary.  At columns 83-84, Volume 261 of the Official Report of 23rd May, 1972, Deputy Cooney said:</P>
    <P>I can see that there are technical reasons for hasty legislation but nevertheless this does not excuse a piece of legislation with so many question marks unexplained by the Minister in his opening statement. The whole point of having this institution of Parliament is to enable Members to tease out the various</P>
    <P>implications of proposed legislation, <Col N="1855" /> to tease out and to examine the social, political and the technical legal implications in relation to each other and in relation to existing legislation.  We have been deprived of that opportunity here.</P>
    <P>The 1972 Act ceases to have any statutory validity from 31st May, nine days away.  At column 88 of the Official Report of the same date Deputy Cooney stated:</P>
    <P>This defective Government have now landed us in a legislative mess and they have come to this House for help.</P>
    <P>In respect of the present Minister and the present Government one thing that distinguishes them from the previous Fianna Fáil Government is their lack of will in relation to the production of legislation in this House.  This is an occasion when that is exemplified. The Dáil is being asked to enact a Bill into law nine days before the 1972 Act goes out of existence.</P>
    <P>I wonder if the Minister, Deputy Cooney, and others were accusing the then Government of being defective on the basis that they did not introduce legislation because if one compares like with like the last Government and the present one cannot be compared.  In relation to legislation the Fianna Fáil Government exceeded anything the present Government have done.  If Deputy Cooney then meant that the Government were defective because their legislative programme was bad then this is a defective Government we have today.</P>
    <P>Concluding his remarks on Second Stage Deputy Cooney said:</P>
    <P>For the sake of the common good we in this party are prepared to give that help, but for a limited time only.</P>
    <P>For the sake of the common good we are prepared to help and assist the Minister in view of his opening remarks about the need for the time to build a special unit to house prisoners of the type now in military custody. I understand that this special unit is to be built at Portlaoise, that preliminary work has begun on it and <Col N="1856" /> that it will take up to three years to complete it.</P>
    <P>In addition to the other contributions that were made in the teeth of reality, the reality produced by the then Minister for Justice, Deputy O'Malley, we had the present Tánaiste and Leader of the Labour Party, Deputy Corish, at column 90 of the Official Report of 23rd May, 1972 on this matter.  The prevarication throughout these quotations, the political balancing, the wanting-it-both-ways attitude, has to be heard to be believed.  Having stated that he wished to vote for it he went on to give so many reasons that his reasons for doing so became invalid and unreal. This shows a total lack of political will.  The present Tánaiste stated then:</P>
    <P>If there is a specific situation because of a specific activity no one could take exception to the introduction here of specific measures to deal with that situation,</P>
    <P>As I have already stated Mountjoy at the time had been wrecked and that was the situation the House was dealing with.  Deputy Corish continued:</P>
    <P>say in the form of a temporary provisions Bill.  But this is not a temporary provisions Bill.  It will now go on our Statute Book as a permanent Act and, much more dangerous, in the form of a generalised Bill which can be invoked at any time it is deemed necessary to invoke it by any Government now or in the future.  This Bill can be invoked without any reference whatsoever to the rioting in Mountjoy and the destruction there on the night of 18th-19th May, 1972.</P>
    <P>That was the attitude of the Tánaiste to the very reasonable request made by the then Minister for Justice, Deputy O'Malley.  Deputy Corish, at column 94 of the same date, stated:</P>
    <P>The measure is too wide, too general, to deal with a specific problem and a temporary situation, but if this is not so I think we should be told.</P>
    <P>Who is to say but that during the course of those two days Deputy O'Malley all but exhausted himself <Col N="1857" /> trying to explain to the then Opposition his real reasons before introducing that Bill?</P>
    <P>The Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries, Deputy Clinton, at column 101 of the Official Report of the same date stated:</P>
    <P>This emergency legislation should not have been necessary.  That has been made quite clear by our shadow Minister for Justice, Deputy Cooney.</P>
    <P>I admit that Deputy Clinton on that occasion did give reasons why Deputy Cooney felt the emergency legislation was not necessary.  Later during that debate the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Social Welfare, Deputy Cluskey, at column 106 of the Official Report of the same date stated:</P>
    <P>Surely the Minister is not asking this assembly to pass a Bill which is a departure from normal democratic procedure and institutions on the basis that he cannot spare two senior prison officers? That is what it means.  The Minister states that. The Minister said:</P>
    <P>It was my hope, at the time of the transfer, to utilise the detention barracks as a civil prison but, owing to the severe demands on the existing prison staffs at the present time and the inevitable delay in recruiting...</P>
    <P>What does that mean?</P>
    <P>Deputy Cluskey then went on to justify his reasons for voting against the Second Stage of the Bill.</P>
    <P>I should now like to give a rather choice snippet from that well known liberal, Deputy Cruise-O'Brien, Minister for Posts and Telegraphs.  At column 118 of the Official Report of the same date he stated:</P>
    <P>It was introduced in a mood which is rather dear to this Government, a mood of very belated but frantic haste.</P>
    <P>I am sure Deputy Cruise-O'Brien when he reflects on that statement will appreciate that the matter of haste and its indecency must, under all the circumstances, be levelled at the Government of which he is now <Col N="1858" /> a member.  For the record I should like to remind Deputy Cruise-O'Brien of his quotation:</P>
    <P>It was introduced in a mood which is rather dear to this Government, a mood of very belated but frantic haste.</P>
    <P>He says in the same column:</P>
    <P>Secondly, the case for the time limit is extremely strong.  I hope the Minister will tell us he accepts the principle of the time limit, that he does not ask us to give him a kind of blank cheque for an indefinite period to keep in force regulations which most of us here would regard as regrettable and undesirable.</P>
    <P>In addition to saying all that, Deputy Cruise-O'Brien absented himself from voting on the Second Stage of the Bill.  I admit he was in favour of the Bill in principle, but it is extraordinary that he did not stay and vote for the Bill, a Bill of such concern to the community at the time.  It is quite obvious it is of similar concern to the community now.</P>
    <P>It is also well to point out that when the time came and the question was put: &ldquo;That the Bill do now pass&rdquo; Deputy Cruise-O'Brien was again absent.  He was for the Bill in principle on paper but, when it came to actually voting for the Bill, he absented himself.  He may have had a good enough reason to be absent. I do not know.  Perhaps before this Bill passes we will have heard from Deputy Dr. Cruise-O'Brien, the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs, why, having spoken for the Bill, he did not have the courage to vote for it when he had an opportunity of doing so.  The record speaks for itself.</P>
    <P>On the Second Stage the Minister was extremely reasonable towards the then Opposition despite the abuse and the personal attacks levelled at him at a time when he should have been receiving the unqualified support of the Opposition.  At column 187 of the Official Report of 23rd May, 1972, he said:</P>
    <P>...I am prepared to approach this matter perfectly reasonably on <Col N="1859" /> the basis mentioned in my opening speech.  Between now and tomorrow morning I am prepared to think up some amendment that would impose a time limit on it. The length of it I do not know: I would have to consult my advisers on that point.</P>
    <P>Again, it is interesting to note, that a number of Labour Party Deputies&mdash; this is clearly shown in the Official Report&mdash;voted against the 1972 Bill on the Second Stage.  Among them were Deputy Cluskey, Deputy Dr. John O'Connell, Deputy Dr. John O'Donovan, who unhappily is no longer a Dáil Deputy, Deputy Dr. Thornley and the present Ceann Comhairle, Deputy Seán Treacy. Deputy Seán Sherwin also voted against the Bill on that occasion.</P>
    <P>Here, now, you have a situation in which the then Opposition, who now find themselves in Government, come along to the present Opposition, who were then in Government and see it as their clear duty to introduce the 1972 Prisons Bill, seeking a three-year extension of the very things they then opposed so vehemently.  We would ask the Minister to tell us, when he comes to reply to this debate, can he rely on the people who then voted against the 1972 Bill to support him on this occasion?  Can he rely on the Labour Deputies who voted against the Bill to support him now?  We query the <i>bona fides</i> of some of the people who expressed what I described as their prevaricating concern on that occasion.</P>
    <P>We find Deputy Dr. Garret FitzGerald, who has a word for everything on every occasion, at column 209 of Volume 118 on 24th May, 1972, speaking as follows:</P>
    <P>As it is, the amendment is unacceptable but we might get somewhere if we had assurances on a number of things.</P>
    <P>The Minister had, of course, exhausted himself giving assurances on that occasion.</P>
    <P>It is interesting to note that a spokesman for the Labour Party on that occasion at column 211 on 24th May, 1972, had this to say:</P>
    <P>We believe that six months should <Col N="1860" /> be adequate to have the necessary repairs carried out especially in circumstances in which fundamental human rights are involved and the legal system as we know it, in that the prisoners&mdash;and there are not many; some 40 or 50&mdash;are not being transferred to another jail as such under the aegis of the Minister for Justice and the prison system as we know it, but are being transferred to military custody.  They are being transferred to the Curragh Camp.  They are being transferred to Tintown with all its sinister and repressive connotations.  It is a serious matter that we are giving responsibility to the Minister for Defence and placing these prisoners under the charge of the military. Here is where the negation of justice and democracy enters into the matter.</P>
    <P>The Deputy who made that statement was none other than Deputy Seán Treacy.  I assume the same Deputy Treacy, who now holds a respected position in this House, will remain seated and will not press the matter to a Division on this occasion, as he did on the last occasion, and as, indeed, a number of his colleagues did also.</P>

At column 220 on the same day&mdash;the great advantage, Acting Chairman, is that the Official Report is there for the record and therefore what is said in this House has to be said with great care because it is always there for research purposes&mdash; we have Deputy Liam Kavanagh making the following statement:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That seems to me a ridiculously long period in which to carry out repairs or alterations to Mountjoy. Anybody who has any experience of building knows that one could build a new prison in that length of time.  For me, the period is far too long and, because of that, I could not support the Minister's amendment. <Col N="1861" /> The Labour Party amendment of six months is reasonable. Even a few extra months might be acceptable, but two years goes beyond all that is necessary, in my opinion, for repairs and alterations.</P>
    <P>Today we have the Minister for Justice giving as the main reason for his seeking an extension for three more years of the 1972 Act the fact that he has decided to build a special unit to house prisoners of the type now in military custody.  He says his special unit will take up to three years to build.  I wonder what Deputy Kavanagh has to say about that.</P>
    <P>Does he consider that, under all the circumstances, the Minister is looking for too long a period? Does he feel&mdash; not having visited Mountjoy, of course, in 1972 to see the desperate damage that had been done on that occasion&mdash;the period being sought by the present Minister for Justice&mdash;his Minister for Justice after all because he is a supporter of the Coalition parties&mdash;for the building of this special unit, a period of three years, is too long? Could we hear from Deputy Kavanagh on this occasion, 21st May, 1974, his reasonable comments as he considered his comments to be reasonable on that occasion?</P>
    <P>A Deputy who practises law in civilian life, if I may put it that way, Deputy T.J. Fitzpatrick <i>(Cavan)</i> had this to say at column 232 of Volume 118 of the Official Report for 24th May, 1972:</P>
    <P>This section would then mean that if nothing happened the Act would cease to remain in force on 31st May, 1974, but the House could terminate it at any time between now and 31st May, 1974.  I do not know if that is what the Minister had in mind, but certainly he has, instead of improving the situation, worsened it by the amendment he has brought in.  Therefore, if the Minister can convince the House that, as he sees it now, the 31st May, 1974 is the minimum period required but gives the House power to terminate the section before that, he might have a stronger case.</P>
    <P>It was generally accepted that the <Col N="1862" /> Minister had a strong case and it was seen that he had a strong case, but still we had political prevarication. Deputy Desmond, at column 235 on the same day said this:</P>
    <P>The Minister must make a far better case for the 31st May, 1974. The Labour Party has put down an amendment to have the date 30th November, 1972, and Fine Gael proposed 1st September, 1973...</P>
    <P>I do not see why between now and Committee Stage the Fine Gael Party should not come in with an amendment, and certainly we would hope that the Labour Party would come in and explain the inconsistency.  We would hope to hear from them on this occasion, either expressing the views they expressed in 1972 or by way of putting down an amendment between now and Committee Stage.  I am sorry to take up the time of the House with so many quotations.  I have no doubt the Minister will reply in some depth and that he will give suitable quotations which will counteract those I have given.  Deputy Desmond continued:</P>

On this occasion no Member of the Labour Party is even in the House.

      <P>It is my intention, to help Deputy Enright, to mention times later on.  Deputy Enright might be able to talk this one away&mdash;and this is the final nail, as it were.  When the Bill came to its Final Stages, the Dáil divided: Tá, 114; Níl, 8.  Of the eight, were Deputies Cluskey, Keating, O'Connell, Spring, Thornley and Treacy.  We on this side are wondering why they adopted that attitude in 1972&mdash;why they cannot be consistent now and offer a point of view, if only to explain their inconsistency.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Now that I have quoted extensively from the Official Report and shown the inconsistencies, I should like to point out that the Minister for Justice then introduced the Bill to deal with <Col N="1864" /> the damage done in the Mountjoy riots.  I would specifically mention section 2 (3) of the Act of 1972.  It is basically the nitty-gritty of the legislation that is in front of us.  It states:</P>
    <P>If and whenever, at a time when this section is in operation, the Minister is of opinion that prison accommodation or prison staff is insufficient to provide secure and reasonable conditions of custody for all persons then in custody in prison or for whom prison accommodation is required or is insufficient to provide such conditions without serious detriment to the maintenance in prisons of the normal arrangements for the rehabilitative treatment and welfare of prisoners he may, in writing&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <P>A number of things are specified.  It states that the persons so specified shall be transferred to military custody and shall remain in such military custody until a number of situations have occured.  That is basically the reason why the Minister for Justice on this occasion introduces this Bill.  It is amazing the way history repeats itself. In 1972 the riots in Mountjoy, among others, were the reasons for the introduction of that Bill.  Now we find that one of the main explanations for this Bill is the building of a high security unit capable of housing of up to 35 prisoners, to be located in the Portlaois prison complex.  It is explained that three years will be required to build that unit.</P>
    <P>Like Deputy Kavanagh, one wonders whether the Minister has given sufficient detail as to the reasons why it will take so long.  I am not suggesting it will not take so long but we would like the Minister to give a more adequate explanation as to why it will take three years to build, admittedly a special unit, to house the type of prisoner the Minister has mentioned. Perhaps the Minister will give us more details in respect of the length of time he is seeking to build the special unit when he is replying.  The Minister did admit, in his opening statement, that he had doubts in 1972 when the Prisons Bill, now an Act, was going through the House.  He said in his introductory remarks: &ldquo;I was of the <Col N="1865" /> opinion in 1972 that the Curragh Detention Barracks could be taken over by the prison administration and operated as a civilian prison. I am satisfied now that it could not&rdquo;. The Minister deserves credit for that admission. But before launching into the speech he made the Minister might have satisfied himself that the Curragh Detention Barracks could be taken over by the prison administration and operated as a civilian prison.</P>
    <P>The Minister, properly, pays tribute to the Defence Forces for the way in which they have discharged the task of accommodating the type of prisoner they have in the Curragh Detention Centre.  In addition to the tribute paid to the Defence Forces, I should like to add my name to the praise of the prison staff and the Garda.  We can be platitudinous about this type of thing but I think it is important, particularly with the times that are in it, that this House at every opportunity should pay tribute to and support&mdash;indicating that support&mdash;the persons on whose shoulders the safety of this State rests, the Garda Síochána, the Defence Forces and the prison authorities.  I do not think there should be any running for cover by any politician in this respect.  They are entitled to, and we must give them, our wholehearted support in carrying on the very difficult task in which they are engaged at the moment.  They are entitled to that support from Oireachtas Éireann and we, on this side of the House, give them that support without any equivocation whatsoever.  Any assistance the Government might seek from us to increase the numbers of the Garda Síochána, the Defence Forces, prison officers or personnel in any of those branches will be forthcoming wholeheartedly. We appreciate that there is an additional burden on the Defence Forces and indeed on the Garda Síochána and, with the way matters are developing at the moment, there will be a continual burden on our prison officers.</P>
    <P>In relation to the matter of prison officers, I was glad to hear the Minister say he intended to introduce a more comprehensive course when <Col N="1866" /> prison officers are taken into the service.  We, on this side of the House, suggested previously that prison officers should undergo a course of initial training similar to that of the Garda Síochána.  Of course we have expressed concern about the adequacy of the training given to the Garda Síochána, nevertheless we feel that this is the type of training the prison officer should receive.  Certainly the then Minister for Justice, Deputy O'Malley, had this type of situation in hand and in mind.  We, in Opposition for the time being, intend supporting this legislation because we see where our duty lies.  There is no prevarication. There is no doubt the 1972 Prisons Act was introduced by a Fianna Fáil Government.</P>
    <P>In 1974, we do not see any reason for changing our minds or having doubts about the probity of the introduction of that Bill nor do we have doubts about the probity of the introduction of this Bill&mdash;in 1974.  At that time the then Minister for Justice expressed doubts about the idea of transferring civilians to military custody.  We still have those doubts.  We would hope that when the present situation resolves itself and the country returns to normality we will use the powers in the Bill to bring an end to its effectiveness. But in the meantime if the situation in the country demands it, we will stand over it.  We believe that the situation in the country does demand it and that the situation in the Prison Service does demand it.  Consequently we will stand over our support for the Bill.</P>
    <P>As we are discussing the Prisons Bill of 1974, there are a number of questions I should like to pose to the Minister for Justice in relation to the interior of Mountjoy Prison.  The building of the corrective training unit was begun by the then Minister for Justice to accommodate, as I understood it&mdash; having accompanied Deputy Seán Moore on a visit to Mountjoy prison &mdash;100 persons.  Can the Minister say now when the corrective training unit will come into operation? He might mention Arbour Hill also in the course of his reply.</P>
    <P>On the matter of Portlaoise prison. <Col N="1867" /> the Minister outlined his reasons for the introduction of the Bill.  We find them rather ironic, to say the least, because they are almost on all fours with the reason, in a different context of course, for the introduction of the Bill by Deputy O'Malley in 1972. Having regard to the attitude of the present Minister for Defence, having regard to his actions in the <i>Claudia</i> incident, having regard to his ducal or princely-type reactions in Greenore, when he took charge of the Defence Forces in his capacity as Minister for Defence, we would ask the Minister for Justice to keep a weather eye on Deputy Donegan in the making of regulations in relation to the places and the manner generally in which persons in military custody, pursuant to section 2 (9), shall be kept in custody.  The subsection states:</P>
    <P>The Minister for Defence shall make regulations in relation to the places and the manner generally in which persons in military custody pursuant to this section shall be kept in custody and such regulations shall correspond to the rules for the time being in force under the Prisons Acts, 1826 to 1970, governing the treatment, employment and control of persons in prison.</P>
    <P>I am not suggesting in any way that Deputy Donegan would attempt to interfere with the well-being of prisoners in custody.  I am merely asking that an eye should be kept on Deputy Donegan.  That is all I would ask the Minister for Justice to do when this becomes law.</P>
    <P>That is all I have to say on this Bill.  Having regard to the manner in which the Minister replies on the Second Stage we will then consider the possibility of giving him all Stages this evening.  I hope the Minister will be reasonable in his reply.  We have heard him replying to a number of matters on the Adjournment in the recent past when he has become rather hysterical in that sense and his speech has then become rather threadworn in regard to any matters <Col N="1868" /> Fianna Fáil might bring up in relation to security.</P>
    <P>In so far as our position in opposition is concerned I know that our record is clear as our record in Government was clear and clean.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>I was disappointed when I came into the House to find that I would have to be the next speaker to offer or the Minister would have got in to reply.  There is an enormous contrast between the Prisons Bill of 1974 and the Prisons Bill of 1972.  Perhaps the reason for that is that there is now a responsible group of people sitting on this side of the House.  Perhaps there was not a responsible group sitting here in 1972.  The proof that there was not a responsible group here in 1972 is that the Minister has to eat humble pie and come in here today with this Bill.</P>
      <P>If there was one aspect of that Bill in 1972 that the present Government objected to it was that originally there was not a time limit other than a proviso for reactivating section 2 by resolutions of the House.  Ultimately when I suggested a three-year time limit from May,1972, that was found to be excessive.  In order to try to get the Bill through the House I had to agree to shorten that period to two years.  Even at that I was assailed by Deputies opposite.  It was not just the Labour Party, who voted against it, who assailed me but many members of Fine Gael including the Minister for Justice.  I noticed when I was going through the Official Report for a short time this afternoon that when I was replying to the Second Stage debate in 1972 I mentioned that only 20 Deputies had contributed on that occasion.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I was immediately interrupted and told that 20 more would have contributed if they had got the opportunity and that they would have expressed their opposition to the Bill but that because it had been agreed to end that debate by midnight on that day only 20 Deputies were able to get in to express their opposition to the Bill. Eight of those voted against it eventually.  As Deputy Andrews has stated it is very interesting to see the <Col N="1869" /> empty seats which six of that eight who are still in this House could occupy if they wanted to.</P>
    <P>It was remarkable that instead of anybody on the Government side, and in particular from the Labour Party, seeking to get in to speak before me the only person who offered to speak was the Minister himself.  I thought that because of the pretty radical change in attitude which this Bill now before us indicates in the thinking of the Government and of the Minister for Justice in particular, that we would have had a fairly lengthy explanation of why the Minister has turned turtle in this way, eaten humble pie and swallowed his words.  The Minister in the very short speech which he has made already agreed in effect that virtually everything he said in May, 1972, was wrong then and is wrong now.</P>
    <P>We had a short skimping-over of the Bill&mdash;two-and-a-half pages of a script.  Even though this Bill is very short it is important.  There are many matters we should examine.  My recollection of the 1972 Act is that section 2 (3) says:</P>
    <P>If and whenever, at a time when this section is in operation, the Minister is of opinion that prison accommodation or prison staff is insufficient to provide secure and reasonable conditions of custody for all persons then in custody in prison or for whom prison accommodation is required or is insufficient to provide such conditions without serious detriment to the maintenance in prisons... he may, in writing&mdash;</P>
    <P>(a) certify that he is so of opinion, and</P>
    <P>(b) direct the transfer to military custody of such of the persons aforesaid....</P>
    <P>It is interesting to find in this speech which the Minister has now made on Second Reading he does not clearly make the case that there is an insufficiency of staff because quite clearly there is not, any more than there was in 1972.  That was only a provision put in to deal with some contigency that might arise but happily never did, and <Col N="1870" /> I am quite sure never will.  Likewise, the Minister does not try to make the case now that the accommodation is insufficient or inadequate in the sense that there are not sufficient cells to house prisoners.  That was the position we were, in fact, faced with in May, 1972, when I had to transfer 40-45 prisoners one night to the Curragh before I was even able to introduce the Bill.  The Minister does not make that case now.  He does not say that there is insufficient accommodation in the sense that there are insufficient cells.  The Minister says that at the moment there are 32 dangerous prisoners in the Curragh and that he has nowhere else to keep them other than in the Curragh until he builds this proposed new high-security small unit at the farm at Portlaoise prison.</P>
    <P>I have only had an opportunity of reading the Minister's speech within the last half-hour.  It is a question of some doubt as to whether section 2 (3) of the 1972 Act covers a situation such as this.  One envisaged at the time that it was purely a matter of accommodation without going into any details on the question of the suitability or otherwise of the accommodation. The accommodation problem does not appear to arise now.  The overall prison population is not any greater now than it was in 1972.  If it is any greater it is only marginally so. There are more prisons or places of detention available than there were in 1972.  I am surprised that the Minister did not refer to the up-to-date prison situation in the various prisons throughout the country.  That is very relevant indeed.  If they were examined the question of continuing this arrangement under the 1972 Act for a further three years would not arise. So far as I recall, of the various new prisons or other institutions which I opened or got started the only one which was actually open at the time of the 1972 riot was the one at Cork. At that time I was having Arbour Hill examined.  It had been kindly offered to me by the then Minister for Defence.  We found that it needed a fair amount of repair and structural alteration.  It clearly could not be available in anything like a short time.</P>
    <P>Shortly after this I opened Lacken <Col N="1871" /> House and Shelton Abbey in Arklow. Lacken House was for younger offenders who would otherwise be in St. Patrick's Shelton Abbey was for people who would otherwise be in Mountjoy.  Both of these made a definite contribution towards easing the accommodation problem since 1972. As the Minister says, the repair of the actual damage done on the 19th May, 1972, to Mountjoy has now been completed.  What is in process at the moment is a general renovation with a view to modernising Mountjoy. I am very glad that that is continuing. The accommodation in Mountjoy must be considerably greater than it was on, say, 20th May, 1972, because it is now repaired.</P>
    <P>We should be clear in our minds that the reason for the 1972 Act was that there was no accommodation in which to put prisoners unless we took over the Curragh.  This Bill is quite different.  It proposes to continue the 1972 Act but for a different reason, that is, that there is not suitable or high security accommodation for the 32 prisoners who are at the moment in the Curragh and who are described as being dangerous.  The Minister says he is satisfied that they cannot be accommodated securely in ordinary prisons without grave risk of disruption. We must be clear, therefore, of the distinction between these two Bills.  There was no accommodation in 1972.  There is now.  But in respect of 32 of these prisoners, the prison is not sufficiently secure, in the Minister's view, to hold them.  I accept the Minister's views on this because he has the advice of people who are competent to advise him on that point.  What we do not know&mdash;and I do not have the up-to-date figures&mdash; are the number of prisoners in Portlaoise at the moment.</P>
    <P>My recollection of Portlaoise is that there is capacity for about 210.  I do not know if there are 200 or 210 prisoners there at the moment but I doubt if there are.  There might be 32 vacant cells which could be occupied by these 32 prisoners who are regarded as dangerous and who are at the moment in the Curragh.  From <Col N="1872" /> what I see from the public street when I pass Portlaoise twice a week, the security there is no less than it is in the Curragh.  For some weeks past I noticed that a new shelter was being built on the roof of the main wing. There is an armed soldier standing at the corner of that roof.</P>
    <P>Today I noticed that in addition there was another soldier standing on a platform inside the main wall near the main gate.  Presumably these two soldiers are visible from the main road.  There must be many more inside who are not visible from the public road.  For that reason one would think that the security there. from a military point of view, must be no less than that obtaining in the Curragh.  Indeed, one begins to wonder whether the prisoners being held in Portlaoise are being held in civil or military custody.  It would appear that the ultimate custodians, from the point of view of preventing a break out, are military personnel.  I am not disagreeing with that but am stating it as it appears to be a fact.  I suggest, if there are 32 vacant cells in Portlaoise, that the 32 dangerous prisoners in the Curragh should be transferred. There may not be much justification for holding 32 potentially dangerous prisoners in the Curragh for a further period of three years.</P>
    <P>When I heard that a Bill of this nature was being introduced, it immediately struck me that the only reason for it was that the two-year period would expire within a week and that it would have to be continued. Particularly having regard to the views expressed by the present Minister, a number of Fine Gael Deputies and nearly all Labour Deputies in 1972 that the period of extension should be the minimum possible, about six and not more than 12 months, I was very taken aback to find when I was handed the Bill at 4.05 this afternoon that the period of the proposed extension was, in fact, three years which is significantly longer than the original period mentioned in the 1972 Act.</P>
    <P>Since the passing of the 1972 Act it was known that the Act would expire at the end of this month. <Col N="1873" /> One would assume, therefore, that if the present Government were to go back on their previous views and decide that they had to extend the period of application of the 1972 Act that they would do so in plenty of time because they had ample notice of it.  It is the practice of officials of the Department to draw the Minister's attention to such a thing at an early stage.  They would give him and the Government ample warning of the fact that the Act would expire at the end of May, 1974, and that legislation would have to be introduced and passed before that date to extend it.  I would be very surprised if the Minister did not have his attention drawn to this fact as long ago as, perhaps, three or four months. The drafting of the Bill, which is only the matter of a line or two, which could have been done by an official in a few minutes did not hold anything up.</P>
    <P>Notwithstanding that, we have the unusual situation that, in spite of all the notice of the necessity of the Bill and assuming the intention of keeping the Act in force, the Bill was introduced today at 4 o'clock, circulated&mdash;having already been printed in advance of the order of the House&mdash; at 4.05 p.m. and a request made that the Second Reading be taken two hours and 55 minutes later, at 7 o'clock.  I began to wonder why this should be so, why this Bill could not be introduced, published and debated in the ordinary way, particularly as it was not a problem which arose overnight, as happened at the time of the original Bill.  I began to be suspicious that, perhaps, the Government did not wish to have this Bill circulated in the ordinary way because that might tend to draw the attention of Deputies and the public generally to a situation in which, through their own fault, practically all members of the Government have to eat their words when bringing in the Bill.  It may well be that it was hoped that by bringing it in almost surreptitiously and having it debated on the same day, perhaps, less attention would be paid not so much to the Bill itself but to the consequences of the Bill <Col N="1874" /> from the point of view of members of the Government who were so highly critical of the fact that it was going to last for two years originally.</P>
    <P>I understand that a request has been made that this Bill would not alone get a Second Reading tonight but that it would be passed through all Stages by this House tonight.  I do not know whether our spokesman or our Whip proposes to accede to that request or not.  What strikes me as unusual is that that request would be made.  I understand it is not proposed to summon the Seanad to sit tomorrow.  I do not know whether the Seanad is intended to be summoned at all this week.  I understand that it is not and that the Seanad will not sit until next week.  If that is so, what is the need or the reason for the unseemly haste which the Minister displays in seeking to have this Bill rushed through&mdash;introduced this afternoon, circulated this afternoon, Second Reading this afternoon, Committee Stage, Report Stage and Fifth Stage all this evening, or apparently required?</P>
    <P>I do not think the Minister will meet any obstruction from this side of the House in spite of the fact that many of us here on this side of the House are well entitled to talk at some length on the contrast between what is now happening here, where there are twice as many Fianna Fáil Deputies present as there are on the Government side, and what happened exactly two years ago almost to the very day in this House when 20 Deputies who had spoken against it from the then Opposition side clamoured because of the fact that only 20 of them were allowed to speak by midnight on that night.  They are, as Deputy Andrews has noted already, mute today, and their muteness, their failure to open their mouths now, is the most eloquent proof of all of the total incorrectness of all that they said here on this Bill in May, 1972, and it is a total justification of what I and the then Government did or tried to do in relation to that Bill.</P>
    <P>Because of the fact that we only got the Bill at 4 o'clock and I had various other things to do as well, I had not time to go through that debate. <Col N="1875" /> I have only read bits of it here and there.  However, one quickly remembers, when one reads a bit of it, even the tone of that debate, the sheer outrage of the Labour Party, in particular, and the present Minister for Justice also on the Fine Gael bench, that such a Bill should be introduced and, in particular, that it was sought to have it enforced for a period longer than six, nine or 12 months.  At that time, the thought of extending it for a further three years beyond the two years that was then proposed as a compromise and, if you like, as a sop to Fine Gael to try to get the Bill through more quickly, would probably have given the present Minister for Justice apoplexy, because he got extremely worked up about the two year period that was then mentioned. The Minister in his very short speech here tonight made the following point:</P>
    <P>A new factor has emerged in the overall situation which makes it necessary to continue the present arrangement.  This is the emergence of well-organised disruption within our prisons and the consequent need for the careful segregation or grouping of prisoners.  The problems involved in maintaining secure custody for the full range of our prison population has been compounded since 1972 by the increased numbers of subversives in our prisons.</P>
    <P>There are, so far as I know, somewhat more subversives in our prisons now than there were at the time of the riot in 1972.  Precisely how many I would not know because I do not know the present population of subversives. Of course, many of those who are in prison now were in prison then also, and hopefully at least some of them will still be there in 1977 when this new Bill expires.  There are no grounds for the assertion of the Minister that a new factor has arisen in the emergence of well-organised disruption within our prisons.  If there was ever proof of well-organised disruption, it was the riot itself in Mountjoy on the 18th and 19th May, 1972.</P>
    <P>I was the only Member of this House who was there that night.  I <Col N="1876" /> saw at first hand exactly what happened. I could not believe that human beings could inflict so much deliberate damage on any building.  One of the things that amazed me most of all was that these patriots, as they regarded themselves then and presumably still do, set out in particular to damage the parts of the prison that were most useful to prisoners.  I recall that at that time in May, 1972, we had just installed about a month or so before that a very new, modern dental surgery in the prison which was as good as could be found in the surgery of a leading dental practitioner in the city.  It had cost the taxpayer, as far as I recall, about £6,000, and there was the most systematic destruction of every single piece of equipment in that room.</P>
    <P>I had been in Mountjoy about a month before and one of the things that I was brought to admire in particular was that surgery and it was well worth admiring.  These savages had gone in there and had smashed to pieces every single little piece of equipment that they could find there. The doctor's surgery, which had also been re-equipped and had a good stock of drugs, equipment and appliances of all kinds was similarly treated.  There was a good deal of damage done to other parts of the prison which had been modernised and re-equipped very recently at that stage for the benefit of all prisoners.</P>
    <P>I can recall before May, 1972, the efforts of various groups of prisoners, more particularly in Portlaoise than elsewhere, to disrupt prison life and cause damage to the prisons themselves, to make things awkward for members of the staff and, particularly, to make life miserable for the nonsubversive prisoners who happened to be in the prisons at that time.  I have a clear recollection of them because these are the things that impinge themselves on one's memory.  Therefore, I find it difficult to agree with the Minister when he asserts that a new factor has now arisen, because that very factor was there in May, 1972, and it was, in fact, that above all else which led to the riot of 18th May, 1972.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1877" /> As I say, because of the development which took place in prisons, in the opening of new institutions of various kinds when I was in the Department of Justice and because of the ones which were planned then all of which, I understand, are going ahead, I was disappointed in relation to this Bill that the Minister would not see fit to refer to these developments because in common with many people I am interested in how they are progressing. I would have thought that by now the capacity of Mountjoy should have been greater than it was in the pre-riot days.  When I left the Department in May, 1973, work was very far advanced on the corrective training unit in Mountjoy, which, I understand is capable of accommodating about 120 offenders.  It was due to be opened in October, 1973.  I understand it is finished but I do not think it is opened yet.  If it were occupied, as it should be, the accommodation problem would be considerably lessened.</P>
    <P>It is very important that it be occupied, not just from the point of view of helping with the accommodation problem but from the point of view of assisting in the rehabilitation of prisoners.  That is its primary concern. Those of us who know anything about Mountjoy know that the old prison as such is not a suitable place for the rehabilitation and education of prisoners.  They could more easily get proper rehabilitation in the purpose-built building which is now ready, in a separate corner of Mountjoy cut off from the main prison.  I am sorry we did not hear anything about that. Perhaps the Minister would tell us the position because there is a great need for it not only from the accommodation point of view&mdash;so far as it is relevant to this Bill&mdash;but also from the general rehabilitation point of view.</P>
    <P>When I left the Department in May, 1973, designs had been drawn and plans had been considerably advanced for a new women's prison at Kilbarrack, County Dublin.  I had hoped it would have been at an advanced stage of construction by now.  That would do a lot to ease the security problems in the St. Patrick's section of the Mountjoy complex.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1878" /> Apart from easing the security problems, it was urgently needed.</P>
    <P>When I first visited our prisons in an official capacity I got a severe shock to find that in the Dublin prison women prisoners were accommodated in a wing of St. Patrick's Institution, which is for younger offenders.  I found that they were housed not even in an entire wing but on a floor of a wing, with young male offenders on the floor immediately above.  I decided there and then that that situation would have to come to an end and that we must have a separate, purpose-built, modern women's prison.  After a fair amount of delay, thanks to the co-operation of the Dublin Corporation we got a site that was regarded as suitable at Kilbarrack.  I should like to know what progress has been made with the provision of the prison. Quite apart from the security and accommodation problems, it is vital that women prisoners in the city be taken from where they are.  It is monstrous that they be housed in a floor of a wing of an institution for young offenders.  The situation in Limerick is much better because even though they are inside the walls of Limerick prison they are in a separate building and are cut off from the main prison with no danger of communication with prisoners there.</P>
    <P>When I left the Department there were various tentative plans for prisons.  There were hopes for building an institution for younger offenders in Cork, probably another such institution on a small scale in Dublin and there were hopes of closing St. Patrick's and moving it to a more suitable site in County Dublin.  I hope progress has continued on these matters and I should like to avail of this opportunity to inquire about them.  If all these plans had gone ahead we would not have an accommodation problem in our prisons, nor would we have the necessity for this Bill.</P>
    <P>I should like to draw the attention of the House to the fact that this Bill is being justified today not on the grounds of the 1972 Act, namely that there was insufficient accommodation, but on the grounds that there is now <Col N="1879" /> no accommodation other than the Curragh which is sufficiently secure to hold 32 particular, and apparently dangerous, prisoners.  I do not know if that is sufficient justification for continuing the 1972 Act.  As I have pointed out earlier, there may be 32 vacant cells in Portlaoise.  I do not know the present population; its capacity is 210 and if its population is less than 180 it should be possible to accommodate these dangerous prisoners. The degree of security there must be no less than in the Curragh because of the large number of soldiers who seem to be permanently stationed there.</P>
    <P>It appears that any other speakers on this Bill, apart from the Minister who will reply, will come from this side of the House.  I would draw attention to the tremendous contrast that exists between the calm situation in which this Bill is debated tonight and the uproar that existed two years ago.  For those who are interested, I want to contrast the responsibility that is exhibited here tonight with what was said on the last occasion.  There were many examples in that debate that one could quote&mdash;Deputy Andrews quoted many and I do not propose to go into a long series of quotations&mdash;but I will quote from a speech made by Deputy Thornley, who is still happily a Member of this House, on the First Stage of the Bill.  He is free to express his views here tonight, as he was in May, 1972, but he appears no longer interested in the problems about which he spoke so vehemently then.  At column 38 of the Official Report dated 23 May, 1973, on the First Stage, before he had seen the Bill, he said:</P>
    <P>I oppose this Bill.  Its contents are theoretically not known.  They are, in fact, known to everybody in this House and every press correspondent here.  I regard this Bill as disgraceful and irrelevant, and as an excuse to use the Mountjoy Jail disorders in order to transfer Irish citizens who, whatever their faults, are awaiting trial, from the control of the Garda Síochána to <Col N="1880" /> the control of the Army.  All these powers exist in section 6 of the Offences Against the State Act.  The Minister has not the courage to come into this House and apply that section, making it quite clear what he is doing which is introducing internment by backdoor methods in this country.  This is disgraceful and irrelevant, and I do not think that the Order Paper of this House should be disfigured by having this Bill on it.</P>
    <P>He spoke again at great length and with great passion on the Second Reading.  He was strongly opposed, as were most of the Labour Party, to the Bill and, in common with seven others, he voted against it.  The seven others included Deputy Cluskey who was then spokesman on Justice for the Labour Party&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMarkCooney" hpid="Mr. Cooney Mr. Cooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cooney</NameTxt>
      <P>It was Deputy Pattison who was spokesman on Justice.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Cluskey had been the spokesman on Justice for quite some time; he must have graduated to higher things at that stage.  Nonetheless he voted against it; he was strongly opposed to the principle of it and, in particular, the fact that it would be kept in operation for two years, which he regarded as outrageous.</P>
      <P>We had three Bills in the time I was Minister for Justice which were particularly vehemently opposed.  The Prisons Bill was not opposed the most strongly.  We had the Forcible Entry Bill and the Offences Against the State (Amendment) Bill which all caused passions to run very high, but not a word of any of them has been repealed, though the opposition to them at the time was extremely vehement. The present Minister was then the Justice spokesman for Fine Gael and at column 82 of the Official Report he began his speech on the Prisons Bill.  At the beginning of the second paragraph at column 83 he spoke about the riot which had broken out and that as a result the prison system had been brought to its knees. He continued:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If any system ends up in that <Col N="1881" /> position, the persons to take responsibility are surely the members of the Executive charged with the responsibility for administering it.</P>
    <P>I think that is an interesting quotation from Deputy Cooney.  There was a little hoo-hah in the House not so long ago when certain aspects of the prison system clearly broke down completely, when we had the escape of five high security prisoners from Mountjoy Prison.  That was surely, if ever there was one, a case of a breakdown of the system, particularly bearing in mind that nobody escaped on the night of 18th May, 1972.  On that occasion we had a public washing of hands by the present Minister.</P>
    <P>I will not go into the terminology that was used.  What we clearly had, and Deputy Molloy took grave exception to it, was a washing of his hands, a washing away of responsibility for the complete breakdown of the prison system which the Minister had spoken about so accurately on 23rd May, 1972.  It was not his fault, he said, in relation to the escapes, it was the fault of underlings.  It is interesting to see, and I am glad he did say it, that in 1972 &ldquo;the persons to take responsibility are surely the members of the Executive&rdquo; in such a situation. That was true when he said it; it is still true and it was true when five high security prisoners escaped from Mountjoy in the last six months.</P>
    <P>At column 87 on 23rd May, 1972, the Minister spoke about getting an unequivocal assurance from the Minister that he was not availing of the emergency in Mountjoy to introduce a type of back door internment.  He wanted to make it clear then that in supporting the Bill his party did so purely to rescue the Minister from the administrative mess into which his maladministration of the prison service had landed him.  If there was an administrative mess which necessitated a two-year opportunity to clear it up in 1972, I wonder what the position could be at the moment, what it could be described as.  The Minister at that time also said:</P>
    <P>We on this side of the House are <Col N="1882" /> not in favour of any move in the direction of military custody per se. I want further to emphasise that our support is conditional on the Government writing into this Bill a time limit for its operation.</P>
    <P>Later on he said:</P>
    <P>If the Government are not prepared to put an unequivocal time limit on the operation of this Bill, this party, on the Final Stages of the Bill, will be forced to oppose it.</P>
    <P>Strange that I did put an unequivocal time limit on it, very clearly and very precisely, and that the man who said those words should come in here tonight to ask Dáil Éireann to extend that time limit for a period significantly longer than the time limit I put on it and for which I was criticised on the grounds that it was too long.</P>
    <P>There are many interesting quotations. I can go on to the next paragraph where the Minister, in relation to the riot at Mountjoy, as a result of which nobody escaped, said:</P>
    <P>This Bill arises from the riot in Mountjoy Jail, and it appears that some of the prison staff were overpowered. I think it is encumbent on the Minister at some stage, if not now, to indicate that he is prepared to hold an inquiry into the facts surrounding the commencement and development of this riot.</P>
    <P>I recall Deputy Andrews some months ago asking in this House for an inquiry to be held, not into a fracas as a result of which nobody escaped, but into two successive highly organised escapes of very high security prisoners, five of whom succeeded in getting out of Mountjoy.  That was a very much more serious thing than an internal riot, notwithstanding the amount of damage that was done. But that request for an inquiry was contemptuously over-ruled.  One wonders did Deputy Cooney, when he said the words I now quote, mean them or could any man have changed so much in course of 18 months that he now does the precise opposite to what he said in May, 1972.  Does power have that much effect on people? It is interesting that some <Col N="1883" /> people qualified to look into these matters might well look into them. The very last words which Deputy Cooney said in May, 1972, were:</P>
    <P>For the sake of the common good we in this party are prepared to give that help, but for a limited time only.</P>
    <P>It is very interesting that the very last point Deputy Cooney made was in regard to a limitation of time. When in deference to his request and that of many other members of the then Opposition, I imposed a time limit&mdash;we had originally suggested three years and reduced it to two years&mdash;I was assailed by the mob who said that two years was too long.  Now we find three years being added by the very man who opposed a two-year period.  The debate in 1972 lasted until 12.25 a.m. Twenty people spoke. We were even graced with a contribution from yourself, Sir, which I will pass over.</P>

      <P>I have glanced at the Committee Stage of the 1972 Bill. The debate on the time limit lasted about five hours the following morning and we had many interesting contributions. Anyone who is interested can read Volume 261, No. 2. I will not delay the House unduly by going through a lot of the speeches but there were strong words from Deputies like Deputy Coughlan and Deputy Thornley. I think the convention is not to refer to the speeches of subsequent occupants of the Chair and, therefore, I will not do it but nonetheless it is all there in black and white.  At column 222 Deputy Coughlan was particularly concerned about the situation that would be brought about by the 1972 Bill in spite of the fact that he voted for it on both the votes but he said he was misled by me and that that was why he voted.  He went on the following morning to justify himself.  He said:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I had my mind clearly made up as to what stand I would take on this issue because I knew that these incidents in Mountjoy were not accidental.  They were forced upon these men, men of conviction, men who believe that what they are doing is the right thing, and we must respect them for their convictions. This position was brought about because of the arrogance, and <Col N="1885" /> nothing else, of the Minister for Justice.  These men had been complaining for quite some time and if the Minister had even a modicum of maturity he would understand what it means to be locked up as a political prisoner.  Some of us have had that experience.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>He continued:</P>
      <P>He, unfortunately&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      <P>that is me&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;has not had that experience. These men who are charged with political offences because of their political convictions have been detained in a prison where they should get treatment completely and utterly divorced from the treatment political prisoners should get.</P>
      <P>Deputy Thornley at column 228 made a very short speech totally opposed to the whole principle of the Bill, not just the question of the time limit.  He said:</P>
      <P>Deputy Coughlan said that he asked for certain assurances from the Minister for Justice.  I ask for no assurances from the Minister for Justice because I know what I am dealing with in the Minister for Justice.  I knew last night when I walked through the &ldquo;Nil&rdquo; lobby what I was dealing with in the Minister for Justice.  The amendment introduced by the Minister for Justice today in implementation of the pledge he made in this House that there would be a time limit on the operation of this Bill is in the first place an insult to the intelligence of this House and, secondly, it reflects the political gullibility of the lawyers on the Fine Gael benches who, 12 hours ago, took his word.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It was regarded as an insult to the House to bring in a two-year time limit because that was so excessively long and at the end of two years we now find a proposal to extend the operation of the Act for a further three years.  If the two were an insult at that time what must the three be <Col N="1886" /> now? But Deputy Thornley is not here to tell us.</P>

      <P>He is presumably in Europe, he having the honour of being a member of the European Parliament and it may well be that the funny way in which this Bill was introduced and rushed through the House was an effort to get it through before Deputy Thornley or people like him even became aware of it.  As a matter of principle to those of our Members who are good enough to serve, at no little inconvenience to themselves, in the European Parliament, I do not think it is right that legislation about which they know nothing should go through this House. I presume that if Deputy Thornley was asked in advance for his views on this legislation he would have pretty strong views or maybe he has been afflicted with the same disease that so many other former occupants of these benches have been afflicted with and that he may also, though I doubt it. have changed his mind&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;very drastically. As I have pointed out, this party have no desire to delay or obstruct this legislation but, in the circumstances in which it has been introduced, even though it has been known for two years that it would have to be introduced and passed by this week, we are suspicious of why it has been done in this way.  If this were a problem that arose last night or even last week, then fair enough, I would say, because I had to do the same myself with the original Bill: &ldquo;Bring it in very quickly and circulate it very quickly,&rdquo; but two years ago the Department of Justice were on notice that they would have to have a Bill passed by both Houses and signed by the President before the end of May, 1974, and still it is on the <Col N="1887" /> afternoon of 21st May, ten days before that, that they produce the Bill and circulate it.  I do not think that is the fault of the officials in the Department because my experience of them for three years was that they were assiduous in bringing to the attention of the Minister the fact that certain things had to be done by certain dates. It is not a question that anyone overlooked the matter.  It is a question that this Bill was deliberately held back and then introduced today in this rather surreptitious and strange fashion.</P>
      <P>There may well be quite a number of Members of this House, apart from those who are in Europe, who for one reason or another did not or could not come up to this House today but who might well have wanted to come if they knew that a Bill prolonging the Prisons Act, 1972 was going to be debated fully in this House this evening, that the debate would commence at 7 p.m., the Bill having been circulated at 4 p.m. and that the debate, it appears now, was expected to conclude tonight.  There may well be Deputies who did not come up because they were given an Order of Business last week of what would be taken today. It may have been of no great concern to them or their constituents and they may have felt that it was not incumbent on them to attend today.  They might have felt otherwise if they had bent on them to attend today.  They might have felt otherwise if they had got normal, due notice of a Bill of this kind.  We have had 15 months notice now of the Misuse of Drugs Bill, 1973, a terribly important matter, and we cannot get the Bill 15 months after it was introduced but we get this one five minutes after it is introduced.  It makes one suspicious and one is entitled, on the Opposition benches, to express that suspicion even though one may not be able to pin down precisely the reason for this strange and surreptitious activity.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. G. Fitzgerald Mr. G. Fitzgerald">

    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>It may be because we have had some funny examples of so-called open Government in recent times.  If this is a form of open Government it is one which, in common <Col N="1888" /> with a number of other forms of it which we have seen, I do not like very much.</P>
      <P>As Deputy Andrews said, the attitude of this party to this Bill will depend to a great extent on what the Minister for Justice has to say in reply to this debate, on the tone of that reply and on the spirit of that reply.  All I say to him now is that there is a great need for him to be very much more forthcoming than he was in his two-and-a-half page opening speech on this Second Stage. It would be possible for me to spend from now until 12 o'clock tonight reading what I would regard as suitable and apt quotations from the debates which took place here on the 23rd and 24th May, 1972.  I do not propose to do so.  Likewise, it would be possible for this side of the House to keep this debate going for a week if they so desired and they might well be justified in doing it because of the surreptitious way in which the debate was commenced but we do not propose to do it because we know from what we have been told now that the existing Act expires on 31st May and we do not want to see a situation in which 32 people might conceivably have to be let go free.  For that reason we do not propose to make the sort of capital out of this that we would be quite justified in making.</P>
      <P>Once again, I want to inquire if my information is correct that Seanad Éireann are not sitting tomorrow.  My subsequent information is that Seanad Éireann are not sitting at all this week.  Is that correct?  If this information is correct&mdash;I cannot be certain about it until I am told by the Minister&mdash;why the hurry? Why introduce a Bill at 4 o'clock, circulate it at five minutes past four, start the Second Reading debate at 7 o'clock and ask to have it finished at 10.30? These are questions which need to be answered, particularly in the context of a Minister introducing a Bill to prolong for a further three years something which two years ago he thought a two-year period was far too long for.</P>

      <P>If Deputy O'Malley has been somewhat hard hitting I feel that the present Minister, with the experience he has had since taking up the arduous office of Minister for Justice, may feel the Deputy is entitled to take the stance he has.  I am a firm believer that wisdom and knowledge come with responsibility. The Minister may well be much more aware of what his predecessor had to contend with when he brought in the Prisons Bill two years ago.  The present Minister has not had to contend with an outraged Opposition.  When Deputy O'Malley was Minister for Justice he had not only to contend with Members of the Opposition in the House but with a very hostile media as well.  He never once shrunk from the responsibility which he had as Minister for Justice.</P>
      <P>The present Minister is most fortunate in having to face an Opposition who are most understanding of the problems he has to face.  The job of Minister for Justice is probably the most arduous job in Government in any country today.  I am sure the Minister would agree that charity is acquired through experience.  I feel Deputy O'Malley was justified in being hard hitting.  When we were in Government we did not have an Opposition who understood the problems we had to face.  When the present Minister took up his job as Minister for Justice he must have been farly shocked when he realised the extent of the threat to the State which exists at all times.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should like to take this opportunity of again asking the Minister for Justice if he has given any thought to the provision of an intensive care unit for young offenders when he is building prisons or renovating prisons.  He has opened a number of special schools, which replace the old reformatories.  I recently attended the opening of St. Laurences School in Finglas which has been in operation for three years.  This school deals with young offenders. When I spoke on the Department of Justice Estimate last year I said that of the young people who get into trouble up to 3 per cent of them can be described as psychopaths.  These are young vandals who have no social <Col N="1890" /> conscience whatsoever.  You can equate them with the kind of people who plant car bombs.</P>
    <P>We have in our midst in this city a number of young people like this, as the Minister is well aware, and there is no place for them.  The special schools cannot take them in because they disrupt the system just the same as the hardened cases who were taken out of Mountjoy and put into the Curragh Detention Camp.  Those young people are on the streets because there is no place for them.  The Minister has been under a lot of pressure in relation to malicious damages.  Earlier this year I learned that the £8 million malicious damages in Dublin represented 17,000 separate incidents of vandalism.  We are not doing anything about this serious problem.  Does the Minister plan to provide an intensive care unit for those people?  Those intensive care units may also be called high security prisons which would cater for young people under 18 years of age who have no intention of reforming.  The courts cannot do anything with them.</P>
    <P>Is the Minister planning anything for young female offenders? The problem here is nearly as bad as that of the young male offenders.  There are very few institutions which will deal with young female offenders.  When the new women's prison is built in Kilbarrack will the Minister provide a separate section there for those young female offenders? If he does not want to associate the young female offenders under 18 years of age with the older women offenders has he any plans to provide special accommodation for them? Has he any place in mind for the female psychopaths? Those people represent a very small percentage of all the young people who get into trouble.  Most of them can be rehabilitated but those other people cannot.  Some place should be provided for them where they can be kept until such time as they show they are willing to progress.</P>

      <P>You have been most generous.  I have covered the points I wanted to make.  If the Minister has a comment to make perhaps you will be generous and allow him to make it because this is something which concerns me deeply.  As Deputy O'Malley has said, this party will not oppose in any way the extension the Minister is looking for because we understand what he has to deal with. As has been stated by the Leader of this party, any time the present Government need extra legislation to strengthen their hand to deal with these people, particularly those referred to in the Prisons Bill, this party will behave and react in a most responsible manner.  We understand, through long years in office the kind of problems the Minister is facing.</P>

      <P>Deputy Briscoe, with some sympathy for me, referred to Deputy O'Malley's hard-hitting speech.  Let me put Deputy Briscoe's anxiety very quickly at ease.  Deputy O'Malley's and Deputy Andrew's punches are powder puff and I am not in the least wounded by them.  He also mentioned I had the advantage of having this debate in the context of a different type of Opposition from the one which was here when the original measure was passed in 1972.  He reminded us that the then Opposition were outraged.</P>
      <P>I think that is an excessive term to describe our attitude then but even if it were not excessive I confess that as a Minister I would prefer to be confronted by an outraged Opposition than an Opposition as exemplified, not by Deputy Briscoe but by Deputies Andrews and O'Malley, a sanctimonious Opposition.  The burden of each of their speeches was a long list of selective quotations from the debate of 1972, selective quotations which had to be taken out of context because we did not want to be bored by having to listen to the entire speech.  These quotations were presented to the House without any attempt to amplify or explain the context in which they were made.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In 1972 I was unhappy about this <Col N="1892" /> Bill.  I readily conceded to the then Minister, and the record bears this out, that he had to get this Bill, that it was necessary in the national interest but I did question the type of Government then being offered which had led to much of the situation which at that time made the Bill necessary.  I criticised the then Minister for, as I said, allowing the situation to be brought to its knees. I said the responsibility for any such result must rest on the Executive.  The Deputies I mentioned attempted to turn those words against me in the context of the escapes which took place from Mountjoy and say that because of those escapes I should apply those words to myself.  But I would draw a very clear distinction between the situation in which State security, of which the prison system is the corner stone, was literally on its knees with its major prison in ruins.  As Deputy O'Malley said when he inspected it that he did not think that human beings could inflict so much damage on a building.  That was the situation I was criticising the Executive for having allowed to come about.  That is not comparable to a number of prisoners escaping.</P>
    <P>I called for an inquiry then and when the Deputy quoted my call for an inquiry he said that an inquiry had been refused into these other escapes during my time of office.  I want to correct the record in that regard.  An inquiry was held and I gave the result in this House in reply to a question from Deputy Andrews before the recess, as far as I recall. No inquiry was held in 1972 following the riot when that prison was literally wrecked and equipment to the value&mdash;I think Deputy O'Malley said&mdash;of £6,000 in the dental surgery was turned into scrap.  No inquiry was held then and that situation was completely and fortunately&mdash;and I touch wood at this stage&mdash;completely unique.  I hope I shall never be faced with such a situation but as far as I can I have taken measures to ensure such a situation will not recur.</P>
    <P>When I came into office one of the most troublesome facts of the task facing me was connected with our <Col N="1893" /> prisons.  There was serious unrest there.  Agitation was a daily occurrence. Protests, marches and, indeed, assaults were common.  The prisons were the subject of much unfavourable comment from the media and people interested in social work generally. In addition, there was a number of subversive prisoners in Mountjoy Jail and a number also in the Curragh.  I decided as a matter of urgency that if good order were to be restored to the prisons and if rehabilitative processes were to have any chance of being carried out, it was necessary to have segregation of prisoners.  As a result of that decision certain subersive criminals were transferred to Portlaoise and Mountjoy was given over entirely to what I might describe as ordinary type of prisoners.</P>
    <P>In order to maintain this segregation in Portlaoise it was necessary to transfer to the Curragh a certain small number of prisoners who could not be accommodated in Portlaoise with the particular brand of subversive we sent there and whose presence in Mountjoy would be actually disruptive. Accordingly, these people were sent to the Curragh.  I have come to the House this evening to ask for its consent to accommodating those people in the Curragh for a longer period, perhaps as long as three years. I do not gladly ask for this consent; it is forced on me because, notwithstanding the good work Deputy O'Malley did in his term in regard to improving the prisons and arranging for new prisons accommodation, there was one glaring defect in the prison system, and I have to accept responsibility for it, and that was the complete lack of a high security unit to deal with disruptive and difficult prisoners.</P>
    <P>Such a unit is essential in any prison system so that prisoners who tend to cause trouble with other prisoners and with the staff and whose one ambition is to disrupt the system should be capable of being segregated in a place of high security.  It is not enough to put them into a wing of one of our prisons.  They must have a special place of their own.  I regret <Col N="1894" /> to say that when I took office there was no such place available and no plans had been prepared for it.  Those plans have now been considered and preliminary steps to implement them have been taken.  It is my intention to see built at Portlaoise a high security unit which will take the prisoners now detained in the Curragh.</P>
    <P>It is not possible because of the demands for segregation and the need for it so that good order can be maintained to have these prisoners anywhere but by themselves.  The only place where they can literally be by themselves and be secure is in the Curragh. This is why I have to come to the House this evening and ask for an extension of the 1972 Act for up to three years because it will take up to three years to complete the design and building of this type of security unit.</P>
    <P>Designing and building a prison is much more tedious, more difficult and slower than designing and building any other type of complex.  The design must be particular to the most minute detail and when it is intended to place this building within the confines of an existing prison the work can only go on in very carefully prepared stages so that security at that prison is not prejudiced or breached during the building operation.  That is why I think a limit of three years is realistic.  I could have said another year and see how we would be fixed then but the problem posed by the prisoners in the Curragh will not be solved until such time as we have a purpose-built, high security unit capable of housing them by themselves.  I cannot see that being completed inside three years.  If this glaring and obvious omission in our prison system had been tackled during the time Deputy O'Malley and his predecessors were in charge of this Department we might not now be in this position.</P>
    <P>I make no apology for asking the House to do something which is not my fault, nor do I see anything wrong or inconsistent in asking the House to give an extension for good and valid reasons for something that I conceded when it was first asked by the then Minister in 1972.  We had observations <Col N="1895" /> about it and they were not unnatural in that field of security, in that whole area of the Government's attitude to subversives, and it was essentially a subversive problem that was presented to us in that debate.  It was not unnatural following the dramatic and traumatic effects of the arms trial and all that went with it and followed it that we in the then Opposition would have had some question marks or doubts in our minds about that whole area.  I make no apology for the stand I took in that debate and I make no apology for any Member on this side of the House for the stand he took in that debate in accordance with his conscience.</P>
    <P>Some questions were raised as to what precise accommodation is available in our prisons at present.  Deputies O'Malley and Andrews asked about the corrective training unit. This unit, which will have accommodation for 100 prisoners, will be ready this summer.  It is not the intention to transfer 100 prisoners immediately into it.  It will have to be worked up to its full complement in terms of prisoners and staff because it is going to be a rather special place. It is going to be a very advanced place and I am determined to ensure that it will be successful.  The best way to ensure this is to get the right atmosphere and the right spirit in it from the word go.  This can best be done by proceeding gradually into it.</P>
    <P>Arbour Hill will be ready by the end of this year but, essentially, this prison will not be able to provide the high degree of security which I indicated this particularly troublesome type of prisoner needs.  Arbour Hill will be suitable as a remand prison and essentially this is how it is intended to use it.  In that use it will have the effect of enabling more space to be made available in Mountjoy.  However, this space in Mountjoy cannot be used for these particular prisoners because Mountjoy would not provide the segregation and separation that is necessary with these prisoners.  Furthermore, if there is any vacant space in Mountjoy I am anxious to see that it is used for the purpose of reconstructing <Col N="1896" /> some of the old Victorian wings to bring them into the type of physical accommodation consonant with 20th century penology.  That can only be done when prisoners are out of it and I hope that can be achieved via the extra space to be provided by the corrective training unit and Arbour Hill.</P>
    <P>Neither the corrective training unit nor Arbour Hill can of themselves solve the problem which is posed by the prisoners in the Curragh.  That problem can only be solved by a high security unit, specially built as such, ensuring security and complete segregation. That was neglected in the past and we now have to pay the price for that.</P>
    <P>I was asked about the women's prison.  The women's prison is going to proceed at the site at Kilbarrack. I have given a public undertaking about that, notwithstanding some opposition from the far side, slightly muted but nevertheless there, about looking again at the site.  We are going ahead with this site at Kilbarrack. Plans for this prison have had to be revised and this will interest Deputy Briscoe.  The original plan entailed having both a complex for adult and young female offenders but it has now been decided to have it for adults only and a smaller complex will be necessary.  The Department of Education will take responsibility for the younger female offenders.  Likewise it is their responsibility to look after young male offenders.  This question of divided responsibility is one of the things that bedevilled children and the law for years.  That is being looked at by an inter-departmental committee to try and end this separation of responsibility and ensure that the present situation, which I regret as much as Deputy Briscoe, of having unruly youths at large can be ended.</P>
    <P>At the moment the residential schools and the residential homes and special schools which have been conducted by the religious are conducted on a volunteer basis.  This gives them the right, regrettably to refuse to have unruly boys.  Granted they have good reasons for not wanting them mix within their schools but nevertheless, <Col N="1897" /> the State is left in the position of not having any way of dealing with these boys at the moment.  This is being examined as a matter of urgency.</P>
    <P>I should like to add that £¾ million has been approved for the women's prison.  The reduction in numbers will be from 120 to a maximum of 60 and the plans are being adjusted to take account of this difference.  We are going to insist that it proceed as planned at the site at Kilbarrack.</P>
    <P>In Limerick prison there is not sufficient space to deal with any significant number of prisoners.  In any event Limerick, like the other prisons, would not afford the degree of segregation necessary for the prisoners in the Curragh.  Cork is in the throes of being rebuilt and for reasons of segregation and for reasons of security&mdash;it is not a secure prison&mdash;it could not accommodate these particular prisoners.  Shelton Abbey is an open prison and cannot come into the reckoning at all.  There are vacant space cells in Portlaoise but, regrettably, having regard to the difficult times in which we are living we have to have spare accommodation there.</P>
    <P>That is the position regarding the availability of accommodation to contain these high-security prisoners.  It gets back to the one essential fact: the failure of my predecessor and his predecessor to provide a high security unit.  To come in and chastise me because I have to ask for an extension of time because of their failure is, to say the least of it, sanctimonious. As I have said earlier, I would have preferred an outraged Opposition, similar to what Deputy O'Malley felt he had two years ago, to what I felt was a sanctimonious Opposition the burden of which was to use quotations of debates two years old and to wallow in a sense of selfjustification. However I do not deny Deputies O'Malley and Andrews their moment of enjoyment if it gave them enjoyment.  Deputy Briscoe described it as hard-hitting but I describe it as powder-puff stuff.  It takes no effect.</P>
    <P>I am grateful to Deputy Andrews for agreeing that this Bill would be taken at this stage.  I regret that the <Col N="1898" /> notice is short.  I had to explore, in some details, alternatives to see if what is essentially a distasteful procedure could be avoided, that is the putting into military custody of civilians. I do not say that in any way derogatory of the standard of care which is afforded by the military to these people.  They are being well looked after in the Curragh and we owe a lot of gratitude to the officers and men of the Military Police Corps for their dedication.  Education facilities are being provided and to some extent this prison is ahead of some of our other adult prisons in this regard.  Increased recreational facilities and amenities have also been provided and the regime is run in as humane a way as possible.</P>
    <P>Nevertheless it is contrary to all theories of penology that civilian prisoners should be accommodated there because the amount of rehabilitative work that can be done is limited because of the very environment itself.  What can be done by way of education is being done and it is being kept under review to see how it can be expanded.  Nevertheless it is distasteful and it is essentially objectionable. This was the core of our opposition when this matter was first debated.  It was not opposition in the sense of seeking to refuse the Government the Bill which they needed urgently but opposition to the principle conceding that expediency demanded that it be passed.  I still maintain the view that it is regrettable that we have these people there.  It is regrettable but unavoidable, and so long as it is I make no apology for asking the House to give me this Bill I am grateful to Deputy Andrews for his attitude to it.</P>
    <P>As I say, I am grateful to Deputy Andrews.  The only point I would like to make with regard to his attitude&mdash;it was adopted by Deputy O'Malley also, though I do not know if he actually meant it&mdash;is that it sounded to me as if I was being told that whether or not I got this Bill depended on how I replied to this Second Reading debate: in other words, if I were a good boy, and spoke nicely, and praised the Opposition, <Col N="1899" /> and did not point out the flaws in their arguments, I might get what I was looking for; I go so far as to hope that that was not what was meant.</P>
    <P>Deputy O'Malley made the point that the reason for the Act in 1972 was because there was no accommodation as a result of the destruction caused by the riot.  He indicated also that there were other reasons why he had to come to the House and those reasons were precisely the same reasons that I have given the House, namely, the presence within the prisons of a disruptive body of prisoners capable of doing serious harm to the entire prison system.  At column 78 in the debate on 23rd May, 1972, Deputy O'Malley said:</P>
    <P>Moreover, and I regret having to say this, there are people in our prisons today who are prepared to go very far indeed to disrupt prison administration even at the cost of risking or causing serious injury or even death to prison officers and to other prisoners.</P>
    <P>Again, just to show that it was not altogether a question of accommodation that forced the introduction of this Bill at that time, at column 81 he said he was asking the House to give him authority &ldquo;to transfer to military custody certain prisoners who are liable to cause trouble&rdquo;.  These quotations show that the problem I am faced with now is not a new problem. Deputy O'Malley was aware of it.  The fact that I had to ask for a three-years' extension is due to the fact that, while Deputy O'Malley was aware of it, he did nothing about it. He did other good work in the prisons, but that was one area, I am sorry to have to say it, he neglected.  I should, I think, quote his exact words. One would imagine from the quotations he took such pleasure in giving to us here this evening and his powder puff punches&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>My quotation is a continuation.  The burden of Deputy O'Malley's speech was that he had to have this Bill because of lack of accommodation.  In addition to that, as he made very clear in the debate, he also had to have the Bill because of the presence of these disruptive prisoners with whom I now have to deal and for whom no provision was made.  I propose to make that provision.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Listening to Deputy O'Malley and Deputy Andrews, one would think that the tone of the Opposition in that debate in 1972 and the general burden of all the speeches was one of unmitigated obstruction, antagonism and attack.  Yet, after that debate, <Col N="1901" /> Deputy O'Malley was able to conclude with the following words, and I quote from column 362 of Volume 261, 24th May, 1972:</P>
    <P>I would like to thank the House for the co-operation and help that was given in the passing of this Bill.  I would like to thank in particular those Members who made a genuine attempt to come to grips with the problems connected with it and whose help has contributed to making the Bill a better one than it would be otherwise.</P>
    <P>One of the ways in which it was improved was by putting a time limit into it and I was one of the people who asked for a time limit and I make no apology for that and I see nothing inconsistent in coming here this evening and asking for a time limit, particularly as Deputy O'Malley himself in that same debate, at column 243, dealing with the context of the time limit and how the amendment might be worded, said:</P>
    <P>I throw this out as a suggestion to the House.  If it were found necessary to extend this emergency situation beyond that time a one section Bill could be introduced in the House at that time.</P>
    <P>This is precisely what I am doing.  The position is that this Bill is necessary for the safety of our prison system.  It is necessary to have prisoners continue in military custody because there is nowhere else of sufficiently high security or providing the degree of segregation necessary to contain these people.  It will take, I am advised, and I think it is a reasonable estimate, three years to provide such accommodation within the confines of a civil prison.  Were these people to be put back into a civil prison as of now I have no doubt that the disruption, the unrest, the protests, the general mess in which I found the prisons when I took over would be our fate very quickly again.  I am most anxious to avoid that situation now that we have got the prisons on to a more placid and more secure footing.  I am anxious that the reconstruction in Mountjoy and the reforms necessary in the regime in all our civil prisons can be fully and <Col N="1902" /> effectively carried out; in order to do that we must have peace in our prisons until such time as we can have segregation of prisoners.  I took over a situation in which it was not possible to have effective segregation within the civil prisons available and the only way at which we can get this effective segregation is to continue to use the Curragh for some time to come.  I hope it will not be as long as the period asked for in this Bill, but I think it is realistic and proper to put in a realistic end date.</P>
    <P>I do not think Deputy Andrews was here when I thanked him for facilitating me in taking the Bill at what I concede and admit to be short notice.  The short notice is due to the fact that we were investigating other possibilities, all of which proved fruitless; the time limit was close upon us and that is why we are forced to ask for the Bill quickly.  The principles of the Bill were, of course, fully debated in 1972. We are looking at them again in the context of 1974.  Let me say again that it is a principle I do not like&mdash;having to keep civilian prisoners in military custody.  It is contrary to the whole basic aim of penology, which is to rehabilitate and improve prisoners. This cannot be done in an unsuitable environment and essentially a military environment is unsuitable.</P>
    <P>I did not like the Bill in 1972. I still do not like the principle, but it is preferable to having ongoing riots, constant agitation and strikes day after day.  That was the state of the prison system when I assumed responsibility in this office.  Happily that state has gone and it is my earnest wish and hope that it will remain gone and that we can continue to improve the lot of all our prisoners and return them to society as good citizens.</P>

      <P>In his reply to the Second Stage the Minister mentioned the sanctimoniousness of the Opposition in relation to the Bill's passage through the House.  We deny this. We suggest the Minister is engaged in some form of triumphalism.  He accused Deputy O'Malley and his predecessors of glaring and obvious omissions in not setting in train plans for the erection of a high risk security prison.  When he was in Opposition, or indeed when any of his colleagues were in Opposition, as spokesmen for the Department of Justice, they never indicated their desire for a high security risk prison by way of normal methods&mdash;Parliamentary Questions.  The Minister accused his predecessors of not taking care of that glaring and obvious omission.</P>
      <P>This was never brought to the notice of the House until today.  I am speaking subject to correction. There was never a suggestion from the then Opposition that they desired the designing and building of a high security risk prison in Portlaoise. Deputy O'Malley is not here to reply to the pettiness of the Minister&mdash;I would not describe it as a charge. All improvements in relation to our prison system were begun by Deputy O'Malley, and after 14 months in office, the Minister comes in triumphantly announcing that there is a glaring and obvious omission in the lack of a high security risk prison for 30 individuals.  We reject this form of boastfulness.  On the Minister's own admission, Deputy O'Malley was a good and concerned Minister for Justice.  Despite the Minister's attempt to underrate Deputy O'Malley's performance, he enjoyed the highest respect of prison officers, the Garda Síochána and the others who came under his control.</P>

      <P>I am dealing with the section, which is to amend the 1972 Act.  This section is to continue until 31st May, 1977.  It is quite comprehensive. It deals with quite a lot <Col N="1904" /> of what I have been speaking about. I was making an important point.  We support the Minister in his plan for a high security risk section in Portlaoise, but the Minister came in and dragged it across the floor of the House and attempted in some fashion to breast-beat and say: &ldquo;Look at what I achieved&rdquo;.  With respect to the Minister, that is all he has achieved. He is telling us he will deliver a high security risk prison in three years &mdash;not today or next year or the following year but in 1977.</P>
      <P>In that context he comes into the House and bleats about his achievements. If that is his attitude he should have another look at it because comparing his performance with the record of Deputy O'Malley this falls into insignificance in the sphere of our prisons.  We have been a responsible Opposition and we will continue to be responsible.  We will give the Minister anything he will reasonably ask for.  We will scrutinise and examine anything he asks for reasonably.  This is not an occasion in which the Minister should try to underrate the contributions of the last Government and particularly of the then Minister for Justice, Deputy O'Malley, and the work he did.  History will judge him as a concerned and able Minister.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister told us he is offering no apology for any member of the then Opposition in 1972.  I did not expect the Minister to offer any apology for those who assumed the attitude they did at that time and who finally voted against the Bill. Why should he?  We exonerate the Minister.  One Deputy to my knowledge, having supported the principle of the 1972 Bill on the Second Stage, did not bother to contribute on the Committee and Final Stages and he did not bother to vote for it.  Six or seven Labour Deputies voted against it.  It is understandable that the Minister would not apologise to the House for them.  They should have come in here and given their own explanations on this Bill, but they have not even the courtesy to be in the House. If the Minister wishes to exonerate or excuse them on the grounds of conscience, I think he would be absolutely <Col N="1905" /> wrong.  It is not a matter of conscience at all; it was a matter of political expendiency then and is a matter of political expediency now that they are not present.</P>

      <P>The Minister now looks for an extension of three years to the 1972 Bill.  He says the reason for that is that the plans for the high risk security section of Portlaoise prison will take three years to complete. But, listening to the Minister's contribution on this, one would imagine that he had the actual section built.  Without giving away security matters I know he and we have a function in that respect&mdash;can the Minister say why; I do not want to press him too hard, and if he replies that it is a matter of security that will be good enough for me.  I think he has a duty to the House to explain why&mdash;and I do not pretend to be a builder or a designer; I would have to rely on the Minister in this respect and I am sure he does not pretend to be a designer or builder either like myself&mdash;it will take three years to build a section in a prison to house 30 persons.  I understand that, within the prison complex, the building of any unit would cause certain security risks by virtue of the presence of building material, machinery, nonprison personnel and so on.  One can understand that.  But taking all that into account can the Minister tell us why the section will take three years to complete?  Is it not a fact that the design is only at the design-board stage, that it is down on paper only <Col N="1906" /> or maybe even beginning to be put down on paper?  Can the Minister say whether, if the building is not completed in three years, he will come in then&mdash;on the assumption that he would still be the Minister for Justice; there is always the possibility that he would not&mdash;and ask for an extension to this Bill?</P>
      <P>These are just some matters on which I would seek clarification without being abrasive about it.  It is not my intention to cause difficulties or trouble, quite the contrary.  Nevertheless in the matter of prison security the Minister has said that, since he came into office as Minister for Justice suddenly there has been harmony in the prison system.  Of course two incidents leap to mind immediately and to which the Minister did not advert on this Bill.  Perhaps they are not applicable but it is as well to remind the Minister that a certain person by the name of Littlejohn has not been recovered.</P>

      <P>I should like to ask a question about the need for three years to build a high security prison.  One of the comments made by the Minister in his Second Reading reply and on which I would ask him to elaborate, referred to young people.  When I spoke about the need for a high security unit for what I described as psychopath youngsters who get into trouble, who need that extra care and attention, the Minister described them as &ldquo;unruly people&rdquo;.  They are not unruly; they are people in dreadful need of proper medical attention.  The Minister accused us in Fianna Fáil of not doing our duty by not building a high security prison.  At least I am on the record as urging on the Minister for the need for a high security unit for the type of young person about whom I speak, persons of 14, 15 and 16 years of age.  There is a great need; they are not just unruly.</P>

      <P>&mdash;&mdash;that 1977 was too long.  As I indicated in my reply, we decided to ask for an extension of three years as this would be a realistic time in which to plan, construct and arrange for the occupation of a high security unit.  Hopefully it will be done sooner, but I would expect that three years would be the outside and that is why the date of 31st May, 1977, is the one inserted in the Bill. Again, as I indicated, planning, designing and building a high security prison carries problems not associated with the building of any other type of complex.  The briefing that has to be done for an architect to enable him draw plans suitable for a high security prison has to be of the most minute kind.  He has to go into such details as the type of clasp on a window.  He has to go into minute details so that he designs a building which, as I say, is one of high security.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>These problems are compounded in this case because we are dealing with an especially difficult class of prisoner. Immense care must be taken.  The briefing for an architect must go into unusual detail.  The type of detail which is gone into in this case is something which would normally be left to the architect's own knowledge.  Because of the specialised requirements of a prison&mdash;and of a high security prison &mdash;these details have to be spelt out <Col N="1909" /> to the Nth degree.  This is necessarily a slow process.</P>
    <P>The building has to be to an extremely high standard.  It has to be secure.  As this building is being erected within the confines of Portlaoise prison certain security procedures will have to be kept in operation.  These, too, will tend to slow up the procedure.  This is why a conservative date of May, 1977, has been inserted in the Bill.  It would be my ambition to see the building completed substantially before that date is reached.</P>

I was in the difficult position that while the indications were that the Bill would go through one never knows how a debate will develop.  I would not like to see a repetition of what happened here recently when the Seanad was summoned but the Bill was not ready for it.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dowling</NameTxt>
      <P>Moving this amendment I referred to the fact that section 9 (c) has been debated in the House for quite a considerable period.  It is an area of discrimination against male and female workers.  We feel that as a result of this discrimination, and because no effort has been made by the Minister to ensure that this area would be sealed off so that discrimination could not take place, there must be a change in the wording of the Bill as indicated by the amendment.  It is a very responsible amendment.  If we are to take the long form of the title of the Bill it is:</P>
      <P>An Act to ensure equal treatment, in relation to certain terms and conditions of employment, between men and women employed on like work.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This would give way to the change which we demand in the sub-title in section 13.  We have discussed section 9 (c) fully.  We have clearly indicated to the Minister, who has agreed that there is discrimination in this section, that if a Bill is to be termed an anti-discrimination Bill we want to ensure that it is, in fact, an anti-discrimination Bill.  The Minister did not see fit to embody in the Bill wording that would clearly indicate that if a person was dismissed and took his claim to a court and established his claim after it had been processed by the court that that worker was then entitled to equal pay.  If at that stage the Minister tells us it is unconstitutional to demand that the worker would be reinstated in his former position, surely there is an onus on us to protect the people who wish to avail of the legislation put through the House?  It is rather amazing to find that we would bring in a Bill which would leave the way open to employers to dismiss a person because of his claim where the court had found that person was justified in the pursuance of that claim, and yet at the same time the person would be victimised because he could not have his employment back.  For that reason, anti-discrimination <Col N="1911" /> is a contradiction in terms of what we have already discussed here today.  The section on the Conditions of Employment (Equal Pay) Act would be more appropriate for that reason alone.  The question of anti-discrimination must be complete and absolute.  It is not so in this case. I would ask the Minister to indicate why this particular term was used and why the Bill which is discriminatory in itself is called the Anti-Discrimination (Pay) Bill.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Lands (Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>, <i>Cavan</i>): In introducing this Bill the Minister recognised that there is and has been discrimination against women in the field of employment. The very introduction of this Bill recognises that fact and sets about remedying it.  When the Bill was first introduced it was entitled the Conditions of Employment (Equal Pay) Bill, 1973.  As I have said, the Minister in introducing the Bill recognised that there was discrimination against women in the field of employment. This Bill sets out to put an end to one aspect of this discrimination. The Minister decided to change the title of the Bill to its present title in order to make it clear that this was the first step on the road to removing discrimination against women in the field of employment generally.  That was the only reason that the title was changed.  The Minister dealt with this fully in his Second Reading speech and I do not think it is necessary for me to go over the whole field again.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Women are discriminated against in the field of employment opportunities, opportunities for promotion and recruitment for employment.  All these fields of discrimination and others will be dealt with in future measures introduced by the Minister. They will then be known as the Anti-Discrimination (Employment Opportunities) Bill, Anti-Discrimination (Promotion) Bill and so on.  It cannot seriously be suggested that there is anything sinister in the present title of the Bill or that the title in any way takes away from the job which the Bill has set out to do.  On the <Col N="1912" /> contrary, it is the beginning of a new series of Bills aimed at eliminating discrimination.  Deputy Dowling cannot be all that serious in the arguments he put forward or in his amendment. Having regard to the assurance I have given on behalf of the Minister that this is the first of a series of Bills to be introduced.  I am sure Deputy Dowling will see and appreciate the reason for changing the title of the Bill and will withdraw his amendment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMoore" hpid="Mr. Moore Mr. Moore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moore</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister stated that this is the first of a series of Bills to emancipate women.  This Bill may do far more harm than good.  On Second Stage and on Committee Stage we pointed out that in section 9 we had legislation which would encourage women to take action in order to get equal pay for equal work.  If a woman lost her case she could be dismissed by her employer and she would have no redress.  The point I am trying to make is that the State is setting out to liberate women; we are encouraging them to take certain steps to enable them to get their rights under this legislation, yet we are told that the State cannot guarantee that if an employer dismisses them, they will have redress under this Bill.  We asked the Minister to write in a guarantee that this would not happen to any man or women who took this action.  He told us that he cannot do this.  The best legal advice told him that this would be unconstitutional. I put it to the Minister that if there is any doubt about the constitutionality of this Bill he should include in it a paragraph or sentence setting out that one of the basic rights of an individual is the right to work. In an employer decides that that is unconstitutional let him go to the expense of taking this matter to the Supreme Court&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanMoore" hpid="Mr. Moore Mr. Moore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moore</NameTxt>
      <P>This is the whole point. The present title is misleading.  This <Col N="1913" /> Bill is full of discrimination against women.  Therefore, to call it an Anti-Discrimination Bill is a fallacy.  How can it be called an Anti-Discrimination Bill when a woman who decides to test her claim for equal pay, whether she wins or loses her case, will be dismissed?  Surely the greatest discrimination is when one is dismissed from one's employment.  Therefore, I support Deputy Dowling's amendment to change the title.</P>
      <P>The point I am trying to make is that the State is leading people to believe that they have certain rights and then saying that the State cannot guarantee those rights.  Why not put in the Bill that a person shall not be dismissed because she claims equal pay for equal work?  Then, if an employer decides that this is unconstitutional, I suggest that he goes to the expense of contesting this in the Supreme Court.  If the Supreme Court rules that this is repugnant to the Constitution, then I accept that.  Better still, let the State, being fair to all its citizens, submit the case to the Supreme Court and if it is found to be repugnant to the Constitution, then I will accept that.  I wish to show that the title of the Bill is wrong.  It will encourage unofficial strikes by people who will try to safeguard the interests of the worker who was dismissed from his or her employment. I support Deputy Dowling's amendment to change the title.</P>

      <P>
        <i>(Cavan):</i> Deputy Moore seeks to make the case that the title of the Bill is misleading. The Bill deals clearly with the question of discrimination in regard to payment and sets out to ensure that women will get equal pay for work of equal value.  Nothing could be clearer from the title than that it deals with discrimination with regard to pay only.  The title of the Bill is &ldquo;Anti-Discrimination (Pay) Bill, 1974&rdquo;.  Any man, woman or child reading that title will know that this Bill deals with pay and pay only. The Minister made that clear at all stages and in all contributions to the Bill.  Other Bills will be introduced later on.  I put it to the House that <Col N="1914" /> there is no substance whatever in the argument put forward by the Opposition Deputies seeking to prove that the title to the Bill is misleading.  I repeat that the Bill clearly says that it is an Anti-Discrimination (Pay) Bill and nothing else.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JosephDowling" hpid="Mr. Dowling Mr. Dowling">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dowling</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Minister for clearing up the situation.  It is clear to us from his statement that the Anti-Discrimination (Pay) Bill relates to pay only.  It does not matter whether a person is dismissed even though he has a valid claim; he makes it and the court adjudges that his claim is justifiable.  The Minister now tells us that it does not make any difference that the person, male or female, cannot assert the right to be reinstated in his or her former employment. We have here positive discrimination. We are told it would be unconstitutional to press the employer to take back a man or woman whose claim for equal pay had been justified in court.  As we said earlier, a person, possibly a breadwinner, could be singled out by the employer, because he made a claim for equal pay, and the employee would have no redress.</P>
      <P>The Minister tells us that this Bill relates only to pay, but the other consequences are important to us.  We want to ensure that the men and women who make a claim under this Bill and who believe they are entitled to make such a claim will not find as a result of this legislation that they will not be reinstated in their former position.  Surely it is discrimination to pass legislation through this House which ensures that an employer can dismiss a person on the basis of an equal pay claim and need not take him back.  This is a greater discrimination than any other discrimination the Minister may have covered in the Bill. As has been pointed out here today, it may impede people from making claims for equal pay under this legislation, in that they have to balance the fear of losing their employment against the additional remunaration to which they would be entitled under this legislation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This is one of the worst pieces of legislation, from the workers point of <Col N="1915" /> view, that has ever come before this House.  Unless the Minister is prepared to amend it to our satisfaction, we are not prepared to let the Bill go through. We indicated to the Minister today that we wanted an opportunity for our legal people to examine the constitutional aspect of the amendments we put before the House at an earlier stage in relation to discrimination.  We have got some advice and we shall be putting down amendments which we feel sure will not be unconstitutional and will compensate the worker for loss of employment.</P>
    <P>The Minister indicated today that there are other measures to protect the worker coming before the House. Surely the Minister should protect the worker in this Bill.  He might never bring in another measure.  The pressures of the time and so on might well mean that no other Bill would come before the House and that this Bill would be enacted and would discriminate against the people we hope to help.  As we pointed out. we are quite sure that was not in the Minister's mind in introducing this legislation, but here we have absolute discrimination against men and women in sections 9 and 10.</P>

We feel it would be unfair to allow a Bill to go through this House under which workers could be victimised by unscrupulous employers. A very serious situation has arisen in so far as an employer can dismiss a man for any reason, justifiable or unjustifiable, and it would be unconstitutional to ask that that man be <Col N="1916" /> reinstated because a section here protects an employer to this extent.</P>

It is unfair to ask the House to pass a Bill which is loaded in favour of an employer to discriminate against workers.</P>
      <P>The first Bill the Minister brought in was in 1973 and he called it the Conditions of Employment (Equal Pay) Bill, 1973.  Even if we changed the title, we know there would be discrimination in it, but we could deal with that on Report Stage.  I would point out that the long title to the Bill does not refer to anti-discrimination: it refers to the conditions of employment of men and women on like work, and surely it is consistent with the long title that our amendment should be accepted.  We would hope that the men and women who hope to gain advantage from the Bill would not gain it purely on the basis of two-, three- or six-months' remuneration at the expense of their jobs.</P>
      <P>We cannot accept this Bill in its present form.  As Deputy Moore and other speakers pointed out, the section indicates that while the claim may be a valid one, and the court upholds it, at the same time the employee concerned cannot be reinstated.  This is discrimination and the title of the Bill contradicts its provisions as indicated in section 13.</P>
