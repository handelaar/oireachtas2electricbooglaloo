        <i>(Cavan):</i> Negotiations for the voluntary purchase of some 89 acres of the property referred to had reached their final stages and arrangements were being made to take possession when the question of the exclusion of a small area was raised by the owner.  This matter has now been settled and it is expected that possession of the lands will pass to the Land Commission later this year.</P>

      <P>Does the Minister seriously suggest that the Land Commission have not yet acquired this holding?  Is he aware that in last May he informed me in this House that agreement had been reached on the purchase price and it was expected that possession would be obtained shortly?  Will he ask the Land Commission to fulfil their commitments to him?</P>

        <i>(Cavan):</i> What I told the Deputy on a previous occasion was correct.  Subsequently, the owner requested the Land Commission to permit him to retain another small portion of the land. Negotiations were reopened with a view to facilitating him in respect of this small portion.  This matter has now been resolved and the Land Commission will get possession this year.</P>

        <i>(Cavan):</i> I am aware of the position in regard to staffing in the Cork office of the Land Commission and I have already arranged for the early transfer to Cork of an additional inspector.  The needs of the office will be borne in mind when recruitment commences following the competition for Land Commission inspectors recently announced by the Civil Service Commission.</P>

        <i>(Cavan):</i> I find that the policy in the Land Commission is that they do not provide houses for workers.  This house was leased to the present tenant under a repairing lease for ten years at a low rent in 1954.  On the expiration of that lease in 1964, the tenant applied for and was granted a further lease for ten years.  Again, on the expiration of that lease this year apparently the tenant applied for and was granted a further extension.  It is part of the terms of the lease since 1954 that the tenant would be responsible for repairs.  Accordingly, it would not be possible for the Land Commission, for the Department of Lands, to make such facilities available.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Minister for Foreign Affairs (Dr. FitzGerald) Garret FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Foreign Affairs (Dr. FitzGerald)</NameTxt>
      <P>The Government and people of Ireland are unequivocally opposed to colonialism and emphatically reject the pretension of one people to dominate or subjugate another.</P>
      <P>Our own history, and the values to which we are committed, oblige us to take this and no other position. Consequently, in our international relations in general and in particular at the United Nations, Ireland has, over the years, consistently affirmed the right of colonial countries and peoples to self-determination and independence. And we support the right of the peoples of the territories under Portuguese domination in Africa&mdash;Angola, Mozambique, Guinea-Bissau and Cape Verde, to self-determination and independence, in accordance with the purposes and principles of the United Nations Charter.</P>
      <P>At the last UN General Assembly Ireland voted for Resolution 3113 (XXVIII) on the Portuguese territories and co-sponsored Resolution 3114 (XXVIII) which recommended the establishment of a United Nations commission of inquiry into the reported massacre at Wiriyamu in Mozambique.</P>
      <P>Virtually no member state of the United Nations, with the exception of South Africa and of Portugal herself, believes that it is in her interests to try to continue to maintain her rule in Africa; and this view is not without its adherents in Portugal as well.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="896" /> It is clear now and has been for some time that Portugal cannot nor should not hope to dominate these territories indefinitely or to fight an exhausting war of attrition that is militarily futile and morally indefensible.</P>
    <P>We hope, therefore, that Portugal will see the wisdom and justice of entering speedily into negotiations with the leaders of the independence movements in the African territories with a view to their early and peaceful accession to independence.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>At least my question has given the Minister an opportunity of making such a comprehensive reaffirmation of our policy. Has that view been conveyed recently directly to the Portuguese Government in view, particularly, of the dismissal of the former Governor and Commander-in-Chief of Guinea-Bissau, who, apparently, argued for self-determination and for that argument was in fact dismissed from his post as Deputy Chief of Staff?</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>While I appreciate that the Minister's position and the Government's position is quite clear and, as I say, is a reaffirmation of our consistent position, does the Minister not think in view of the importance of this and our own history as well it would be appropirate to convey that view directly to the Portuguese Government through diplomatic channels?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Dr. FitzGerald Dr. FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think so. I will think about it but I do not think so.  This view is merely confirmation of a view which has been established for a long time and was equally held by the previous Government.  I have affirmed it in the Uinted Nations and it was well known to Portugal.  I do not think there is any need to convey directly a particular view at this moment.</P>

      <P>The reply to the first part of the question is &ldquo;never&rdquo;. As regards (b), the position is that, strictly speaking, a veto has never been used by other member countries of the EEC.  That is to say, there has been no occasion when a matter was put to the vote in the Council and action was blocked as a result of one country registering a veto.

      <P>In that case&mdash;allow me to reply if you want the answer&mdash; strictly speaking the veto is not used in the sense that there is an actual vote but when it is clear that a country is not prepared to agree to something which it sees as being contrary to its vital interests the matter is not pursued, it is withdrawn or postponed.

      <P>asked the Minister for Foreign Affairs the views of the EEC Council of Ministers in relation to direct election to the European Parliament; the form of democratic representation he envisages for Ireland; and the general powers which will be granted to the Parliament.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>The EEC Council of Minister has not had to express any view in recent times about direct elections to the European Parliament. With regard to the remainder of the question I would refer the Deputy to my reply to Question No. 13, Dáil Debates of 20th February, 1974, on European union.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Crowley</NameTxt>
      <P>If the proportional representation that we have at the moment is reduced will the Minister then use his veto on such a scheme?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Dr. FitzGerald Dr. FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy is talk-of the the non-proportional representation we now enjoy, having 5 per cent of the representation with 1 per cent of the population.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FlorenceCrowley" hpid="Mr. Crowley Mr. Crowley">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Dr. FitzGerald Dr. FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>If there were a proposal which envisaged changing that and it did not contain compensating arrangements, for example, for a bicameral system with an Upper House with equal representation for states it would, of course, be unacceptable to us in this country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickPower" hpid="Mr. Power Mr. Power">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Power</NameTxt>
      <P>As the only view I have ever heard in this House was that a direct form of election would be best, does the Minister not agree that it might be better for us to act off our own bat rather than react to what others might do?  Let us go ahead and set up the machinery for this form of democratisation.  Would he not agree that direct elections would be better than the present system?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Dr. FitzGerald Dr. FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I think we would all like to see that.  There are technical difficulties, however, because the form of the wording of the Treaty of Rome is such that until there is unanimous agreement on direct elections by all <Col N="902" /> the countries the form of the representation must be such that those elected are members of the parliament of their own country.  Therefore, if we had direct election and people stood who were not Members of this House and were elected they could not take their place in the parliament.  That, unfortunately, is the wording of the Treaty of Rome and, therefore, we must, I think, put our main effort into seeking unanimous agreement on direct elections throughout Europe.</P>

    <Title>Health Services (Limited Eligibility) Regulations, 1974: Statement by Minister for Health.</Title>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanCorish" hpid="Minister for Health (Mr. Corish) Brendan Corish">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Health (Mr. Corish)</NameTxt>
      <P>As the House is aware, the Government decided last August to extend the present &ldquo;limited eligibility&rdquo; health services to the entire population from April 1st next.  This decision is intended to provide a free hospitalisation scheme for all.  Every member of the community, irrespective of income or type of employment would be entitled under the Government's scheme to the following health services:</P>
      <P>1.  Free hospital in-patient services</P>
      <P>2.  Free hospital out-patient services</P>
      <P>3.  Free maternity services</P>
      <P>4.  Free infant welfare services</P>
      <P>5.  Assistance towards the costs of drugs and medicines, so that from the commencement of the scheme no family would be required to pay more than £4 per month for drugs and medicines.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I belive that this scheme represents <Col N="909" /> a significant step forward in the creation of a socially just Ireland and is in fulfilment of the Government's commitment in their statement of intent to introduce a comprehensive system of social services in this country.</P>
    <P>This scheme of free hospitalisation for all members of our community was widely welcomed as a major social advance and as an important social innovation.  Among other things I was pleased to receive a statement from the Catholic Hierarchy's Council for Social Welfare to the effect that</P>
    <P>The Tanaiste's initiative in this area is welcomed by the Council and is in harmony with the recommendations of the Council's &ldquo;Statement on Social Policy&rdquo; which was released last November.</P>
    <P>It was welcomed for what it was&mdash; a significant re-ordering of the existing system of patchwork legislation where the quality of the medicine depended on the money in your pocket.</P>
    <P>It is the policy of this Government to provide free hospital services for all in public wards.  The policy is fully supported by the parties constituting the National Coalition and that policy will be implemented.</P>
    <P>I want to assure this House that it is my express determination as Minister for Health to help create an Ireland where the cost of being sick is not for anybody a cause of illness.  I want to assure this House that I will not be deflected from my decision&mdash; and the Government's decision&mdash;to bring in the new scheme.</P>
    <P>The House will recall that at present only insured manual workers, non-manual workers earning less than £1,600 per year and farmers with a valuation of £60 or less, are entitled to free hospital and maternity services. By extending these services in accordance with the Government's decision to the entire population, I estimate that over 300,000 extra persons will become eligible for these services for the first time.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="910" /> There were, and still are, those who did not approve of our scheme.  In fact Deputy O'Malley, the Opposition spokesman on Health, was quick off the mark the day the Government announced the scheme, to voice his party's opposition.  He evidently believes in a system of different standards for different income groups, although fortunately for the children of this country a distinguished member of his family did not believe that in respect of secondary education and I do not believe it in respect of medicine.</P>
    <P>I want to emphasise that in introducing free hospital and maternity services for all members of the community the Government were not eliminating private practice for consultants or forbidding patients to enter private or semi-private wards in a hospital but were giving every member of the community, without distinction, the option of free treatment and maintenance in a public ward, if so desired.</P>
    <P>I also want to emphasise that from the very beginning I wanted to implement my scheme with the co-operation and involvement of the consultants upon whom the hospital system ultimately depends.  I extended to them my trust and I asked for their help in bringing in the new services by April 1st.  My only desire was to improve the social conditions in our country by extending the hospital services.</P>
    <P>To my intense regret I have received neither the understanding nor the co-operation which I could have expected as Minister for Health charged with the responsibility of implementing a policy decided upon by the Government elected by this Parliament.</P>
    <P>Instead representatives of the medical consultants opposed the introduction of my scheme until such time as they decided the population should have free hospital and medical services. To some extent the fears of the consultants were understandable since a large proportion of their incomes comes from those to whom I intend to extend the benefits of my scheme.  They said they were concerned about where and how they were going to recoup themselves for a falling off of this source of income.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="911" /> I believed when the negotiations started with the consultants that they would be prepared to accept remuneration based on salary because they had indicated, in the context of existing services, that they favoured a contract system based on a salary with pension and other rights.</P>
    <P>It seemed to me that our negotiations on the new scheme would go on from there and would be concerned primarily with determining the compensation they were entitled to because of any losses in their private practice arising out of the Government's proposals.</P>
    <P>Unfortunately since negotiations began the consultants moved from the salary form of remuneration and introduced the idea of a system of payment for each item of service.</P>
    <P>They now wish to secure an option for every consultant, between a salary, on the one hand, and a fee per item on the other.  What the consultants are talking about is so much for one type of operation, so much for another and so on.  This fee per item option constituted a new and unexpected element in the negotiations.</P>
    <P>We have tried to persuade the consultants to drop this idea, because this type of payment could lead to bad medical organisation and it is very difficult to cost.  But the issue of the fee per item payment presents great difficulties and at a certain stage appeared to me that it could lead to prolonged and protracted negotiations.</P>
    <P>Since I could not resolve that matter quickly, I made an interim proposal to the consultants, which would protect their incomes, permit negotiations to continue and allow me to bring in the scheme on schedule.</P>
    <P>The proposal was that consultants would be paid on the present basis for patients who have an income under £2,500 per year and at voluntary health insurance rates for public patients earning in excess of this amount.  The terms of this interim proposal were to have applied until final agreement was reached with the consultants.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="912" /> The consultants rejected this proposal.</P>
    <P>I had, therefore, to consider other alternatives.  Clearly no new scheme can be worked if the consultants refuse to take part in it.  They have the freedom to refuse to work any scheme which they do not like, no matter how much the scheme might benefit the public at large.</P>
    <P>I wrote to the medical organisations representing the consultants and said that in view of their attitude I intended to introduce only those parts of the scheme which did not involve their participation or affect their incomes Those portions of the scheme which I referred to were: (a) free maintenance in public wards and (b) the drug subsidy scheme.  I also proposed to revise upwards the income limit for free hospitalisation so that the existing free services could be in part extended to some of those over the present limit of £1,600 per year.</P>
    <P>The consultants have also rejected this compromise reiterating that final agreement on rates and methods of remuneration for them must be made before any part of the scheme can come into effect.</P>
    <P>I am, therefore, faced with a very difficult choice.  I can either postpone the entire scheme for free hospitalisation until final agreement is reached with the consultants, or I can seek to implement those parts of the scheme which do not rely for their implementation on the co-operation of the consultants.</P>
    <P>In relation to the latter, I have to tell you that the consultants have, as indicated already, rejected any introduction of any part of the scheme, even those parts whose practical working does not depend on them, until their pay position, on a fee per item or salary option has been satisfactorily concluded from their point of view.</P>
    <P>I had to consider what would happen if I were to introduce on schedule even the modified scheme to which I have referred.</P>
    <P>As I have indicated to the House the consultants had said they would refuse to co-operate in implementing the scheme unless final agreement on salary and conditions were reached with them.  They repeatedly refused to <Col N="913" /> spell out what they meant by non-co-operation but to me this implied serious disruption of the existing services.</P>
    <P>Any Member of this House or of the public could read a report in Monday's <i>Irish Independent</i> to the effect that &ldquo;the doctors' negotiating body will refuse to co-operate, and that vital services, except for emergency cases, will be withdrawn in protest&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>If this is what the consultants have in mind, or if they propose to restrict admissions to hospitals, then human health and even life could be placed at risk.  I am not prepared to take such a risk.</P>
    <P>Deputies must all recall the very serious prospect that faced us when the junior hospital doctors were involved in a work to rule and I cannot allow the risk of a similar situation developing and, perhaps, actually occurring.</P>
    <P>For the public good I have decided to postpone the introduction of the free hospital scheme for a limited period in order to avoid any danger to human life and to avoid confrontation with the consultants on this occasion in the hope that they will reconsider their general attitude.</P>
    <P>In order to effect a settlement so that the free hospital scheme can come into operation as soon as possible, I propose to establish a body to look into the present systems and rates of payment and incomes of consultants and to make recommendations on the system or systems which should operate when the limits are abolished.  The findings of this independent body should help towards finally reaching a settlement which will allow the full implementation of the Government's scheme.</P>
    <P>Accordingly, it is not the Government's intention to move the motion dealing with the Health Services (Limited Eligibility) Regulations, 1974.</P>
    <P>There are some points arising in relation to liability from the 15p health contribution, voluntary health insurance cover and the scheme for drug subsidies which I have to consider <Col N="914" /> following on this decision and I intend to make a statement on these when introducing my Estimate tomorrow morning.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>I will come back to him in a few minutes.  The long statement which we have heard from the Minister for Health, an unusually long one in these circumstances, is remarkable for the fact that it devotes most of the nine pages to finding fault with other people because this scheme which was promised as long ago as last August is not, at this very late stage, being introduced on Monday next.  At no stage, according to this statement, can any scintilla of blame be attached to the Minister for Health.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I beg leave to quarrel with that reading of the situation.  I regard it as unfair that the sole blame for the fact that this scheme is not being introduced should be ascribed to the consultants.  The medical profession were faced with the situation last August in which they were called in at 3 o'clock one afternoon and were informed by the Minister for Health that one hour later he proposed to make an announcement.  That announcement would have had the effect, if implemented, of taking away approximately four-fifths of their income. Because a large segment of their income was to be taken away, I think the medical profession, or any <Col N="915" /> other group whatever, had the right to see that they did not lose financially by any proposals to be brought in by the Government and imposed on them without consultation.</P>
    <P>Therefore, I do not think it is fair to blame the medical profession for seeking negotiations in order that they would not lose financially by what was proposed.  As far as those negotiations are concerned, it should be borne in mind that even though I and others in this House, and many people outside the House, as long ago as last October, said to the Minister for Health that the necessary negotiations would be long and complex and that they should be begun immediately, they did not, in fact, begin until 10th January this year, which everybody felt was far too late to allow them to be brought to a successful conclusion by this week so that the scheme could be introduced next Monday.</P>
    <P>We have the situation that notwithstanding this difficulty having been pointed out to the Minister time and time again, 300,000 people were led to believe that they would get free hospitalisation as and from 1st April. The Voluntary Health Insurance Board circulated subscribers, and many private health schemes also got in touch with their members, to advise them that radical changes would be necessary in their cover as from Monday next.  They are now left in the situation that they are in a complete heap.  They do not know where they are.  The VHB must have an enormous administrative job on their hands as a result of this; the Revenue Commissioners had made detailed arrangements for the collection of the 15p per week as had the health boards in respect of the £7 per year contribution.  All that has now been changed suddenly and we are told this only four or five days before the scheme was due to be introduced.</P>
    <P>Reference was made by the Minister to the fact that when this scheme was announced last August I immediately expressed opposition to it on behalf of this party.  That is not an accurate statement.  What I said was <Col N="916" /> I and this party had reservations about the proposed scheme because it was only the best-off 10 per cent in the community who would benefit and that nothing was being done and there was to be no benefit at all for the less well-off people, notwithstanding the fact that taxpayers in general would have to pay for it.  The word &ldquo;taxpayers&rdquo; includes everybody in the country because even the man with the smallest old age pension pays an element of tax in almost all his expenditure.</P>
    <P>I and this party had reservations at that time that a scheme should be brought in that would help only the best-off in the community at a time when the health services were, by common agreement, not ideal for those who were not well off.  In the months that have ensued since I expressed those reservations they have been strengthened by what has happened in the meantime and I and this party have become convinced that the introduction of this scheme at this time is a misuse of priorities and that what we should be thinking about is not extending free hospital service to the best-off 10 per cent in the community but extending the choice of doctor scheme or the free medical card system to a far greater number of people.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>Those who are just above the medical card limit at the moment undoubtedly suffer great hardship because they have to pay their family doctors.  There would be fewer people in hospital at the moment, there would be need for fewer hospital places, if old people were able to avail of their family doctors more regularly and earlier.  The need for their ending up in hospital would be obviated.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Because the name of the late Donogh O'Malley was introduced into this statement of the Minister for Health, and since the implication in what was said is that Donogh O'Malley would not have approved of the line which I and this party took in relation to this <Col N="917" /> matter, it is no harm to point out a few facts.  In the comparatively short time the late Donogh O'Malley was Minister for Health, one of his principal achievements was the issue of a White Paper which led ultimately to the choice of doctor scheme which has been of tremendous benefit not to the richest 10 per cent but to the least well off 30 per cent&mdash;the people who had medical cards and who were compelled up to that time to operate under an archaic 19th century dispensary system, under which they had no choice as to which doctor they might go and they were herded into a particular segregated building.  The man who introduced that White Paper would take precisely the same point of view of this proposed scheme of the Minister for Health as I do.</P>
    <P>When free secondary education was introduced by the late Donogh O'Malley, it was not for the benefit of the children of the rich.  They already had it.  It was done for the people who to this day come to me to thank me on his behalf and they are the less well-off parents of children who otherwise would not have got secondary education. We should get our priorities right. I have no apologies for the reservations I expressed last August.  I have no apologies for the reservations which are now expressed in the amendments standing in my name on today's Order Paper.  In particular, I have no apology to offer that the best off 10 per cent of our people should not be helped at the expense of the poor and those who are badly off.</P>

I noticed from this morning's newspapers that it did take place and presumably the Minister presented the Press with copies.  A copy of this book was, by courtesy, sent to the Chief Whip of my party yesterday.  Today 24 hours after the Press conference, not one copy has been distributed to the Members of this House.

      <P>Last night before reporting progress I attempted to make the case of the justice and the desirability of Deputy Molloy's amendments.  We discussed these amendments in relation to part of the eastern seaboard and in particular we discussed that section of the amendment which related to the greater Dublin area.  The Minister in his proposals <Col N="921" /> attempts to give preference to this area by vastly increasing the number of Deputies to represent the people of Dublin.  Deputy Molloy's proposals, using the same criteria as the Minister, attempted to show that the people of the greater Dublin area &mdash;Dublin County, Dún Laoghaire and the city area&mdash;can get fair representation without interfering with the rights of the electorate in the country areas, particularly on the western seaboard where the Minister is reducing the number of representatives. The Minister's proposals are specifically designed so that the number of Members for each constituency will be uneven, so that there will be three seats in the various consituencies. The Minister contends that that is a fair use of the proportional representaion system, that in having an uneven number of seats in an area, PR is working to its fullest.  Deputy Molloy worked on the same theory when he set before the House his list of amendments, but the Minister has given no consideration to Deputy Molloy's amendments.  He has said: &ldquo;You can talk away until your time runs out, and then I am going to march my Deputies through the lobby, and every one of these amendments will be defeated.  My Bill will be passed no matter what Members on that side of the House say.&rdquo; The Minister is sitting there smugly waiting for the time to run out until he will use the guillotine be it today or tomorrow or Tuesday.</P>

The Minister, in his proposals, has gone chasing into parts of Kildare and also parts of Wicklow.  There is West County Dublin constituency which is merely a portion of County Dublin together with a large slice of County Kildare.  The Minister referred to Mid County Dublin which is a large slice of the city together with portion of the county and a large slice of Wicklow.  He describes it as Mid County Dublin despite the fact that there are three different areas involved, the city, the county, and county Wicklow.</P>

      <P>When we were discussing these amendments last night the Minister became annoyed with us. I can cast my mind back to not too very long ago when the Minister was on this side of the House, and I know that certainly if he found himself in the same predicament as we now find ourselves in, faced with a Bill whose only intention is to copperfasten the Government in power&mdash;in their eyes anyway&mdash;<i>ad infinitum</i>, he would react in exactly the same way as we are reacting. Therefore, I do not think he is being quite fair to us when he condemns us for doing what we consider is our parliamentary duty.  The Taoiseach let the cat out of the bag yesterday when he said: It is our first opportunity in 50 years&mdash;&mdash;</P>

However, we do find ourselves in a dilemma of not being able to discuss constituencies relevant to the amendment by drawing comparisons.

    <Speaker pid="FlorenceCrowley" hpid="Mr. Crowley Mr. Crowley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Crowley</NameTxt>
      <P>I think I am.  Otherwise, I do not think we can mention any constituency in isolation.  That would have a sort of melodeon effect; as one went on, one would be affecting every one of them.  However, the point I was trying to make was this: that in amendment No. 9, in Dublin South-East, how is it that so many fewer people are required to elect a Deputy than are required to elect a Deputy in the west where a Deputy has to cover such an enormous area? I am sure the Minister will not accept any one of our amendments but nevertheless one always lives in hope.  I do not think he can say honestly that the 148 seats, as allocated, represent a fair allocation.  Taking into account the fact that any Minister for Local Government can never do a perfect job, nevertheless he has a certain ideal to which he should operate, especially when he and other members of the Government have so often expressed their concern for and their desire to better the lot of the people of the west. But the first opportunity that they have, they practically attempt to take away their representation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="926" /> Having said that, the amendments that we have down, Nos. 1, 8, 9, 12 and 20, are reasonable and the Minister, being a reasonable man, should consider their acceptance.  And, if he does not, let him give us cogent reasons&mdash;without flying off the handle &mdash;for not accepting them.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Mr. Molloy Mr. Molloy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>The only job we can do here is to offer fair criticism of the Minister's proposals and to illustrate a manner in which this job could have been carried out justly and, indeed, even logically.  The amendments under discussion, Nos. 1, 8, 9, 12 and 20, deal with the constituencies of Carlow-Kilkenny, Wicklow, Kildare and with all the Dublin constituencies, that is, in the county, in the borough and in Dún Laoghaire.  Generally speaking, there is not any great difference between the Minister's proposals and our amendments in the Carlow-Kilkenny, Wicklow and Kildare constituencies, especially in relation to the number of seats.  The Minister proposes a five-seat constituency in Carlow-Kilkenny: the amendment proposed by us also is for a five-seat constituency. The Minister proposes a three-seat in Wicklow and our amendment also is for a three-seat constituency. The Minister proposes a three-seat in Kildare; our amendment is for three seats also.  We have already shown the difference in our proposals in relation to Carlow-Kilkenny, Wicklow and Kildare.  We have shown where our amendments differ from the Minister's proposals but the overall number of seats to be allocated in each of those areas is not different.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Where we do differ substantially from the Minister's proposals is in relation to the number of seats he is allocating to the whole of the Dublin county area, including the borough and Dún Laoghaire.  At the moment there are 38 seats there.  Because of the increased population, the Minister has four new seats to distribute.  He is increasing the overall number of Deputies from 144 to 148.  In his Bill he has reduced the representation of the western area from 30 to 28.  That gives him another two seats to be distributed. Therefore, he has six to distributed <Col N="927" /> tribute.  We strongly criticise the Minister and the Government for deciding to allocate five out of those six seats to the Dublin area.  The sixth seat is allocated to the constituency of Meath. We disagree with that also.  We feel that the arguments we have made here are based on very reasonable grounds. During the course of this debate we have shown that there has not been equal treatment of all the citizens of this country in the manner in which this allocation has been done.  We have shown that the Minister has allowed a lesser number of persons per Deputy in the Dublin area than he chose when allocating seats to the western area.  We find it impossible to understand why any Minister&mdash;knowing the special difficulties and problems of the western area&mdash;should, in fact, decide to allocate representation in the House of Parliament on a basis where the urban area of Dublin requires fewer numbers of the population per Deputy than does the western area.  There is no logic in it and the Minister has made no effort to justify his action.  It is bald discrimination; discrimination of the very worst kind. As an Opposition party we have a strong obligation to highlight this discrimination. Therefore, our amendment proposes that the increases in population in the Dublin area would warrant the allocation of an additional three seats&mdash;not five as the Minister has done.  Our amendment proposes that there should be 41 seats in the Dublin area; an increase from 38 to 41.  The Minister's proposal is to increase it by five to 43.</P>
    <P>It is spurious on the part of the Minister or any member of his party to argue that the population changes oblige him to do what he has done. This is not so.  In the course of the debate we have shown that there is no basis on which he could substantiate that statement.  The Minister has, in fact, acted in a discriminatory fashion.</P>
    <P>To give some comparisons in an effort to illustrate what the Minister has done, I should like to take some of the constituencies under discussion and show the devious method the Minister has used to give over-representation to the Dublin population.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="928" /> I do not want to delay the House by going through all the constituencies but I shall take some of them.  If we start with the constituency of Dublin (Cabra), the Minister's Bill proposes that that be a three-seat constituency. Our amendment also proposes a three-seat constituency there.  Our amendments are designed specifically to show the country and the Minister &mdash;were he to take heed&mdash;that it was possible, on a fair basis, to allocate three seats there and still end up with 43 seats in the whole of the Dublin area.  He has allocated three seats in the Dublin (Cabra) constituency, including a total population, based on the 1971 census of 59,314 persons.  The amendment proposed by the Fianna Fáil Party proposes a three-seat constituency in about the same area but it would include a total population of 61,450.  The Minister's proposal would show an average of 19,771 people per Member, that is 352 below the national average.  Our amendment shows a population of 20,471 per Member, which is 348 above the national average.  The Minister has been going below the national average in the Dublin area and our amendments have gone slightly over it.  In that way we have shown that the Minister has used that devious method to grant additional seats to the Dublin area and has thus discriminated against the west.</P>
    <P>The next one here is Dublin (Clontarf), which is a three-seat constituency. This would cover a population of 58,592 people.  There is no constituency of the same name in our proposal.  The nearest one to it is North-Central.  Perhaps it would be easier to make comparisons if I chose constituencies with exactly the same titles and which cover the same areas.</P>
    <P>The constituency of Dublin South-East is a three-seat constituency.  We have a proposal for a three-seat constituency for that area.  In the Minister's proposal this constituency covers a population of 57,875 which gives an average of 19,292 per Member, which is 831 below the national <Col N="929" /> average.  Our proposal for this constituency is that it be a three-seat constituency to cover a population per the 1971 census, of 62,846, an average of 20,948, which is 825 above the national average.</P>
    <P>There are several other constituencies in the Dublin area I could quote but I do not wish to take up the time of the House.  We wish to ensure all of these areas are debated in the House and we deplore the threat of guillotine.  We will not be inhibited by it.  We feel we have made our point cogently.  We appeal to the Minister to reconsider the disastrous decision he has made in the Bill.  We appeal to him at least to be honest with the House.  We ask him to give some explanation as to how he can justify the fact that it requires more people in the western area to elect a Deputy than it does in the Dublin area.  Dublin did not seek that advantage.</P>
    <P>In the explanatory memorandum the constituency of Kildare is included in a group which the Minister calls North Leinster, including Cavan and Monaghan which are in Ulster.  There are five constituencies in that group, as mentioned in the explanatory memorandum, electing 20 Deputies.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DenisJones" hpid="An Leas-Cheann Comhairle Denis Francis Jones">

      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>Kildare is under discussion. The Minister's explanatory memorandum refers to North Leinster as an area and within that is the constituency of Kildare, which is under discussion.  Kildare, with the other four constituencies the Minister has grouped under the title of North Leinster, elects 20 Deputies.  They are in the constituencies of Cavan, Louth, Meath, Kildare, Longford and Westmeath. Those 20 Deputies require an average per Deputy of 19,596, which is far below the national average.</P>

      <P>I want to make the <Col N="930" /> point that in that North Leinster area the average per Deputy is 19,596.  The Minister finally agrees with the figure which I gave on Second Stage, which he claimed was wrong.  He half-heartedly corrected his statement later.  He has now declared that my figure on that occasion was completely correct.  The Dublin area, which is grouped here, and which comes under all the amendments being discussed, elects 43 Deputies under the Minister's proposal.  The average per Deputy there is 20,142.  When we move to the western area, where there are 28 seats, the average is 20,509.  This is the highest average of the five groups the Minister chose to put together in the explanatory memorandum.</P>

Yesterday, during the course of the debate, he got up and talked, finished whatever he had to say and sat down but at no time did he give any explanation for his reasons for doing this.  He spoke about everything under the sun except the points we raised.  These proposals in relation to the constituencies of Carlow-Kilkenny, Wicklow, Kildare and in particular all of the Dublin areas, are totally discriminatory and cannot be justified.  We feel we have registered as far as we can our protest in this House against what the Minister has done.</P>

      <P>Unfortunately, without being repetitive, there is nothing to be added to what I said yesterday, last week and before that.  Deputy Molloy, Deputy Crowley and Deputy Burke have been repeating over and over again what was said previously. It is not possible to continue replying to these matters because it means I would be out of order in repeating statements which I made before.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Molloy has been building &ldquo;Aunt Sallies&rdquo; and has had great <Col N="931" /> fun knocking them down.  If he likes that sort of thing I would not try to prevent him as long as the Chair allows him to do it.  There are two points I should like to repeat and leave it at that.  The average for the Dublin area is 20,142 and the average for the rest of the country is 20,115. No amount of switching round of statistics will get away from that fact. One other fact is that when Fianna Fáil were drawing up the 1969 Bill they took three seats from the west and they could see nothing wrong with it.  The situation is that we have divided the constituencies fairly throughout the country and no amount of talking or criticism will change that fact.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Mr. Molloy Mr. Molloy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister will not get away with the figure he has just given.  The average per Deputy for the Dublin area is 20,142 for the 43 seats being allocated.  The average for the western area is 20,509.  The only way the Minister can change the average for the whole country outside Dublin is by including the area where his own constituency of Meath is, where the average is below the average in Dublin.  It is 19,596 in that constituency.</P>

The Minister is a very confused man at present and I can understand his out-bursts during this discussion.

    <Speaker pid="JosephDowling" hpid="Mr. Dowling Mr. Dowling">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dowling</NameTxt>
      <P>I am referring to amendment No. 9, to Dublin.  Why did the Minister in one instance choose three seats and in another five seats for almost identical areas, one relating to the Dublin City Council and the other to the Dáil constituencies? Why did he choose three seats for the Dublin constituencies?  It does not make much difference to me whether it is three, four or five but the Minister is confused.  One day he sees a five-seater as advantageous, the next day it is a three-seater.  On the east coast there is Louth minus 974, Meath minus 895&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dowling</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister will read it in the Official Report.  The Minister probably feels that the east coast is a suitable breeding ground for his own party politicians but the people will have the opportunity, we hope at a very early stage, to answer the Minister.  I am sure that things will not work out in the way this confused Minister intends.  Who drew up the constituency revision?  What say did the Minister have in it?  Was it drawn up by his officials or by people outside this House?  We are led to believe, from the political gossip that we hear in the corridors of this House and elsewhere, that certain people outside this House did it.</P>

      <P>I am referring to the Dublin constituencies and I would like to know who advised the Minister and how did he arrive at this situation.  I understand that there was conniving behind the scenes and pressure on the Minister.  If the pressure on the Minister brought about the three-seaters, and if the Minister says so, we can take a sympathetic view of a very confused man.  On the other hand, if the Minister wants to accept full responsibility we will ask him to compare his action here with the five-seaters that he drew up for local authority representation.</P>

      <P>We asked the Minister to explain the reason for the three-seat constituencies in Dublin but he did not do this.  No effort was made by the Chair to force the Minister to answer the simple questions put by the Opposition in relation to the Dublin area.  The Minister has insulated himself in a four-seat constituency although he tells us that this is not the best kind of constituency, He agrees that the three-seaters or the five-seater are the best.  Perhaps the Minister would tell us why he selected that type of constituency in his own area if he considers that it is not the best.</P>

      <P>He should tell us if there were pressures put on him, if the revision of the constituencies was carried out by himself or if it was a case of giving it to the parliamentary draftsman who set out figures that were freely accepted by the Minister. I do not think that is so.  We had people here who boasted that the Dublin constituencies were drawn up by individuals outside this House and outside the Civil Service and then presented to the Minister.  If this is the case, we deplore the fact that pressure groups can dictate to a Minister who will not listen to the reasonable amendments put forward by Deputy Molloy.  The amendments were explained fully to the Minister but apparently he does not understand them despite the fact that Deputies Crowley, MacSharry and Burke explained in great detail the problems they see in relation to this lopsided revision, the discrimination, the jack-boot activities or whatever tag one might like to put on this revision.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is the duty of public representatives to make known their points of view with the object of ensuring that <Col N="936" /> the legislation is improved by the acceptance of amendments.

      <P>Deputy Dowling made just one comment in any way relevant to the matter under discussion and that was in regard to the number of seats allocated to a Dublin constituency. He asked how it had come about that in Dublin Corporation there were five seats given and only three in the Dáil for almost identical constituencies.  A five-year old child could answer that one.  It has been done because I wanted to give the same areas as far as possible and everyone, including Deputy Dowling's own backbenchers, said they were glad it had been done because it made things more convenient for them. They will henceforth be representing the same area in the corporation as they are in the Dáil.  If Deputy Dowling would just count he would realise what the position is.  He does not understand and he talks about people being confused.</P>

      <P>The House has already read the Minister's explanatory memorandum.  I asked him if he would facilitate the Opposition by circulating maps to illustrate the amendments which we proposed.  This was not granted.  Therefore, we are at a disadvantage in conveying to Members and to the public exactly what is behind our amendments.</P>
      <P>I am grateful to the House for giving me the opportunity of recording those figures and I intend to do the same with the other constituencies so that all our constituencies can be compared with the Minister's table. Any fair-minded person examining these figures at a later date will see that the Fianna Fáil amendments are based on a fairer basis than the Minister's. We have clearly illustrated the degree of discrimination against the west with which I am sure Deputy Donnellan in his heart does not agree. The people in the west find it very difficult to accept any person close to the Pale telling them they are not entitled to the same level of representation as the people living in any other part of the country.</P>

      <P>We have clearly illustrated the savage degree of discrimination which is evident in the Bill by showing that it requires almost 500 more people per Deputy in the area west of the Shannon than it does in the eastern area.  The level of discrimination is much greater when one examines this in relation to other areas.  In his explanatory memorandum the Minister has divided the country into five different groups of constituencies.  I have already shown to the House that the group which requires the greatest number of population per Member is the western group, and the group which requires the least number is the group in which the Minister's own constituency is located.  The deviation between those two groups is as much as 1,000.  In actual fact it takes 1,000 more in the west to elect a Deputy&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <P>Ba mhaith liom a fhiafraigh den Aire an bhfuil polasaí ar leith ag an Rialtas faoin Ghaeilge.  Is beag adúirt sé faoin Ghaeilge nuair a bhí sé ag caint inné; is mó a labhair sé faoin Ghaeltacht, agus, mar sin, ba mhaith linn a fhios a bheith againn cad tá i ndán don Ghaeilge ins na blianta atá romhainn.  Más é an tAire Poist agus Telegrafa a bheidh ag freagairt níl a fhios agam an mbeidh seisean ábalta meon an Rialtais a nochtadh fá dtaobh <Col N="948" /> de sin, ach ar a laghad beidh Aire na Gaeltachta ábalta a rá nach n-aontaíonn sé leis má abrann sé rud ar bith as an bealach.</P>
    <P>Is féidir a rá gur díol truaigh inniu an gná-shaoránach go bhfuil a dhearcadh féin aige ar an tsaol.  Na bun-phrionsabail a chreid sé iontu i gcónaí tá sé imníoch, neamh-chinnte fá dtaobh daofa mar gheall ar na h-ionsaithe cliste atá á ndéanamh orthu ag grúpaí éagsúla daoine, a bheireann liobarálaí orthu féin.  Is eagal liom go bhfaigheann na grúpaí seo i bhfad níos mó tacaíochta ó na meáin cumarsáide ná dream ar bith eile.  Tá na daoine seo an-chliste agus is féidir leo pointe a fhorbairt agus a chur chun tosaigh chomh maith sin go nglactar leis go ró-mhinic mar &ldquo;the in thing&rdquo;, mar adeirtear sa Bhéarla.  Ansin na daoine sin go bhfuil an dearcadh acu atá faoi ionsaí, cuirtear ar a gcosaint iad agus léirítear iad mar Choimeádaithe atá in éadan dul chun cinn sa saol.</P>
    <P>Leis an bhrú lochtach seo a thagair mé dó atá ar an ghná-dhuine, tá sé deacair air gan géilleadh agus dul leis an dtaoide.  Bealach éasca as a bheadh ann dó.  Ach ní bhfuarathas a dhath fiúntach ariamh de thairbhe géilleadh den chineál sin.  Daoine a chreid go láidir in a gcuid cúiseanna agus a sheas go daingean leo ba chuma cad iad na deacrachtaí, sin iad na daoine a d'fhág marc in a ndiaidh ar an saol.  Bhí mé ag léamh ar na mallaibh rud a scríobh Walter Lippman, an colúnaí clúiteach sin in Ameiricá, nuair adúirt sé:</P>
    <P>We should be ready to make sacrifices when we are tempted to be weak, and have the courage to say no when it would be a lot easier to say yes.</P>
    <P>Níl an oiread sin daoine ann inniu ag déanamh ionsaí oscailte ar an dteanga.  Tá módh oibre níos ealaí-onta acu.  Iarrann siad orainn an teanga a thréigint ar son cúiseanna a mbeadh bá an phobail leo, mar shampla&mdash;tá siad ag iarraidh a chur in a luí orainn go bhfuil gluaiseacht na Gaeilge in a bhac d'athaontú na tíre.  Ní feidhm domhsa a rá nach gcreidim seo.  Ach cuir i gcás go raibh sé fíor, an amhlaidh atá na daoine seo ag iarraidh orainn prionsabal <Col N="949" /> náisiúnta amháin a chaitheamh uainn ar mhaithe le ceann eile a bhaint amach?  Nach é an rud ciallmhar agus an rud ceart leanúint leis an aidhm fiú dá nglacadh sé níos fuide ceann cúrsa a shroisint?  Táthar ag iarraidh orainn géilleadh inár gcuid prionsabail agus dul sa seans go bhfaighimid an ní atá uainn in am níos goiride.  Ní dhéanann seo ach mearbhall a chur ar daoine.</P>
    <P>Tá sé doiligh sainmhíniú a thabhairt ar cad is cultúr ann.  Is dócha go bhfuil sé fíor a rá gurab ionann cultúr agus an dóigh a mhaireann muid agus a n-iompraíonn muid féin. Ach níl iomlán na fírinne ansin nó tá muid san dóigh in a bhfuil muid mar gheall ar an tógáil a fuair muid. Na neithe a gcreideann muid go láidir iontu agus an t-idéalachas atá ionainn is cinnte go bhfuair muid mór-chuid de sin ón á dtuismitheoirí agus tháinig sé anuas chuchu sin ónár sinnsir.  An t-idéalachas seo, an dóchas, an imní agus na mianta atá againn, rinneadh iad a nochtadh don chéad uair tríd an teanga Ghaeilge agus ní féidir a shéanadh go bhfuil tionchar anmhór ag an dteanga sin ar an dóigh a smaoitíonn muid agus a n-iompraíonn muid féin inniu.</P>
    <P>Caithfidh seo a bheith fíor nó má amharcann muid ar chuid de na cultúir atá sa domhan feicfidh muid go bhfuil difríochtaí eatorran agus difríochtí mhóra i gcásanna áirithe.  Tá seo amhlaidh mar gheall ar an dóigh ar leith a dtáinig forbairt orthu&mdash;níorbh ionann teanga daofa.  Mura bhfuil tionchur ag teanga ar fhorbairt cultúir, cén fáth nach aon chultúr mór amháin atá sa domhan inniu?</P>
    <P>Tá na náisiúin éagsúla bródúil as a gcultúr féin.  Tá siad bródúil as cé gur dóiche nach bhfuil siad i gcónaí ábalta sainmhiniú a thabhairt air, ach tuigeann siad gurb í an tsuimint í a thathaíonn le chéile iad mar theaghlach. agus a spreagann iad chun a dtréithe éagsúla a fhorbairt ar mhaithe leis an dteaghlach agus comhoibriú a dhéanamh le chéile chun a chinntiú go mairfidh an teaghlach; agus anso tá mé ag tagairt don náisiún mar a bheadh teaghlach ann.</P>
    <P>Mar adúirt mé, níl mé sásta le stáid na Gaeilge nó le stáid na Gaeltachta faoin Rialtas seo.  Níl mé ag rá nach <Col N="950" /> bhfuil an tAire dáiríre, ach ní fheicim caidé mar a thuig leis a dhath fiúnteach a dhéanamh i leith ceachtar den dá rud atá luaite agam fhad agus atá daoine san Rialtas ag lochtú agus ag déanamh beag dár cultúr agus den Ghaeilge.</P>
    <P>Mar adúirt mé, cháinim cuid mhaith agus an ceart agam, ach ag an am chéanna níl sé de dhith orm agus ní raibh sé riamh de dhith orm cnámh spáirne poilitíochta a dhéanamh den Ghaeilge.  Mar sin is féidir liom aontú leis an méid adúirt an tAire ag deireadh a ráitis nuair adúirt sé go dtiocfadh linn uilig cuidiú lena chéile an Ghaeilge a athbheochan.  Má támuid, ar an dtaobh seo den Tigh, sásta go bhfuil an Rialtas dáiríre fán Ghaeilge agus fán Ghaeltacht, gheobhaidh siad tacaíocht uainn agus beidh muidinne anseo i gcónaí ag faire orthu le cinntiú go ndéanfaidh siad beart de réir a mbriathar.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Posts and Telegraphs (Dr. Cruise-O'Brien)</NameTxt>
      <P>I rise in support of the motion by the Minister for the Gaeltacht:</P>
      <P>Go bhfuil Dáil Éireann ag aontú lena bhfuil fógraithe agus déanta ag an Rialtas le bliain anuas ar mhaithe le forbairt na Gaeltachta agus leas na Gaeilge.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Faulkner in his speech sought to suggest that there was a difference between what was &ldquo;fógraithe&rdquo; and what was &ldquo;déanta&rdquo;, what was proclaimed and what was done, and that the Government was not delivering beart de réir ár mbriathar.  I think the answer to that is contained in the speech of the Minister for the Gaeltacht which was a characteristically, practical, businesslike, down-to-earth one and which began by pointing out that the Estimate for the Gaeltacht had risen, under this Government, by almost 50 per cent, from £2,784,000 the year before we came in to £3,828,000 in 1973-74.  Well, that is beart de réir ár mbriathar.  In fact we did not have so many &ldquo;briathar&rdquo; about it but the &ldquo;beart&rdquo; is 50 per cent better and speakers have laid, and rightly laid, emphasis on the realism of the people of the Gaeltacht. I think they realise that fact and <Col N="951" /> all the &ldquo;holier than thou&rdquo; words that can be used on this subject cannot deflect their eye from that fact.  The Minister's speech&mdash;I shall not go over it, he made it very well himself&mdash; covered what was done and gave details about it.</P>
    <P>I think it is important to look at the present state of the Gaeltacht and at the more general position of the Irish language and the activities linked with its preservation.  Fianna Fáil have a motion before this House complaining of the inadequacies of the Government's policies in relation to the Gaeltacht and the Irish language.  The motion is in the name of an Teachta Séamus Ó Tonnaí, a Deputy for whom I have respect.  I recognise his sincerity in relation to the Irish language and I know of his valuable efforts to promote its use in public life.  He referred to me, I think&mdash;at the outset of his remarks yesterday&mdash; and wished to know whether I had come to the House to defy him in some way.  I did not come to defy him or even to interrupt him; I came to listen to him and, as usual, I learned a good deal to my advantage.  But he will forgive me if I say that motions like the one put down by him on behalf of his party represent the ultimate in Fianna Fáil policy towards the Irish language, preserving the Irish language by proclaiming it to be a fact.  This is the aspect of those policies about which some of us have complained.  We are not ashamed of complaining about that; we have no apology to make for it.</P>
    <P>Ten years ago, in January, 1964, the Commission for the Revival of the Irish Language proposed their final report and presented it to the Government. That commission, which had sat for five years, stressed again and again the necessity of active steps &ldquo;now&rdquo;&mdash; that was in January, 1964&mdash;to deal with the Gaeltacht problem.  A year later, in January, 1965, the then Government proposed a White Paper in which it said that it regarded the preservation and strengthening of the Gaeltacht as essential to the restoration of the Irish language. We had a large and great silence on the matter for the following four <Col N="952" /> years; no &ldquo;beart&rdquo; and not even many &ldquo;briathair&rdquo; during that period until 1969 when the Government appointed Comhairle na Gaeilge to advise them all over again as to the best steps to establish Irish as a general means of communication.  They, in turn, issued a series of reports culminating in two important documents <i>Gníomh don Ghaeltacht</i> presented to the Government in December, 1971, and <i>Implementing a Language Policy</i> presented to the then Government in April 1972.</P>
    <P>Up to the time they had left office in March, 1973, Fianna Fáil had done nothing to effect the recommendations made to them by successive boards and the important document, <i>Gníomh don Ghaeltacht</i>, lay before them for 15 months.  And they are now asking for &ldquo;beart do réir ar mbriathar&rdquo;.  In respect of this document it must be pointed out that it was a five year action programme for the Gaeltacht.  The writers of the report stated, and I quote:</P>
    <P>The urgency of the action and the fact that action would bring about change in the overall situation...</P>
    <P>Indeed, that was its purpose, leading us to concentrate on the immediate future and to concern ourselves mainly with the next five years.  Each and every report presented to the last Government urged them to take immediate action, and not without good reason. A staggering decline in the population of the Gaeltacht areas, on the one hand, and an unsuccessful programme for a realistic language policy in the Gaeltacht on the other were clearly visible to all.  Anything that the people of the Gaeltacht got from Fianna Fáil had to be wrung out of them and the last and highest was nearly 50 per cent less than now provided.  Indeed, their only positive contribution to the Gaeltacht in recent years was to close a school in the most precariously situated Gaeltacht.  I am not going to say much more about that because the Parliamentary Secretary, Deputy Begley, will be coming in later and has a better right to speak on that than have I and I want to hear him.</P>
    <P>It is against this record of the Opposition that the contribution of my colleague, the Minister for the Gaeltacht, must be judged.  He <Col N="953" /> announced yesterday, in a detailed manner, the Government's proposals for Údarás na Gaeltachta.  This will give the people of the Gaeltacht a unique opportunity to participate in the planning of their future.  It is an imaginative scheme in community development.  The Government believe that a realistic policy towards the Gaeltacht must be developed and the Minister for the Gaeltacht has spent the entire year investigating, at first hand, the condition of the various Irish speaking areas.  I do not know that any Minister for the Gaeltacht before him has spent so much time in the Gaeltacht, such a high proportion of his time during his period of office.  In order to familiarise himself with the problems, the Taoiseach also went to brief himself on industrial development in the Gaeltacht areas.</P>
    <P>Deputy Faulkner has&mdash;if I understood him correctly&mdash;suggested that I referred to the position of Irish in the Gaeltacht as a bog culture.  That is a characteristic distortion.  I did nothing of the kind.  I wish to set the record straight in that regard. What I said in Waterford&mdash;in referring to the differences between the people, say, in Dublin and Cork&mdash; was that I value these differences more than I do the kind of bog oak monolith that is often presented to us under the name of national culture.  It was not an attack on Irish or on Irish culture but on something which is often presented to us by politicians in that guise.</P>
    <P>Deputy Faulkner has said also, in the course of his remarks, that the Irish people do not regard me&mdash;the individual who addresses you&mdash;as one of themselves.  Well, that is true of a sizeable section of the Irish people. The Fianna Fáil Party do not regard me as one of themselves and they are damned well right.  I am not and I am not trying to be.  But I would remind Deputy Faulkner and any other Deputies there are here that I have as good a right to speak in this Assembly as any other Deputy&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>&mdash;&mdash;and it was not the Chinese who sent me here but the people of Dublin North-East.  I think anyone who suggests that a Deputy in this House is not one of the Irish people is insulting not merely the Deputy but, much more importantly, those who sent that Deputy here.  It is not much use pretending that the majority portion of the national culture is the Irish language when, in fact, that language is spoken as a community language only in certain western seaboard areas.  The report <i>Gníomh don Ghaeltacht&rdquo;</i> describes the linguistic situation in these areas thus, and I quote:</P>
      <P>The Gaeltacht areas are bilingual. But the degree to which Irish and English are used varies greatly.  In a few parishes only is Irish the language of all occasions or domains of life.  In many of the defined Gaeltacht areas Irish is used by a small number and in very few domains.  In nearly all areas English tends to be the language of commerce.  This is the reality of the Gaeltacht situation after all these years of athbheocaint na Gaeilge.  Who could accurately describe what is the situation outside the Gaeltacht.  We must have done with romantic dreams about the Irish language if we are to serve its interests at all and, in fact, if we are to grow up.  I, no more than any other Deputy, do not wish to see the death of the Irish language but there is nothing more certain than that if we fail to recognise the crisis situation pertaining to its very existence, we will kill it altogether.  It is not, in my opinion, adequate or even suitable to give the Irish language a status which it does not have while, at the same time, doing nothing about ensuring, by practical means, its survival. Even the great days of <i>The Irish Press</i> when it carried proudly on its masthead &ldquo;Do chun glóire Dé agus onóra na hÉireann&rdquo; have gone.  I believe that the Minister for the Gaeltacht has completed an extremely successful year's work.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would like to say something&mdash;as it has been touched on here&mdash;of my own criticisms in this area and to develop these a little in the limited time at my disposal.  I think what I <Col N="955" /> have to say is summed up mainly in a remark which was not one of mine but something said to me by a parent at a school meeting in my constituency. He asked me if I thought that it slowed up people's learning to have them half ashamed of themselves.  I said I thought it would have that effect.  He added: &ldquo;They did not&rdquo;&mdash; referring to his own schooldays, not so long ago as he was quite a young man&mdash;&ldquo;teach us Irish.  They taught us to be ashamed of ourselves for not knowing it.&rdquo; That is a terrible indictment of what the Irish language policy has represented in practice for many people, in particular, since I represent many of them, may I say for many working class people in Dublin city and in what are terribly known as educationally deprived areas in our cities and elsewhere.  That is what Irish has meant for them.</P>
    <P>Deputy Tunney, speaking out of his own practical experience as a teacher, dealt very well with past failures in the Irish language teaching policy, particularly the failure to cast enough emphasis on the teaching of Irish as a live language.  He dealt with that very well but he did not deal with this other part, teaching people to be ashamed of themselves for not knowing Irish while not really teaching them Irish.  That is an important part of what has been done to our people in the name of Irish and not to the good of Irish.  I am not saying that the people who did that were not sincere and well-intentioned about what they did but I think that if they continue to be sincere and well-intentioned they have a right to take a good, hard look at what happened and at the situation now.  If I may say so, also, they should not be so ill-tempered with people who raise questions on this area, not denounce them as outcasts from the nation and not distort their words but consider what element of truth there may be in those words, be prepared to reassess the situation as it actually is and not just issue instructions that we have to continue to live in a dream.</P>
    <P>Most Irish people want their children to have an opportunity to learn Irish.  I want that myself for my own <Col N="956" /> children.  My own little boy is going to Scoil Neasain, where subjects are taught through Irish, a very good school in my constituency.  There is a great fund of goodwill towards the Irish language among our people but it is not enough to say that this is largely untapped in practice.  I am speaking now about the Galltacht not the Gaeltacht.  It is practically choked up by various forces.  People want their children to know Irish but they do not want them to be penalised for not knowing it, either in examinations or in their jobs.  They do not want to be condescended to.  They do not want to be treated as second-class citizens either by people who actually know Irish or by that more numerous class who write their names in Irish and belong to the local cumann.</P>
    <P>It is not enough to say that people do not want to be condescended to.  It is true to say that people will no longer put up with this and that the people who go on meting out this kind of treatment will find that people will not put up with the condescending attitude nor will they put up with &ldquo;let us pretend&rdquo; when we speak of the restoration of the Irish language. I put the question to a distinguished Irish scholar the other night, who was vigorously defending this concept of the restoration of the language: &ldquo;Restoration to exactly what, to the condition that Irish was in in 1168?&rdquo; He is a very moderate man and he said: &ldquo;no, 1600 would do.&rdquo; Does anybody think we can restore 1600 or anything about 1600?  The whole culture of 1600 is part of history.  The Taoiseach in his speech in Connemara last January committed this Government to realistic policies in this area, where they are long overdue. I believe these realistic policies are based on (1) intelligent and active commitment to the development of the Gaeltacht and the preservation of its heritage and, (2), basing the Irish language policy on a concept of the role of Irish in the kind of society we actually live in and are likely to live in.</P>
    <P>That society is made up of people who speak English most of the time and are likely to continue doing so. <Col N="957" /> In these conditions, if Irish is to become more widely used and better used, this will be in proportion to how attractive it appears.  The Government wish to co-operate with those who are trying to make it more attractive and to cut down on the elements of compulsion, elitism and make-believe which are damaging the true interests of the Irish language and also damaging the educational and cultural growth and development of our people.</P>
    <P>The whole pattern of the activity of the Minister for the Gaeltacht in his speech last night reflects this pattern of realistic and serious goodwill towards the Gaeltacht and the Irish language.  I believe their figures speak louder than words.  You can see in the Minister's policy towards the Gaeltacht two things, one is a reaching out towards the Gaeltacht with a policy of active, practical help, implying money.  This Government are putting their money where their mouth is, not as happened before.  That is only one side of it.  The other is dropping the paternalistic attitude towards the people of the Gaeltacht and encouraging them to play their own part in the management of their own affairs.  I believe it is on those two pillars that the Minister's policy and the Government's policy stand.</P>

      <P>Mar is gnáth leis an Aire Poist agus Telegrafa, tá sé ar dhá thaobh an chlaí.  Tá sé ag moladh na Gaeilge agus athbheochan na Gaeilge agus ag an am gcéanna tá sé ag caitheamh droch-mheas ar dhaoine atá ag déanamh a ndícheall ar mhaithe leis an nGaeilge.  Ní ceist pháirtí ná tada mar sin ceist na Gaeltachta ná ceist na Gaeilge.  Baineann seo le chuile dhuine.  Má tá daoine ann a bhfuil meas acu ar an Ghaeilge agus má tá siad i bPairtí Fhianna Fáil nó i bpairtí ar bith eile ní ceart go mbeadh daoine eile á gcáineadh agus ag fáil locht orthu má tá fonn orthu Gaeilge a labhairt agus Gaeilge a chur chun cinn.  Rugadh agus tógadh sa Ghaeltacht mé.  Is oth liom a rá go dtáinig meath ar an nGaeltacht agus ar an nGaeilge sa Ghaeltacht sin.  Ní ar mhuintir na háite an locht ná b'fhéidir ar rialtaisí ar chor ar bith. Tá a fhios againn go rabhamar le <Col N="958" /> tamall fada faoi chois agus faoi leathrom ag muintir thíre eile.</P>
      <P>Tá a fhios ag chuile dhuine nach bhfuil sé ach 9 nó 10 mbliain ó d'eirigh linn teacht chun chinn agus féacháil le tada a chur chun tosaigh. Anois, nuair a bhí pobal Gaeltachta ins na Gaeltachtaí ar fad bhí an pobal sin beo, bríomhar.  Tá an pobal sin beo, bríomhar go fóill i dTír Chonaill, i nGaillimh agus in áiteanna i gContae Mhuigheó agus i gCiarraí.  Caithfear chidiú níos mó leo chun go bhfanfaidh siad mar a bhí siad.  Tá a fhios againn go bhfuil go leor cainte déanta anseo faoin ndul chun cinn atá déanta ag an Aire nua ach cé go bhfuil go leor spaisteoireachta déanta aige ag dul thart go dtí na Gaeltachtaí ar fad, rud a rinne na hAirí Gaeltachta a bhí ann roimhe, ní fheicim tada nua san óráid a thug an tAire aréir ná in obair ar bith a thug sé ós cómhair na Dála go dtí seo.  Tá caint déanta aige faoi chomharchumainn.  Bhí na comharchumainn ann sul a dtáinig sé isteach anseo ina Aire.  Bhí deontaisí le fáil ag na comharchumainn agus níl aon athrú déanta ag an Aire sna deontaisí a bhí le fáil ag comharchumainn sul a dtáinig seisean isteach anseo.</P>
      <P>Tá caint déanta aige faoi theangmháil atá á dhéanamh ag Gaeltarra Éireann leis na húdaráis eile sa Stát, leis an bhForas Talúntais, leis an Roinn Talmhaíochta agus Iascaigh. Cé bhunaigh na rudaí sin ar fad?  Bhí siad sin ann sul a dtáinig seisean isteach anseo mar Aire agus má tá breis airgid á thabhairt i mbliana aige le haghaidh na Gaeltachta, tá mé cinnte dá mbeadh an Rialtas seo againne ann go mbeadh an bhreis chéanna airgid á thabhairt acu mar níl sé ach ag leanúint ar aghaidh leis an gclár oibre a bhí bunaithe go maith anseo sul a dtáinig sé isteach ina Aire.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Tá cúpla ceist agam le cur ar an Aire.  Bhunaigh Gaeltarra caidreamh níos dlúithe leis an Roinn Talmhaíochta agus Iascaigh agus leis an bhForas Talúntais.  Sin ráiteas.  Níl sé cruthaithe aige in aon áit go bhfuil an caidreamh sin ann.  Chuir mise ceisteanna ar an Aire faoi chúrsaí talmhaíochta, faoi chúrsaí cimín, <Col N="959" /> faoi obair sa Ghaeltacht a bhain le talmhaíocht agus le h-iascaireacht agus sé an freagra a fuair mé nár bhain siad san le Roinn na Gaeltachta, gur bhain siad le Roinn éigin eile.  Ní thuigim céard tá i gceist aige ansin in Uimhir a 5 ar leathanach a 4 nuair adeir sé gur bunaíodh an caidreamh seo go bhfuil caint déanta aige faoi.</P>
    <P>Tuigimid go maith gur ceist eacnamíochta atá ann maidir le slánú na Gaeltachtaí agus tá a fhios againn go gcaithfear airgead a chur ar fáil agus go gcaithfear obair a chur ar fáil ins na Gaeltachtaí má theastaíonn uainn iad a choinneál slán agus más fíor é go bhfuil teangmháil déanta ag an Aire leis na Rannógaí seo atá luaite aige, beidh gá leis agus gá mór leis mar, má tá na Gaeltachtaí le teacht chun cinn, caithfidh siad braith ar thalmhaíocht agus ar iascaireacht agus ar rudaí atá le fáil san áit acu.  Ní cabhair ar bith dúinn bheith ag braith ar strainséaraí le teacht isteach agus cuidiú linn.  Caithimíd úsáid a bhaint as an amh-ábhar atá againn féin ins na Gaeltachtaí le h-iad a chur chun tosaigh.  Céard a thárlóidh anois leis na scéimeanna atá againn maidir le cúrsaí feilmeoireachta san Euróip?  Cé mhéad ceann de na Gaeltachtaí a bhéas in ann cuidiú a fháil feasta i dtalmhaíocht i ngeall ar na feilmeacha beaga atá sa nGaeltacht?  Céard a thárlós do na scéimeanna a bhí againn le fada le leasú talún a réiteach, le feirmeacha a dhraenáil?  Céard a thárlós do na scéimeanna sin ó thárla go bhfuil muid anois ag glacadh leis na scéimeanna atá ag teacht chugainn ón Euróip? An mbeidh cuidiú le fáil feasta ag na feirmeoirí beaga sa Ghaeltacht?  Níl a fhios agamsa freagra na ceiste sin. B'fhéidir go bhfuil sé ag an Aire.</P>
    <P>Luaigh sé ceist na hiascaireachta. Sílim go mba cheart go mbeadh i bhfad níos mó cuidiú á thabhairt maidir leis an iascaireacht.  Tá go leor cineál iascaireachta ann.  Tá cheana féin Bord Iascaigh Mhara agus na daoine seo ag déanamh a gcion féin maidir le h-iascaireacht ar an bhfarraige agus maidir le báid a chur ar fáil do dhaoine a bhfuil suim acu san iascaireacht acht sílim go dtig linn dearcadh <Col N="960" /> ar rudaí mar iascaireacht oisirí agus &ldquo;fish farming&rdquo; mar a thugann siad air i mBéarla, a leithéidí sin, le níos mó saothrú a chur ar fáil ins na Gaeltachtaí.  Tá go leor de mhuintir na Gaeltachta agus níl aon seans acu céirdeanna a fhoghlaim.  Níl aon deis acu na céirdeanna a fhoghlaim sa Ghaeltacht agus níl seans le fáil acu ina gCondaethe féin le céird ar bith a fhoghlaim.  Tá AnCO ann acht tá AnCO ag plé le cúrsaá ins na bailte móra agus tá na daoine atá ins na bailte móra in ann cuidiú a fháil agus níl na daoine ins na háiteacha iargúlta in ann cuidiú a fháil mar go bhfuil siad an-fhada ó na láithreáin ina bhfuil AnCO suite.  Ba cheart go mbeadh scéim éigin ag Roinn na Gaeltachta agus Gaeltarra Éireann le deis a thabhairt do mhuintir na Gaeltachta traenáil a fháil ins na Gaeltachtaí féin.</P>

      <P>Chuireadh ceist agus thug mé freagra uirthí.  Céard tá déanta agaibhse le AnCO ó tháinig sibh i gcumhacht?  Ní fheicim tada déanta go fóill ag an Aire ach an méid cainte atá déanta aige ar an radio mar atá leis an Rialtas seo an t-am ar fad&mdash;rialtas tré phoiblíocht. Sin an méid maithis atá déanta acu.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Má theastaíonn uainn an Ghaeilge agus an Ghaeltacht a chur chun tosaigh caithimíd cuidiú le saol eacnamaíochta na ndaoine agus sílim nach bhfuil go leor á dhéanamh i láthair na huaire.  Tá go leor a <Col N="961" /> d'fhéadfaí a dhéanamh chun cuidiú le daoine fanacht ina mbailte féin lena muiríneacha a thógáil sa teach agus le bheith leo agus le cuidiú leo.  Le fada an lá tá go leor leor rudaí ag cur isteach ar an nGaeltacht&mdash;an imirce cuir i gcás agus is maith an rud é go bhfuil stop á chur leis an imirce i láthair na huaire.  Tá daoine ag teacht ar ais agus tá siad in ann obair a fháil ach tá deacrachtaí ag cuid de na daoine seo, daoine go bhfuil muirín agus clann acu agus ar tóigeadh na páistí sin i Sasana agus, b'fhéidir, atá pósta le strainséaraí, níl siad in ann na deontaisí tithe a fháil nuair a thagann siad ar ais anseo.  Níl ansin ach rud amháin.  Admhaím go bhfuil go leor déanta le seirbhísí, le tithe, le bóithre, le h-uisce, le cumhacht leictreachais, rudaí mar sin, ó cuireadh an Stát ar bun ach ní leor sin leis na daoine a choinneáil ag obair sa bhaile. Caithimíd cuidiú leo obair a fháil agus cuidiú leo a mbeatha a shaothrú san áit a bhfuil siad.</P>
    <P>Anois maidir le saol cultúrtha na nGaeltachtaí, níl seans dá laghad ag an gcultúr atá againn leanúint ar aghaidh nó seasamh i n-aghaidh an stuif atá ar siúl ar thelefís agus ar an radio.  Is beag cláracha i nGaeilge atá i gceist ar thelefís ná ar an radio. Is beag ceol Gaelach atá le cloisteáil agus má tá sé ann bíonn sé ar siúl maidin Domhnaigh nuair nach mbíonn duine ar bith ag éisteacht leis.  An clár ceol Gaelach is mó a bhainimse taitneamh as bíonn sé ar siúl gach maidin Domhnaigh nuair nach mbíonn duine ar bith ag éisteacht leis.  Sílim gur beag seans atá ag ár gcultúr muna dtig linn an radio agus an telefís a dhíriú i gcaoi go mbeidh meas ag daoine ar a gcultúr féin agus ní bhaineann an cheist seo le muintir na Gaeltachta amháin.  Baineann sé leis an dtír ar fad.</P>
    <P>I láthair na huaire bheadh daoine bréan den stuif atá ag teacht ar radio agus ar thelefís.  Is beag clár a bhfuil meas ar bith ag duine ar bith a bhfuil suim aige i ngluaiseacht na Gaeilge ná na rudaí atá Gaelach ar an dtelefís ná ar an radio.  Fiú amháin i gcúrsaí spóirt agus caitheamh aimsire tá cosc á chur ar na cluichí Gaelacha <Col N="962" /> agus ar na cláracha a bhain le cluichí agus le spóirt.  Níl a fhios againn cé tá ciontach ach is doiligh a thuiscint go bhfuil daoine anseo atá ag cur scéala ós ár gcomhair á rá go bhfuil siad i bhfábhar cultúr Gaelach, i bhfábhar Gaeilge agus ansin ag an am chéanna go bhfuil siad ag déanamh cos-ar-bolg ar rudaí a bhaineanns le Gaeilge agus le Gaelachas.  Ní thig liomsa an rud a thuiscint agus tá sé soiléir nach bhfuil muid dáiríre faoi na rudaí seo.</P>
    <P>Má thógaim an Ghaeltacht againn féin, cuir i gcás, Gaeltacht Mhuigheo tá sí dearmadta ar fad.  Níl baint ar bith le Radio na Gaeltachta againn. Níl fiú amháin duine ag obair do Radio na Gaeltachta i gContae Mhuigheo.  Tá seirbhís á fáil ag Tír Chonaill, ag Gaillimh, Ciarraí agus níl mé ro-chinte faoi Chorcaí ach níl áird ar bith orainne agus, ar ndóigh, tig linn a rá mar abraítear sa Bhéarla: Contae Mhuigheo go bhfóire Dia orainn.  Is fíor é i gcás an aitheantais atá le fáil againn ó Radio na Gaeltachta agus ón údarás.  Anois ó thárla caint ar Radio na Gaeltachta mé, baineann sé seo leis an Aire Poist agus Telegrafa ach más rud é nach bhfuil airgead aige leis na cláracha sin atá ar siúl ar Radio na Gaeltachta a leathnú agus cuidiú chun iad a chur ar fáil do mhuintir na Gaeltachta ar fad, sílim go mba chóir dó iarraidh ar Aire na Gaeltachta nó ar an Rialtas tuilleadh airgid fháil le cuidiú le Radio na Gaeltachta chun cláracha ceantar a bhunú agus a leathnú agus a chur ar fáil do na Gaeltachtaí uilig.</P>
    <P>Anois luaigh an tAire Údarás na Gaeltachta.  Ba mhaith liomsa ceist a chur air: céard a thárlós do na coistí áitiúla nuair a chuirfear an t-údarás seo ar bun.  Bhí coistí áitiúla a tháinig le chéile ins na Gaeltachtaí uilig le cúpla bliain, na daoine óna comharchumainn agus óna gluaiseachtaí eile ar fud na Gaeltachta.  Céard a thárlós do na coistí áitiúla seo nuair a chuirfear Údarás na Gaeltachta ar bun?  An leigfear chun bealaigh iad nó céard a thárlós dóibh?  Cén uair atá dúil ag an Aire an t-údarás a chur ar bun?  An mbeidh toghachán ann <Col N="963" /> i mbliana?  Cén chaoi a chuirfear ar bun an túdarás nó cé chaoi a socrófar ar na toghacháin le haghaidh na mball a bhéas ar an údarás seo?  Céard a thárlós do na daoine atá ag obair anois ar son Roinn na Gaeltachta, na stiúrthóirí agus na daoine sin atá faoi láthair ag feidhmiú ar fud na Gaeltachta? Céard a thárlós do na daoine sin agus do na daoine atá ag cuidiú leo ag obair ar fud na Gaeltachta?</P>
    <P>Anois maidir leis na breac-Ghaeltachtaí agus na haiteacha atá buailte leis na Gaeltachtaí, cuirim i gcás, an paróiste inar tóigeadh mé féin.  Tá an paróiste sin rointe i dhá leath.  Tá an chuid thiar den pharóiste taobh amuigh den Ghaeltacht agus tá an chuid thoir ainmnithe sa Ghaeltacht. Anois tá sé íontach deacair dul chun cinn a dhéanamh i bparóiste mar sin nuair atá coiste i bparóiste agus tá cuid den pharóiste taobh amuigh den Ghaeltacht agus tá tuilleadh dó sa Ghaeltacht.  Céard a dhéanfadh an tAire maidir leis an gceist sin?  An bhfuil dúil aige paróiste nó ionad eacnamaíochta a thógáil nó an bhfuil dúil aige teorainn na Gaeltachta nó limistéar na Gaeltachta mar atá sé anois a fhágáil mar atá sé?  Tá a fhios agam go bhfuil an cheist chéanna fíor i nGaeltachtaí eile.  Tá sé fíor i dTír Chonaill.  Tá sé fíor i gCorcaigh agus creidim go bhfuil sé fíor i gCiarraí chomh maith.  Céard a dhéanfaidh an tAire maidir leis na rudaí sin?</P>
    <P>Bíonn daoine ag rá go bhfuil Gaeilge agus foghlaim na Gaeilge ag cur isteach ar pháistí scoile, ag cur isteach ar oideachas agus baineann sé seo le háiteacha taobh amuigh den Ghaeltacht.  Tá a fhios againn go maith nach maith le páistí scoile go minic b'fhéidir an modh múinte ná an chaoi ina gcuirtear an Ghaeilge cun tosaigh ins na scoltacha.  Tá taithí agam féin ó bheith ag múineadh scoile i mBaile Átha Cliath.  Dé gnáth ní raibh meas ag na páistí, b'fhéidir, ar Ghaeilge ach sílim nach ar na páistí féin atá an locht.  Sílim go mbíonn tionchar ag na tuismitheoirí orthu.  Ní bhfaigheann siad an cuidiú ceart ón a muintir.  Cáintear an Ghaeilge agus caitear drochmheas uirthi agus nuair a bhíonn an scéal <Col N="964" /> mar sin is doilig do pháistí meas a bheith acu ar an Ghaeilge nó meas a bheith acu ar an Ghaeilge a fhoghlaim. Tig le chuile dhuine againn i bhfad níos mó a dhéanamh chun cuidiú le páistí agus le meas a chothú iontu don Ghaeilge, don náisiúnachas agus do rudai a bhaineann linn fein agus lenár dtír féin.</P>
    <P>Deir daoine go bhfuil ceist na Gaeilge agus slánú na Gaeilge ag cur isteach ar mhuintir an Tuaiscirt agus á rá nach mbeadh fonn ar bith orthu theacht isteach sa Stát seo dá mba Stát Gaelach a bheadh ann.  Le déanaí nuair a bhí John Hume faoi agallamh cuireadh ceist air.  Tá an t-agallamh le léamh i <i>Comhar</i>, Márta, 1974.  Cuireadh an cheist seo air:</P>
    <P>Ó hE.  An bhfeiceann tusa nó an SDLP an Ghaeilge mar bhac d'aontú na tíre?</P>
    <P>J. H. A mhalairt ar fad! Mar eolas duit, is é an SDLP an t-aon pháirtí amháin i stair pholaitiúil an tuaiscirt a raibh polasaí acu agus a chuir os comhair an phobail é ar fhorbairt chultúrtha nó mar a deirimid sa tuaisceart &ldquo;forbairt chultúrtha traidisiúnta&rdquo;&mdash;ciallaíonn sé sin an teanga agus gach rud a bhaineann léi.  Tá tacaíocht tugtha ag an phobal dúinn don pholasaí seo.  Leanamar ar aghaidh ansin chun é a thabhairt i gcrích mar chuid dár ráiteas ar aidhmeanna sóisialta agus eacnamaíochta&mdash;is é sin go mbeadh an polasaí cultúrtha seo mar chuid de seo agus tá ráiteas cuimsitheach dár n-aidhmeanna in aidhmeanna aontaithe an Executive Tuaisceartach ar fhorbairt ár dtraidisiún cultúrtha agus is ceann de na traidisiúin cultúrtha is láidre ná an Ghaeilge agus bheadh súil againn go bhfaigheadh sé a áit chóir i bhforbairt cultúrtha an tuaiscirt.  Ní fheicimse ar chor ar bith mar bhac é.  Sílim go raibh dearcadh mhuintir na Gaeilge go dtí seo, sílim gur ghlac siad dearcadh ró-chaol, rónáisiúntach chucu féin agus gur chuir siad í le traidisiún pholaitiúil amháin.  Ach feictear dom go bhfuil saibhreas na Gaeilge agus an chultúr Ghaelaigh ar fad mar dhroichead a bheadh ábalta suim <Col N="965" /> doimhin a bhunú idir Protastúnaigh agus Caitlicigh agus má thugtar faoi ar mhodh leathan an chultúir agus ní ar an teanga amháin, is é sin ag cur an chultúir Ghaelaigh chun cinn caithfidh sé suim úr a mhúscailt sa teanga sa deire, thiar thall&mdash;tríd an ceol, an dráma agus mar sin&mdash;gurb é seo an dóigh gur ceart dúinn suim sa teanga.  Is í pholasaí hÉireann agus gan dabht éireodh suim sa teanga.  Is í pholasaí leathan-bhuin mar seo a chreideann an SDLP agus is polasaí a ba mhaith linn a chur i gcrích agus muid i gcumacht.</P>
    <P>Ón ráiteas sin tá sé soiléir go mba cheart do gach duine&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>Mheasfá ó bheith ag éisteacht le Teachtaí Fhianna Fáil go raibh sé mar aidhm acu an Ghaeltacht agus an Ghaeilge a shabháil acht tá a fhios ag gach éinne an dallamullóg a chuir Fianna Fáil ar na Gaeltachtaí. Tá figiúirí anseo agam a léiríonn líon na ndaoine ins na Gaeltachtaí ón mbliain 1956 go dtí an bhliain 1971. Fuaireas na figiúirí sin as Census of Population of Ireland, 1971, leathanach 152, agus Census of Population of Ireland, 1963, leathanach 30.  Sa bhliain 1956 bhí 85,703 duine sa <Col N="966" /> Ghaeltacht; sa bhliain 1961 bhí 79,323 duine ann; sa bhliain 1966 bhí 73,630 duine ag maireachtáil sa Ghaeltacht agus sa bhliain 1971 ní raibh ach 70,568 duine fágtha sa Ghaeltacht. Le 15 bliain anuas tháinig laghdú breis agus 15,000 sa Ghaeltacht agus cé bhí i gceannas na tíre i rith an tréimhse sin ach muintir Fhianna Fáil.</P>
      <P>Maidir le hÚdarás na Gaeltachta, bhí a ndóthain ama ag muintir Fhianna Fáil chun é a bhunú. Buíochas le Dia, anois tá Aire ag an gComhrialtas go bhfuil a chroí agus a mheon sna Gaeltachtaí.  Níl seachtain nach bhfuil Aire na Gaeltachta i nDún na nGall, i Muigheo, i nGaillimh, i gCiarraí, i gCorcaigh no i bPortláirge. Nuair a bhí Rialtas Fhianna Fáil ann ní raibh aon Aire nó Rúnaí Parlaiminte ann a bhí an oiread sin suime aige sna Gaeltachtaí.  Fiú amháin ní raibh aon Aire lánaimsearach acu.</P>
      <P>Tá Aire na Gaeltachta tár éis fógra a chur amach go mbeidh níos mó na 2,000 jobanna breise sna Gaeltachtaí sar i bhfad.  Deinim comhgháirdeachas leis an Aire.  Ar aghaidh leis an dea-obair.</P>
      <P>Ag tagairt arís d'Údarás na Gaeltachta, i 1971 chuir Aire na Gaeltachta fógra chuig an Aire Rialtais Áitiúil údarás a chur ar bhun.  Ach mo léan, bé sin deireadh an scéil. Bhí breis agus bliain go leith ag an Aire Rialtais Áitiúil ach ní raibh a chroí san obair.</P>
      <P>Bhí sé cosúil le ceol binn na n-éan bheith ag éisteacht le Aire na Gaeltachta aréir nuair a dúirt sé go raibh breis agus £3 milliún le caitheamh aige.  Dúirt fear liom le déanaí, fear a chaith breis agus 80 bliain sa Ghaeltacht, gurb i seo an chéad uair a chonaic sé Aire na Gaeltachta sa Ghaeltacht.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>D'oscail an tAire Oideachais scoil Dhúin Chaoin.  Ní raibh muintir Fhianna Fáil sásta leis sin agus tá siad ag bagairt ó shin.  B'fhéidir nach bhfuil mórán páistí ag freastal ar an scoil ach mhúscail an gníomh sin muintir an pharóiste.  Faoi láthair, tá siad ag cur comharchumann ar bun. Tá spiorad na ndaoine ag filleadh.  Tá monarcha bheag ag obair ann agus <Col N="967" /> tá siad faoi láthair ag déanamh iarracht halla paróiste a thosnú.  Sé an tAire Oideachais a mhúscail an spiorad sin.</P>
    <P>Nuair a bhí an Teachta Tunney ag caint aréir, rinne mé tagairt do Ghaelgeoirí Bhaile Átha Cliath.  Is mian liom anois miniú a thabhairt don Teachta faoi céard a bhí in aigne agam.  An Domnach seo caite, de réir na nuachtán agus Telefís Éireann, tháinig breis is 350 Gaeilgeoirí Bhaile Átha Cliath le chéile i Liberty Hall agus d'aontaíodar d'aon-ghuth nach raibh sé de cheart ag Muintir na hÉireann bheith ag feachaint ar thelefís an BBC, go ndéanfadh sé scrios ar ár gcultúr agus mar sin de.  Ní raibh le déanamh ag na daoine a bhí ag caint ach cnaipe a bhrú agus tá gach staisiún acu.  An Domhnach seo caite ní raibh fiú amháin Telefís Éireann ag muintir na Gaeltachta toisc go raibh easaontas sa stáisiún.  An bhfuil Gaelgeoirí Bhaile Átha Cliath ag rá gur second class citizens muintir na Gaeltachta? D'fhan muintir na Gaeltachta dílis don teanga le blianta fada agus is masla mór dóibh a leithéid de raiméis agus a tháinig ó Liberty Hall.  Ní raibh an dream a bhí ansin ag tabhairt liberty d'éinne ach dóibh féin.</P>
    <P>Ar 23 Eanáir, 1974, chuaidh an Taoiseach go dtí an Ceathrú Rua agus ní dochar chuid den mhéid a dúirt sé a chur isteach sa dhíospóireacht. Thug sé na haidhmeanna a bhí ag an gComhrialtas i dtaobh na Gaeltachtaí. Uimhir a h-aon, dúirt sé go raibh sé mar chuspóir:</P>
    <P>féachaint chuige go mbeidh gach chabhair le fáil dóibh siúd go dteastaíonn uathu an Ghaeilge a bheith mar theanga acu ag baile agus ina saol poiblí, agus ina theannta san féachaint cad é an tslí is fearr chun a áiteamh ar an bpobal i gcoitinne suim a chur sa nGaeilge;</P>
    <P>agus a dó&mdash;</P>
    <P>féachaint chuige go ndéanfaí gach is féidir chun na limistéir Ghaeltachta a neartú.  Is é mian an Rialtais leas eacnamaíoch, sóisialach agus cultúrtha na Gaeltachta a chur chun cinn chomh tapaidh agus chomh héifeachtach agus is feidir.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="968" /> Dúirt an Taoiseach freisin:</P>
    <P>Caithfear lán-ionadaíocht a thabhairt do mhuintir na Gaeltachta sa leagan amach a bheidh ar an bhforbairt seo.</P>
    <P>Tá Aire na Gaeltachta againn anois arb é a aon chúram leas na Gaeilge agus na Gaeltachta a chur chun cinn.  Níl aon chuid den Ghaeltacht ná fuil siúlta aige anois agus tá buailte aige le hiondaithe ó na ceantair éagsúla agus a dtuairimí cloiste aige.</P>
    <P>Tá mórán déanta cheana féin ag Aire na Gaeltachta, ag Roinn na Gaeltachta agus ag Gaeltarra Éireann chun scéimeanna nua a chur chun cinn agus tá cuid acu Cheana féin á gcur i gcrích.</P>
    <P>Mar sin, táimíd tar éis a theaspaínt go soiléir go bhfuil croí an Chomhrialtais sa Ghaeilge agus sa Ghaeltacht.  Cuirim geall: i gceann 15 bliana ní bheidh laghdú chomhmór le 15,000 daoine sa Ghaeltacht ach feasbhsú de bharr an pholasaí atá ag an dTaoiseach, ag Aire na Gaeltachta agus ag an Aire Poist agus Telegrafa.</P>

      <P>Tá fealsúnacht áirithe i roint sean-fhocal Gaeilge. Dúirt Aire na Gaeltachta go raibh súil aige, le cúnamh Dé, go dtiocfadh an Ghaeilge ar ais.  Tá sean-fhocal ag muintir na Gaeltachta: &ldquo;Is maith le Dia féin cabhair d'fháil&rdquo;.  Creidim sa Ghaeilge; creidim i nDia; ach níos tábhachtaí ná sin, creidim i gcumacht Rialtais. Ó thángadar i gcumhacht ní dúirt an Rialtas go dteastaíonn uatha an Ghaeilge a aibheochan agus tá imní, éadóchas agus eagla orm dá bharr.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister for Post and Telegraphs may accuse me and other Deputies of giving too much attention to what he would regard as a romantic dream.  I wish to take issue with him on this point.  Is it more romantic to have a neglected aim and ideal than to have an ideal and pursue it to the point where it might be realised?  Life is not entirely about material things.  To dismiss ideas, aims and ideals is to misread their function.  They are not useless, impractical, <Col N="969" /> worthless dreams.  They are visions, perhaps somewhat remote. Here I disagree with speakers who claim that this aim can be realised in the lifetime of the Government. These are the aims and objectives of what we would regard as being as near perfect a situation for the Irish people as we could imagine.  If when communicating they do so in part at least in the language of their forebears, the language of their ancestors, the language which is regarded as holding the Irish philosophy, that is an aim which should be nurtured. This aim need not be denied by any Government.</P>
    <P>In his dismissal of the Irish language the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs found himself in what he will accept was unusual ecclesiastical and religious company who would say that because we are not sincere about it, because we are not practising it <i>in toto</i>, why use the language?  I have not the time to go into that at the length I should like.  Following that logic, we would have to say to all those people who profess faith in the Ten Commandments: &ldquo;because you do not practice entirely and absolutely every one of them, you should jettison them&rdquo;.  As regards the good religious fathers, the good Jesuits and the gentlemen who speak on their behalf, are we to take it that because the people of the world are not practising Christianity, all the efforts that have been made for practically 2,000 years should be ignored and we should move to something else or to some other grey area that treats of living from moment to moment or from day to day and makes no provision at all for things of the spirit or any ideal?

      <P>If that represents the little remnant of the small Irishman with his small hammer tapping at what should be the Minister's sense of &ldquo;Irishness&rdquo;, I can understand it. As regards the situation where a mere peasant can make the Minister feel ashamed if that peasant has a superiority in the Irish language which the Minister does not enjoy, I suggest that he or I should not feel the least bit inferior because we have not had the opportunity that the other person has had of being proficient in the Irish language.  I never advocated, and nobody in these benches ever advocated, that any Irishman should feel inferior because he had not got an efficient and, what my friend the Parliamentary Secretary would deny me, a Dublin man's knowledge of the Irish language.  If the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs wants to attack people who tend to monopolise the language, why does he not, on the very utterance of the Parliamentary Secretary here last night, an utterance which would deny to me my right under the Constitution&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>&mdash;&mdash;speaking in Waterford said that as far as he was concerned Irish was important but its importance must not be over-emphasised in relation to broadcasting. At the moment 2 per cent of the programmes broadcast is in the Irish language, and as far as the Minister is concerned we are getting much more than we deserve, getting much more than this minority interest is entitled to.  The Minister would tell the people who are interested in having Irish programmes that they are not going to run the show.  The Minister would also tell us that the people in the Fianna Fáil benches are exploiting the Irish language.  As far as I am concerned when we reach the day that the Minister indulges in the same exploitation, when the Minister is prepared to say to this House that this new Government have a plan and have a policy for the Irish language then I shall be happy to welcome that exploitation.</P>

      <P>On this side of the House we feel that we have made a very strong case in favour of the amendments which we have put here. We feel that the arguments are irrefutable. In fact, no attempt has been made by the Minister to refute or disprove them or to substantiate the reasoning or thinking behind his own proposals which we are seeking to amend in order to make them reasonable. At this stage we would make a final appeal to the Minister to consider the amendments which we have put before him.  We would ask the Government to accept those amendments.</P>

      <P>If Deputy Molloy is really serious I suppose I will have to reply to him.  I would like to say, as I have already said on a number of occasions, that Deputy Molloy had ample opportunity to introduce a Bill such as this if he wanted to or to make any amendments or regulations in respect of Dublin city, an area we are now talking <Col N="976" /> about.  He did not do so.  I do not know whether that is because he could not do so or because he would not be allowed to do so.  I know he made four attempts at change and he has now introduced amendments which bear no relation whatever to what he was suggesting when he was on this side of the House.</P>
      <P>As I see it, the situation is that we have introduced a Bill.  I consider the Bill to be fair.  I have given reasons why I consider it to be fair.  The average over the whole country is slanted towards the rural areas rather than the city areas, taking all Ireland into consideration.  I am not prepared to agree that we should have another border along the Shannon. We hear much about the Shannon as if it were to be another border but we have enough borders in this country.  I do not see any good reason&mdash;and there has been no argument made by the Opposition which would convince me&mdash;why a change should be made.  In fact, a number of speakers from the Opposition side pointed out that all the pluses were in the rural areas and all the minuses in the urban areas; we are now dealing with Dublin.</P>

There is a plus of 93 in Dún Laoghaire.  Dublin (Artane) and Dublin (Ballyfermot) each have a plus.  Dublin (Cabra) is a minus, as is Dublin (Clontarf). Dublin (Finglas) is a minus, as is Dublin North-Central.  Dublin (Rathmines) is a plus.  Dublin South-Central is a minus, as is Dublin SouthEast. That proves in fact&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <P>This amendment deals with the deletion of the entry relating to the constituency of Cavan-Monaghan and the substitution of a three-seat constituency of Cavan and a three-seat constituency of Monaghan.  The Minister's proposal is that there should be created a five-seat constituency in that area comprising the administrative county of Cavan, and the administrative county of Monaghan except that the part thereof which is comprised in the constituency of Louth. We do not agree that it is proper or correct to create such a large constituency in this area.  We have shown in our amendment that two three-seat constituencies could have been created here.  There are many valid arguments as to why those two counties should not have been grouped together to form a five-seat constituency. Amendment No. 13, which is also under discussion, reads:</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="983" /> In page 9, in the second column of the entry relating to the constituency of Louth, to delete all words after &ldquo;Louth;&rdquo; and substitute &ldquo;and in the administrative county of Meath, the district electoral division of St. Mary's.</P>
    <P>The Minister's proposal in relation to the proposed four-seat constituency of Louth is that it should consist of the administrative county of Louth and part of County Monaghan, the area of Monaghan being the district electoral divisions of Drumboory, Inishkeen, Killybegs, in the former rural district of Carrickmacross.  An examination of <Col N="984" /> the 1971 census of population for the county of Louth will show that the population there is close to the figure required for a four-seater and we propose to add in one electoral division from the county of Meath, the district electoral division of St. Mary's.  The county of Louth would then meet the required population figure for a four-seater and that would involve less disturbance than the method proposed by the Minister.</P>
    <P>Amendment No. 16 reads:</P>

    <P Just="Right">&ldquo;</P>
    <P>We suggest a three-seat constituency for Meath as against the Minister's proposal to create a four-seater in this area.  The Minister's proposal which would involve an area consisting of the administrative county of Meath goes on:</P>
    <P>and, in the administrative county of Kildare, the district electoral divisions of:</P>
    <P>Cloncurry, Donadea, Kilcock, in the former Rural District of Celbridge No. 1;</P>
    <P>Ballynadrumny, Cadamstown, Carbury, Carrick, Drehid, Dunfierth, Kilrainy, in the former Rural District of Edenderry No. 2.</P>
    <P>The present Meath constituency is a three-seater so this is a major change.</P>
    <P>As I mentioned earlier, the population of County Meath and County Kildare are quite similar but neither of them are quite adequate for the creation of a four-seat constituency. If one is to be made a four-seater it must be topped up with an area from a neighbouring county.  I suggest that as Kildare had the greater population recorded in the 1971 census the four-seater should have been created in Kildare with additions.  The Minister has chosen to make Meath a four-seater and we propose it should be a three-seater, the reason being we believe that the counties of Cavan and Monaghan, which are Border counties, stretching along a long section of the Border between the Twenty-six and the Six Counties, should not have representation in the Dáil diminished. We recognise that the population of either Monaghan or Cavan on its own is not adequate to allow for the creation of a three-seat constituency. If we are to retain a three-seat constituency in both of those counties there will have to be additions from adjoining areas.  This is what we propose in this group of amendments.  The substantial population of County Louth, close to the figure required for <Col N="985" /> a four-seater, justifies the creation of a four-seat constituency in Louth. The population of County Louth according to the 1971 census is 74,951. The addition of one electoral district from the county of Meath, the St. Mary's one, where there is a population of 2,201 and which is close to the town of Drogheda, brings it to a neat total of 77,152 which is about the required figure.  It is within the constitutional limits and we propose that that constituency should be created.</P>
    <P>I have said that according to the census returns Cavan did not have an adequate population for three seats and it requires an addition from adjoining areas.  The minimum figure required to keep within the constitutional and Supreme Court provisions for a three-seat constituency is 57,369 but the population of Cavan is only 49,141.  We propose the addition of a number of electoral districts in the adjoining county of Meath with a population of 8,484 and to form a constituency of Meath having a three-seater, having a total population of 57,625 which is above the minimum figure of 57,369 required by law.</P>
    <P>In the 1971 census the county of Monaghan recorded a total population of 46,242 and there would have to be additions to the county from adjoining areas if it was to have the minimum figure.  There is a difficulty in that area of trying to meet this requirement while, at the same time, causing minimum disturbance in adjoining areas.  Having accepted the principle as we did that the county of Monaghan should continue to return three Deputies, that there should be a constituency of Monaghan including the whole of the county plus adjoining areas, we had to meet that requirement by taking part of County Cavan into County Monaghan, the district electoral divisions of Shercock, Taghart, Lisagoan, Enniskeen and Kingscourt, with a total population of 3,477.  In the administrative county of Meath the district electoral divisions are Ardagh, Drumconrath, Killary, Grangegeeth, Posseckstown, Nobber, Carrickleck, Kilmainham, Cruicetown, <Col N="986" /> Castletown, Rathkenny, Donaghpatrick and Stackallan.  That is a total population of 8,062, giving an overall total for the constituency we are proposing of 57,781 population which will allow for the election of three Deputies from that area.</P>
    <P>In trying to retain three-seaters in Cavan and Monaghan, it was necessary to cede part of County Meath into both counties and, in fact, Cavan ceded part to Monaghan to help to bring up the level in that area.  This would allow for the creation of a three-seat constituency in Meath.  This is not new; it is more or less a continuation of the arrangement that exists at present where the county of Meath is supporting the county of Monaghan to bring it to a three-seater The remainder of County Meath has a population of 52,982.  To bring that over the required figure we propose transferring electoral divisions from County Kildare with a total population of 9,724 and a small transfer from North County Dublin of 402, making a total for the proposed constituency of Meath of 63,108.  This is below the maximum figure of 63,369 which is the high range of the tolerance for a three-seater.  As long as we stay within the figures of 57,369 and 63,369 we are complying with the law.</P>
    <P>Those are the proposals we put before the House and the Minister must agree strong arguments can be made for the retention of two three-seaters in this area.  It is a sensitive area and it has special problems which have been only too tragically highlighted in recent times.  The area should have the maximum representation allowable by our Constitution and the interpretation put on it.  It involves difficulties in the adjoining counties.  The Minister sits in County Meath.  I want him to understand that our proposal for a three-seater has nothing to do with that.  The fact that it happens to be in the Minister's area, where he would probably stand&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>Perhaps I am asking too much of the Minister.  He is a rather touchy individual.  I have stated my intentions quite clearly and if the Minister does not want to accept them that is fair enough.  I did not have any intention of interfering with it because it was his constituency. The Minister can take what he likes from that, but that is the position.  Obviously, in trying to retain the three-seater in Cavan and in Monaghan one would have to transfer from Meath.  It would not have been possible without massive transfers from Kildare, Dublin or Louth to have retained a four-seater as the Minister proposes.  As it is a three-seater at the moment there is no great change involved in what we are suggesting.</P>
      <P>Our amendments deal with Cavan, Monaghan, Meath and Louth.  We propose Cavan should be a three-seater with a population of 57,625; Monaghan a three-seater with a population of 57,781; Meath a three-seater with a population of 63,108 and Louth a four-seater with a population of 77,152.  We submit that amendment to the Minister as a reasonable proposal.  We ask him to ignore the fact that he has a vested interest in these constituencies and to consider the harm he is doing to the counties of Cavan and Monaghan by reducing their representation.  We trust he will recognise the special difficulties and the need for maximum representation for the counties adjoining the Border.</P>

      <P>If we wanted a better example of sheer hypocrisy we could not get a better example than what we have listened to in the last half hour while Deputy Molloy told us about what he now proposes to do with the North Leinster area, including Cavan and Monaghan in the Ulster area.  As I have already said on a few occasions, the Deputy made four efforts to draw something like a Constituency Bill before he left office.  I must assume that he favoured the last one because it proposed to put Cavan and Monaghan into one constituency but today he talks about two three-seaters.

      <P>I am making a categorical statement to the effect that Deputy Molloy doodled through the Department of Local Government.  I do not know whether he did anything else, but he was certainly doodling with figures in an effort to do something about the Constituency Bill.  He made four efforts and the fourth effort resulted in Cavan-Monaghan as a five-seater constituency.  I have the evidence.  Let there be no doubt about that.  I told Deputy Molloy before that I would produce the evidence.</P>

      <P>I know it has no significance because the Deputy is now over there and I am over here.  He did a nice little doodle then in regard to Louth.  Louth was to be a three-seater, not the four-seater which he now believes is so justified.  Portion of North Meath, north of Navan, bringing in Ardee, County Louth and a portion of Drogheda going out to the sea was to be a three-seater constituency. Then he was to make another three-seater of the rest of it with a <Col N="989" /> portion of County Dublin from Balbriggan. Then he was making a four-seater of Kildare and Wicklow.  I described it as a dog's breakfast.  That is what he tried to do.  He even made a worse job&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>It was a lot of nonsense because it was what Deputy Molloy was doing.  I agree with him. It was a lot of nonsense.  But now he comes in and he tries to give the impression that he, being a reasonable man, wants to do the right thing and not one bit of resemblance have his proposals now to what he proposed then.  This is what he has: he wants Cavan to be a three-seater. Let me say that, when the last Constituency Bill was being drawn up by my predecessor, Mr Kevin Boland, he divided North Meath between Cavan and Monaghan and he divided it very neatly.  He divided it at the village I was born in and put one half into one constituency and the other half into the other constituency and at the end of the village County Meath came in.</P>

      <P>I know he does not and Mr. Boland would not know either unless somebody told him and we know, of course, there was somebody to tell him; there was a cumann.  Now in this particular proposal we again have the suggestion to bring Cavan in because of the fact that under Fianna Fáil the population of Cavan continued to drop.  That is something that must not be forgotten.  It was necessary therefore to bring more of County Meath in.</P>

      <P>If Deputy Molloy wants to say something more I will let him in but would he please allow me to make my statement?  He can then come in and make whatever comments he wants to make on it until 10.30 tonight.  The proposal was to move a lot more of County Meath into Cavan along with the portion that is still in it.  Then he proposed to move another portion almost up to Navan town into Monaghan.  This was the way he was going to make Cavan and Monaghan two three-seaters. Of course he said he was going to do the big thing then: since Louth was almost entitled to four seats he would give Louth four seats and he fixed on the electoral division of St. Mary's, which covers the area of Laytown and Bettystown.  I live in Bettystown, but this was purely accidental.</P>

      <P>Deputy Molloy does not know where I live, moryah! He has not got a clue.  The effort was made and the only difference now is that by the time he thought of it he was sitting over there and he cannot get away with it.  That is the only difference because, if somebody had told him when he was over here, I am quite sure he would have tried to pull it off and forced me to stand in County Louth.  It would be a nice handy constituency, but I am not that kind of guy; I prefer to stand for the county I belong to.  This meant that he was going to have the administrative county of Cavan, except the part thereof comprised in the constituency of Monaghan, so portion of Cavan was going to be added to Monaghan and portion of Meath added to Cavan and County Monaghan was going to have Monaghan itself, portion of Cavan and portion of County Meath.  I am sure Deputy Molloy did not believe in crossing county boundaries or anything like that: take a bit here and a bit there and put the whole thing together and call it something and that would be a constituency.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There was only one reason, of course, why this was proposed.  It was <Col N="991" /> different from what is being done by me and Deputy Molloy would like to have something in here for which he thought he might get a certain amount of support.  I want to tell the two Deputies opposite from Monaghan and Cavan, who are representing their areas very well that no matter what anyone may say, there will come out of the five-seater comprising Monaghan and Cavan excellent representatives, those who will be able to represent Monaghan and Cavan as a constituency, as they have always done, so Deputy Molloy need not worry about the necessity, because it is along the Border, of having enough people to represent the people there because the people who will come in here to represent them, no matter who they are, and irrespective of what party they belong to, will make a good job of it.  Deputy Molloy can be sure of that.  He came along then and he was putting Louth with a portion of St. Mary's electoral division of Meath and then he was coming along to Meath itself and he had the rest of County Meath, except the portions he was giving to Louth and to Cavan and to Monaghan, and then to make it even he pushed in a good slice of Kildare. Having looked at it then there was something wrong with the mix.  It was like the old lady making the Christmas cake: it did not look quite right and she wondered if there was something else that should be put in to make it different and Deputy Molloy, with his Christmas cake, put in Balscadden from County Dublin.  Here we have a Monaghan constituency made up of Monaghan, Cavan and Meath; a Cavan constituency made up of Cavan, Monaghan and Meath and a Meath constituency made up of Meath, Louth and Dublin.  And this is what Deputy Molloy calls a rational way of drawing up constituencies.</P>

      <P>Deputy Molloy is as well aware as I am that the arrangements made in this Bill are perfectly reasonable while the suggestions he has been making are absolutely ludicrous. He made play of the fact that I put a fourth seat into Meath.  In a peculiar way he tried to suggest I did this in order to save my own seat.  I would like to remind Deputy Molloy now that in the last election I had 1,000 votes more than the next Fianna Fáil man.  On the cards it might appear that this would give Fianna Fáil another seat in that area, and good luck to them, but perhaps there is somebody down there the party do not like too well who might come up because the last time there was a one-man show being operated in Meath and the result was that representation of the Fianna Fáil Party in Meath changed.  I do not want to enter into the local vendetta which may go on in these things.  The only reason for this was that it became necessary to put portion of Kildare into West Dublin. I can assure Deputy Molloy that in four years when the general election comes along if I stand for Meath I will get elected.  In years gone by before the last carve-up, before portions of Meath were taken away and given to Monaghan and Cavan, I polled more than 1,000 votes above the <Col N="993" /> quota despite the efforts of Deputy Molloy's predecessor.  They could not get me out of the Dáil and any similar attempt by these amendments will also fail.</P>

      <P>It shows the petty mind behind the person who drew up these amendments.  It was done in order to create a problem.  Why Deputy Molloy should show his hand in this way, with this ridiculous proposal, I do not know.  When this Bill was being drawn up it was very fairly done.  Nobody will deny that Louth had to get a four-seater.  Some small portion of Monaghan had to go in.  I am sorry for that but it will be generally admitted that the portion which has been put in was the smallest possible and although I dislike breaching county boundaries, this is one case in which it became necessary.</P>
      <P>As far as Monaghan and Cavan are concerned, those of us living in or near that area appreciate that in the main the two counties have the same type of economy.  Largely they are the same type of people, very decent people, a mixture of the different cultures and different ways of life that do not exist elsewhere.  They get on very well together and it is natural to put together Monaghan and Cavan in a five-seater.</P>
      <P>Meath was a three-seater, covering the whole area.  Then some of it was put into Kildare some years ago, then portion was added to Monaghan and portion to Cavan.  Then portion of Kildare had to go to Meath and the situation now is that portion of Kildare will be added to Meath in order to make a four-seater.  Again, I am sorry for the necessity to break a boundary but as long as the High Court decision remains and the Constitution remains there is nothing anybody can do about it&mdash;it had to be done in that way.</P>

      <P>When I was speaking a few moments ago Deputy Molloy succeeded in confusing me and I want to put the record straight.  Deputy Molloy's amendment proposed that Cavan would consist of part of Cavan and part of Meath; Monaghan would consist of part of Cavan, part of Meath and the rest of Monaghan; Louth would consist of all of Louth and part of Meath; and Meath would consist of part of Meath, part of Kildare and part of Dublin.  We all know of the shocking row there was during the last revision when Leitrim was split three ways.  This time there is a row because it is being split two ways.  Deputy Molloy wants to split Meath four ways. I know there was no ulterior motive when he did this.  It was a pure coincidence. But the fact that it was the only constituency at which he really had a go would suggest that there was a little more&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>The Deputy has hit the nail on the head.  When one tries to make Cavan and Monaghan into two three-seat constituencies one immediately runs into trouble and County Meath has to be broken up badly to do it.  Deputy Molloy might do that but I would not.  Cavan and Monaghan together, with the exception of 2,400 people, make a natural five-seater.  That was a very good reason why&mdash;&mdash;</P>

Meath and Cavan people are not the same, as I am sure Deputy Wilson will agree.  I was born on the Meath-Cavan border and there is a difference in the outlook of the people in those two areas.  There is no difference between the Cavan and Monaghan people.  There are two different cultures and two sets of people who work well together.  They are the best integrated people I know.  Therefore, I think it was the natural thing to do.</P>

I could not accept these proposals because there is neither sense nor meaning in them. They would not improve the position; as a matter of fact, they would disimprove it very much.  After a few more years of National Coalition Government when the population of Cavan-Monaghan get an opportunity of building up under a good Government, I will be very glad to give them back extra seats.

I hope to follow your solid guidelines and not to ruffle the Minister and draw fire on myself. I know there are two ways of dealing with a hedgehog; I have chosen the one which does not excite him to put out his spines.</P>
      <P>I am appealing to the Minister to accept Deputy Molloy's very solid amendments, and I am appealing on what I think are very solid grounds. Nowadays there is great talk about community development.  In order to have community development we must have a community.  I submit to you.  Sir, that that is precisely what we have in Cavan, a community well developed, with a unified spirit.  Here I would reject the Minister's proposition that there are two cultures in Cavan.  I think I know what the Minister is referring to.  There may be two religions; perhaps he is listening too carefully for an intelligent man&mdash;and I know he is one&mdash;to the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs.  I reject the idea that there are two cultures in County Cavan.  There are variants in religion all right, but we have a single, unified community, and it is on that basis that I am appealing to the Minister to accept Deputy Molloy's very intelligent amendment as to what he proposes to do.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="999" /> The Gaelic Athletic Association is very strong in County Cavan and some people have blamed it in the past for attaching over-importance to county.  Be that as it may&mdash;I am not admitting that that is so&mdash;it did play a big part in welding the whole county into a single community, with a singleness of purpose very often that has nothing to do with games.  The principle town in the county is almost at the centre geographically, and this has a unifying influence on the county.</P>
    <P>We have one local paper in County Cavan.  I lived in Donegal for a time where there were four or five papers and I know the difficulty of dealing with, say, organisations of any kind when you have to pay for four different advertisements.  In my county we have a local paper.  It does not necessarily support the political party I belong to, but it is a fair paper, and it also has this unifying mission.  It watches out for developments in the county.  It also covers a small part of Monaghan and of course it is interested in the whole country and in Europe and the world, as a good paper would be.  It has, as I say, this mission and has had since the family that owns it came from Dublin in the last century and made an Irish and nationalist paper out of it.</P>
    <P>The Minister said that Deputy Molloy, when he was Minister for Local Government, was doodling.  I think he was a very good Minister. In relation to what he said about Cavan and what he intended to do, the Minister knows quite well that until proposals have been hardened, have been finally settled, have been drafted and brought into this House, they are merely an exercise.  He knows that even if you have a codicil to a will, if it is not signed, sealed and delivered it has no validity in law. Therefore, I think it is a little bit much of the Minister to be criticising Deputy Molloy for what he claimed were Deputy Molloy's proposals for this area.</P>
    <P>As I have said, this is a unified <Col N="1000" /> area.  It has a community spirit.  It was the ancient Kingdom of Breffni. The Deputy from Ballinamore is no longer here, but he would agree that perhaps there is more of a kinship with his area than there is with Monaghan, not that we have not always got on very well with the Monaghan people.  The major portion of the county, of the extra Cavan territory that Deputy Molloy proposes in his amendment to take in, is that around Oldcastle In ancient times it was part of Breffni.  The O'Reillys, while they were not exactly marauders, did add that part of the County Meath to their territory, and this tradition of a link, a nexus, between Oldcastle and that part of Cavan around Mountnugent, Castlerahan, that whole semi-circle, still exists; in fact Oldcastle is its natural capital and so on.</P>
    <P>In the times of fairs and markets that circle was even wider and took in a larger territory.  However, there is still a kind of spiritual relationship between that part of County Cavan and Oldcastle.  It is one that we have cultivated, and Oldcastle and its environs fit well into the Cavan constituency. I think the Minister knows this himself.  We are very proud of the connection, very proud of the ancient town of Oldcastle which was to the forefront in every national cause since the beginning of the century.  As the Minister probably knows, the words &ldquo;Sinn Féin&rdquo; were used as the title of a paper in that town long before Arthur Griffith set up his organisation of that name and he had to get permission from that town to use that name.</P>
    <P>If the Minister looks carefully at the map of what he proposes, he will see that the constituency he proposes for us is huge; it is an amorphous one: from my house, which is almost on the Westmeath border to Armagh; from my house to Aughnacloy in Tyrone. It is a huge area, and all the arguments that have been put forward about the revitalising of rural life are valid arguments, and this revitalising is a different proposition when you have a huge area like that and you want to service it as best you can in Parliament.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1001" /> The Minister referred to the falling of the population in the area.  The Fianna Fáil Party were conscious of that, and I submit the most important single piece of legislation that came before this House <i>a propos</i> the maintenance of rural Ireland was that which set up these specially designated areas for the development of small and medium-sized industries.  If the Minister consults the figures from the last census, he will see in relation to Cavan that the areas that have a plus sign, in other words, areas where the population increased, were the areas where new industries were established.</P>
    <P>This is the way the Fianna Fáil Party want to deal with the decline in rural population which, as I said before in another debate, is a European and worldwide phenomenon, and it is one that needs drastic methods to counteract. The Minister said that, of course, it was not really Cavan; I submit, with respect, that substantially this is the historic area of Cavan, not what the Minister is trying to weld together, Cavan and Monaghan.  I have already made the point about Oldcastle, that it was naturally in our sphere of influence, if that is not too pedantic a term to use in the circumstances.  The tradition has been there for a long time.  The tradition of representation in the constituency has been a noble one from the time that Mr. Biggar represented us.  Mr. Biggar, as Members are aware, was the man who, with Roynane, invented the parliamentary tactic, not employed in this House, of obstruction through Arthur Young who came from what is now the Six Counties, as did Biggar and Arthur Griffith, when a new Ireland was awakening.</P>
    <P>It is a great pity that county is no longer a constituency.  It is a break in the chain of tradition which saddens me.</P>

      <P>I am sorry if Deputy Coogan mistakes geography for what was history but that is a minor point. There was a fine tradition from Biggar to Smith in my constituency and I would like to see the constituency maintained as it has been maintained substantially over the years.  I am aware that the Minister came originally from the Moynalty area and I am also aware that Deputy Molloy did not know this when he was constructing his amendment. There was nothing personal in it.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Molloy discussed this matter with Deputy Leonard and myself and we were anxious to retain Cavan and Monaghan. I am appealing to the Minister for the reasons I have given to consider this amendment and I should like to thank Deputy Molloy for trying to maintain this thread of tradition.  I know the Minister has not as hard a heart as he pretends and I <Col N="1003" /> recommend to him acceptance of this amendment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>Unless I forget Deputy Wilson's points I should like to intervene at this stage.  Deputy Wilson has said that Cavan is a natural unit and implies that, therefore, it is wrong to join it to any other county for constituency purposes.  The fact is that Cavan has a population of only 52,618 which is 4,751 short of the minimum required for three seats.  Deputy Wilson then makes a plea to revert to the old kingdom of Breffni.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>On a point of information, I did not make that plea.  I mentioned that Breffni went eastwest and not north-south which is what the Minister's proposition is doing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>Even the kingdom of Breffni did not go up and if Deputy Wilson read the amendment he would discover that in addition to the portion which was in the kingdom of Breffni, Killeagh, Oldcastle, Moylagh, Stonefield, Knocklough, Crosskeys he moves up to Crossakeel, Killallon, Ballinlough, Boherboy, Trohanny, Moybolgue, Kilskeer, Burry, Loughan, Castlekeeran, Newcastle, Moynalty, Newtown, Girley, Grennanstown and Stahalmog.  Deputy Wilson, who knows the area almost as well as I do, goes from Moynalty to Newtown, the area where Carlanstown is, and then he skips Kells and goes out between Kells and Navan to Girley.  How he got that into it beats me.</P>
      <P>To do this would mean chopping areas which are in the Meath constituency and cross into Cavan.  Girley and Grennanstown are near Athboy, the Athboy side between Kells and Navan, and Stahalmog is near Castletown.  I am prepared to admit that if I started to go through areas I did not know and just picked them off a list in Galway I might possibly make the same mistake but it does appear as if Deputy Molloy has made a few bloomers in this.  I am not blaming him because it is possible it is a mistake I would make.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1004" /> Stahalmog is between Carlanstown and Castletown and the Meath-Monaghan constituency comes in between it and any of the rest of the portion of Cavan mentioned.  I am sure Deputy Wilson agrees with that.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>Carlanstown was in the constituency for the last election.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>Carlanstown was but the area around it is in Monaghan. Now it is suggested that an area beyond the Monaghan area should be brought across Carlanstown in some peculiar way and into the Cavan constituency. I do not know how it is proposed to do this but it is also proposed that Girley and Grennanstown, which is within five or six miles of Navan, should be brought down and added to the Cavan constituency. This is making it a little bit ludicrous. This shows how ridiculous the whole thing is.</P>
      <P>To return to the Monaghan constituency&mdash;this is something to which Deputy Leonard should refer when he speaks&mdash;the proposal is that in the administrative county of Cavan the electoral divisions of Shercock, Taghart, Lisagoan, Enniskeen and Kingscourt should be included in Monaghan. I am sure Deputy Wilson's heart will be b'eeding for the ancient kingdom of Breffni there because he is losing them to Monaghan.  They are being swiped away: the marauders are in again.  A minute ago the Deputy was not willing to give an inch but now he is giving to the constituency of Monaghan from the administrative county of Cavan the district electoral divisions of Shercock. Taghart, Lisagoan, Enniskeen and Kingscourt.  It is proposed that they should go into Monaghan and this makes nonsense again of the whole argument.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>However, Deputy Wilson does even better.  He goes into County Meath and gives to Monaghan the district electoral divisions of Ardagh which to us is Kilmainhamwood, Drumconrath, Killary which is Lobinstown and is near Ardee.  Grangegeeth which is between Ardee and Drogheda, Posseckstown which is beside Nobber, Nobber itself. Carrickleck which is doubling back towards Carrickmacross.  Kilmainham which is Kilmainhamwood and is near <Col N="1005" /> Kingscourt, Cruicetown which is between Kilmainhamwood and Carlanstown, Castletown which is near Navan, Rathkenny which is between Castletown and Slane and is about six miles from Navan and five or six miles from Slane, Donaghpatrick which is about four miles from Navan and on the far side of the Gibbstown Gaeltacht&mdash; Gibbstown has been left out&mdash;and Stackallan which is to one side of Slane.  Deputy Molloy's attitude so far as this amendment is concerned reminds me of a child playing a game of Monoply.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LiamCunningham" hpid="Mr. Cunningham Mr. Cunningham">

    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>The game involves a player being able to hop from one side to another in order to take something he wants.  Deputy Molloy has been playing a little game of Monopoly of his own because he has begun swiping areas throughout the county which bear no relation either to Cavan or to Monaghan.  He thought these places might look well on paper.  Unfortunately, I do not know the rest of the country as well as I know County Meath but I know every stick and stone in Meath and, consequently, I am well aware of what has happened in this case.  Even if I were to say to Deputy Molloy now that I am prepared to accept his amendment, the situation would be unworkable.  We would be the laughing-stock of the country if we were to allow this sort of thing to happen.</P>

In his efforts at this horse trading he must have had some advice from the local people but, whatever advice he may have got, it was not natural to put into Louth the area of Meath that is mentioned in his amendment.

      <P>Before Deputy Crinion left Fine Gael I was dealing with the people from County Meath and giving them good representation.  No matter what way one looks at the proposals in this Bill, they are better than anything proposed by Deputy Molloy.  Even Deputy Wilson, having spoken in favour of Deputy Molloy's amendments, is now wondering why he did not read the Bill first&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>You can have Cavan and Monaghan in beside it.  Deputy Wilson cannot get away from one fact.  While there are areas out towards Leitrim which might be better off or more easily serviced by Leitrim, if we wanted to break county boundaries across the centre, the area of Monaghan and Cavan is between 50 and 55 miles.  I have driven across it during a by-election.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>I am talking about the areas within Monaghan and Cavan. The area which Deputy Wilson is talking about is less than the existing area which is covered by the existing constituency of Meath, without the addition which has been put on to it. It is 60 to 65 miles from one end to the other.  I have travelled it.  Deputy Wilson has less in that area.  He wants to go from where he lives across to the extreme end of Monaghan.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>I know that area very well.  I spent much time in it.  As Deputy Wilson knows, I have been through it.  I also know Deputy Wilson's area well.  Deputy Wilson said that the area of Cavan was well represented down through the years.  It was fairly well represented and so was Monaghan.  I am not quarrelling about that.  It has had good representatives. It will continue to have good representatives but the difference will be that they will have a selection of five representatives.  They will be able to call on five different TDs after the next general election.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>Not on this occasion.  I do not want to delay the House any longer.  I think I have given ample proof that the amendments put down by Deputy Molloy just do not stand up to criticism.  The obvious thing for the Deputy to do is to withdraw them. <Col N="1012" /> I suggest that he should do so now.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesLeonard" hpid="Mr. Leonard Mr. Leonard">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Leonard</NameTxt>
      <P>I make an appeal as I made earlier in the debate to the Minister to examine Deputy Molloy's proposals.  They differ only very slightly from the proposals which I made in a contribution earlier when I asked on that occasion for Monaghan, Cavan and Louth to be three three-seater constituencies and the Minister's own constituency to be a four-seater. This is just a small change. Looking at the map, which we did not do when we were examining the position, I find that Deputy Molloy's proposals are, according to the map, sounder than they seemed to be at first.  The biggest mistake the Minister is making&mdash;and a rural Deputy especially would feel this&mdash;is that he is inclined instead of bringing the population away from Dublin to cluster it in.  He is bringing part of Monaghan into Louth which is a small compact, highly-industrialised county.  It is a heavily populated county.  It is like bringing apples into an orchard.  The Minister is adding to the number of votes in Leinster, an area which has done very well with the additional Deputies.  By doing that the Minister is taking from the province of Ulster where there are three counties&mdash;Monaghan, Cavan and Donegal.  He is reducing representation there from 12 to ten.</P>
      <P>No matter what way you look at this there will be great complaints from people who represent that area. I was thinking of the Minister as the man from God-knows-where while they were talking about Meath. Other representatives here of different political opinions from mine should also make their contributions and complain now about the loss of two seats in Ulster.  If you look at the Monaghan-Cavan constituency you will see that it runs across 70 miles with a border running almost from the Irish Sea to the Atlantic Ocean. Instead of 66 miles, 166 miles would be nearer to it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesLeonard" hpid="Mr. Leonard Mr. Leonard">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Leonard</NameTxt>
      <P>It could be 180 or <Col N="1013" /> 190 miles.  From that point of view it looks as if it would be very unwieldy, leaving out of the question the loss of representation, the loss of the seat.  Deputy Molloy's suggestion is very commendable and the Minister should give serious thought to it.  We spend a lot of time crying about the depopulation of the rural areas.  This Bill is a very effective effort to depopulate them.  Patrick Kavanagh used to talk about 100 years from now.  He was the only notability we had in the county and now even his grave will be in a Leinster constituency.</P>

I drive through that area coming to Dublin and it is very hard to know when you are in Monaghan and when you are in Cavan.  If you look at the map you will see that Deputy Molloy's approach is a commonsense one.  I would ask the Minister to look at it very closely.  He mentioned the by-election in Monaghan but at that time very little mention was made by any of the coalition speakers about the constituencies Bill.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Leonard</NameTxt>
      <P>If the Coalition thought it was a good arrangement and that it would be of benefit to the Monaghan people, they should have stated that in handbills and pamphlets.  Had they suggested that Monaghan-Cavan should be a five-seater that might have been more honest.  The people of Monaghan would have known the thinking of the Coalition Government.  They would have questioned them prior to the election on their stand on the Electoral (Amendment) Bill.  I expected that the Deputies from Donegal, Cavan and Monaghan would have made some sort of a stir when they found that two seats were being taken out of Ulster.  Where we had 12 seats, they are being reduced to ten.  Had it been put on paper that this was the thinking, the result would probably have been different.  The Minister said the National Coalition Government were a good Government and I thought he meant to imply that their type of Government would increase the population of Monaghan-Cavan.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesLeonard" hpid="Mr. Leonard Mr. Leonard">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Leonard</NameTxt>
      <P>The point I am making is that by their effort or by their lack of effort the Government brought about a decline in the small industries and in the small farming incomes and, instead of increasing the population, they had the opposite effect.  That is all I wish to say on it. I would ask the Minister to sleep on it and think over Deputy Molloy's proposals whereby at least he would leave us 11 seats out of the 12 in Ulster and not take the second seat away from us.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>I think Deputy Leonard made a fair speech and made his point with his tongue in his cheek.  Deputy Leonard must have been aware that the voters of Monaghan were quite satisfied to accept that a five-seater was what they wanted because the Bill was being discussed in this House at that time.  I am aware also that the Opposition made the best of the story that in fact they would retain two three-seater constituencies there although the shadow Minister for Local Government&mdash;when he was Minister&mdash;so often had the direct opposite proposed. Therefore, the issue was decided.  If Deputy Leonard wants to say it should have been an issue at the by-election&mdash; it was an issue.  Off platforms in the constituency I stated that it was my proposal to make Monaghan-Cavan a five-seater and our man won the seat. We have got to go by the decision; the National Coalition candidate won the seat.</P>

      <P>Deputy Leonard made a fair case for what he felt was right but he must agree that the decision was made at the by-election.  They all knew what was happening.  Therefore, the people of Monaghan were satisfied that a five-seater was the proper thing.  Deputy Leonard made another comment which I am going to throw back to him.  Perhaps it is unfair but he said that driving around Kingscourt it is difficult to know whether one is in Cavan or Monaghan.  The Bill will settle that problem.  It is true that Cavan and Monaghan are very alike. I know the area very well.  I was born and reared beside it and spent my youth all around there.  At times I would find it extremely difficult to know which was Cavan and which was Monaghan because the people are the same; the land is the same&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>However, we will forgive them that.  I put Enniskeen into <Col N="1018" /> Louth.  But the two Deputies sitting there did not know that there was a place called Enniskeen in their constituency; it is on the border.  Now Deputy Molloy would make a present of it, along with Kingscourt and Shercock, to County Monaghan. Deputy Wilson, who has been defending the ancient kingdom of Breffni, is prepared to allow the marauders&mdash;as he referred to them&mdash; come in from Monaghan and carry it away.  The marauders are entitled to carry it away into Monaghan. Obviously Deputy Wilson is interested only in the area on the Meath-Cavan border.  Perhaps he feels he should look after that end of it and to hell with County Cavan, east Cavan; it does not matter where they go.  If Monaghan wants them they can have them; he does not want them anyway.</P>

I pointed out that Deputy Molloy was taking a big swipe of the ancient kingdom of Meath as well and he was going up one side of Navan nearly to Athboy.  What he was doing that for beats me.  He probably did not know the area but I think the people of that area would not be prepared to accept that they should go into County Cavan.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesLeonard" hpid="Mr. Leonard Mr. Leonard">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Leonard</NameTxt>
      <P>He was not going up as far as Cavan.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>Does Deputy Leonard know Kellstown?  If you go into Kellstown and out by the Gaelic park for about three miles, there is a village called Fordstown and, a short distance from that village there is a place called Girley.  That village, including the church, was to be in Deputy Molloy's Cavan constituency.  Go on towards Athboy, a few miles farther on to a place called Grennanstown. <Col N="1019" /> By some peculiar stretching according to Deputy Molloy, it also was going into the Cavan constituency.</P>
      <P>Deputy Leonard is well aware of the pincer movement around Monaghan. Monaghan is situated in an area almost surrounded by Northern Ireland.  He is aware of this.  Deputy Molloy was doing the same with Kells. He was making one arm of the pincer Cavan and the other arm Monaghan. But he was going even further up; he was going through Castletown and on up to Rathkenny.  Then he was going back across the Gibstown Gaeltacht to Donaghpatrick.  Obviously nobody briefed him on it.  I am sure there was somebody in his party who knew a little about County Meath and who would have been able to tell him that the proposals he was making were too ridiculous for words.  They were almost as ridiculous as those he had before he left office when he was putting a narrow strip across the centre with the town of Ardee and a little bit of Drogheda, along the Boyne.  He was making a constituency out of that.  But, in this particular case he had a new idea.  He put this strip up along until he came very close to Kells, on up within a short distance of Athboy.  Somebody who knew the area looking at it would realise how absolutely foolish it was.  Then he came up the other side, went across by Kells, and then on up until he reached almost to Slane.  I do not know what the dickens was his idea but it seems he went a little bit screwy.  Perhaps he just counted how many there were in that area, then jotted it down and put the whole total together and, if it made what he thought was a constituency, all right&mdash;that filled it in.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Could there be any other explanation for what he did because it is not the action of a reasonable man? When he came to deal with the Louth constituency he agreed with me that that constituency was entitled to four seats but having done so he decided he would take away the arrangements I had made for a small portion of Monaghan, 1,644 people to be added to it and he would, instead, take in <Col N="1020" /> the electoral division of St. Mary's. He must have had local advice on this because he went along the Boyne, turned right and went half way to Balbriggan in a narrow strip along the sea.  When he passed the village where I live he cut into the sea and then decided that little bit would be added on to Louth.  If he was on this side of the House and he did that he would be handing me a nice little constituency. Louth, though small, has a couple of large towns in it and with such a big population it would be a very handy constituency.  It is one of those which would be entitled to four seats.</P>

      <P>Fianna Fáil did not get the votes.  They would not have said no to them if they got them.  As far as Meath is concerned, it comprises the administrative county of Meath except the parts thereof which are comprised in the constituencies of Cavan, Monaghan and Louth.  Deputy Molloy, having cried here with the rest of his party about my dividing <Col N="1021" /> Leitrim into two parts&mdash;they said it was a shocking thing&mdash;now comes along and attempts to divide Meath by taking portion of Monaghan, Cavan and Louth, to add to Meath, thus dividing it four ways.  He considers this would be a reasonable suggestion to make.  He then wants to bring in the district electoral divisions of Cloncurry, Donadea, Kilcock, Ballynadrumny, Cadamstown, Carbury, Carrick, Drehid, Dunfierth, Kilrainy, Windmill Cross, Kilpatrick, Timahoe North, Timahoe South, Balraheen and Maynooth and adds in, from the administrative county of Dublin, Balscadden.  I do not know why he picked on that little village. If he wanted to do it another way he could have taken the nearest point to Meath and, without taking the big bit off Kildare, he could have taken Balbriggan off.  Deputy Burke would have something to say to him if he took Balbriggan off.  Deputy Molloy had prepared for him amendments which he introduced here.  I was critical of the first set of amendments but they were great when compared with the amendments in the second group.</P>

Deputy Molloy had this proposal and he said he spent as many hours preparing it&mdash;I think I am quoting him correctly&mdash;as we had spent discussing the Bill in the House.  He said he spent almost 40 hours preparing the amendments.  He must have put a lot of work into them if that is so.  We now have the result.

    <P>The Minister on a number of occasions referred to proposals, which he claimed I had as Minister, for the revision of these constituencies.

      <P>Deputy Meaney has given me notice of his intention to raise the matter of the part played by the Minister for Defence during the past week in the course of searches for arms.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJVMeaney" hpid="Mr. Meaney Mr. Meaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Meaney</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank you for giving me the opportunity of discussing this matter.  I shall try to bring to your notice and explain to the House the tragic events in regard to the actions of the Minister for Defence in the past week.</P>
      <P>We all know that there have been searches of ships for arms.  I know that the Minister will say that the Government are all for law and order. So are we.  So am I.  What I am worried about is the insecurity of the security of this State and the fact that there seems to be no co-ordination or communication between the Minister for Defence, Deputy Donegan, and the Minister for Justice, Deputy Cooney, in regard to the security of the State. It is only right and proper that if there are attempts illegally to import arms the Army and the Garda Síochána should get every backing to see that they do not arrive.  The Minister did not give this to the Defence Forces.  He was either telling an untruth or he knew something and did not pass on the information.  I am trying to highlight his general behaviour in the time available to me.  Lest there be any misunderstanding, I should like to compliment our Defence Forces and our Garda Síochána for the exemplary way in which they carry out their duties.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We all know that ships have been searched within the past few days but I should like to make reference to two specific searches&mdash;one at Greenore and one at Cork.  The general opinion in the country is that there seems to be no collective responsibility as far as this Government are concerned, that the right hand does not seem to know what the left hand is doing and that the Minister for Defence is not willing to pass on to <Col N="1025" /> the Defence Forces information he has and that when he goes to places looking for publicity, as he went to Greenore, he is only hindering the Defence Forces in the carrying out of their duties.</P>
    <P>On Saturday night, March 24th, 1974, gardaí and troops moved into Greenore as the 1,500-ton general cargo vessel, the <i>Owen Kersten</i>, registered at Hamburg, arrived from Rotterdam having been watched by security forces for a couple of days.  On Sunday last, the 25th, the 1,500-ton freighter, the <i>Vaterland</i>, docked at Cork at 11.10 after sailing from Antwerp.  This ship was supposed to contain illegal arms.  After a police search in the glare of international publicity it was found to contain arms and ammunition but they were, in fact, for the Defence Forces and, for the record, it was blank ammunition.</P>
    <P>This raises many questions regarding security.  The <i>Vaterland</i> docked in Cork on Sunday at 11.10.  There was no guard mounted on it from the time it entered Irish territorial waters. There was no guard on it as it sailed up through Cork harbour.  I am definite that there was no guard, either from the Army or from the Navy, on it until 4 o'clock on Monday evening.  The whole country is asking why it was that unarmed gardaí had to guard the ship from 11.10 on Sunday morning, the 24th, until 4 o'clock on Monday evening, 25th March.  It was quite easy for anybody or any organisation, if they wanted to take away the arms that were on it, to do so.  It was quite easy for them to stop the ship as it came up through Cork harbour.</P>
    <P>The Minister, when questioned on this, made several statements, He said that he was well aware that legally commissioned arms were on the <i>Vaterland</i> and that it was due to dock in Cork.  If he was so aware why did he not communicate with the armed forces, with the Garda authorities and with senior Army officers and tell them that?  It is definite in Cork that it was the gardaí who first informed the Army that the arms were on the ship and <Col N="1026" /> that was on Monday evening at 4 o'clock.  The Minister has made statements to the newspapers, on the radio, everywhere.  I should like to quote from the <i>Evening Press</i> of Tuesday, March 26th.  The Minister said that:</P>
    <P>The security forces were aware that there were arms for the army on board one of the ships.  The ship involved had 89 other items.  The army arms was only one item and they were interested in the others.</P>
    <P>Asked why this was not explained to the press, he said that one of the necessities was that there would be absolute security.</P>
    <P>That is grand and I would wish that there should be absolute security. Where was the security when that ship entered Irish territorial waters? There was no guard mounted on it as it sailed up into Cork city through Cork harbour.  The harbour is not that wide.  It would have been quite easy for any group of armed men&mdash;I do not care who they were or what their purpose&mdash;to stop that ship, board it and take off the cargo.  There was no security and the Army were not sent to guard it until Monday evening, 27 hours after it had docked. There were unarmed gardaí carrying out a search on that ship and doing their duty.  Why did the Minister not make sure that this was not allowed to occur?  It was, indeed, inviting trouble.  It is well known that we never had such inaction in the country as we have at the moment.  Since this Government took office there has been insecurity in the State, there have been jailbreaks, helicopter liftings from prisons and now the greatest muddle of all which, thank God, had no serious consequences.</P>
    <P>I hope what I have said here tonight will bring the Minister to his senses and make him realise that as his Leader said the other day, the time for the fun is over, the time for the buffoonery is over, the time for the gallery and the publicity is over.  The Minister must do his duty to ensure that the security of the State is properly maintained.</P>
    <P>I want the Minister to explain how <Col N="1027" /> it is that a ham radio operator was able to pick up a security message on Saturday, 23rd March, and because he could listen in to two sources he was able to say to the world at large that arms were consigned for Ireland and were on a certain ship.  I read this in the papers but outside of that I was told that this ham radio operator was able to pick up this message. How can we have security if an ordinary ham radio operator, living not far from Cork, can pick up a top security message and relay it to the world at large?  Suppose I was a man out for destruction and a member of an organisation that wanted to get at one of those ships for the arms it would be easy to get a man in that position and get all that information.</P>
    <P>I also want the Minister to state definitely when the arms were commissioned, when they were loaded, at what port and when they were due to arrive in this country.  He talked about the security of this cargo.  There is great security on it now as it is being transferred by road from Cork to Dublin.  The very fact that the Army had to convey it and mount guard on it, as is right and proper, shows that if they knew what was happening on last Sunday and Monday they would have done their job.  They were willing to do their job but the message was not relayed to them.  It was held back on purpose by the Minister for Defence.</P>
    <P>The boat docked at Greenore and was searched by the armed forces, which they were quite entitled to do if they had any suspicions.  What I object to is the Minister for Defence, an ordinary layman like myself, going to the area in the full glare of publicity and taking complete command. What qualifications has he for directing such an operation?  What experience or expertise has he to do this?  There was one other incident in which the Minister became involved which left a very bad taste because he interfered with the course of justice and separated nationals from non-nationals. The non-nationals were let flee from the country when they should have been before our courts.</P>

      <P>I have several complaints but I cannot give the names. However, I can assure the Deputy the men were only too glad to give their names.  They want to be rid of the Minister.  I was looking at television last night when the Minister was questioned on this matter and I thought he made the most derogatory remarks about our Defence Forces. He said it was a routine search at Greenore and that he just came to thank them.  As a matter of fact, he said, &ldquo;I came to thank the Garda fellow and the soldier fellow&rdquo;.  This is typical of the way the squire spoke to his servants.  The fact that the Minister is a member, or at least is associated with the squirearchy may account for this attitude.</P>
      <P>As long as he is Minister I hope he will never interfere again with the Army when they are doing their duty, as they were at Greenore until he arrived.  The Minister also said on television last night that probably he should not talk at all.  I wish he lived by that rule because it would be the greatest blessing to us.  However, any man who is looking for publicity is bound to keep blathering.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When discussing the arms searches the Minister had a good swipe at the Press.  He said that when the Press were deprived of a scoop it was like a lioness losing her cubs.  The Minister has not given satisfactory answers to the questions put to him.  I wish to know if there are other arms on <Col N="1029" /> the high seas, legally commissioned by the Government?  If so, what guarantee has this House and the nation that the Minister knows when they are arriving?  Will he transfer them to the Defence Forces who, no doubt, will mount a proper security guard?</P>

      <P>We should learn a lesson from the past week, otherwise we will be a complete laughing-stock. We are bad enough with what has happened already to our security system but we would have been the laugh of the country if some of these ships had been hijacked and the arms taken.  It is all right to say that there was only blank ammunition but there could also have been live ammunition.</P>
      <P>I hope the Minister will deal fully with events from 11.10 a.m. last Sunday until 4 p.m. on Monday, that he will stand by the statement that he knew all about the arms.  I hope he will tell us why he did not give that information to the Defence Forces who would have taken action had they been kept in the picture.  At that time the Minister was on his way to Greenore to take over from the senior Army officers.  This was dangerous and was resented by the Army authorities.</P>
      <P>There must be collective responsibility in the Government and there must be liaison and co-ordination between the Minister for Defence and the Minister for Justice.  It did not happen in this case and the fact that the Minister did not inform the Defence Forces meant the Garda had to mount guard on a ship in Cork where they were exposed to the danger of an attack by an armed gang.  They were unarmed and had to guard the ship for 27 hours.  That was unfair. It should not have happened and it must not recur.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If the Minister knew the arms were on board the <i>Vaterland</i>, why did he not inform the Defence Forces?  Can one imagine a Minister for Defence saying a few days later that he knew the arms were there all the time, while <Col N="1030" /> the Army were kept out of the area and unarmed gardaí had to take over? The Minister must answer that question. There is only one course open to him: he should resign for the sake of the security of the country and I say that in all honesty.</P>

      <P>I went, as I have done on many occasions, to a place where the Army were working to thank them for their work.  I never pass an Army man engaged in this kind of duty, whether on the Border on elsewhere, without going over to thank him.  I went there and I remained there for five to ten minutes and I was very courteously shown the boat by both the Army and the Garda personnel and I got quite a good insight into the problem confronting them in their search.  Then I went home.  That is what happened at Greenore.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I described it as a routine search and that is how the military described <Col N="1032" /> it to me.  It was under the control of the Garda.  In all these searches there is a certain performance of duties and a certain attention to detail.  That is what I understand by a routine search.</P>
    <P>With regard to Deputy Lemass's query, this matter is so serious I really think we should look at everything that could possibly be thrown up.  Deputy Lemass made the point that there might have been arms on board which might have been got rid of by being dumped overboard.  I take the Deputy's point and I want to inform the House now that on the day in question there were reconnaissance flights by Irish aircraft and one naval vessel was also on the job.  We have, as Deputies are aware, very few naval vessels and not that many aeroplanes either, but Deputies may take it that every possible effort that could be made was made and every action that could be taken was taken.</P>
    <P>When I am asked specifically if I had information, my answer is that I will now read what I am allowed to read from the relevant Army documents relating to the matter&mdash;in other words, that which is not a security risk.  Reliable information was received that one of several ships sailing from Rotterdam might be carrying arms.  Because of that information the necessity arose to search these ships.  In addition, as I have already informed Deputy Lemass, there was a reconnaissance by Irish aircraft and there was the presence of a naval vessel.  That was as much as could physically be done.</P>
    <P>I leave the opinion of the Army on me to the Army.  I do not need Deputy Meaney, or anybody else, to enlighten me on that.  It is for the Army to say whether I am good for them or bad for them, whether I am a good Minister for Defence or a bad Minister for Defence.  That is the position I adopt and accept totally and completely.</P>
    <P>As to the necessity for this sort of search, I would refer first of all to the leading article in <i>The Cork Examiner.</i> Indeed, a large proportion of Deputy Meaney's contribution here tonight was secondhand.  He <Col N="1033" /> apparently borrowed certain lines of approach from this particular leading article.  The article says:</P>
    <P>We do not know what communication there was amongst the security services as regards this operation, but we do know that the Army and the Naval Service denied all knowledge of any ship bringing arms over the weekend.</P>
    <P>I refuse for one moment to accept that any one of my officers went to <i>The Cork Examiner</i> and blathered.  The word &ldquo;blather&rdquo; was used here tonight. No one of my officers&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>There is just no such thing as fair play where Fianna Fáil are concerned.  Lest some Opposition Deputies may feel sympathetic because there may have been some degree, be it great or small, of inconvenience caused to various <Col N="1034" /> people, whoever they may be, or because the security measures adopted may have caused some speculation, then I say to them: &ldquo;Realise what the position is&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>I will quote now the words of the Minister for Justice when moving a Supplementary Estimate for his Department on 12th February, 1974:</P>
      <P>In the same period 330 rifles, 290 pistols and revolvers, 518 grenades, 15 rockets, 4 rocket launchers and a sizeable quantity of explosives were seized by the gardaí, a truly horrifying arsenal.</P>
      <P>That was in the year 1973.</P>
      <P>We have a duty to search and we will search.  It is quite clear that in an operation like this we will not succeed on every occasion.  If one is contending with or operating against a subversive organisation one is aware that the tactic adopted is that of tying up the legitimate forces of the State in different places so that these subversive forces may then cause mischief and misery in an area where the legitimate forces of the State are not immediately available.  At all times we will do our utmost to combat subversive organisations and our very best has been, is being and will be done.</P>
      <P>Let us come now to the kernel of this whole matter.  I have here the report from the secretariat of my Department.  According to that report on 19th March, information was received from the shipping agents and the manufacturers' agents that a quantity of defensive equipment was being shipped on the <i>Vaterland</i> due to arrive in Dublin on the 27th of this month.  On the Saturday, 23rd March, information was received that one of some six ships sailing from a continental port might be carrying arms. The ships concerned did not include the <i>Vaterland.</i> The necessary security arrangements were initiated.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>At 1.30 p.m. troops were called out in aid of the civil power in connection with the search of the <i>Owen Kirsten</i> at Greenore.  At about the same time word was received from two sources that a ship carrying arms was seen off the south coast.  This was apparently <Col N="1035" /> the <i>Vaterland</i>, a sister ship of one of the suspect vessels.  The <i>Vaterland</i> moored off Whitegate about midnight.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Donegan</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Meaney really should listen and I would remind Deputy Fitzgerald that it is the security of this State that is at risk in this whole matter.</P>
      <P>The <i>Vaterland</i> docked in Cork at 11.15 a.m. after having been under Garda surveillance, and was later boarded by a party of gardaí and detectives.</P>
      <P>Word was conveyed to the gardaí at Cork, to Detective-Sergeant Thorne of Union Quay station, at his home, by the command duty officer that there were stores for the Defence Forces on the <i>Vaterland</i> and the military authorities advised that a full search of the <i>Vaterland</i> should be undertaken, and quite rightly so.</P>
      <P>A military party was requested from Collins Barracks, Cork, at 9.30 a.m. and provided at 10.30 a.m.  So much for Deputy Meaney's allegation that there was only a party of unarmed gardaí on duty for a period of 24 hours, and no Army until 4 p.m. on Monday, 25th March.</P>
      <P>The search was the responsibility of the Garda and under their direction and control.  The military were assisting the Garda.  In each case the Minister for Defence was concerned to the extent that the military were involved in these searches, but they did not have responsibility for decisions to search or for the conduct of the searches.  That was a matter entirely for the Garda.</P>
      <P>But I was deeply interested.  I wanted to ensure the searches were done and I wanted to back up the Army.  I was there in Greenore for ten minutes and, please God, I will be there again should circumstances demand it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The search of the German ship <i>Vaterland</i> was not occasioned by any lack of information on the part of the Garda that the military stores the vessel was carrying were for the Defence Forces.  The reasons for searching <Col N="1036" /> the vessel are a matter for the Garda.</P>

      <P>The person concerned was allowed an old age non-contributory pension at the weekly rate of £5.15 from 7th December, 1973, on the recommendation of the social welfare officer who assessed his weekly means at £4.83 which included £3.87 from earnings.  This is the appropriate rate of pension where weekly means exceed £4.00 but do not exceed £5.00. The pension committee subsequently decided that he was entitled to a pension at the weekly rate of £6.15 which is the rate payable to a person whose weekly means do not exceed £4.00.</P>

      <Col N="908" /> The social welfare officer appealed against the committee's decision.</P>
    <P>The claimant has now furnished a medical certificate, dated 22nd March, 1974, showing that he is incapable of work.  Consequently it has been accepted that his weekly means do not exceed £4.00 and a pension at the full weekly rate of £6.15 has been awarded to him from 7th December, 1973.  A supplementary pension book covering the increase and arrears of pension have been issued to him.</P>
