      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Foreign Affairs whether, in view of the action of the British, German and French Governments in negotiating, with the oil-producing countries, he considers that this country is still bound by the Copenhagen Declaration of December, 1973.</P>

      <P>The heads of State or Government meeting in Copenhagen on 14th-15th December, 1973, agreed on the necessity for the Community to take effective action on the lines set out in the communiqué issued after the meeting.  The communiqué has been placed in the Oireachtas Library.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Action on each of the measures envisaged is proceeding according to a timetable of work drawn up by the <Col N="1108" /> Commission subsequent to the summit meeting.  Already the Council has adopted two such measures, namely a decision setting up an energy committee and a regulation on information for the establishment of comprehensive energy balance sheets for the Community.  The deadline of 28th February, 1974, for a Community programme on alternative sources of energy has not, of course, been reached but work proceeds.  All member states are accordingly in course of complying with the recommendations of the Copenhagen Summit in the energy field.</P>
    <P>Negotiations by individual member states with oil producing countries are not contrary to the terms of the Copenhagen Summit communiqué.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>The summit meeting was not one at which different Governments put forward different proposals.  It was one for the heads of State of different Governments to discuss problems together and out of that certain proposals emerged.  We did not put forward specific proposals nor, indeed, did the other Governments.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Loughnane</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Foreign Affairs if he is aware that the British Army are now supplied with the &ldquo;sound&rdquo; weapon; and if he will make representations to the British Government against its inhuman use in Ireland.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Dr. FitzGerald Dr. FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>It is presumed that the Deputy is referring to earlier reports of the existence of a machine said to produce both very high frequency, and very low frequency sound in the ears of those within its range.  The British authorities have again been asked whether there is any intention on their part to use such a device.  They have reaffirmed that they do not possess a device such as described in those reports and, moreover, are not aware of the existence of any such device.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BillLoughnane" hpid="Dr. Loughnane Dr. Loughnane">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Loughnane</NameTxt>
      <P>The reply given by the Minister today is exactly the same as the reply he gave to a similar question on 23rd October, 1973.  At that time I believed the Minister but since then&mdash;six weeks ago in fact&mdash;I read in some British newspapers that the British Army have this weapon which is completely inhuman.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanTreacy" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Seán Treacy">

    <Speaker pid="BillLoughnane" hpid="Dr. Loughnane Dr. Loughnane">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Loughnane</NameTxt>
      <P>Did the Minister make any request to the British Government on this matter because his reply is the same as that given in October? I am in possession of knowledge, gained from the British Press, that the British Army is in possession of this inhuman weapon. Is the Minister aware of the inhuman nature of the sound weapon, of the fact that it is not selective in its recipients and that it can harm people within ten miles?  It can deafen them and the British Army have that weapon in Northern Ireland.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Dr. FitzGerald Dr. FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I am afraid the Deputy was misinformed on this point.  Not only have they not got it but they are not aware of the existence of such a device.  It is possible that the Deputy is confusing it with something else but the Deputy is incorrect in his point.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BillLoughnane" hpid="Dr. Loughnane Dr. Loughnane">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Loughnane</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not confusing it at all.  I am aware that the British Army have this weapon, having read British Press reports.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Dr. FitzGerald Dr. FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>Concern has again been expressed to the British authorities regarding the decision to authorise the use of CR gas in Northern Ireland, particularly in view of the reported continuing doubts of scientific and medical experts as to the adequacy of the tests of its possible toxic and long-term effects.</P>

    <P>5.</P>
    <Speaker pid="HughGibbons" hpid="Dr. Gibbons Dr. Gibbons">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Gibbons</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Foreign Affairs if it is obligatory for members of the United Nations to register with it all treaties and agreements between them; if so, the purpose of registration; whether such registration gives any function to the United Nations to initiate discussions on such treaties or agreements or to give interpretations of any section of them that may, at any future date, be a subject of dispute between the contracting members.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Dr. FitzGerald Dr. FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>Article 102 of the United Nations Charter provides that every treaty and every international agreement entered into by any member of the United Nations shall be registered with the secretariat and published by it.  I understand that the purpose of the provision, which is based on a similar provision in the Covenant of the League of Nations, was to prevent secret treaties which were thought to have been an important contributory cause of the first world war.  Unless registered a treaty or agreement may not be invoked before any organ of the United Nations.  Registration does not of itself give any function to the United Nations to discuss such treaties or agreements or to adjudicate on their interpretation in the event of a dispute between the parties.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>If that is the case, can the Minister state why it was necessary to write a specific indication into the Sunningdale communiqué that it would be registered when he tells us now that there was such a provision under the United Nations?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Dr. FitzGerald Dr. FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>That is a separate question.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>If an international agreement has to be registered under the UN regulations why was it specifically written in?</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy's question relates to the United Nations.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="Mr. J. Lynch Mr. J. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>Is it a fair interpretation of the Minister's answer that the fact of registration adds nothing to the agreement on its face?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Col N="1112" />
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Dr. FitzGerald Dr. FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>Perhaps the Deputy did not follow my reply.  I said that unless registered a treaty or agreement may not be invoked before any organ of the United Nations.  Registration does not of itself give any function to the United Nations to discuss such treaties or agreements or to adjudicate on their interpretation. There is an effect in that it enables parties to invoke them, whereas a treaty could not be invoked for the United Nations otherwise.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="Mr. J. Lynch Mr. J. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the invoking of such an agreement give the United Nations some rights of interpretation of its contents?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Dr. FitzGerald Dr. FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>The question of what it meant could arise in the debate.  For example, the Security Council could take account of the agreement and make a recommendation on a dispute.  Obviously in making a recommendation on a dispute and in taking account of an agreement it would have to make its interpretation of the agreement.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>Is it not a fact that once such an agreement is registered with the United Nations the International Court of Justice at The Hague has a function in interpreting it?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Dr. FitzGerald Dr. FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>Such an agreement could be referred to the International Court of Justice but only with the consent of both parties.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>

      <P>Permanent members of the Security Council cannot use the veto to prevent discussion of any matter.</P>
      <P>The relevant rule is contained in Article 27.2 of the charter which provides that decisions of the Council on procedural matters shall be made by the affirmative vote of nine Members. The unanimous affirmative vote of the permanent members is not required for such decisions.</P>

      <P>I would refer the Deputy to the Council Resolution of 17th December, 1973, on industrial policy which adopted a time-table for the realisation of the first stage of the programme provided for in the Paris Summit communiqué.  This programme sets out the priorities and deadlines for the abolition of technical barriers to trade in foodstuffs and industrial products.</P>
      <P>Apart from its primary end in liberalising trade, the programme also bears on consumer interests in so far as health, safety and composition standards are concerned and on the environment in certain respects, for example, maximum lead content in motor fuels, maximum sulpher content in domestic fuel oils, permissible noise level of mopeds, motorcycles, civil engineering plant, water pollution by pleasure boats, and so on.</P>
      <P>The full text of the resolution, which is quite lengthy, will be found in Vol. 16, No. C 117, of the Official Journal of the European Communities of 31st December, 1973, a copy of which has been placed in the Dáil Library.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Dr. FitzGerald Dr. FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>With your permission, a Cheann Chomhairle, I propose to take Questions Nos. 13 and 14 together.</P>
      <P>The Government fully accept the commitment set out in the communiqué after the Paris Summit in October, 1972 to transform, before the end of the present decade, and with the fullest respect for the treaties already signed, the whole complex of the relations of the member States of the Communities into a European Union.  This commitment was, of course, also accepted by the previous Head of Government.</P>
      <P>In my statement of foreign policy in the Dáil on 9th May of last year I expressed dissatisfaction with the present very indirect form of democratic control in the Community, which, among other things, at present makes the Community and its institutions appear remote to the peoples of Europe.  Setting out the attitude we would adopt in our approach to the establishment of a European Union, I said that it would be unacceptable to us as to others that policies under an economic and monetary union should not be under adequate democratic control, which could involve a strengthening of the powers of the European Parliament and, in time, possibly also a movement towards the implementation of the qualified majority voting system in the Council.</P>
      <P>These are among the principles which will serve as guidelines for the Government's contribution to the drawing up of a report on European Union.  The institutions of the Community (Parliament, Council, Commission and Court of Justice) were given a mandate by the Paris Summit to draw up such a report, before the end of 1975; the Copenhagen Summit asked that this work be accelerated. The Government's contribution will be made in the context of the Council which decided on 5th February, 1974, that its Committee of Permanent Representatives, aided possibly by an expert working group, should prepare a draft report for submission to it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In accordance with our desire to obtain in the short-term increased <Col N="1119" /> powers for the European Parliament the Government have supported proposals to give greater budgetary powers to the Parliament.  These proposals are at present under consideration by the Council.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NoelTLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>In the Minister's view is any progress being made towards the achievement of this communiqué or do things look less optimistic at the moment?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Dr. FitzGerald Dr. FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>It is encouraging that the Copenhagen Summit decided to accelerate the work but there are, of course, other aspects of the present state of the Community which are a bit discouraging and which suggest that it would be difficult to make much progress with this work, perhaps in the immediate future.  In other words, there is a state of will to speed things up, but there may be problems about getting a concerted will towards a solution in the immediate future.  We have two years to do this work which is to be completed by the end of 1975 and, hopefully, within that time the situation will improve and the Community may pull together rather better and come up with a satisfactory solution as to what a European Union should be and how it should function.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Dr. FitzGerald Dr. FitzGerald">

    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Dr. FitzGerald Dr. FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>Not at this stage, I think.  The first thing is for us to <Col N="1121" /> clear our minds on what we believe would be in our own interest which is, I think, more complicated than it appears to be in some cases at first sight.  It is not always easy to be certain what particular line will be most in our own interest in the long run.  When one is clear on that one would seek at the conference&mdash;perhaps before it but more likely at it&mdash; allies on these issues.  The Deputy will be aware that the permanent representative to the United Nations, Mr. Con Cremin, who has just retired, has been asked to take on the leadership of the Irish delegation because we feel that this is a matter of very great importance and that his long experience and great ability will enable him to put forward the Irish case effectively at that conference.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>It is because of its complexities that I raised the matter. I am aware of how complex it is.  I suggest that after the Minister studies it he should, as soon as possible, seek other kindred views on the matter. Would the Minister accept that there is an indication that there will be a wide range of different views which can hardly be resolved at the conference unless proposals have been discussed in advance?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Dr. FitzGerald Dr. FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>The conference goes through a number of stages. What usually happens at a conference of this kind is that you have a formal opening session, then you have a session where you get down to the problems and isolate them and see what problems it is hard to get agreement on, and then you have another session some months later during which people have time to consult with each other and you then move towards a conclusion.  That is the kind of programme here because there is a second session to be held in Caracas in Venezuela from 20th June to 29th August.  There will be a third session in Vienna in Austria as well.</P>

Until the recent outbreak of hostilities between China and South Vietnam the dispute has been confined to conflicting legal claims.</P>
      <P>Ireland as a member of the United Nations is committed to the peaceful settlement of such disputes.  Consequently, we would hope that the parties to the dispute would resort to the means available to them under the United Nations Charter for its peaceful resolution.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>

      <P>Could I ask the Minister how many Ministers with portfolios attended at that Council of Ministers?  I asked the Minister to specify the Ministers of the Member States who attended.  How many, in fact, did attend?</P>

    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Dr. FitzGerald Dr. FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>It is a bit complicated. Our system of terminology here as regards Ministers and portfolios is different from what it is in some of those countries.  I will put it this way.  There were Ministers for Foreign Affairs there from Belgium, Germany, Ireland, Luxembourg, The Netherlands and the United Kingdom. They were in some cases accompanied by other Ministers and in the case of other countries like Italy a Minister with special responsibility for regional policy was there.  The Deputy will see the reply.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>As the Deputy is aware, on 31st July, 1973, the Commission of the European Communities communicated to the Council of Ministers a proposal for a Council regulation establishing a regional development fund.  Subsequently, on 11th October, 1973, the Commission transmitted to the Council a proposal for a Council regulation on the list of regions and areas which the Commission considers should benefit from the fund.  Subsequent consideration within the Council has centred on the vital questions of the size and distribution of the proposed fund.</P>
      <P>At the Council meeting on 17th-18th December, 1973, it was agreed to resume discussions in the month of January, 1974, since it was not possible, following examination in depth of the basic problems arising in respect of the proposed regional development fund, to arrive at a satisfactory decision prior to the deadline of 1st January, 1974, set by the Paris Summit Conference of 19th-20th October, 1972, and by the Copenhagen Summit Conference on 14th-15th December, 1973.</P>
      <P>Following further exploration of the positions of the various member States, it was agreed at the Council meeting on 30th January, 1974, to invite the Commission to submit to the Council revised proposals in respect of the fund for consideration at a special meeting which was originally to have been held on 18th February, 1974.  This meeting has now been postponed and a revised date has yet to be agreed.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister accept that the attitude of the Council towards the regional fund is tied up with, for instance, the energy crisis within the Community?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Dr. FitzGerald Dr. FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not sure what the Deputy means by &ldquo;tied up with&rdquo;.  There was a form of linkage established by the British Government for a brief period between agreeing to establish the energy committee and agreeing to a regional fund but at the last meeting&mdash;I think it was&mdash;they withdrew that linkage.  Whether countries in the attitude they adopt are in any way motivated by considerations connected with the energy crisis is something on which I could not express a view.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware of the statement made by Chancellor Brandt prior to the Copenhagen Summit in which he said that if the Community could not reach a common position on the energy crisis the Rome Treaty was not worth the paper it was written on?  Is that not an indication that this common stance is a condition of developments in this and in other areas?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Dr. FitzGerald Dr. FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I think certain countries, particularly Germany and the Netherlands, are very concerned with that point of view and, indeed, have expressed it quite strongly but that problem has to a large extent been overcome since then as the withdrawal of the British linkage indicates. Although the Washington Conference cannot be said to have been successful from the Community's point of view, in view of the division between one country and the other eight in the formulation of the final communiqué, the difficulties to which the German Chancellor referred at that time seem to have been somewhat mitigated at Washington.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>I am impressed by the Minister's optimism.  I appreciate that this is a major issue which cannot be resolved at Question Time.  Is the Minister now optimistic that these discussions will be concluded towards the implementation of an effective <Col N="1127" /> regional fund which would have significant benefits for Ireland?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Dr. FitzGerald Dr. FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I think that the division in the Community at Washington does create a problem for reaching agreement on a number of items although it may, perhaps, have ameliorated some German problems <i>vis-á-vis</i> some of the other Member States.  It does create a fresh problem which quite evidently has been an obstacle already to holding the meeting that was to have taken place last Monday to settle this issue. In view of the cancellation of that meeting and the fact that we have not yet fixed an alternative date, I would not want to express great optimism on a solution in the immediate future. At the same time, I do not want to suggest that this is impossible or necessarily unlikely but I do not want to mislead the House into thinking that the present situation in the Community is satisfactory or conducive to reaching agreement on a major issue of this kind.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>One last supplementary&mdash;I understand that this is not a matter within the control of the Minister or of all of them&mdash;but the Minister will recollect that from time to time in the course of negotiations and discussions he has expressed optimism as to what was happening at these consultations.  Does the Minister now accept that the grounds for his optimism were apparently not there in fact?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Dr. FitzGerald Dr. FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I have expressed the view that the Irish share as originally proposed was inadequate, that we could not agree to any solution that did not significantly increase that and I expressed myself as hopeful as to our success in achieving such an increase. I remain hopeful on that point, but what has happened is that in the last month or two difficulties have arisen about the size of the fund which is a separate and new issue, rather than the question of the Irish share.  That is an aspect of it about which I am pessimistic but I am quite optimistic that if and when they come to agree on the size of the fund a solution will be found which will be significantly more <Col N="1128" /> favourable to Ireland than the solution originally proposed.</P>

      <P>The German Government did not indicate its tentative doubts about the size of the fund or give any indication about these from the month of July until I think the month of September.

      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>The Council of Ministers is considering at present proposals from the Commission of the European Communities for the establishment of a regional development fund and the conditions under which it will operate.  Until agreement is reached on such matters as the eventual size and the manner of distribution of the proposed fund's resources it is not possible to supply at this time the information sought by the Deputy. However, the general tendency of expenditure from the fund will be to create industrial employment or infrastructures related closely to industrial development so that expenditure on arterial drainage will remain a matter solely for national administration.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesLeonard" hpid="Mr. Leonard Mr. Leonard">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Leonard</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Dr. FitzGerald Dr. FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>We have been pressing for a wide definition of infrastructural investment for the purposes of this fund but that is resisted by a number of countries who wish to confine the fund to industrial investment and infrastructural investment closely related to particular industrial projects.  That is why I do not express optimism about arterial drainage being brought within it.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Dr. FitzGerald Dr. FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>The position here is that agriculture is excluded because it is covered by the FEOGA Fund and the regional fund is intended to deal with industry and services such as tourism, not with agriculture.</P>

    <Speaker pid="LiamCunningham" hpid="Mr. Cunningham Mr. Cunningham">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cunningham</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Dr. FitzGerald Dr. FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>That is a separate question but the FEOGA Fund and its distribution was largely, if not completely determined before we adhered to the Community.  What the Deputy is really asking is whether arterial drainage can be financed by assistance from the FEOGA Fund. That is a separate question which I would not attempt to answer here.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnCallanan" hpid="Mr. Callanan Mr. Callanan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Callanan</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware that the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Finance gave me a very straight answer when he said there was no money available from the EEC for drainage?  I want to know what effort has been made to see that money is made available because it is vital to the survival of the west of Ireland that money be made available.  We were told in a straight answer that money was not available for the Board of Works.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Dr. FitzGerald Dr. FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>That is a separate question.  There is no fund at the moment in existence or proposed by the Commission from which money could be available.  I say that subject to correction on the question of arterial drainage because I have not the information here.  So far as funds are concerned there must be a proposal by the Commission to establish a fund.  The question here relates to the regional fund and as far as it is concerned I have indicated that it does not look as if arterial drainage can be financed from that.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Foreign Affairs if he has had any recent communications with the British Government with regard to jurisdiction over the island of Rockall; the outcome of these discussions, if any; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Dr. FitzGerald Dr. FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>There have been no communications on the matter since the Deputy last raised the question in the House on 29th November.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>I take it the present position is that the Government still do not recognise Britain's claim but intend to do nothing to pursue a claim on our behalf?  Is that the position?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Dr. FitzGerald Dr. FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>The Government intend to pursue their position that the question of a claim to the Rock as such does not give entitlement to rights in the area around the rock. After the initial British action in regard to Rockall, its annexation in 1955, the matter has been let rest since.  To pursue a claim at this stage would be to cast doubts on the very contention on which we are resting our case, that such annexation of such a rock does not, in fact, entitle people to such claim.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>I appreciate that the Minister seems to be expressing a new concept of law and we will not argue that now.  Could he give any <Col N="1134" /> indication what this Government intend to do to protect the interests if any, which we may have or could have in the resources around that island, apart from saying that they do not accept Britain's claim?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Dr. FitzGerald Dr. FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>That is the necessary action to protect our position at this stage.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister has said nothing beyond saying we question their claim.  I am asking him what we are doing to establish our claim?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Dr. FitzGerald Dr. FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I should, perhaps, add that the question of the median line between Irish and British waters for the purpose of oil exploration, and so on, is something which we will be negotiating with Britain in due course and in that negotiation in the first instance we will be concerned with the Celtic sea.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>Frankly, I cannot see anything concrete or positive in what the Minister has said.  Could I ask him at least to ensure that the jurisdiction on this island would be a matter for discussion at the proposed conference on the law of the sea, if the Minister cannot resolve it in the meantime by establishing a claim to it?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>If the Minister cannot resolve it by discussing it with the British Government directly, would he ensure that this matter of the jurisdiction over Rockall is discussed at the international conference?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Dr. FitzGerald Dr. FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>To date I have not made representations to the Syrian Government in regard to Israeli prisoners of war.  As the Deputy is aware, continuing negotiations at the highest levels by intermediaries in the Arab-Israeli conflict are in progress. It is not felt that a unilateral approach to the Syrian Government at this point would serve a useful purpose in view of the sensitive and delicate nature of these negotiations.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Briscoe</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister not agree that he is well known for his sentiments in regard to apartheid and would he not agree that this refusal by the Syrian Government to release the names of prisoners held <Col N="1142" /> by them to the International Red Cross is a question that transcends all considerations in the name of common humanity?

      <P>The European Youth Foundation which was set up by the Committee of Minister's of the Council of Europe in May, 1972, began operations in May, 1973, when its secretariat was established.</P>
      <P>The Report of the foundation for 1973 is not yet available but is expected to be presented to the governing board next April.</P>
      <P>Funds available to the foundation for 1973 amounted to 3.7 million French francs, equivalent to approximately £330,000.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>During 1973 the foundation paid out a total of 1.6 million French <Col N="1145" /> francs, equivalent to £143,000.  This expenditure covered contributions towards general administrative expenses of 14 international youth organisations and towards the expenses of 32 meetings organised by youth organisations.  As the foundation was operational only for a part of the year 1973, there was a substantial surplus in that year which is carried over into 1974.</P>

      <P>I am trying to inform the Deputy and the House but if they interrupt me I cannot do it. After the time when the briefing was given a decision was taken by the conference itself to place an embargo on Press releases, not to have Press briefings or releases.  Initially, a misunderstanding prevailed to the effect that the briefing given by our delegation had been given after the embargo when, in fact, it was given before.  If, of course, it had been given after the embargo it would have been a breach of faith and there was genuine concern expressed by some other delegations about the point.  However, our explanation, when given, was fully and, I might say, cordially accepted by all parties and this episode was then happily closed.</P>

    <Title>Control of Exports (Temporary Provisions) Act, 1956 (Continuance) Bill, 1974: Second Stage.</Title>
    <Speaker pid="JustinKeating" hpid="Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. Keating) Justin Keating">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. Keating)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>The Control of Exports (Temporary Provisions) Act, 1956, which was enacted for a period of three years and has been renewed at the end of each three-year period, will expire on 31st March, 1974.</P>
      <P>The purpose of this Bill is to continue the 1956 Act in force until 31st December, 1977.</P>
      <P>The Act empowers the Minister for Industry and Commerce to prohibit by order, the export of industrial goods save under a licence issued by him.  Such orders have a life of 12 months only and may be annulled by resolution of either House of the Oireachtas at any time during that period.  Control is at present in force on a range of goods under the Control of Exports (No. 2) Order, 1973, and the Control of Exports (Southern Rhodesia) Order, 1973.</P>
      <P>On Ireland's accession to the European Communities it became necessary to harmonise our legislation relating to export controls with that of the Community subject to the concessions relating to specific commodities which had been negotiated for Ireland in the Treaty of Accession. In effect, this resulted in a continuance of our existing export controls with a single exception, horns and hooves, and a control on the export of pure copper waste and scrap was added in order to comply with the Community export control on this scrap.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As a member State of the EEC, Ireland is, of course, obliged to comply with the requirements of Community law in the context of trade in ferrous and non-ferrous waste and scrap to Third Countries.  Since the <Col N="1155" /> supplies of iron and steel scrap and of waste and scrap of aluminium, lead, zinc and copper alloy arising in this country are essential to the needs of Irish users, it is in our interest to apply the Community controls on the shipment of these scrap metals to Third Countries.  As regards trade in them to the Community markets we are entitled to maintain our controls on scrap of non-ferrous metals until 1st July, 1975, and on iron and steel scrap until 31st December, 1977.</P>
    <P>For the following reasons, therefore, I consider it necessary to have continuing powers to maintain the existing export controls and to enact the appropriate legislation for the purpose:</P>
    <P>(a)  to conserve supplies of scarce raw materials, e.g., scrap metals, for the benefit of home industry;</P>
    <P>(b)  to ensure that strategic materials are not exported from this country to undesirable destinations, or that this country is not used as a base for such trade from elsewhere;</P>
    <P>(c)  to comply with the mandatory resolution adopted by the United Nations Security Council requiring member States to prevent the export of goods to Southern Rhodesia;</P>
    <P>(d)  to have immediately available a means of dealing with any emergency which might denude the country of essential materials before corrective legislation could be enacted and to impose such new export controls as may be required in the interest of Irish and Community users up to 31st December, 1977.</P>
    <P>For the reasons mentioned I commend this Bill to the favourable consideration of Dáil Éireann.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JosephBrennan" hpid="Mr. Brennan Mr. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with the necessity to have this legislation continued. I note what the Minister states about the termination of the legislation. I thought, since it is a Bill which enables the Minister to make orders <Col N="1156" /> of various kinds in relation to various products and materials, the actual termination of the legislation, as such, was not important; that it might be necessary to retain it indefinitely. One can always foresee the possibility of controls being needed in many directions.</P>
      <P>The Minister did not state&mdash;but he will confirm, I am sure, to the House &mdash;whether these controls include, at any stage, the export of timber grown in this country, whether from our new forests or old standing timber.  I always have a sort of grievance about this because we have been exporting a considerable quantity of forest timber for some time and have left ourselves in a position where we have not sufficient raw material either for a pulp industry or an expansion of the chipboard industry.  Some time ago, when the Minister was in Opposition we had proposals for the erection of a chipboard industry in the north west of Ireland&mdash;perhaps in my own county, or convenient to it&mdash;and the forestry people continually advised us that the raw materials were not sufficient to support a third chipboard industry.  Indeed, so much was the stockpiling with the existing two industries at the time that everything would so indicate and, I believe, was contrived to so indicate at the time. In the meantime, exports of forest thinnings, which would have been admirably suitable for either pulp or chipboard, continued at a very high rate.  I am not happy that the controls we exercised were sufficient.  I say that because it is the first opportunity I have had of referring to legislation which embodies restrictive controls on exports.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I understand that hides, skins and pelts, as well as scrap metals, were some of the things which were controlled originally by separate legislation but after 1956 the Minister was enabled to make orders to control them.  I think it essential that we have legislation of this kind in perpetuity. I am not too clear on the Minister's terminal date of 1977.  Is this to comply with an EEC regulation which precludes us having legislation such as this or are we restricted from controlling <Col N="1157" /> exports to Third Countries after 1977?  Will we continue to have the power to impose restrictions?  Will there be a prohibition of exports of any material after 1977 to any country?  The public are looking for an answer to mineral resources.  I sought to have a question raised today which is of urgent public importance&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>In relation to the control of exports which will be exercised by orders made under this legislation, we are in need of legislation which will monitor monopolies, mergers and take-overs.  This is a matter of urgent public importance. Irrespective of decisions made officially or otherwise, it is relevant to refer to the need for legislation when dealing with the restriction of exports.  This would go further than the powers conferred on the Minister in this Bill. This legislation would not be suitable for the type of exercise the Minister might have to perform in relation to mineral resources or to take action to prevent what is happening or threatening to happen.</P>
      <P>As I have already stated, it is of grave concern that legislation be introduced to deal with monopolies, mergers and take-overs.  This is a weapon which should be in the hands of the Minister.  It could be used to the best purpose in accordance with each situation as it presents itself.  The Minister might take the opportunity, when replying, to make a statement on this.  That statement would be welcomed by the House and the country generally.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have no objections to the continuance of the powers provided in <Col N="1158" /> the Control of Exports (Temporary Provisions) Act, 1956.  Will the Minister tell us whether, after 1977, which is the terminal date in this two-section Bill, he will have retained any powers to deal with exports to countries, whether member countries of the EEC or Third Countries?</P>
    <P>The scope of the Bill does not enable me to extend the debate, if my contribution is to be relevant.  I am sorry that the Ceann Comhairle did not permit me to discuss the question which I sought to raise today. While I disagree, I must comply with his ruling.  I will raise the matter on a more appropriate occasion.</P>
    <P>Our exports are varied, complicated and important.  So far as home production is concerned, raw materials are very important.  Because of inflation which we cannot control, the price of imported raw materials is increasing.  For that reason it is necessary that we reserve as far as possible our natural resources of raw materials.</P>
    <P>I should like the Minister when introducing this Bill to have given an outline of the variety of products which were controlled in the past.  If he has a list available, the House would be interested to have it in his reply.  To what extent will these controls be necessary in the future?</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnFOConnell" hpid="Dr. O'Connell Dr. O'Connell">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Connell</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Brennan mentioned sheepskins and hides. There is a restriction on the export of sheepskins and licences are required. Vested interests are responsible for this restrictive practice.  How does the Minister view this?  To protect these vested interests his predecessor restricted export licences.  It was argued at that time that sheepskins were necessary and vital to Irish industry, whereas hides were equally, if not more, essential.  I could never understand the logic of this argument put forward on every occasion by the Department of Industry and Commerce because this was a restrictive practice and served no purpose in protecting Irish industry.  Will the Minister have this investigated or have our regulations been changed to come into line with the EEC regulations?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1159" /> The Minister said we must:</P>
    <P>...comply with the mandatory resolution adopted by the United Nations Security Council requiring member States to prevent the export of goods to Southern Rhodesia.</P>
    <P>I support this.  Does the Department get reports as to how the other member States of the United Nations are complying with this regulation? It appears to me that they are not. We, as a Government who are complying with the regulation, should insist that the other members comply too.  There is evasion.  We support the policy which denounces the regime in Southern Rhodesia.</P>
    <P>I should like to refer to the scarcity of raw materials, especially scrap metal.  The Minister said that it would be necessary:</P>
    <P>to have immediately available a means of dealing with any emergency which might denude the country of essential materials before corrective legislation could be enacted and to impose such new export controls as may be required in the interest of Irish and Community users up to 31st December, 1977.</P>
    <P>An interesting aspect of this is, would this not give us power to prevent the export of the actual raw material, the mineral resources of our country, before the necessary legislation comes into effect?  As was pointed out recently, we are in the same position as the Arabs are at present in that they have an essential raw material and they are imposing restrictions on its export.  We will now be given power, with the aid of these regulations and before the necessary legislation comes into effect, to deal with this.  This aspect should be borne in mind by the Minister.  We can restrict the export of the mineral resources of our country and this is very important.</P>
    <P>I was delighted to hear Deputy Brennan state he was going to support the Minister in any action he proposes to take to prevent the loss of our valuable mineral resources.  Deputy Brennan stated that he wanted to see <Col N="1160" /> proper legislation introduced to protect these mineral resources and that we must see that the people benefit from these.  It is great to hear such a responsible statement from Deputy Brennan.  From the response of the Minister it was obvious he appreciated it.  It is important that we look at this, and to the vast wealth that is in our country, to ensure that we protect this wealth and that the people benefit from this wealth.</P>
    <P>It has been admitted, not so much by ourselves but by experts abroad, that we are, perhaps, one of the wealthiest countries in Europe at present. However, it will be a sad state of affairs if foreigners can gain control over our mineral resources to such an extent that we are powerless.  The only way we can do something about that is by the application of the Control of Exports (Temporary Provisions) Act, 1956 (Continuance) Bill, 1974.  We should use this, if necessary, to ensure that our mineral resources are preserved and reserved for the benefit of the people.  I hope the Minister will take speedy action to ensure that the interests of the Irish people are safeguarded in protecting our mineral resources.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FlorenceCrowley" hpid="Mr. Crowley Mr. Crowley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Crowley</NameTxt>
      <P>Like the other speakers I welcome this Bill.  Any Bill that will conserve supplies of raw materials, particularly at this time, is welcome.  The Fianna Fáil spokesman on Industry and Commerce, Deputy Brennan, mentioned the question of timber.  At present we are involved in the export, to a considerable extent, of another very scarce raw material, oil.  I believe 95,000 tons per annum is being exported in various forms. Would the Minister not consider it desirable that in present circumstances he should invoke the clauses in this Bill to ensure that we have this very valuable basic commodity kept at home?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A lot of our people are unable to go ahead in manufacturing industries, in agriculture and in the economic life of this country because there are restrictions on the sale of and allocation of oil but, at the same time, we are exporting in the region of 95,000 tons of oil per annum.  If this Bill was <Col N="1161" /> brought into operation in this case it would be complying exactly with the terms of conserving supplies of any scarce raw materials.</P>
    <P>I should like the Minister to let us know what consultations he has had with industrialists in relation to what are scarce raw materials.  The obvious ones are there for all of us to see but there may be other materials that are not so obvious.  Industrialists may not be aware that when this legislation is in operation they can appeal to the Minister to use his powers under it. I believe it is appropriate that we have this opportunity of discussing at this time the question of conserving our raw materials, the great mineral wealth we now seem to have in the country.  We should see to it that that mineral wealth is not eroded by a few unscrupulous capitalists.</P>
    <P>The Minister, even in this very tame Bill, has the power to spike their guns for them.  He is the man responsible for issuing licences of any description for the export of any minerals or raw materials.  It might be no harm if the Minister barked loudly at present and pointed out to those who are endeavouring to take over our mineral resources that it is not going to be plain sailing.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanTreacy" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Seán Treacy">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>That is hardly relevant on this Bill.  I allowed Deputies to make brief reference to it in so far as raw materials could be related to exports but to go into the matter in any depth is not in order.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FlorenceCrowley" hpid="Mr. Crowley Mr. Crowley">

    <Speaker pid="FlorenceCrowley" hpid="Mr. Crowley Mr. Crowley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Crowley</NameTxt>
      <P>I understand that the Chair is in a difficulty having refused the question from Deputy Brennan which he considered of importance.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanTreacy" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Seán Treacy">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FlorenceCrowley" hpid="Mr. Crowley Mr. Crowley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Crowley</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Brennan considered this question to be of national importance and I do not think we should be restricted in our debate by the fact that that was refused.  In my view it is directly relevant.  The Minister may easily refuse to grant licences to those people.  If he does that they cannot export the goods.  The Minister would be taking a step in the right direction in relation to any monopolies, mergers or take-overs that might be in the pipeline if he did that.</P>
      <P>We all resent this blatant act of capitalism that is being performed at this time.  That is not to say I am anticapitalist but I am against this blatant display of manipulation of money. More important, I am against the manipulation of the resources of the people.  It is that which we are concerned about on this side of the House and we are going to ensure that the resources of the people are kept for the people.</P>
      <P>The reason I have mentioned this is because this Bill, even in its limited scale, could certainly confine it.  The Minister is as aware as anyone of how important this issue is and of the powers available to him.  If necessary, he should bring in immediate legislation to control our mineral wealth. There were no problems while we had simply holes in the ground.  We were not too concerned, in fact we were not even aware of the vast potential under the ground, but now that we are and now that we know its value and that there is such a world scarcity in these materials we must enact legislation necessary to conserve them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is a reference that we must comply with the mandatory resolution adopted by the United Nations requiring member States to prevent the exportation of goods to Southern <Col N="1163" /> Rhodesia.  Deputy O'Connell raised the question of how other members are complying with this.  Why is Southern Rhodesia alone picked out for this treatment?  It is not that any of us condone what is going on there; we could make a much stronger case against Russia, which country raped Czechoslovakia, Yugoslavia and other countries.  It is my opinion that we should invoke any clauses in this Bill to ensure that none of the strategic materials goes to countries like Russia.</P>
    <P>When we are a party to these agreements do we really know they are being effectively kept?  What kind of monitoring or checking do we have? Are we the only country involved in this kind of exercise?  I know there are other countries who are party to this agreement but who are getting around it and who are supplying Southern Rhodesia, to our detriment I might add.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnFOConnell" hpid="Dr. O'Connell Dr. O'Connell">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Connell</NameTxt>
      <P>To the detriment of the principles of the United Nations.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FlorenceCrowley" hpid="Mr. Crowley Mr. Crowley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Crowley</NameTxt>
      <P>And also to the detriment of industries that may be involved. When we sign these agreements we incur a certain amount of industrial and financial loss but we do so because of our belief in a more basic fundamental principle.  It should apply equally to all people who are parties to the agreements.  There are countries who are blatantly contravening this agreement.  They may not be doing it openly but may operate through second or third countries.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In this Bill we have power to restrict the shipment of scrap metals to Third Countries.  If we decide some material should not be sent to Rhodesia, how do we know it does not reach that country?  While some of these principles may be very laudable in their concept they are not so practical in their operation.  Of much more practical concern to us is the preservation and conservation of our own raw materials and our mineral wealth.  This reinforces the tremendous argument there must be for the establishment and erection of a smelter in this country because it is only <Col N="1164" /> by operating a smelter that we will be able to have full benefit from our mineral wealth.  With the other speakers I welcome the Bill.  I would urge the Minister to deal effectively with what is happening at present in relation to Tara Mines.</P>

    <P>I find myself in agreement with many of the sentiments expressed by Members opposite and I welcome the support I shall derive in the coming months from those expressions of opinions regarding our natural resources. One of the fundamental principles of the EEC, now with nine countries and with a population of ¼ billion, is the free movement of goods. It is a central freedom in the Community. We are retaining certain controls for as long as we can but these powers will run out at certain dates, some of which were given in my opening speech as the middle of 1975 or the end of 1977.</P>
    <P>Deputy Brennan raised the question of indefinite retention.  My attitude to the Community is a matter of record. My recognition of the overwhelming desire of the Irish people, including Members opposite, to participate is also a matter of record.  We are in a situation where I will use every mechanism that remains to me for as long as I can in defence of what I conceive to be the national interest <Col N="1166" /> and the protection of our natural resources. However, there is a profound and vigorous drive on the part of the Community towards the complete freeing of the movement of goods inside the Community and towards the application of all restrictions for trade outside the Community, not by individual members but by the Community institutions.  That is the direction in which we are moving.  I am in no hurry along that road but we are bound by the Treaty of Accession which we negotiated and there is a fairly rigorous time-table in regard to that.</P>

      <P>With regard to timber exports, timber is separately controlled by another Act, the Agricultural and Fishery Produce (Regulation of Export) Act, 1947.  It is a control exercised by my Department.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>Without interrupting the Minister's train of thought, could this not be applied to the control of timber exports?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JustinKeating" hpid="Mr. Keating Mr. Keating">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>I understand that there is some regulation on timber exports. In regard to timber in the rough: exports permitted of rough timber not exceeding eight inches in diameter.  In regard to sawn material: exports permitted of timber not exceeding five inches in thickness but without regard to length.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should point out also that this restriction and the operation of the Act, I understand, will expire on 1st July, 1975.  That is part of our Accession Treaty and it is something we cannot get out of.  There is a real conflict of interest between a nascent timber-processing industry and the desires of exporters to purchase here, probably strengthening the home industry so that they can compete, and this is the best protection which remains  <Col N="1167" /> to us.  We have this power.  We use it to some extent currently.  We will not be able to retain it.</P>
    <P>I do not want to dodge the issue of monopolies, mergers and take-over legislation.  I think it fair to make the point&mdash;and I will not anticipate answers to Parliamentary questions or other debates or the discussion on the Bill&mdash;that where an effort is being made by a foreign company to take over another foreign company in a foreign country our legislation and our actions have no bearing on that. Secondly, where the company being bid for does not in any sense enjoy a monopoly position in the country there is no bearing of monopoly legislation on that.  I just wanted to make those two observations.</P>
    <P>I agree entirely with the need for monopolies, mergers and take-over legislation.  I first looked at the Bill carefully about two months after coming into office.  We came into office in the middle of March.  We were very busy so it was mid-May before I looked at it.  I glanced at it then and when I examined it I thought it needed strengthening.  To be reasonable that involves a good deal of consultation. As people who were Ministers will well appreciate, there are delays not of Ministers' making and if you are to draft good legislation which will stand up in a sensitive area, the draftsmen must have time to get it right and you have to talk to people.  I do not think it is unreasonable that it is not yet enacted but I agree entirely on its importance and urgency.  That is really an aside.</P>
    <P>Rhodesia was also mentioned and the prohibition on exports to Rhodesia. For the sake of clarity.  I should say that the resolution of the United Nations under which we are acting is a mandatory resolution.  One has, of course, the option of not carrying out the mandate but in regard to the United Nations we try to behave meticulously and well.  Down the years our record in regard to United Nations resolutions is a good one and our standing in that organisation is very high, which it would not be if we did not behave as we are doing in this area and many other areas.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1168" /> It is mandatory.  They are not saying: &ldquo;Please do it.  Please do not sell exports to Rhodesia.&rdquo;  They are saying: &ldquo;Do it and you are in violation of a mandatory resolution if you do not.&rdquo;  The point is correctly made that there is evasion.  I share the expression of disapproval of the Rhodesian regime which has come from the other side of the House. There is, indeed, evasion.  It is a matter of regret to me, but there are two things to be said about it.  One must go on doing something which is both mandatory and morally right even if not everybody else is doing the same. One might say in regard to upholding a law: &ldquo;Many people are breaking it and why should I not?&rdquo;  It is an individual judgment for each nation.</P>
    <P>I am pleased that we are behaving well.  It may cost us a little but Rhodesia is not an enormous market anyway.  It is not costing us a huge amount.  My morals might get weaker if we were doing it at a huge cost but if it is a slight cost it is nice to behave well.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JustinKeating" hpid="Mr. Keating Mr. Keating">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>In politics, as the Deputy is aware, morality is not always that simple.  I am pleased that it is small because it does not put my desire for Ireland to behave well under any pressure.  We are not losing very much by behaving well and we are doing something we are called on to do by the United Nations.  Other countries are cheating.  That is a pity but I do not think that should weaken us.  The mechanism of cheating is largely, I understand, through South Africa which is not amenable to pressure from countries like ours.  I am glad we are doing it and I hope we will go on doing it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Since it came up I want to make a point about the export of oil.  Deputy Crowley said we were exporting 95,000 tons of oil a year.  In a sense, yes but, of course, we are huge net importers because we do not get any oil out of the ground.  We depend entirely on what comes in for our requirements.  There is some net re-export. In terms of our total consumption we import every bit of it.  In <Col N="1169" /> regard to that 95,000 tons of oil the Minister for Transport and Power&mdash;I am poaching of course&mdash;could say that we cannot send it out.  That is perfectly possible but it would be silly because a large number of companies could say: &ldquo;Very well.  If that particular 95,000 tons cannot go out there will be many other 95,000 tons that will not come in so thank you very much.&rdquo;  In fact, we are importers of every ton, every gallon, every barrel, that we use so we cannot increase our supply except once in regard to a small amount by imposing any resriction on re-export.  We would be disrupting a system of which we may have criticisms but which is not working too badly at the moment.</P>
    <P>I am glad the matter was raised about consultation with industry on scarce raw materials.  I am pleased to say that two agencies, not directly part of the Department of Industry and Commerce but responsible to it, are performing very well in this instance. Immediately shortages started to emerge I had personal consultation with CII and we have been in touch steadily.  The Industrial Development Authority and Coras Tráchtála through their network of offices overseas and through the good offices of CII, internally CII have arranged a mechanism by which firms with shortages, or who fear that they may run into a shortage situation, can channel their requests to CII who send it to the IDA/CTT network worldwide and we are in a position to scour supplying countries for scarce materials.  While there is worldwide worry about scarcities already this mechanism has worked well, has got us over some difficulties and has enabled the continuation of employment in exports and production. I am unable to compliment them wholeheartedly because they are not directly my responsibility but CII, the IDA and CTT are co-operating very well on this and that is an important point.</P>
    <P>I have tried to deal with most of the questions raised and, although some of them were a little bit diverse, they touched on some real topics. Deputy Brennan correctly referred to <Col N="1170" /> this as a little Bill.  Essentially it is continuing something for a bit longer and there is no contention about it.</P>

      <P>Before the Minister concludes, I was not quite satisfied with his explanation on the question of oil exports.  We import all the oil but we send the exports into totally different countries.  How could they affect our imports?  Is it not due to agreements which the people doing the refining have already entered into that we must export?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JustinKeating" hpid="Mr. Keating Mr. Keating">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>We are not a long way off but I am quite happy to amplify what I said if that is in order.  There are two separate things.  One is that there is a major tank farm in Bantry. I understand that all the oil that comes in there goes out again.  That one is, therefore, irrelevant although it is a matter of huge exports if we wanted to count them as exports.  There is also the matter of the refinery in Cork which is owned in consortium by three of the majors.  They supply some of the Irish market and some of the overseas market from it and they supply some of the overseas market and some of the Irish market from other refineries of which they are proprietors also.  We are treated in regard to price and distribution as part of a larger market.  I suggest that in delicate current circumstances any major interference with this system, which is not disadvantageous to us <i>vis-á-vis</i> larger markets, should not be contemplated at this time.  There is no net export figure.  We are importers of all our needs.  There is a significant export out of the Cork refinery but there are inputs to Dublin from other refineries.  It is something that balances out, as I understand it.  I am now invading the field of my colleague the Minister for Transport and Power and I do not want to do so any further.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Local Government (Mr. Tully)</NameTxt>
      <P>Let me say that we had quite a helpful discussion on Committee Stage.  Some of the points made were new to me; some were of great assistance.  The proposals made from the other side of the House were pretty useful.  I gave Deputy Haughey a guarantee that I would look at a number of the amendments suggested because it was agreed that we could not accept them as they were and that it would be necessary to deal with the Bill in a different way.  The wording in the Bill, perhaps, and in the amendments was a little loose.</P>
      <P>I move amendment No. 1:</P>
      <P>In page 3, to delete lines 20 to 22 and substitute the following:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;(a) construct, repair or maintain fences or retaining walls adjoining a public road which are the responsibility of any other <Col N="1172" /> persons and which do not form part of a motorway, or.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>An amendment was put down by Deputy Haughey.  It would have meant, in effect, that responsibility for fencing and retaining walls adjoining all public roads would eventually pass to local authorities.  I promised to look at the section and see if specific provision could be made to make road authorities responsible for fencing and retaining walls on motorways.  The Bill, as drafted, would enable local authorities to assume this responsibility as the local authorities could constructively take the walls to form part of the motorway.  The amendment I now propose would relieve adjoining landowners from liability for fences and retaining walls on motorways.  I consider that this provision can be defended on the grounds of road safety and prevention of unauthorised access to motorways.</P>
    <P>On the last occasion I feared that we might reach a situation where too much responsibility for the maintenance of fences would fall on local authorities.  This amendment prevents that except where motorways are concerned and I agree that, since the only access to motorways should be from lesser type roads, responsibility for maintaining the fences should be part of the whole motorway plan and should be borne by the local authorities.</P>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>I have no option but to thank the Minister very sincerely for this amendment which meets the situation adequately.  It deals exactly with the sort of argument we were putting forward on Committee Stage. It represents a very considerable improvement from our point of view in the provision of the section.</P>
      <P>Amendment agreed to.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 2:</P>
      <P>In page 3, between lines 31 and 32, to insert the following subsection:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;(3) Before making a scheme under this section, a road authority shall have regard to the preservation <Col N="1173" /> of scenic and natural amenities and, for that purpose, shall consult with such bodies as the road authority considers necessary.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>An amendment on these lines was pressed very strongly by Deputy Haughey.  He emphasised in particular the preservation of scenic and national amenities.  The amendment I now propose goes a reasonable distance towards meeting his point.  He asked that particular regard be given to scenic and amenity aspects, but legal advice is against conceding &ldquo;particular regard&rdquo;.  If we have to have particular regard to sporting and recreational facilities and agricultural activities I must again resist it, because it could hold up the whole thing.  For instance, there are other things such as hospitals and school buildings which rate higher in my reckoning than sporting and recreational facilities.  If we mention agriculture where does industry come in?  I do not think we should mention any organisation.  I think my amendment covers what we require although it does not go the whole way Deputy Haughey wanted.  I got the Deputy's point and I think my amendment sufficiently covers what we both think would benefit.</P>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>I think it does and again I have no hesitation in accepting the Minister's amendment and welcoming it.  I think it is quite sufficient, now that we have all had time to look at the situation.  It is sufficient for the Minister to provide, as he is doing in the amendment, acknowledgment of the principle and we could not possibly look for anything more than that.  Indeed, if I was sitting down, in the light of the discussion on Committee Stage, to frame my own amendment I would almost certainly have come up with something akin to this.</P>
      <P>Amendment agreed to.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 3:</P>
      <P>In page 3, between lines 36 and 37, to insert the following subsection:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;(5)  The Minister, when approving <Col N="1174" /> a scheme submitted to him under this section, may, in any case where he considers it reasonable to do so, issue a direction to the road authority to provide for any person who, by reason of the construction of a motorway, is deprived of reasonable access from one part of his property to another, a suitable alternative means of access, and the road authority shall comply with any such direction.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Deputy Haughey proposed that a new section be inserted before section 10 to provide that a farmer would not be deprived of ready access from one portion of his farm to another and that he should be provided with an underpass or other suitable form of access.  Deputy Haughey withdrew his amendment on the understanding that I would have a look at it and see if provision could be made to deal with cases of deprivation of access from one portion of a farm to another.</P>
    <P>The amendment which I am now proposing is provided as an additional subsection to section 4 and it will enable me, when approving a scheme under that section, to issue a direction at the same time to the local authority to provide a suitable alternative means of access in any case where, having considered the evidence given at the public local inquiry into this scheme and the report of the inspector at that inquiry, I consider it reasonable to do so.  It may be necessary to provide similar facilities in regard to the severance of a farm.  The amendment is as far as I would be prepared to go on this.  Of course, until proved otherwise, we assume that the local authority will behave responsibly and reasonably.</P>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the amendment.  It seems to me to go as far as the Minister could be expected to go, in anticipating and dealing with the difficulty which we foresaw might arise in certain cases.  The Minister has found a very suitable solution in that he is reserving to himself, on appeal as it were, the right to issue a direction to the local authority.  On reflection, I think that is possibly the <Col N="1175" /> best and most flexible way of dealing with this situation.  This could be a complex matter in certain areas but the fact that the Minister has this reserve power of direction will ensure that local authorities are very alert to the problem and will seek to solve it, first of all, at local level.  That is, perhaps, the ideal way of dealing with it.  The fact that the Minister can give this direction will, I hope, ensure that the local authority will try to avoid any necessity for an individual citizen to have to go to the Minister and endeavour to deal with the problems encountered in the preparation of the scheme.  I am quite happy with the amendment proposed by the Minister.</P>

      <P>I am sorry.  That is an unusual fault with me.  The procedure provided for in subsection (2) is standard procedure, somewhat similar to that contained in the Housing Act, 1966.  I considered the matter further and I introduced amendment No. 6 which makes detailed provision based on the Housing Act, 1966, in relation to serving notice.  Therefore, I am not prepared to accept Deputy Haughey's amendment.  Amendment No. 6 is a completely new provision based on the Housing Act, 1966.

      <P>Paragraph (b) of the Minister's amendment states that notice shall be served by leaving it at the address at which the person ordinarily resides or in a case in which an address for service has been furnished at that address.  Is this a new provision in Bills governing the issue of such notice that this section authorises a new method of serving notice merely by leaving it at an address at which a person ordinarily resides?  Obviously the Minister will appreciate that this may not be a satisfactory manner in which to serve a notice and it may happen on occasions that the person for whom it is intended may never receive it.  The Minister, therefore, would not know if the person had received it.  I do not think that would be a good practice.  Would the Minister say if this is a new provision, whether similar provisions have been included in former Acts and is he <Col N="1177" /> satisfied that it is a fair way to issue a notice?</P>

      <P>(b) By leaving it at the address at which he ordinarily resides or, in a case in which an address for service has been furnished, at that address;</P>
      <P>(c) by sending it by post in a prepaid registered letter addressed to him at the address at which he ordinarily resides or, in a case in which an address for service has been furnished, at that address;</P>
      <P>(d) where the address at which he ordinarily resides cannot be ascertained by reasonable inquiry and the notice, is so required or authorised to be served, in respect of any land or premises by delivering it to some person over sixteen years of age resident or employed on such land or premises or by affixing it in a conspicuous position on or near such land or premises.</P>
      <P>This is exactly what is in the 1966 Act and I think it is fairly complete and it does protect, as far as can be done. There will be cases when it will not protect but that will not be the fault of the authority.</P>

      <P>In page 4, between lines 14 and 15, to insert the following subsections:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(3)  Where a notice is required or authorised by this Act or any order or regulation made thereunder to be served on a person, it shall be addressed to him and shall be served on him in some one of the following ways:</P>

    <P>(d) where the address at which he ordinarily resides cannot be ascertained by reasonable inquiry and the notice, is so required or authorised to be served, in respect of any land or premises by delivering it to some person over sixteen years of age resident or employed on such land or premises or by affixing it in a conspicuous position on or near such land or premises.</P>
    <P>(4)  Where a notice is required by this Act or any order or regulation made thereunder to be served on an owner or occupier of any land or premises and the name of the owner or of the occupier, as the case may be, cannot be ascertained by reasonable inquiry, it may be addressed to &lsquo;the owner&rsquo; or &lsquo;the occupier&rsquo;, as the case may require, without naming him.</P>

      <P>In page 4, line 42, to delete &ldquo;the only&rdquo; and substitute &ldquo;a&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not think I need delay the House very long on this.  I made the case as strongly and comprehensively as I could on Committee Stage.  The amendment relates to a situation where a farm or other property has one or more means of <Col N="1179" /> access to it.  As the Bill stands in such a situation the road authority are quite entitled to block up, remove or stop any one means of access and provided any other means of access to the public road existed the farmer or property holder would have no remedy.  I felt that the road authority should be compelled to replace any access which they removed or interfered with.  That would be achieved by substituting &ldquo;a&rdquo; for &ldquo;the only&rdquo; in line 42.  I still think I have a very valid point here and I am sorry the Minister apparently has not yet put down his own amendment to deal with it.  Perhaps he is quite satisfied with my amendment and we will hear from him in a moment that he is accepting it.  If that is so I shall be very happy indeed.  I would urge him to consider the case I have in mind.  I elaborated on Committee Stage on this point.  I indicated that you can have a farm of land where the closing of one means of access, even though another existed, could result in considerable inconvenience and hardship for a farmer.  I had hoped to rectify that sort of situation.  I still press my amendment on the Minister.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sorry that I cannot accept the amendment.  Section 6 (4) as drafted imposes a prohibition on a road authority from closing or stopping up the only means of access which a person has from his land to any public road until an alternative means of access to a public road has been provided.  Deputy Haughey wants to impose the obligation that for every access to a public road or roads that has been stopped up an alternative means of access shall be provided.  I will be forgiven for repeating what I said the last day, that it appears as if he wants to be as they say God is, that He never closes one door but he opens another.</P>

      <P>It may be all right when God is dealing with it but I do not <Col N="1180" /> think we should write in that wherever an access is closed another one must be opened.  We all know of farmers and others who have more than one access and one would do but because there were, for instance, two or three fields at one time and now there is only one the other two accesses are never used.  They are there just because they were there and were not doing any harm.  Deputy Haughey would suggest that they must all be replaced and that would cost money but probably would not mean a thing to the owner of the property.  I do not believe it would be right to impose this as mandatory on the local authorities.  At the same time, this does not mean that the road authority will act unreasonably or unjustly and there may be cases which would call for more than one alternative means of access to a public road and where it must be done. When I am approving a scheme if I consider it correct, or if my successor considers it correct, we can provide for more than one means of access to a public road.  I think it is reasonably dealt with and I would ask Deputy Haughey to accept that I am as interested as the next in protecting the rights of the property owner, the farmer and the private individual.  I do not think we should go too far with it and in my opinion Deputy Haughey's amendment would go too far.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 8:</P>
      <P>In page 4, line 45, to delete &ldquo;an&rdquo; and substitute &ldquo;a reasonable&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The House will recall that, on Committee Stage, I argued as cogently as I could for the insertion of the words &ldquo;agreeable to the owner&rdquo; in subsection (4) of section 6 where it deals with the provision of a new access to a public road by a local authority.  I had in mind&mdash;and I think it was Deputy Callanan who was very much in agreement with me on this&mdash;the sort of situation where the road authority, in pursuance of its obligation, would eliminate an existing means of access and purport to provide a substitute but where, because of the nature of things, the substitute would not be adequate, would be unsuitable or inconvenient from the point of view of the farmer or landowner.  We could all fairly readily visualise that sort of situation arising&mdash;where the local authority or road authority could provide an alternative means of access which, on paper, would comply with the provisions of the section but, in actual fact, would not really compensate the farmer or landowner for the means of access which had been eliminated.  I was anxious to spell it out in the section that the new means <Col N="1182" /> provided must be acceptable to the owner.  It seemed to me that that was a reasonable sort of provision.  But the Minister for Local Government, with very great cunning, evoked for us here in the House the spectre of a contrary Fine Gael farmer&mdash;not a Labour or Fianna Fáil one, I might point out&mdash; somewhere who would be totally unreasonable and who could never be satisfied, to whom we would, in effect, be giving the power&mdash;if my amendment were acceptable&mdash;to hold up the development for all time.</P>
    <P>I saw the force of the Minister's argument in that respect because I readily admit that such contrary Fine Gael farmers do exist here and there throughout the country.  In an endeavour to compromise and provide something which would meet both our points of view, I decided to put down this amendment&mdash;mainly to delete the word &ldquo;an&rdquo; and substitute it with the words &ldquo;a reasonable&rdquo; so that it would now read:</P>
    <P>...shall not close, stop up, remove, alter or divert such means of access until a reasonable alternative means of access to a public road has been provided.</P>
    <P>I think that would be acceptable to the Minister.  It seems to me that it would provide a <i>via media</i> between both our points of view: on the one hand, the individual farmer or landowner would have the protection of the word &ldquo;reasonable&rdquo; and, on the other hand, the road authority could not be held up indefinitely, because the word &ldquo;reasonable&rdquo; has a very definite meaning and connotation in legal terms and it would be a matter of fact whether or not the alternative could be regarded by reasonable men as reasonable.  Therefore, I strongly recommend the alternative to the Minister for favourable consideration.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Mr. Molloy Mr. Molloy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to support Deputy Haughey's amendment and ask the Minister if he can see his way to accept it.  The wording that Deputy Haughey seeks to include at this point in the subsection is that a reasonable alternative means of access to a public road be provided.  In suggesting that the words &ldquo;a reasonable&rdquo; be included, he is putting forward <Col N="1183" /> a very reasonable amendment to the subsection.  One can imagine situations arising, under the subsection as it stands, where many farmers would be completely dissatisfied with the alternative access provided by the local authority and would have no comeback.  I think the inclusion of those words would strengthen the hand of the farmer in seeking from the local authority that the alternative means of access to be provided by them was a means of access which would be suitable to his needs, provided it was deemed to be reasonable. The subsection is a bit bald as it stands.  It gives a local authority the right to provide an access and leave it at that, and the owner of the land who has been interfered with has very little comeback.  A kind of &ldquo;take it or leave it&rdquo; sort of attitude seems to emerge from a reading of the subsection and it does not seem to be asking a lot to have the words &ldquo;a reasonable&rdquo; included before the word &ldquo;alternative&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnCallanan" hpid="Mr. Callanan Mr. Callanan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Callanan</NameTxt>
      <P>I can speak with some authority.  I have been seven years with Galway County Council.  A national primary road went along beside a man's farm; the county council did provide an alternative entrance for him.  But what did they do?  They had to elevate the road outside his premises; they shifted it way up; now he has to take a very sharp turn at the end of the elevated part of the road.  No man would accept that. There has been argument going on ever since between the man and the engineering staff in an effort to reach agreement.  Deputy Molloy knows the spot fairly well between Aughrim and Cappatagle&mdash;on the national primary road&mdash;where one can see that entrance still there.  It is a common disgrace on a public road.  If you have not some reasonable way of giving a farmer a chance of putting up his case for at least a decent alternative to an entrance that may be closed, I think this amendment should be accepted.  I do not think it would be reasonable at all to leave it to officials to say merely: &ldquo;Here you are; we are giving you this but take it or leave <Col N="1184" /> it.&rdquo;  The case I have just instanced remains unsettled with Galway County Council after seven years.  We cannot get the officials to come and put a reasonable entrance into that man's premises.  I would ask the Minister to take that into consideration.</P>

      <P>Like Deputies Haughey and Molloy, I should like the Minister to accept this amendment because&mdash;as cited by Deputy Callanan&mdash;there are a number of cases in Mayo in which the county council have provided alternative means of access but which could not be called reasonable by any means.  It is very difficult for a man to gain access to his land when the only means of access provided by the county council is a passage with a one in two rise.</P>
      <P>In addition, if the Minister did accept this amendment, it could be used possibly as an esteemed selling point to farmers in an area.  It might stop a lot of objections to the Minister and would help to facilitate the speedy passage of any particular scheme by a Minister.  I, too, would ask him to accept the words &ldquo;a reasonable&rdquo;.  The Minister has great experience of farmers and he should know the position.  I think the Bill would be the better for the insertion of those words.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>The position is that with regard to this word &ldquo;reasonable&rdquo;&mdash;which one of my colleagues used here recently and about which he was taken to task by a lot of people, including Deputy Molloy, for saying that any reasonable man would accept something&mdash;we now seem to have the country full of reasonable men who would be prepared to accept something only if they considered it reasonable.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have quite a lot of experience of local authorities.  I am amazed to find people with experience of local authorities talking, for instance, about having to accept what the officials decide.  Any good local authority representatives who blindly accept what the officials decide, if the elected representatives think it is wrong, need to have somebody tell them their rights. <Col N="1185" /> They do not have to accept them.  I am amazed that the county council to which the Deputy referred should have put in such an entrance to a farm.  The county council members, if they were doing their duty, should have insisted on a proper entrance.</P>

      <P>County engineers are paid officials of a local authority.  If what Deputy Molloy and others say is correct, what is the point of local elections? Where does local democracy come in?</P>
      <P>I cannot understand how so many people are afraid of county officials. If an official does something which they consider wrong, why are the public representatives afraid to say that it is wrong and take the necessary steps to have it righted?</P>

      <P>It is not a good best if the dispute is still going on after six years.  &ldquo;Reasonable alternative&rdquo; means that a reasonable means of access must be provided before the rural authority can close the only existing means of access.  What will happen if Deputy Haughey's proposal is accepted?  We are talking mainly about farmers but there will be other property owners looking for a means of access.  All they have to do is be awkward.  It does not matter whether they are Fine Gael, Fianna Fáil, Labour or do not have any politics if they are awkward.  Unfortunately, we all have experience of these awkward people who believe they are making themselves important by objecting to progress being made and thereby holding up the scheme indefinitely.</P>

His would have to be a reasonable judgment. Much as I would like to, I could not accept Deputy Haughey's amendment.  To do so would be inviting trouble from those who have already made up their minds that motorways will not go within 50 miles of their property.  Evidence can be found in newspapers and public statements.  If we want motorways we must define everything that is contained in this Bill.  If a dispute occurs, the matter can be decided by the Minister for Local Government.  We will have to introduce something along those lines with regard to entrances to lanes, <i>et cetera</i> where one unreasonable person holds up numerous very worthwhile schemes.

      <P>I am disappointed that he is now forcing himself into the position where he is rejecting the word &ldquo;reasonable&rdquo;. If he thought some more about it he would find that position indefensible. I remember from my law student days that the word &ldquo;reasonable&rdquo; had a very definite connotation in law.  The man on the Clapham bus was supposed to epitomise what is reasonable. I am sure in our case it would be the man on the Donnycarney bus.  Lawyers accept that there is a subjective standard of reasonableness.  I should have thought that this was a very fair compromise of wording for the Minister to accept, that the local authority must provide a reasonable alternative. The adequacy of the reasonableness could be left to be determined in the light of the particular local circumstances in each case.  I note with regret that the Minister does not feel inclined to accept this amendment.  I urge him when he goes with the Bill to the Seanad to have a further think about this.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I agree that the fact that ultimately sanction rests with the Minister is a safety valve or fall back.  On the other hand, I do not think we should frame legislation on the basis that it will be all right because there will be a reasonable Minister and he will give a reasonable decision.  From the point of view of the Minister and his Department a case could be a very miniscule matter, but it could be a very important matter from the point of view of a humble individual citizen. It need not necessarily be a very large landowner or a big farmer who is involved.  It could be a very small farmer or as the Minister said, somebody with a house or cottage along the projected motorway.  It could be <Col N="1188" /> very significant to him and have an important bearing on his convenience. From that point of view I should have thought that if we put in the word &ldquo;reasonable&rdquo; it would compel both sides, the individual citizen affected and the local authority, to be sensible and come up with a reasonable alternative.  The Minister has been so forthcoming in other aspects I am disappointed that he has not been equally forthcoming in this respect.  I will leave the matter at that with the wish that the Minister will, between now and the time the august upper House are given this Bill, have another look at the particular wording.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 9:</P>
      <P>In page 5, line 24, after &ldquo;notice&rdquo; to insert &ldquo;in the prescribed manner&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>Following discussion on Committee Stage I agreed to have a look at this particular subsection.  The original subsection (3) read:</P>
      <P>Where a scheme is made by a road authority under section 4 of this Act, the planning authority for the area to which the scheme relates shall serve notice on all persons who have been granted planing permission for development (which has not been commenced or has not been completed) on any land affected by the scheme.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have inserted, after &ldquo;notice&rdquo; the wording &ldquo;in the prescribed manner&rdquo;. This has a particular connotation and, I believe, it is the best way to deal with it.  The question of when work commences has caused a lot of trouble under previous schemes in the Department of Local Government and other Departments.  Deputy Molloy and I are aware of a particularly worthwhile regulation which was introduced by him with regard to the value of houses and how people attempted to beat that by laying foundations and leaving them there.  Whether that was commencing the house or not it was accepted by the Department that it was, in fact, commencing the construction of the house.  I do not think <Col N="1189" /> that should have been accepted as such.  The result was that people got away with something.</P>
    <P>Deputy Haughey and Deputy Molloy were anxious that something like this would not happen again. Deputy Molloy queried when would works commence.  The question of how commencement should be interpreted for the purpose of section 8, subsetion (3) will be dealt with in this amendment which enables me to make regulations prescribing the manner in which notice will be served, regulations which will, in any event, be laid before this House.  I will take the opportunity in these regulations of providing an acceptable definition of &ldquo;commencement&rdquo;.  As of now I have not a cast-iron or foolproof definition of &ldquo;commencement&rdquo;.  Like so many other words, it is not an easy one to define and it is not easy to define when something commences. The fact that this will be laid before the House is a guarantee that the Members of this House will have the right to say what they think on the particular arrangement before it is operated.</P>
    <P>In my view this is the best way rather than attempting to tie it up in some manner in this section and finding afterwards that because there was a leak in it there was no way in which it could be dealt with.  Reluctantly, because I am not very much in favour of legislation by ministerial regulations, I do this.  I am doing so because I believe it is the best way in this case.</P>

      <P>I have tossed around half a dozen different ideas in my mind.  If it was simply a question of deciding when a building commences that could possibly be defined easily enough but it may not be a building, it may be a golf course, a garden or a glass house.  It may be something that is not at all similar to a building.  We have to get some wording which will <Col N="1190" /> be wide enough to cover all these things and yet be precise enough to say that this prevents the sort of abuse of which we had evidence before. I ask the House to accept this and if I can at all I will give further particulars of what we propose in the Seanad.  I hope by then to have the necessary wording.  In any case, the regulations must come before this House.</P>

      <P>Development, something for which permission has been granted under the Planning Act. Under this section very extensive powers are given to the authorities. In fact, authorities can suspend planning permission already granted or revoke planning permission if a scheme under section 4 of this Bill is approved or it can modify a permission which has already been fully granted.  This is probably the first time that such provision has been provided in any Act interfering with legitimate planning permissions granted already. I am aware that local authorities have power to revoke but, as we know from experience, this only happened in exceptional cases.  In this case all permissions lying in the way of a proposed motorway can be fully revoked.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The anomaly arises in as much as section 8, subsection 3, applies only if the development for which permission has been granted has not commenced but if it has commenced this section cannot be operated.  The word &ldquo;commencement&rdquo; has a very great significance in this section.  As we on this side of the House have pointed out, much of what we have been discussing here may only affect a small number of persons but those persons can be seriously interfered with in their way of life and in the <Col N="1191" /> quality of life which they enjoyed and the environment in which they lived. Their lives can be seriously disrupted through the carrying out of construction of a motorway.  Though the number may be small we are speaking on their behalf.</P>
    <P>A person having such planning permission revoked could find that his plans for the future are seriously interfered with.  It is important, if that power is being given, and if it does not apply if development has commenced, that persons should be able to decide for themselves under the manner prescribed by the Minister whether they had commenced and were relieved from this section.</P>
    <P>The Minister has given us an assurance that he will publish the regulation. If we do not like it we will have the opportunity of debating it in this House within the prescribed period.  I am thankful to the Minister and we agree to the amendment.</P>

In dealing with this Bill, we have discharged our function as a Legislature in a reasonably adequate and satisfactory manner.  I commend the Minister for his approach.

We are elected to discuss and to deal with the work of the nation, how to make laws that will improve conditions for everyone.  The approach adopted by the Opposition and by people from my side of the House helped to get through what I consider a useful Bill. As everyone knows, I am a very reasonable man and when the Opposition are reasonable they will find me reciprocating.  I hope we will be able to continue this kind of approach because this is what the people have elected us to do, not the kind of things that occasionally and unfortunately we indulge in.  As Deputy Haughey has said, I hope this example will be followed in the House for many years to come.

      <P>Section 2 is the important section that allows for an increase in the number of Deputies to be elected to this House.  We have stated that, as a general principle, we do not object to increasing the number of Deputies by four but naturally we would only agree to that on certain <Col N="1193" /> conditions.  We would expect the distribution of the four seats to be carried out in a fair and just manner.</P>
      <P>We do not accept this has been done.  In the remainder of the Bill and in the Schedule it is clear that fair and just principles have not been applied in the distribution of the four additional seats.  This is disappointing and is a cause of much concern to the people.  The Minister has been reasonable to a certain extent in the debate on the Motorways Bill which we have just concluded.  He listened to reasoned argument, he has conceded that the Opposition made valid points; in one case he accepted our amendment as it stood and in other instances he brought forward amendments when he agreed with the points we made. Deputy Haughey complimented him. We had hoped that spirit would emanate through all discussions on Bills in this House but I am afraid in the discussion so far on section 2 we could not agree the matter has been dealt with in a reasonable fashion.</P>
      <P>We have asked the Minister to explain his reasons for increasing the number of Deputies by four.  One would reasonably expect that any Minister coming before the House with such an important request would have cogent and valid arguments in favour of it.  There has been debate among the community since the foundation of the State in connection with this matter; there are those in favour of increasing the number of Deputies and those who are not in favour, and there is also a substantial lobby who sincerely believe there are too many Deputies elected to this House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It was unusual, to say the least, that the Minister gave no reasons, except a few words that were included in his introductory speech on Second Stage. Apart from that, when he made a brief reference to EEC additional work, when we came to deal with the section on Committee Stage the Minister merely said that the Government had decided to increase the number of Deputies by four.  He said the Government had sufficient votes to put the amendment through and he indicated to this side of the House that was sufficient argument for his asking the <Col N="1194" /> House to increase the number of Deputies by four.</P>
    <P>I listened and contributed to the debate last night.  The only conclusion I could come to at the end of the discussion was that the only arguments being advanced, either for or against this section, were from the Opposition. There was no real contribution in favour of this section from the Government who brought the Bill before Dáil Éireann.  There was complete silence from the Deputies on the Government benches.  The only contribution came from the Minister but there was no support for the Bill from the Deputies sitting behind the Minister&mdash;in fact, very few Deputies thought it worth their while to come in and listen to the debate.  We suspect that there are quite a substantial number of Deputies in the Fine Gael and the Labour Party who disagree with the provisions of this Bill.</P>

    <P>The following motion was moved by Deputy Colley on 19th February, 1974:</P>
    <P>That Dáil Éireann, in view of the inflation now raging in the economy and the consequent hardship being inflicted on most income tax payers and in particular on those with very low incomes who were never intended to be subject to income tax, calls on the Government to increase substantially the personal, earned income, marriage, child and age allowances under the income tax code and to provide by legislation that, thereafter, such allowances will be adjusted annually in relation to movements in the cost of living index.</P>
    <P>Debate resumed on the following amendment:</P>
    <P>To delete all words after &ldquo;Dáil Éireann&rdquo; and substitute &ldquo;notes that personal allowances under the <Col N="1195" /> income tax code were not increased in the financial years 1957/58 to 1972/73 inclusive at a rate commensurate with the depreciation in money values.</P>
    <P Just="Right">&mdash;(Minister for Finance.)</P>
    <Speaker pid="TomJFitzpatrick" hpid="Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick (Dublin Central) Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick (Dublin Central)">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>(<i>Dublin Central</i>): When I reported progress last night I was reviewing the tax-free allowance as it stands today and I was pointing out how totally inadequate it is in view of the massive inflation which has taken place over the past 12 months.  I was reviewing the allowance for the single person and the married person and I was moving on to the housekeeper's allowance.  Under the present income tax code you are allowed a deduction of £100 for a housekeeper.  In the light of the massive increase in the cost of living over the past 12 months, such an allowance is entirely inadequate, especially in the case of a man whose wife is dead and who has to employ a housekeeper to look after his children.  A figure such as that is completely unrealistic and I call on the Minister to ensure that it is increased substantially.</P>
      <P>A deduction of £60 is allowed for a dependent relative.  We believe that it is desirable to keep an aged mother and father at home rather than put them in an institution.  Here again a progressive policy could be implemented and something realistic allowed. We put down this motion to prompt the Minister to give realistic allowances right across the income tax board.  After their meeting with the FUE and the Congress of Trade Unions, the Government issued a vague statement to the effect that they propose to increase income tax personal allowances.  We want something far more tangible.  Part of the motion in Deputy Colley's name reads: &ldquo;...and to provide by legislation that, thereafter, such allowances will be adjusted annually in relation to movements in the cost of living index.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister should make a firm commitment now on the increased allowances he will provide in his forthcoming budget.  It is not good enough to say that there will be a review.  If <Col N="1196" /> we had not put down our motion it is doubtful whether the Government would have made any move.  They should have moved in this direction when the national wage agreement was being put to union members throughout the country.  If they had we might have had a different result.  I sincerely hope that a national wage agreement will be accepted because it is the best type of negotiation in an economy such as ours.</P>
    <P>A certain amount of overtime should not be subject to income tax.  The Minister for Local Government has already set a precedent with regard to differential rents.  The Minister should see if he can give some concessions to people who work overtime because I know from my own personal experience that workers are very reluctant to work overtime when they find that their entire overtime earnings are subject to income tax.  A concession in this regard would have a beneficial effect on production.  Absenteeism is quite prevalent especially in the early days of the week.  I suggest that some overtime earned after working a 40-hour week should be exempt from income tax.  This would ensure that every employee would have to report for work on a Monday morning.  Otherwise he could not qualify for relief on his overtime.  Instead of being a disincentive to production, it would encourage production by giving people an incentive to work overtime.  Employers are finding it difficult to get employees to work at night-time and at weekends.</P>
    <P>I put down questions to the Minister on this matter two or three months ago asking if he would consider the possibility of exempting some overtime. The answer was in the negative and when I questioned him further he said he thought it would be a disincentive to production.  I do not think it would. The Minister has made no firm commitment as to what concessions he will give in the forthcoming budget.  I thought he would make a commitment that whatever the national wage agreement would be that amount would be adjusted accordingly.  That is the very minimum commitment he should have made.</P>
    <P>I have no doubt that when the final <Col N="1197" /> VAT figures are made up on 31st March the Minister will have a substantial increase on the amount he budgeted for last year.  Inflation has helped the Minister.  Every increase in the price of food, clothing and housing utilities helped buoyancy and revenue.  The higher the prices the more the Minister collects in VAT.</P>
    <P>The price of fuel has brought about an unprecedented rise in the cost of living.  It must be unique in the history of the country that the price of a product should rise by 100 per cent. The Minister will gain substantially from VAT on petrol.  We all realise the effect the increase in fuel costs will have on the economy.  It will affect the manufacturer and the motorist.  In olden days motoring might have been considered a luxury but today the average person requires a car to take him to and from work. It will affect the housewife in fuel costs.  Today the majority of new houses are centrally heated and do not use hard fuel.  The huge rise in the cost of fuel will have a detrimental effect on the standard of living.</P>
    <P>Since the Arab countries have doubled the price of crude oil, the Minister should reduce the duty on oil and petrol.  He is making it up in one way by taking it in in VAT.  He should either remove VAT or reduce the duty.  I would suggest a reduction in the duty on petrol and oil.  I do not think the Minister would lose very much because he is gaining on VAT.  Whatever he budgeted for last year on VAT, on oil and petrol, with the rise in price in the past year he will get a substantially greater sum by 31st March.  In budgeting for the coming year he will virtually double his VAT from petrol and oil.  He should take this into consideration and give some concession by relieving the duty, which is quite substantial, on oil and petrol.  In 1973 receipts were equivalent to £53.84 million.  That does not take VAT into consideration.  The Minister should look at this and see what additional VAT he will get and reduce&mdash;&mdash;</P>

Deputy Colley relinquished the office of Minister for Finance less than 12 months ago.  It is not the case of a party in Opposition for a long time calling for amendments in the law which they have been unable to make.

      <NameTxt>Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>(<i>Cavan</i>): It came about largely through a tightening up of the machinery of the Revenue Commissioners to bring the lower income group into the income tax net.  PAYE was introduced in 1961 when the number of income tax payers was 220,000 and in less than three years that number had increased to 320,000, an increase of 100,000 in round figures.  That was largely, if not entirely, attributable to the dragging into the income tax net of the lower income group.  It was also due to the fact that between 1957-58 and 1972-73 there was no increase in the personal allowance and also to inflation and the increased cost of living and the decrease in real money values. The attack was on the lower income group all the time.  That is emphasised by what happened to surtax payers who during the previous Government's term of office fell in number from 9,600 to 6,650.  That was entirely due to the fact that the former Government went easy on surtax payers and raised the threshold for surtax from £2,500 to £4,500.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is interesting to note the income tax and surtax returns in the past number of years.  Net income tax receipts jumped from £66,868,371 in 1967-68 to £169,190,962 or nearly trebled while surtax in the same years increased only from £3,078,181 to £4,493,779.  Those are striking figures. While income tax almost trebled, sur-tax went up by only one-third.  I should have thought that when the former Government saw fit to bring the lower income group into the income tax net they would have ensured that all those liable to pay tax <Col N="1200" /> would pay it and that all gains enjoyed would be made liable to tax.  During their term in office the Fianna Fáil Party refused to bring in a capital gains tax and as a result vast incomes&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>(<i>Cavan</i>): I am dealing with the past 16 years. Vast incomes were earned and enjoyed free of tax by speculators and such like.  For example, according to the Kenny Report, between the beginning of 1963 and the end of 1971 the average price of serviced land in County Dublin increased by 530 per cent, free of any tax.  In the same period the consumer prices index increased by 64 per cent.  In County Dublin the average price per acre of serviced land was £1,100 in 1960 and it had increased to £7,000 in 1971, again free of tax.  The average price per acre of potential building land was £300 in 1960 and it had jumped to £2,500 in 1971.</P>
      <P>The report goes on to say that the pattern was the same, comparatively speaking, all over the country.  I believe that, as a result, many speculators in land got away with huge untaxed incomes because if a man makes £2,000 a year capital gain on a farm of land, on a house or on the Stock Exchange it is just as much income as the earnings of a man working in a factory or working elsewhere. Yet, under Fianna Fáil, the party who now call for justice in taxation, one person was taxed and the other person was not.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I stated that between 1957-58 and 1972-73 there was no increase in the personal allowances.  My namesake, who contributed immediately before me, pointed out that there was no increase in the housekeeper allowance and that such an increase should be granted.  I want to point out to the Deputy that the housekeeper allowance in 1957 was £100 and it is still £100.  When the small increases were introduced in 1972-73 by Deputy Colley he did not increase the housekeeper <Col N="1201" /> allowance.  One might have thought that putting down this motion by Deputy Colley was evidence that in opposition he had time to think the matter over and that he had come to the conclusion that there should be a fairer system of taxation.  If that were so it would not be so bad, but in view of the happenings at the Fianna Fáil Ard-Fheis, I can only regard this motion as a bit of hypocrisy and a bit of play-acting.  At the Fianna Fáil Ard-Fheis a resolution was put down by a delegate from Cork who called for the imposition of a capital gains tax and made the type of case I have been making here.  On the advice of Deputy Colley, the Ard-Fheis rejected the resolution.</P>

      <P>(<i>Cavan</i>): I want to say, according to the newspapers, there was an acrimonious debate on the resolution calling for the imposition of a capital gains tax and, on the advice of Deputy Colley, the Ard-Fheis rejected the resolution and decided to hold on to the system whereby the people who make huge profits on the Stock Exchange, on speculating in land and on other speculative activities are to be exempt from tax and the people who earn their living by the sweat of their brow are to continue to pay the last penny.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When I was in Opposition I did not contribute very often to financial discussions but on several occasions I intervened in budget debates to call for an increase in the personal allowance on the basis that to leave it static was, in fact, increasing income <Col N="1202" /> tax.  So far as this Government are concerned we will do the fair thing and the right thing.  Deputy Colley comes in here, after his Government being in office for 16 years, and makes a play out of the fact that we did not in our first budget, a few weeks after coming into office, do what the Fianna Fáil Government failed to do during their 16 years in office.</P>
    <P>In our first budget we attended to the poorer section of the community and we make no apology for doing that.  The Taoiseach and the Minister for Finance have given an indication of our general intention in regard to taxation.  The House and the country can be assured that we will embark on a system of taxation that will be equitable and we will not tolerate the system which has been operating in this country for so long whereby the big income was exempt from tax and the smaller man was taxed to the hilt.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RaymondMacSharry" hpid="Mr. MacSharry Mr. MacSharry">

      <P>The reason we on this side of the House put down this motion in the name of Deputy Colley is that for the first time the ordinary wage earner's income is in the vice-like grip of raging and uncontrolled inflation.  One could elaborate on many aspects of that statement but I think there are many statements on the record of this House which back up what I have already stated.</P>
      <P>This year we expect to see the unprecedented situation of up to 20 per cent inflation.  The figure for last year was 12 per cent.  It is no wonder that the Coalition Government sought to stifle discussion on this motion last week and no wonder they stooped to every trick and Parliamentary device to ensure that the people were kept in the dark.  The economy has taken a disastrous turn and I think the public are entitled to know&mdash;it is our duty as an Opposition Party to inform them&mdash;the disastrous road the economy is now taking.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Coalition Government consist of two parties, Fine Gael and Labour, who came together before the last general election with the slogans &ldquo;Price Stabilisation&rdquo; and &ldquo;Halt <Col N="1203" /> Inflation&rdquo;.  Both parties had to practise hypocrisy and deceit to secure a mandate from the public.  They are now in Government and they have an opportunity of carrying out the mandate but we have seen many of the issues that they tried to sell to the people being totally and systematically abandoned and wrecked by them since they assumed office last March. I doubt if the people will ever again be deceived in the way they were last year.</P>
    <P>The Government have come in here on many occasions in the past six months and said that their policy on prices failed because of outside influences. Outside influences are not the cause of the unrest and trouble in the economy.  The trouble is that this Government are made up of two extreme groupings.  On the one side, we have the extreme conservatism of Fine Gael and on the other side what might be described as doctrinaire socialists.  This must entail the formulation of some type of compromise policies.</P>

      <P>We, in Government, on two occasions successfully negotiated a national wage agreement. National wage agreements are agreements between all concerned in the interests of the economy and the progress of the nation.  That means co-operation between worker and employer and between them and Government. At times certain requests are made from one side or the other and advice is taken from various sources to ensure that what is best for the country is done and that there is a fair distribution of the resources of the State.  Reasonable requests were made by the people involved in the national wage agreement negotiations.  Many of these requests related to the subject matter of our motion which is: &ldquo;To increase substantially the personal, earned income, marriage, child and age allowances under the income tax code.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>The first proposals that were put to the Employer/Labour Conference were overwhelmingly rejected.  I do not think the Minister for Finance is without blame in this regard because at that very important time before Christmas the Minister for Finance spoke on the Appropriation Bill in the Seanad.  I shall quote from the Seanad Official Report of 19th December, 1973, column 438.  The Minister said:</P>
      <P>In view of this situation one must be realistic about what the economy can afford by way of income increases without doing serious and lasting damage all round.  The proposals for the national pay agreement were drafted in good faith at a time when it was felt that growth prospects for 1974 were good.  The situation has now obviously changed for the worse.  This is worrying since the combined effect of rapidly rising domestic costs and a sharp upward trend in oil and raw material prices could again boost inflationary pressures, slacken demand and lead to unemployment and hardship.</P>
      <P>Can the workers really be blamed for the rejection of those proposals?</P>

      <P>&mdash;&mdash;had risen by 25 per cent.  We welcome the announcement made yesterday but, at this stage, I feel the Government are not going far enough.  I should like to know why it is not possible for the Government to state now what those concessions might be because I think this is what will decide the outcome of many problems existing today.</P>
      <P>Last night the Minister for Finance trotted out figures which suggested that the personal allowance would have to be raised from £299 to £340; widow's allowance from £324 to £385; married allowance from £494 to £682; child allowance to £220, and the earned income allowance from £500 to £800.  By stating those figures in this House does the Minister intend increasing the allowances to that level?  If they are going to be less or more, we should like to know, and the public would like to know exactly what is intended by the statement made yesterday when one considers the many false promises that have been made already by this Government that have been either shelved or abandoned.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Over the past 12 months, on many occasions, the present Government tried to deceive the public with statements of intent on issues such as tax on profits of mines and capital gains tax which, in themselves, are creating a certain amount of uncertainty in the economy as a whole.  As I said earlier, I think these statements of intent are merely being put on record as statements of intent to be <Col N="1207" /> shelved and about which nothing more will be done because of the differences of opinion between the two political parties forming the present Coalition Government.</P>
    <P>But the ordinary worker, the person whom I represent anyway, is more concerned about the value of his or her take-home pay packet.  This is the concern of many thousands of people throughout the country.  Naturally, they are concerned about it now.  In my opinion they asked a reasonable request&mdash;that the Government would indicate what they intended to do about income tax allowances.  We are all concerned about what can be described as the ordinary worker; how his wage packet, his take-home pay, the money on which he has to live and rear his family, how the value of that, has so diminished in the past 12 months and, as I said earlier, will diminish much further in the coming 12 months.</P>
    <P>The issue contained in this motion is a fundamental one of fair treatment&mdash;at what point the income tax allowances should be fixed.  It is our duty here, as an Opposition, and our obligation, to direct the attention of the Government to what is now a very specific and widespread public demand for action in this regard and is related to the circumstances now obtaining.  It is foolish of the Government&mdash;by this amendment&mdash;to try to overlook the circumstances of today because, as was explained by Deputy Colley last night, if what is contained in the amendment is so, then there is all the more reason for much more decisive action by the Government in relation to income tax allowances. We know that the Government have the resources available to them to make a significant contribution now and not even wait until 6th April.  I see no reason whatsoever why it was announced, even though two weeks ago it was divulging budget secrets and the information requested was refused here in this House.  The Government issued a statement yesterday saying that this matter would be in some way resolved on 6th April, or in the next budget, dating from 6th April.  It is another example of <Col N="1208" /> how this Parliament is being treated with contempt in this regard.</P>

      <P>We know there are many demands and all sorts of requests around budget time but we insist, on this side of the House, that no matter what are the other demands, this one has to be met because we know it can be met at this stage.  I hope that the national wage agreement is accepted but I think&mdash; when the Government were prepared to go so much further yesterday than two weeks ago, in stating their intention of doing something in regard to income tax allowances&mdash;there is no reason whatsoever why it could not be done now; from this day, or tomorrow and I should like to be convinced by whatever Government spokesman is involved as to why it is not possible.  Have a Finance Bill introduced stating what the Government intend to do; have it implemented as and from 6th April because I think this is what is being requested and, in the circumstances now obtaining, it is a reasonable request.</P>
      <P>If the Government are to show sincerity in relation to the many promises they have made over the last 12 months this is one issue on which they should spell out what they intend to do.  They will not be giving away budget secrets.  They have broken that precedent by announcing their intention to do something in this regard.  If the argument can be pursued that it is not the right thing to do until budget day, the number of people who could evade tax between now and 6th April would be minimal. On the other hand, the Government have said that they propose to introduce further taxation, tax on profits on mines and capital gains tax. These are budgetary statements which, in my opinion, are doing far more damage to the economy than if the Government spelled out exactly what they intend to do in relation to income tax allowances.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I could go into more detail about individual items mentioned in the motion because I think it is important. <Col N="1209" /> Every public representative, whether he is in this House or is a local government representative, is aware of the hardship caused to many thousands of workers because of the inflationary situation which exists today.  The only way to help the taxpayer is to increase these allowances substantially.  The Government have said that they will give some increases. I do not want to go so far as to say that they may not be enough, but perhaps it is too little, too late to have the third wage agreement accepted.</P>
    <P>The Government have made so many promises that the people are becoming disillusioned and may not accept this new one.  I appeal to the Government, in the interests of a satisfactory agreement emerging to think seriously of announcing before 7th March what exactly their intentions are.  This is a reasonable request for us to make.</P>
    <P>This motion, which was originally submitted last December, was for the purpose of trying to salvage the national wage agreement.  I hope the Government will consider what I have said and will announce these immediately&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not one for short speeches.  There is not a great deal which needs to be said on this motion except that it is a timely motion.  The amendment confuses the issue to a degree which makes hollow the allegation of the Minister for Finance who regards the motion as a &ldquo;bit of political play-acting&rdquo;.  I may be quoting the wrong Minister.  Maybe it was the Minister for Lands who said that.  The Minister for Finance said something similar.</P>
      <P>Whether this is play-acting or not, the fact is that the motion could not be more appropriate and never was it more needed than at this time.  I appeal to the Government to take it, for what it is worth, on its face value, and relate it to the sad and inflationary circumstances in which we live and the continuing trend upwards of all the living costs for our people. This applies to the vast majority of our people and not only to a relatively few low wage earners.  In my estimation it is no use to play-act on the amendment merely because it is said that the motion is play-acting.  If the motion is play-acting the amendment does nothing to relieve the play-acting but rather adds to it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The public, who are looking to us for relief in some manner as outlined in the motion, will not have any great regard for any of us on either side of the House if we finish up by stymieing each other by having an amendment recalling the fact that certain allowances have not been increased for so long.  That to my mind is play-acting. I appeal to the Minister and the Government to take seriously the intent of the motion, disregard any uncharitable views they may have formed about what inspired it and take it for what it is worth.  There is no doubt that the suffering public, the workers and income tax payers who are seeing more and more of their incomes dwindle against inflation on the one hand, and a bigger slice being taken off their increases by way of taxation, do not appreciate play-acting, <Col N="1211" /> whether it be in the motion or in the amendment.  They can only think cynically that, if they believe the Government that there is play-acting in the motion, then they can be truly convinced that the amendment is certainly play-acting on the part of the Government.</P>
    <P>As I said at the outset, I only wanted a few minutes.  I am thankful to the Minister for giving way and I will do better than he asked and let him in before 7 o'clock.  I appeal to the Government to let us have the substance of the motion regardless of what we may have said or are saying about the motion or the amendment. It is needed, badly needed, and could not come at a better time.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JustinKeating" hpid="Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. Keating) Justin Keating">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. Keating)</NameTxt>
      <P>I have much to say in a short time.  I should like to commence by saying that I agree with the sentiment of the last speaker. We are not at a time in our national economy or our national life when we want to be simply sticking our fingers in each others eyes.  Without trying to score points one can gain insight into the thoughts about income taxation of a party by analysis of its actions. In my view that is a legitimate thing to do and I propose to do that in relation to the present Opposition.</P>
      <P>The essential, inescapable thing about income tax is that it is a part of general tax.  We all, as Government or Opposition, and public representatives, want more money to do things of a socially and economically useful kind.  The sources of revenue are limited, and if one does not get it one way it must be got another way.  If one is seriously looking for reliefs for the lowest paid from income tax under a series of allowances one has to have some practical proposals as to where receipts for the Government are to come from.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the Statistic Office's analysis of receipts and expenditure receipts are broken down under three heads, taxes on income, taxes on capital and taxes on expenditure.  I now want to deal with the trend of taxes on income from 1959 to 1972.  I will take these as percentages, and I will put in 1964 <Col N="1212" /> as well because it is a year in the middle and we are picking trends, not a particular year.  Taxes on income of our total receipts in 1959 were 25.1 per cent; in 1964 they were 31.2 per cent and in 1972 they were 37.2 per cent.  In each of those intervals 1959 to 1964 and 1964 to 1972 as percentage of total receipts tax on income went up.  Taxes on capital yielded 2.1 per cent in 1959; 1.8 per cent in 1964 and 1.5 per cent in 1972.</P>
    <P>During those years taxes on capital were going down.  This represents a trend of thinking on the part of a party that had a chance to change direction a little every year.  The trend was that income tax had to contribute more and capital taxation had to contribute less, and less in the case of capital taxation starting on a very low pace but less at a time for capital taxation when the economy was getting bigger and stronger steadily.  The yield from taxation on income during that period went up by 762 per cent while the yield on capital went up by 355 per cent.  The whole emphasis was away from capital taxation and towards income taxation.  That was done year after year, it was the thrust of the then Government's attitude to gaining revenue.</P>
    <P>I should now like to deal with the matter of personal allowances because this over a long period of years represents the thrust of thinking about allowances.  In the period 1957 to 1972 the consumer price index rose by 119 per cent and money fell to less than half its value.  If one were to adjust the income tax allowance in that period without improving the allowance, for the change in the consumer price index by 1972 for a single person the £115 allowance should have gone to £340; the widows' £175 should have gone to £385; the married person's allowance should have gone from £310 to £682.  However, in each case the allowances, year after year, did not keep pace with the consumer price index increase.</P>
    <P>Speaking for myself I am not proud of the last budget treatment of the personal allowance for the wife who goes out to earn.  In 1957 it was £45 and to allow for inflation it should <Col N="1213" /> have been £99 in 1972 but it was actually £74.  It had not half kept pace. We put it a little ahead of inflation, not enough I admit, but at least we added to it.  If one is talking about the size of the income tax net and people who were never intended to be caught in income tax one should bear in mind that in 1957 185,000 paid income tax while in 1973 this figure had risen to more than 700,000.  That expresses an attitude, not just one year but year after year, budget after budget, of the role that income tax ought to play in the gathering of income to spend in socially useful ways and to the role that personal allowances ought to play in releasing people from the tax net.</P>
    <P>More and more people were caught but the allowances were not even adjusted for the cost of living and this all took place at a time when the economy was thriving and the role of income tax as a revenue yielder was increasing.  It is worth saying again that in the period 1957 to 1972, with the huge changes in the economy, the number of sur-tax payers fell from 9,600 to 6,550, down almost two-thirds. That does express attitude to taxation and it is permissible to say it.</P>
    <P>I should now like to explain the position in relation to married couples with three children, which is the norm for our society.  Since in the period 1958-1959 to 1972-73 money fell to approximately half of its value to compare like with like one doubles the income.  People who had £1,000 in 1958-59 should have had £2,000 in 1972-73.  One compares the family earning £1,000 in 1958-59 with a family earning £2,000 in 1972-73.  In 1958-59 the effective rate of income tax taking into account allowances was 3 per cent on that family and in 1972-73 it was 9.9 per cent.  Percentage wise that was an increase of almost three times.  That was the people in the lower income group.</P>
    <P>For middle income group, those earning £2,500 in 1958-59 or £5,000 in 1972-73, the effective tax rate went up from 21.3 per cent to 24 per cent.  In other words, the lower income rose from 3 per cent to almost 10 per cent and the middle income group from 21.3 to 24 per cent.  Income tax as a <Col N="1214" /> yielder went up during those years but allowances to release people from the net went down during those years.  The number of people caught in the net went up over those years and the burden of taxation got heavier relatively on the poor over all those years.</P>

      <P>Three things characterise the thinking of the present Opposition in regard to income tax. The first of these is simply confusion, inability to think clearly.  If one wants an example of that and there are many I can refer to the budget of 1970-71 because in the budget of 1970 the then Taoiseach stated:</P>
      <P>My proposal is that the first £100 of taxable income will be charged at two-thirds the standard rate.</P>
      <P>That is from the budget speech of that year which was read by the then Taoiseach for the Minister for Finance.  A year later the budget statement was:</P>
      <P>I propose to repeal with effect from the current year the provisions under which the first £100 of taxable income were charged at two-thirds the standard rate.</P>
      <P>That was a direct reversal within 12 months.  It does not show coherence, it does not show a clear sense of direction or strategy.  Confusion it has been and a complete willingness to make moment to moment <i>ad hoc</i> changes without any plans of what the role of tax in society ought to be. The second feature of the present Opposition's attitude to income tax is a contrast of words and deeds.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In part II, page 262, in the &ldquo;Second Programme for Economic Expansion&rdquo; dated July, 1964, it was stated that the Government's aim was to create conditions permitting, as soon as possible, a reduction in direct taxation.  When Deputy Lynch was Minister for <Col N="1215" /> Finance in 1966 income tax was increased by eight pence on the standard rate&mdash;that was 21 months later. However, the figures I gave earlier show that the whole tendency for ten years&mdash;the Second Programme was introduced a decade ago&mdash;has been the opposite of the Government's wish about direct taxation as expressed in the Second Programme.</P>
    <P>First, there is the confusion; secondly, the contrast between words and deeds; thirdly, and the most serious, a fundamental unwillingness to do any thinking about income tax in relation to other taxes and in relation to the task any government have of gathering enough money to do what they wish.  The broadcast I heard of the Fianna Fáil Ard-Fheis at the weekend indicated even now, with the freedom of Opposition, a continual unwillingness to do any re-thinking in this area or to do anything new.</P>
    <P>Having said that, I come to the text of the motion which says three things.  It refers to very low-income people who were never intended to be subject to income tax.  I am pleased to hear it but when one looks at the figures from 1959 to 1972, when one sees the increase in the number of people caught and what inflation did to allowances, it is effrontery for someone so newly in Opposition, who was a Minister for Finance, to offer this thought.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">

      <P>Now the Opposition tell us.  It is lovely to hear it but it is such a pity they did not believe it before.  However, a change of mind is welcome.  The motion calls for increased allowances.  I have spoken about what the Opposition allowed happen to allowances, not in one budget but year after year.  It is nice that they want the allowances increased now and we say to them: &ldquo;Thank you very much.&rdquo;  The motion calls for a relationship to the cost of living index.  Year after year in Opposition I talked about the relationship of the allowances to the <Col N="1216" /> cost of living index.  The present Opposition did nothing about it for 16 years but now they have a change of mind.  It is very welcome but what a shame they did nothing about it before.  There is a strong strand of effrontery in this whole presentation.</P>
      <P>In the 11½ months since this Government came to office, it has been our first year as a member of the EEC which put an enormous strain on certain members of the Government and entailed a lot of extra work.  It has been the year in which our relationship with the North of Ireland at last started to evolve. The remarkable progress at Sunningdale was the result of an enormous amount of work at Government level and, since it did not involve the Department of Industry and Commerce, I can say that all the more wholeheartedly.  In the last year we had membership of the EEC which was new&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>&mdash;&mdash;we had Sunningdale which was new, we had an economic upheaval in relation to prices and interest rates, devaluation and the oil crisis.  In that period the Government found the time and the energy to do the most serious thinking about taxation and the role of income tax in the whole of the tax burden than has happened in the last quarter century and more than our vigorous and informed Opposition were able to do in the whole of their period in Government when things were relatively calm and easy.</P>

The Opposition did not have the time nor the energy in 16 easy years to devote that much thought to taxation.

      <P>Although it is not mentioned, let us talk about the juxtaposition of these motions with the third national wage agreement.  We all want that agreement.  Might I remind Deputies opposite that in 1970 it did not go through on the first round and, in fact, there was a threat of statutory action behind it when it did go through, and in 1972 it did not go through on the first round either. Now we are trying again in very difficult circumstances.  At a time when we are trying to salvage the national wage agreement, we are offered a thought by Deputy MacSharry, who spoke about the cost of a food basket increasing by 25 per cent in one month, or at an annual rate of 300 per cent.  We have very serious inflation but we are not within an ass's roar of that and there are no statistics to prove it.  In fact, there are many statistics to prove the opposite.  The Opposition are weeping crocodile tears.  Exaggerating the state of inflation is dangerous to a national wage agreement; exaggerating the economic difficulties every country is facing and with which we are dealing courageously is damaging&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>Despite the disgraceful and disreputable efforts of the Government <Col N="1218" /> to prevent the motion being discussed last week, despite the fact that they tried to spike the guns of the motion by calling in the Irish Congress of Trade Unions for a few minutes to hand them a statement saying what the Government were going to do and getting it out to the media before the motion could be discussed here, and all the other paraphernalia of disreputable media tricks we have come to expect from the Government, the motion has been well worth while.  It has forced the Government to face up to their responsibilities not only from the point of view of social justice but in trying to secure as far as possible the completion of a national agreement. This was an area in which the Government were singularly supine up to the time we forced them out into the open.</P>
      <P>It is particularly noticeable in this debate that no speaker on the Government side attempted to make any real comparison between their performance and that of the previous Government.  What they did was to go back to 1957 and we had the same old figures trotted out time after time. Yesterday I pointed out the enormous difference between the situation today and that of previous years in regard to VAT, under which they increased the rates, in regard to the historically high level of inflation, and in regard to the much greater strength of the economy, the wealth of the economy. No speaker on behalf of the Government has attempted to refute that argument.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would say to you, Sir, that if anybody wants to make a genuine comparison, as far as you can get it, between the performance of one Government and another, he should compare the situation of the 1973 budget with that of the 1972 budget, although that comparison is unfair to the Fianna Fáil Government because inflation was not so high at that time and because VAT was in operation only for five months and at lower rates than this Government have imposed. Even allowing for all that, if you compare it&mdash;and I will quote the Minister for Industry and Commerce who has just spoken, who said that <Col N="1219" /> you can get an insight into the mind of a party&mdash;I presume he meant two parties in Coalition&mdash;by an analysis of their actions&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>Judged by their actions, as the Minister for Industry and Commerce said, this Government in the 1973 budget imposed taxation on everything in sight at a higher rate than had ever been heard of in this country. <Col N="1220" /> What did they give for income tax relief?  They gave £½ million.  That is the insight into the mind of this Government.  We have been hearing excuses from the Minister for Industry and Commerce&mdash;and we heard excuses from the Minister for Labour some time ago to the same effect&mdash;about why they have not been able to do things they should have been doing. We have been hearing about their difficulties concerning the North of Ireland.  We have been hearing about their difficulties concerning the EEC.</P>
      <P>Do they really think people will fall for that?  What do they think was going on before they took up Government? Do they think the EEC did not exist and that we were not in it?  Do they think we did not have problems in the North of Ireland?  Of course we did, but we got on with the job.  We were more interested in it than in the gimmicks and the nonsense we have been having, like the statement issued yesterday, handed to the Irish Congress of Trade Unions to try in a shabby way to defeat the effect of a motion in this House.</P>
      <P>I want to tell the Minister for Industry and Commerce something.  He spoke in the debate on the economy not so very long ago, Sir.  You may recall that, in the course of that debate, I made certain suggestions to the Government as to what they might do in the interests of the economy and, in particular, in regard to bringing about a national wage agreement so far as the Government can contribute to it.  It is a free collective bargaining situation but clearly the Government can contribute to a climate that will enable it to be voted on favourably.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One of the suggestions I made was that the Government should commit themselves to increases in income tax allowances.  The Minister for Industry and Commerce, with his usual combination of arrogance and ignorance, said that suggestion was clear evidence that this party deserved to stay on the Opposition benches.  He said that only about ten days ago.  I want to point out to you, Sir, that yesterday the Government of which he is a member came out and did precisely what I suggested.  This is worth pursuing <Col N="1221" /> even in the few minutes I have left.  There are two possibilities.  Either the Minister for Finance has been codding his Labour colleagues in the Government because not only did the Minister for Industry and Commerce make that silly statement&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="JustinKeating" hpid="Mr. Keating Mr. Keating">

    <Speaker pid="JustinKeating" hpid="Mr. Keating Mr. Keating">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>What I said was that your performance in that debate, of which three suggestions from you form part, was so fatuous in relation to the general difficulties in the economy that you deserved to stay in Opposition.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>The fact of the matter is that the Minister for Industry and Commerce made that statement and the Tánaiste backed him up and shouted across the House at me: &ldquo;You were not so generous when you were in office&rdquo;.  He made some reference to budget secrecy.  There were references by other Ministers to <Col N="1222" /> budget secrecy.  They could not under any circumstances make any commitment in advance of the budget. That was nonsense and I said so.  The Minister for Finance may have codded his Labour colleagues, and it may be that they are so ignorant and immature that they could not see that he was codding them.  There is another possibility, that is, that he did not cod them and that when they made those statements, when they told the Irish Congress of Trade Unions and the workers they could not make any commitment, they knew that they could.  Then they come out and make it when they are under pressure from a motion in this House.</P>
      <P>We on this side of the House have been particularly concerned in so far as we can do anything from this side of the House&mdash;and what we can do is limited&mdash;to contribute to bringing about a national pay agreement.  I have deliberately refrained from saying certain things in this House, and in particular in this debate, which would be well deserved so far as criticism of the Government goes, but which might possibly contribute to preventing a national pay agreement being brought about.  I want to point out that the kind of activity by a Government who say: &ldquo;We cannot under any circumstances make a commitment because of budget secrecy&rdquo; and then make a commitment, will not give confidence to workers.</P>
      <P>I appeal to the workers over the heads of this inept and incompetent Government, despite the Government's record, to vote in their own interest for a national agreement.  At least we could ensure from that that there will be some concessions in income tax.  They may not be what we would all hope they would be, but there will be some.  It will not be too long, Sir, I believe, before the workers will get an opportunity to show this Government what they think of them, and to put into power a Government in which they can have confidence.</P>

      <P>We are dealing in this section with a proposal to increase the number of Deputies to be elected to this House from 144 to 148.  I have already indicated that on this side of the House we do not in principle oppose increasing the number of Members by an additional four to 148 but that we object very seriously to the manner in which it is proposed to distribute these additional four seats among the various constituencies the Minister proposes in this Bill.</P>
      <P>The Minister is aware that the Constitutional provisions allow for such an increase if he chooses to take the lower figures suggested in the Constitution of 20,000.  This is what he has done.  The House should be aware that the option open to the Minister ranges from 148 Deputies down to 99 Deputies if he chose the higher figure per Deputy of 30,000 mentioned in the Constitution.  As it has been the practice over the years to decide on the number of Deputies by going to the lower limit mentioned in the Constitution, 20,000, one can in that way justify the creation of four new seats.  We feel that the Minister is expecting a lot from us in seeking our ready agreement to this section in view of the manner in which those seats have been allocated.</P>

      <P>This section is influenced by the use the Minister makes of the power he is seeking in this Bill which we claim is unjust and unfair.  He is paying no heed to the practical situation which obtained in this country at the time he drew up the proposals which are contained in this Bill.  One must consider <Col N="1226" /> that the population of the province of Munster in 1971 was 882,002 and that that, in fact, was an increase of 22,668 over the previous census figures published in 1966 but in this Bill the Minister does not propose increasing representation in any of the counties in the Munster region.  Yet, when one looks at the census figures for Leinster and examines the increase in the population that has taken place in that province one sees that it has increased by 88,700.</P>

The whole basis on which this section stands is that there was an increase in population shown in the 1971 census.  I submit that I am fully in order in examining the census figures.</P>

      <P>The Chair will appreciate that there is a vital principle involved here.  The whole Bill <Col N="1228" /> stands or falls on section 2.  If there are no additional seats to distribute, then the Schedule falls because the Schedule as drawn up is dependent on 148 seats being allocated.  We are arguing the question of these additional seats.  We feel we are fully entitled to go into this whole matter on this section in very great detail.  If the Government are seeking the support of the Fianna Fáil Party for this Bill they must come clean and they must give us an indication as to whether they intend to make any amendments to the Schedule, whether they intend at any stage to consider the amendments proposed by this party or whether they are prepared to consider amendments on Report Stage which would effect a fairer distribution of the additional seats.  Not alone is the Minister by this device in a position where he has the discretion to create four new seats but by the devious means employed by the Minister in this Bill he has taken unto himself the right to allocate six new seats by reducing that area of the country from Donegal to County Clare by two. The population, as given in the 1971 census, does, in fact, allow for the retention of 30 seats in that area, which is the existing number of Deputies elected from that area now and the Minister proposes to reduce that area by two.  This means that, in dealing with the Schedule subsequently, the Minister has six seats to allocate; two which he stole from the west of Ireland and four which he is allowed to create under the Constitution if we accept this section.</P>
      <P>What has happened?  Five of those seats have been allocated to the Dublin area; one to the Minister's own constituency.  Munster has received no increase and the west has been reduced by two.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We submit to the House that this is gross gerrymandering; that it is total dishonesty; that the Government should be completely ashamed even to come before the House with a measure such as this.  If they sent in Deputy Tully to carry the brunt of this debate and bring this Bill through the Dáil; if they had said: &ldquo;You do <Col N="1229" /> it, Jim; you stick it out there; you march it through; we will come in when you want us to vote&rdquo;&mdash;that is a very poor way for the Government to treat this House.

No argument has been <Col N="1230" /> used other than that the Government have decided; the Government have the votes and will march it through.

I have seen, since this debate started&mdash;and in the speeches that were made here on Second Stage &mdash;Deputies from the west of Ireland totally indoctrinated by their leaders, coming in here&mdash;Deputies from Roscommon, from Sligo and from Leitrim &mdash;saying that the Minister has no choice, because of the population figures in the 1971 census, other than to reduce the number of seats in that western region by two.</P>

      <P>The Minister had a choice.  According to the Constitution, he could have ranged from 148 Deputies down to the number mentioned by Deputy Molloy, which was 99.  This is a fairly wide choice.  We do not mind his making the choice he did; that is, 148.  It does mean that he is creating a situation&mdash;by having 148 Deputies&mdash;where, in the views of all sides of this House, the people of this country will be better represented. In other words, we could have had a situation where the Minister could decide, under the Constitution, that he would take 25,000 persons per Deputy and, in so doing, would divide the population by 25, thus arriving at a number of Deputies which would be much fewer than 148.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Section 2 provides for that kind of activity by the Minister under the Constitution.  Although he would be legally and constitutionally entitled to do it I think it would be wrong for the Minister to say that a Deputy will represent not fewer than 25,000 persons.  I am glad he did not do it. As a matter of fact, the better representation any group of persons has in this House and the lesser number of persons which a Deputy represents, all the better.  In other words, he can <Col N="1233" /> do it more efficiently, provided the area he has to cover is fairly small. Therefore, we do not object to 148 in itself.</P>
    <P>We now have a situation where some men are more equal than others. The people in the Minister's constituency, where he added another seat, are more equal than the people in the western constituencies where, instead of a Deputy representing 19,000, he will have to represent 21,000.</P>

      <P>On a point of order, may I respectfully suggest that some of the remarks by Deputy Cunningham are relevant.  Suppose a manager came to his directors for £X,000 this year, the first thing he would be asked would be what did he want to do with it.  We are not satisfied with what has been done and we want to find out exactly what the Minister proposes to do.  Therefore, I hold that Deputy Cunningham's remarks on distribution are relevant.</P>

A Deputy might vote according to his conscience and this section might be defeated.  In that case I might never get a chance again to discuss it on another section. This is possible.  The Government were defeated before.</P>

      <P>On a point of order, last night we had the distribution of population in Dublin and how the Dublin seats were arrived at, from the Minister.  You were in the Chair, Sir.  With respect, I asked him for <Col N="1236" /> the figures on Munster.  I congratulated him for having the Dublin figures.  If I were in his shoes coming in here and fighting for Dublin city I would have that ammunition with me.  The fact is that he produced these figures and gave us not alone the population figures for the 1971 census but also the projected figures for the following two years.  On that basis, if Deputy Cunningham is ruled out of order, the Minister should have been ruled out of order last night.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>If the Minister took some time to discuss what he could have done arising out of the figures of the 1971 census in Dublin and the choices which he had available to him he might have had a different view.  He has shown us clearly when talking on section 2 of this Bill that he had a choice in respect of Dublin.  He explained <Col N="1237" /> to us that he was toying with the idea of giving Dublin 41 seats, 42 seats, 43 seats or 44 seats.  As Deputy Molloy has pointed out, the Minister had six seats to play around with, four of which became available due to the increase in the population, the other two pilfered from the west of the country.  Instead of any of the numbers that he mentioned the Minister decided on 43.  In other words, the Minister went the whole hog but, of course, he kept one for County Meath, his own constituency.</P>

      <P>The Minister went further.  He went outside the population of the 1971 census and asked Dublin Corporation Planning Section to give him the up-to-date figures in relation to the city.  What he wanted them for is hard to understand because they were not relevant to anything he was legally or constitutionally entitled to do with the Bill.  However, he did so many things with this Bill that I suppose he had reached the stage where he thought he was all powerful and all mighty. He thought there was no harm in seeing what the situation in the future could be.</P>
      <P>I should like to tell the Minister that the future for him, and his Bill, so far as the country is concerned looks bleak.  The Minister will go down as the architect of this blatant piece of gerrymandering.  The people up and down the country are not yet aware what is happening to them. That is because very little publicity has been given to this matter and little discussion has taken place.  Some counties are now objecting to this. They are, of course, also objecting to the Minister's high-handed circular to the local authorities asking them if they have any suggestion to make but when they made suggestions down went the jack-boot.</P>

The people of Munster are in the same boat but the Deputies from that province sit like dummies behind the Minister.  When he looks crossly at them they freeze but on the appointed day they will troop in behind him and say they are happy with what the Minister did and that he is entitled to a seat in Meath which he has taken from Ulster.  The same applies to Connacht.  There is an Ulster Deputy sitting behind the Minister but he will walk into the lobby behind the Minister and say Ulster is prepared to be gerrymandered. We are not prepared and I want to state that loudly and clearly.  The Minister can have 148 Deputies if he is prepared to give a fair deal.  He should show by his actions that all people are equal.</P>

Does he realise that Fianna Fáil took part of Leitrim and put it into Donegal, that they brought part of Connacht into Ulster to keep six Deputies in Donegal, four of whom were Fianna Fáil?  It amazes me that Deputy Cunningham and others seem to forget that prior to 1937 there were eight Deputies in Donegal and Fianna Fáil had four of these&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>The Chair hesitates to interrupt the Deputy but he must advise all Members that this section deals with the fixing of the total number of Members to be elected to this House.  The debate should not attempt to cover distribution of the seats.  Deputies should relate their remarks solely to whether the number should be 144 or 148 Members.  That is the issue.</P>

Last night Deputy Dowling entertained us in a pantomime effort on whether he should support the section and he ended up by telling us how he could oppose it.  I do not know <Col N="1241" /> whether Deputy Cunningham supports or opposes the section.  He seems to be objecting to the fact that out of 148 Deputies there would be one less Deputy in Donegal.

If I were manager of a big business and wanted extra money this year, one of the first things a director would ask me would be what I wanted to do with the money.

Deputy Cunningham forgets that in 1961 it was the then Minister for Local Government, Deputy Blaney, who kept the Deputy in this House, as happened in 1969 when Mr. Boland was Minister.  What the present Minister for Local Government did should have been done in 1961 or in 1969.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lalor</NameTxt>
      <P>Like other Fianna Fáil speakers I share the view that it is advisable to have the maximum numbers of Deputies in Dáil Éireann arising from&mdash;and I take it this is relevant &mdash;the necessity to be represented in <Col N="1245" /> Europe and the possibility of a Council of Ireland.  There are various reasons why we should have the maximum amount of representation especially in view of the proposed new regulations under which we will have more meetings in Committee.  Deputy Molloy is also convinced that we should have the maximum number of Deputies.  While we fully support that, we have reservations in view of the fact that we have no indication as yet from the Minister as to whether he is willing to accept amendments to the Schedule which have been submitted by Deputy Molloy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lalor</NameTxt>
      <P>Therefore my view on the figure of 148 Deputies is totally changed.  In the 144 Deputies at present there are representatives from all over the country.  There are 38 Deputies from the Dublin city and county area.  In the 148 Deputies it is proposed to have 43 Deputies from the Dublin city and county area and 105 Deputies from the rest of the country, whereas at present there are 106 Deputies from the rest of the country.  That acts as an incentive to us to oppose this section.  While the Minister proposes that the people of the Republic be represented in Dáil Éireann by four extra Deputies he is also proposing that 25 counties should be represented by one less.  This Electoral (Amendment) Bill sounds to me in a peculiar sort of way&mdash;if I am not ruled out of order&mdash;very much like the Sunningdale Agreement.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJLalor" hpid="Mr. Lalor Mr. Lalor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lalor</NameTxt>
      <P>I suggest the Deputy should listen to me.  We hear about this open Government but we do not seem to get any factual statements from them.  I was pointing out that the 1971 census of population showed that there were roughly 94,000 extra people in the country as compared with the 1966 population.  Arising from that, the Minister, following the pattern his predecessor would have adopted, proposes that the number of representatives to be elected to this House should be raised to 148.  I was saying that I agreed with this proposal in section 2.  That means an extra Deputy per 23,000 or 24,000 people and this is fully justified but the manner in which the Minister proposes to increase the representation in one area, the Dublin city and county area, by five Deputies and to reduce the other 25 counties by one Deputy has this side of the House worried.  I think this view has been <Col N="1247" /> expressed by everybody speaking here. It is from this point of view that we are worried about sanctioning the increased number of Deputies.</P>
      <P>We are justified in asking the Minister to give some indication that he is willing to review his decision to disenfranchise 25 counties which have earned increased representation in order to boost the representation in Dublin city and county by an extra five Deputies.  I am talking not in terms of Ulster, Munster and Conacht but about Ulster, Munster, Connacht and the remainder of Leinster outside Dublin city and county.  There has been an increase in population all over the country.  The Munster area population increased considerably. So did the Leinster population. The population in the Connacht area dropped by little more than 10,000 people.  From that point of view there seems to be every justification for querying the intention of the Minister and the Government as expressed in section 2 of the Bill.</P>
      <P>There are two different matters involved: one, the Minister is seeking four extra seats in Leinster House with which we agree, and two, the manner in which he proposes to fill them, with which we positively disagree. I realise that we shall have an opportunity of discussing individual cases on the Schedule and later in the Bill but if the Minister is adamant on this we would be justified in opposing the increase in representation which will have an end result of reducing rural representation&mdash;by &ldquo;rural&rdquo; I mean outside Dublin city and county &mdash;from 106 to 105 Deputies.  This is extremely important.  At present, outside Dublin city and county 106 Deputies are returned to Dáil Éireann.  As a result of this Bill, as it is apparently planned at present, we shall have four extra Deputies but on the other hand we shall end up with a situation in which there will be one fewer Deputy from the 25 counties outside Dublin city and county.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lalor</NameTxt>
      <P>I think I have endeavoured to make my point in this regard by indicating that we can have two different points of view.  We are <Col N="1251" /> anxious to have the maximum number of Deputies but only provided they represent the proper distribution of people.  I do not know if anybody has read section 2.  It states:</P>
      <P>Dáil Éireann shall, after the dissolution thereof which next occurs after the passing of this Act, consist of one hundred and forty-eight members.</P>
      <P>The most extraordinary thing can happen here.  It is quite possible by a great stretch of the imagination to visualise a situation whereby the National Coalition Government, of which the Minister for Local Government is a member, may continue in office for a period of five years.  This would mean their term of office would last to March, 1978.  A census is due in 1976 and if the Government survive till then it is likely they could mess about a lot with the count&mdash; they have done so already&mdash;and might deliberately hold back having the census.  I wonder if it would be possible for the Minister to alter this section to read:</P>
      <P>After the dissolution thereof which next occurs after the passing of this Act or after the next census, whichever comes first</P>
      <P>because it is quite probable that the population may have exceeded the number which would justify having 149 or 150 Deputies.  I know that constitutionally it has worked out that 148 is the absolute maximum number of Deputies we can have in the House arising from the 1971 census.  It might be no harm if the Minister amended section 2 in some way to take into consideration the possibility of increasing the representation of the country arising out of the 1976 census.  That is likely to take place before the present Dáil dissolves.  Tolerances have been stretched to the limit in some constituencies and those could be out of order following the next census.  If the Minister was not so anxious to get this Bill and to do the gerrymandering which is so blatant and if he waited until after the 1976 census he would be in a position to see to it that the people would be more adequately represented.</P>

If the Minister intends to misuse the power to increase the number by four, as he appears to intend to misuse it, by taking away from the representation of the people in 25 counties in order to give increased representation to the other&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickJLalor" hpid="Mr. Lalor Mr. Lalor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lalor</NameTxt>
      <P>With all due respect, there would not be an amendment on the Schedule.  The Minister should consider an amendment so that he could increase, if the Dáil has not dissolved before the next census which is due in 1976, the representation in this House.  I think that is very much on the section and is something that probably the Minister himself would welcome the opportunity of doing, because it is very much accepted, in the House, that the House could well do with the maximum amount of representation. Despite the fact that we regularly read letters in the papers, referring to how adequate it would be to have 40, or 50, or 60 working Deputies to have a proper Parliament here, we&mdash;who are engaged in parliamentary work&mdash;are extremely conscious of the pressures on our time in order to give legitimate representation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I object to the Minister describing this as a Second Reading speech because I have indicated on two or three occasions in the course of my contribution the fact that I would welcome an indication from the Minister of an intention to intervene in order to clarify any of the points.  As a matter of fact, I know there is nothing to stop me sitting down, letting the <Col N="1256" /> Minister reply and speaking again on Committee Stage.  I am all for 148 Deputies but I object&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>&mdash;&mdash;to 25 counties of this Republic of ours being reduced by one Deputy and having the balance go to build up the representation from Dublin.  I suggest the Minister seriously consider building into section 2 an amendment to provide that the numbers can be, or may be, increased following the dissolution of this Parliament, of this Dáil, if it exists beyond 1976 on the basis of the new census.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JosephDowling" hpid="Mr. Dowling Mr. Dowling">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dowling</NameTxt>
      <P>In relation to section 2, I should like to say that representation is the keynote.  It refers to the number of Members of Dáil Éireann and an increase of four Deputies. Again, this is related to the population of the country.  If we take the 148 Members, we find that that is broken down into a number of constituencies and counties.  Nowhere else in the Bill is there a reference to numbers except in section 2.  Therefore, I take it I am in order in referring to the breakdown of the numbers of population in relation to the 148 seats that the Minister proposes in the Bill.  We see that the Carlow/Kilkenny area, in the 1971 census, had a population of 100,001 persons.</P>

This fragmentation is done in the following manner: in the Carlow/Kilkenny area&mdash;as indicated in the Bill&mdash;there are 100,001 persons.  This is based on the census of population 1971.

Our objections and arguments up to now have been that the extra seats, which are at the discretion of the Minister, should have been allocated in a manner that could be seen to be fair and just to the whole community.  This House should not be asked to pass legislation which is discriminatory in its very structure. This legislation discriminates against the rural areas.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>This section is purely administrative.  It is similar to the corresponding provision made in the 1969 and the earlier revisions of Constituencies Acts.</P>
      <P>Under the revision some polling districts or parts of polling districts will be in a constituency different in area from the constituency in which they are situated at present.  The names of electors in the register of electors are arranged under polling districts and the name of the constituency is shown in respect of each polling district.  The register which will be in force following enactment of this Bill will have been prepared on the basis of the existing constituencies.  It is essential that arrangements be made to have the name of the appropriate new constituency entered clearly for each such polling district or such part of a polling district affected in the register to be used at the general election first held following the enactment of the Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1267" /> It is not possible to specify at this stage which register will be affected or whether the direction will be given in respect of the draft or final register. This will depend on the date of dissolution of the Dáil following enactment of the Bill and the date of the subsequent general election.  For this reason, subsection (1) proposes that the Minister may by direction provide for the entry of the name of the appropriate new constituency, in respect of each such polling district or part of a polling district, in every draft register, list of claimants, register of electors and list of corrections published before the dissolution of the Dáil following the passing of this Bill.  It is intended that the Minister's direction would be issued on the dissolution of the Dáil and would specify precisely which draft or register <i>et cetera</i> should be amended.</P>
    <P>Subsection (2) provides for the preparation of a new postal voters list or lists where a new constituency is not identical in area with the present constituency.  Corresponding provision was made in the 1947, 1959, 1961 and 1969 Acts.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Mr. Molloy Mr. Molloy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>Did the Minister say that this direction would be issued at the dissolution of the Dáil?  One could foresee a situation in which the Dáil would be dissolved on 16th April and the register that is prepared would come into operation on 15th April. In such circumstances it would be necessary for the Minister to issue such an instruction on the day of dissolution. If by some mischance a general election did not take place until, we will say, next September, would it not be prudent for the registration authorities, without having to wait on a direction from the Minister, to have this tidying up job done before the dissolution of the Dáil? Why would it be necessary for them to wait for a dissolution and await a direction from the Minister?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>In the normal way it would be done, but it can be done up to the dissolution of the Dáil.  This is the very same provision as was made in all previous constituency <Col N="1268" /> changes.  There is no alteration whatever in the arrangements.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJLalor" hpid="Mr. Lalor Mr. Lalor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lalor</NameTxt>
      <P>Having a section like this in the Bill and justifying it on the basis that it is a replica of similar sections in previous Bills does not appeal to me, quite frankly.  Later on, on the Schedule we will be talking about the creation of new constituencies, of new locations.  There is nothing in the Bill which provides that the Minister may by direction make an order to delineate the particular constituency.  That is inbuilt in the Bill.  Somewhere in the Schedule a line is drawn down through the middle of a street.  Is that not a straightforward indication to the returning officer for the area that he is expected to make the proper arrangements for the publication of the draft register to suit that area without any direction from the Minister?  I cannot see that there is any necessity for the Minister to make an order which is obviously directed at the returning officer or the registrar for the area telling him that he is to put the constituency of Kildare on a register already marked Kildare.</P>
      <P>The Dublin constituencies have been so messed about that I can visualise many registers having to be prepared.  The titles of all the Dublin constituencies will have to be changed. Does the passing of the Bill not automatically mean that the registrar has to prepare the registers for the new constituencies in each location?</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickDHarte" hpid="Mr. Harte Mr. Harte">

    <Speaker pid="PatrickJLalor" hpid="Mr. Lalor Mr. Lalor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lalor</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy's intervention raises another interesting point. In section 6 I see no reference to whom the Minister is to give his direction.  I thought it was the county registrar.  Deputy Harte understands it is the county secretary.  I wonder is it the returning officer in the Custom <Col N="1269" /> House a couple of corridors down the way.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>This can become terribly complicated if we proceed on the wrong assumption.  To clear up the point raised by Deputy Lalor it is the registration authority and that is the county council or the corporation as the case may be.  The direction will be given to them.  The reason the direction is given on the dissolution of the Dáil is that the existing registers must remain for by-elections.  The work will be done on preparing the new registers immediately this Bill becomes an Act.  Legally they cannot be changed until such time as the Dáil is dissolved. That is why it is stated in this way.  It is quite a simple matter.  I know it can appear to be confusing.  No. 1, the reason it is not changed is that the old registers will be used for by-elections and No. 2, the new register can only be declared on the dissolution of the Dáil but the work will be started as soon as the Bill becomes law.  Does that explain Deputy Lalor's question?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJLalor" hpid="Mr. Lalor Mr. Lalor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lalor</NameTxt>
      <P>I read here:</P>
      <P>... the Minister may by direction provide for the entry of the name of that constituency in respect of the polling district or part of the polling district, in every draft register, list of claimants, register of electors and list of corrections prepared under Part II of the Electoral Act, 1963, and published by a registration authority before the dissolution of Dáil Éireann which next occurs after the passing of this Act.</P>
      <P>Does this mean that, following the passing of this Bill, Dublin Corporation will have the responsibility continuously of having two sets of registers in preparation, one in the event of a by-election and the other in the event of the Dáil dissolving?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">

    <Speaker pid="PatrickJLalor" hpid="Mr. Lalor Mr. Lalor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lalor</NameTxt>
      <P>I have not had the experience.  My constituency has never been changed.  I have never heard any Deputy say that at the time of issuing an approved register he gets two copies, one covering, say, a section of Ballyfermot for a by-election and the other covering a section of Ballyfermot <Col N="1270" /> for a general election.  Is the Minister saying there will be two registers issued?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>There will be two names on the same page.  It is not actually as Deputy Lalor suggests.  The register of electors is drawn up and when this Bill becomes law it will be necessary for the registration authority, the local authority, to prepare the new arrangement. This preparation will be done by the local authority even before the direction is issued by the Minister but on the dissolution of the Dáil the Minister will issue the direction.  Meantime, the local authority will prepare the register to cover both eventualities if the constituency is changed.  This has been the position, I understand, since the passing of the 1947 Act.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Mr. Molloy Mr. Molloy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>An interesting point arises from the comments of Deputy Lalor.  For the sake of argument we must assume that by some mischance the present Government stays in office for longer than most people expect, say, for another two years. The registration authority is obliged to publish a final register on 15th April each year.  It has been customary for each sitting Member of the House to be circulated with a copy of that register each year, the up-to-date register for the constituency he represents.  If a general election did not take place for two years from 20th April this year we would have a situation where the registration authority would forward a copy of a completed register to a Deputy which in the case of a general election would be absolutely no use to him.  I do not know if this point was ever raised before but, unfortunately, when the Electoral (Amendment) Bill was before the House in 1969 the then Opposition allowed all of the sections in that Bill to pass without comment.  There were no queries on the Bill up to section 7, which we come to next.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We should like clarification on this point from the Minister.  Does he foresee that following the passing of a Bill similar to this the registration authorities will be issuing registers to Deputies for areas they will not be able to represent in the succeeding <Col N="1271" /> general election, if they stand?  That seems rather anomalous.  Could the Minister say if it is intended to distribute these registers which must cost the State and local authority quite an amount of money to circulate?</P>

      <P>Deputy Molloy has made a very good point.  It is something on which I am not too clear. Deputy Molloy says there was no debate on the last occasion when this type of Bill was passed but in the Official Report we see that sections 1 and 2 were passed without discussion. Sections 3, 4 and 5 were postponed and there was a discussion from then onwards.  I understand it was accepted that this was how it was done. Deputy Molloy said the Opposition did not make this point.  While it is being made now by the Opposition, in a sense it was the Government's job if there was something wrong to see that it was dealt with.  My information is that&mdash;and this has been the case since 1947&mdash;when a constituency is changed the local authorities draw up two registers and publish the register with two headings.  This has not happened in my constituency because I got the County Meath end of it, even though portion of it was in County Monaghan and portion in County Cavan.  I also got the Kildare end of it when portion of Meath was in Kildare. It never struck me that there was any particular significance in the fact that it was marked &ldquo;Kildare&rdquo;. The reason was that if a by-election occurred the old register would operate.  That is what has been done and that procedure will be adopted in this case.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have been making some inquiries about how the mechanics of it work. I am as anxious as anybody to ensure there is no unnecessary duplication.  I am assured it is necessary and that although inquiries were made earlier it was not found possible to find a simpler way of doing this.  I intend to pursue this matter and see if there is some simpler way.  All I can say is that I shall have further inquiries made and ensure that there is no avoidable duplication.  I understand <Col N="1272" /> we are following exactly the procedure which was followed up to now.  It appears the previous Government found it was all right and there must not have been much wrong with it or somebody would have noticed it.</P>

      <P>The Minister said that when this Bill was before the House previously section 6 which was dealing with a similar provision in the 1969 Electoral (Amendment) Bill was, in fact, discussed.  I should like to read out what was stated at that time in connection with section 6.  The question was proposed that section 6 stand part of the Bill.  Deputy James Tully of the Labour Party asked if the Minister could do anything about this problem possibly in this Bill or if not in some future Bill, where there are polling districts crossing. &ldquo;The result of these proposals before the House&rdquo; he said &ldquo;is that people living in certain areas could be voting several miles away in the heart of another constituency.  This is a peculiar situation and has arisen because of the way in which the boundary map is drawn up.  Could the Minister try to have constituencies or electoral areas straightened out in some way so that this will not keep on recurring.&rdquo;  The Minister replied: &ldquo;It is provided for in section 7.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In other words, the question put by Deputy Tully on section 6 should, in fact, have been asked on section 7 and really there was no question asked on section 6 when the Bill was before the House then.  The Minister may have inadvertently misled the House on that matter.  There never has been any proper discussion on section 6 and on what happens and on the matter of whether two registers will <Col N="1273" /> be published and circulated which could involve substantial waste of the taxpayers' money.  I am satisfied that the Minister is not too clear on what the procedure is.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>The very same situation has arisen now.  Section 7 is the section on which we should be discussing this.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Mr. Molloy Mr. Molloy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>Section 7 is the section where reference is made to polling booths.  Section 6 deals with the register of electors.  The Minister's question about areas crossing dealt with polling booths.  So, they did not discuss the question of the register of electors and its publication and the position arising following the passing of such a Bill and also the position arising in the interim period between the passing of the Bill and the holding of the next general election and the obligation of the registering authority to forward copies of the completed register to each sitting Member in his constituency, to give him a register of the total number of persons entitled to vote in that constituency.  It will, of course, be pointless because that constituency, in the case of quite a number as proposed by the Minister, and even as proposed by us in our amendments, would not exist after the passing of this Bill and the dissolution of the House.  I am satisfied that the Minister is not clear how this will operate.  He is not clear whether money will be wasted in distributing such registers to Deputies who will have no interest in them and he cannot clarify the point we raised.  We could come back again on Report Stage and the Minister might at that stage be able to inform us exactly what the arrangements will be, how this problem will be dealt with and he may be able to give us an assurance that there will not be any undue wasting of the ratepayers' money.</P>

      <P>The only mistake I seem to have made so far is that I have taken a section of the Bill out of a previous Act.  I suppose I should have more sense and found out if what Fianna Fáil have been doing over the years was right or wrong.  Deputy Molloy seems to be casting very grave doubts on what was done by the <Col N="1274" /> Fianna Fáil Government over the years and he has made me believe there must be something wrong with it, although I am not quite convinced.</P>
      <P>He referred to sections 6 and 7.  In fact, the former Deputy Boland, the then Minister for Local Government, referred to the fact that it was section 7 that dealt with it.  We are not talking about the same thing.  We are talking about a polling district split up and we are talking about the question of the register of electors.  The whole point in talking about the register of electors is because the names of the people on that register of electors are in a split polling district.  There is no point in talking about one unless we are prepared to relate it to the other.  The former Deputy Boland whom many people considered to be an unreasonable man pointed out that it could be discussed under section 7 and I, being a reasonable man, agreed to that and we discussed it under section 7.</P>
      <P>Apparently that does not hold any longer.  As a matter of fact, one of the comments of the then Deputy Boland was that it was handed down over the years.  I used almost the same expression earlier when I said that it was the way in which it was being done.  He also said his carving was done to suit the Constitution.  I quite agree with Deputy Molloy that, as it stands, it could appear that maybe there is too much printing being done and, perhaps, there is an easier way to do it. The best thing I can do is to have another look at this, see if it can be dealt with in another way and have an amendment on the Report Stage if this is necessary.  It appeared down the years that it was not considered necessary but I am always open to suggestions if they are good ones.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Mr. Molloy Mr. Molloy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>I am grateful to the Minister for agreeing to come back and give us a full explanation of the exact procedure to be followed when we come to Report Stage.  However, I would like to take him up on one point where he stated that because a similar clause was contained in the 1969 Act it should be good enough for Fianna Fáil today.  We do not accept that argument.  If the Opposition at that time did not decide that it was necessary <Col N="1275" /> to query these things and to establish what the facts were, then on their heads be it but we are not satisfied in Opposition that just because some similar section appeared in some Bill while we were in office we will not query it, that we will not see if it can be improved.</P>
      <P>We believe in progressive legislation, in improving the system in this country and in making a positive and worthwhile contribution to the debates here.  If we find that some measure that we brought before this House in the past comes before us again by way of a section in a Bill we will not concede our right to see if that can be improved.  It is a nebulous argument on the Minister's part.  I draw attention to it because it is about the fifth time he has used it.  He seems to be satisfied that if we accepted it four or five years ago in a previous Bill it must be all right.  It is a great compliment to the Fianna Fáil Government at that time that the Minister should think in this way and should put that forward as his only argument in favour of retaining such a section.</P>
      <P>I would like to make it quite clear to the Minister that as long as we are in Opposition we will examine every single line of every Bill that comes before this House.  If we can find ways of improving them we will do so.  We appreciate that the Minister has already recognised that we have been able to make a valuable contribution to Bills already.  He has accepted some of our proposals and the Bills have been substantially improved because of that.  We would like to see that continuing and we would like to give the assurance to the Minister that quoting that argument again will hold no water with us.</P>

      <P>The only thing I would like to say about this particular Bill is that Deputy Molloy seems to consider that he, in Opposition, is entitled to query things&mdash;rightly so&mdash; which neither he nor any member of his Government were prepared to do when in office.  It appears that this is the fifth or sixth time, or maybe more, in which Deputy Molloy particularly <Col N="1276" /> has been prepared to throw overboard everything that Fianna Fáil did.  It explains to me a lot of things because, unfortunately, I was under the impression that a Government who were in office for a good while would at least know the whole position. However, it appears to me that they did not bother to query anything at all.  As long as they were in office it was all right.  Deputy Molloy is saying that while that might be all right while they were on this side of the House when they are in Opposition it is an entirely different matter and they are then able to look for the mistakes they made.</P>
