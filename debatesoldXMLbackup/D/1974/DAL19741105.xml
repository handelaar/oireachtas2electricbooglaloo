    <Speaker pid="SeanMoore" hpid="Mr. Moore Mr. Moore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moore</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Taoiseach if there are any proposals before the Government to amend the Constitution or for the preparation of a new Constitution; and when these proposals are likely to be made public.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LiamCosgrave" hpid="The Taoiseach Liam Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>There are no such proposals before the Government.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMoore" hpid="Mr. Moore Mr. Moore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moore</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Taoiseach consider asking his Ministers to desist from making such observations as Deputy FitzGerald made&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanTreacy" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Seán Treacy">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>This is a separate matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMoore" hpid="Mr. Moore Mr. Moore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moore</NameTxt>
      <P>He said the Government might go it alone and seek to have the Constitution changed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanTreacy" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Seán Treacy">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy should relate his remarks to the question before the House.  Would the Deputy come to the question?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMoore" hpid="Mr. Moore Mr. Moore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moore</NameTxt>
      <P>They are to use the Constitution to cover up for the failure of the Government both economically and politically.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanTreacy" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Seán Treacy">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>I am afraid the Deputy is availing of Question Time to make a speech.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LiamCosgrave" hpid="The Taoiseach Liam Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy may not recall that the initiative, when it was originally taken, to consider amending the Constitution was taken <Col N="842" /> by the late Seán Lemass when he was Taoiseach.  He made a speech at a Fianna Fáil cumann in Limerick and subsequently he approached Deputy Corish, as Leader of the Labour Party, and me, as Leader of Fine Gael, and we had quite some correspondence. Eventually, an all-party committee was set up to consider it. The Deputy will recall that that committee reported.  At a certain stage the late Seán Lemass became a member of the committee.  The committee brought in certain recommendations. That was the first reference in recent times to a suggested amendment of the Constitution.  Since then there have been numerous references, both by the late Seán Lemass, who at the time, I think, spoke for the entire Fianna Fáil Party, and there has been discussion on the matter from all sides of the House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMoore" hpid="Mr. Moore Mr. Moore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moore</NameTxt>
      <P>I accept the Taoiseach's statement, but what I am trying to convey to the Taoiseach is that Deputy Lemass did not try to use the Constitution as an excuse for the failure of his Government, as Ministers appear to be doing at the moment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LiamCosgrave" hpid="The Taoiseach Liam Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>No such thing.  The late Seán Lemass announced this as a view on behalf of the Government at the time and he invited the two Opposition parties to participate. Since then there has been quite a bit of discussion but no one suggested at that time that Seán Lemass, as Taoiseach, was in any way doing something that he was not within his rights to do.  He invited other Deputies to participate in it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="Mr. J. Lynch Mr. J. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Taoiseach implying that the initiative of Deputy Lemass at that time was in reference to Articles 2 and 3 of the Constitution? Is it not more correct to say that what he had in mind was the possibility of looking at the Constitution as a whole and that the recommendations in regard to Articles 2 and 3 in the report of that committee emerged among scores of others?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LiamCosgrave" hpid="The Taoiseach Liam Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy will recall the report of that committee of <Col N="843" /> which Deputy Lemass was a member. Deputy Colley, who was then Minister for Industry and Commerce, was chairman.  The other Fianna Fáil Deputies were Deputies Andrews, Lemass, Molloy, Senator O'Kennedy&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="Mr. J. Lynch Mr. J. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>We are well aware of the constitution of the committee.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LiamCosgrave" hpid="The Taoiseach Liam Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I was about to say that what was agreed in relation to Articles 2 and 3 was that the committee had given careful consideration to the wording of these provisions. They continue:</P>
      <P>We feel that it would now be appropriate to adopt a new provision to replace Article 3.</P>
      <P>They went on to say:</P>
      <P>The wording which we would suggest is as follows:</P>
      <P>1.  The Irish nation hereby proclaims its firm will that its territory be reunited in harmony and brotherly affection between all Irishmen.</P>
      <P>2.  The laws enacted by the Parliament established by this Constitution shall, until the achievement of the nation's unity shall otherwise require, have the like area and extent of application as the laws of the Parliament which existed prior to the adoption of this Constitution.  Provision may be made by law to give extra-territorial effect to such laws.</P>
      <P>That was the unanimous recommendation of the committee at that time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="Mr. J. Lynch Mr. J. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>I am familiar with the recommendation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMKelly" hpid="Mr. Kelly Mr. Kelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>The only person who objected to it was Kevin Boland; no other member of Fianna Fáil opened his mouth.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="Mr. J. Lynch Mr. J. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Parliamentary Secretary please hold his patience while I address a question to the Taoiseach?  I am asking the Taoiseach specifically whether he is <Col N="844" /> implying that Deputy Lemass took that initiative with specific reference only to Articles 2 and 3.  Is it not true to say that it was with a view to an overall look at the Constitution that this initiative was taken?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LiamCosgrave" hpid="The Taoiseach Liam Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>Absolutely.  Deputy Lemass made a lengthy speech at a cumann meeting in Limerick and it was afterwards that he approached Deputy Corish and me.  We had quite some protracted correspondence and eventually agreed the terms of reference. Indeed at that time Deputy Lemass invited and specifically suggested to Deputy Colley that the younger Members of the Fianna Fáil Party should be put on the committee. Subsequently, with the passage of time, Deputy Lemass himself went on the committee and after he went off the committee they put Deputies of a more senior vintage than he had envisaged on the committee.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="Mr. J. Lynch Mr. J. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>May I put it to the Taoiseach again whether or not Deputy Lemass in his approach to him and to Deputy Corish referred not to Articles 2 and 3 of the Constitution when he spoke of reviewing the Constitution but to the Constitution as a whole?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LiamCosgrave" hpid="The Taoiseach Liam Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>He did not refer to any Article.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="Mr. J. Lynch Mr. J. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>That is what I wanted to get from the Taoiseach.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LiamCosgrave" hpid="The Taoiseach Liam Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Moore asked me a question&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="Mr. J. Lynch Mr. J. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>And the Taoiseach tried to imply that Deputy Lemass initiated this.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LiamCosgrave" hpid="The Taoiseach Liam Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>No, I did not.  I said the whole question of the consideration of this was in recent times initiated by the late Taoiseach, as he then was, Deputy Seán Lemass.  In fact, at the time it got a rather short welcome in a leading article, somewhat less explicit than subsequently became the fashion, in <i>The Irish Press.</i></P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="Mr. J. Lynch Mr. J. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>All I wanted to do was ensure that the Taoiseach was not implying that Deputy Lemass had regard to only Articles 2 and 3.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Col N="845" />
    <Speaker pid="LiamCosgrave" hpid="The Taoiseach Liam Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>Must I repeat it again?  I said all the Articles&mdash;the whole Constitution.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="Mr. J. Lynch Mr. J. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>That is established now.</P>

      <P>The trend in current unemployment levels for all activities is given by regular statements compiled in respect of the number of persons on the live register as maintained in the local offices of the Department of Social Welfare.  I am satisfied that there is no other method which would monitor short term unemployment changes with the same coverage and frequency.</P>
      <P>Weekly returns from the local offices cover the total live register subdivided by the principal administrative categories, e.g. unemployment benefit claims current, unemployment assistance applications current, and so on, with separate totals for men, boys, women and girls.  The weekly statement is issued one week after the date to which it relates.</P>
      <P>More detailed monthly returns from the local offices cover the total live register at mid-month classified according to a very detailed list of industrial groups in which building and construction work is distinguished. There is, of necessity, a longer delay in the compilation of these returns.  The most recent monthly industrial analysis relates to mid-August.  It is hoped to have the mid-September analysis available very shortly and to speed up the compilation for subsequent months.</P>

      <NameTxt>Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries (Mr. M.P. Murphy)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am aware of reports of exports of unmillable wheat.  I understand, however, that only small quantities have, in fact, been exported.  Under the common agricultural policy free movement of cereals between member states must be permitted.  This assures us of full access to grain stocks within the EEC which is of far greater advantage to our livestock feeders than the loss through export of small quantities of unmillable wheat.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnCallanan" hpid="Mr. Callanan Mr. Callanan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Callanan</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Parliamentary Secretary not consider setting up some kind of board?  The Grain Board was demolished by a stroke of the pen and surely there should now be something to replace it. The Parliamentary Secretary is aware that this board used to buy all unmillable wheat and subsidise it through the poorer parts of the west. We understood there would be another board to replace the Grain Board, but nothing ever happened and the result is there is now nobody to buy except the millers and they can export whatever they like.  The EEC has nothing to do with this. Would the Parliamentary Secretary not consider setting up some type of State board?</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelPatMurphy" hpid="Mr. M.P. Murphy Mr. M.P. Murphy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M.P. Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>As I indicated in my reply, the amount of unmillable wheat exported is relatively small.  It is exported to Northern Ireland and, by virtue of our membership of the EEC, we cannot prevent unmillable wheat being exported to Northern Ireland.  In so far as the latter part of the question is concerned, I can assure the Deputy that both the Government and the Department of Agriculture and Fisheries are mindful of special problems arising in the Deputy's constituency and in the western part of the country generally and appropriate steps are being taken to deal with these problems.</P>

    <P>
      <Col N="851" /> There is nothing in the EEC regulations against that.  The millers cannot be stopped, but the Minister could buy it.  That is what the Grain Board was doing until it was wiped out by a stroke of the pen.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelPatMurphy" hpid="Mr. M.P. Murphy Mr. M.P. Murphy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M.P. Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>While I am confident that the good returns received by feed barley producers this year will provide a strong incentive to them to increase the acreage next year, I would propose to intensify the publicity campaign launched last year and to seek the co-operation of the county committees of agriculture and the growers themselves.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnCallanan" hpid="Mr. Callanan Mr. Callanan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Callanan</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Parliamentary Secretary not consider, particularly in the western areas where the stock is very poor this year, ensuring that this will never happen again by having from one up to five acres for tillage to try to balance the economy?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelPatMurphy" hpid="Mr. M.P. Murphy Mr. M.P. Murphy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M.P. Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister made several statements regarding the advisability of growing additional cereals, particularly barley, and the price obtaining for barley at present is £65 per ton.  It is a remunerative price.  Even at the time of harvesting the price of something more than £50 per ton was a relatively good one. Because of the price barley is fetching at the moment, I am satisfied we will have an increased acreage next year.  The differential between the acreage last year and the acreage this year is not too great.  I know that Deputy Callanan will do his utmost to popularise the growing of barley as a good crop for farmers so that they will be able to provide for their livestock.</P>

    <Col N="852" />
    <Speaker pid="JohnCallanan" hpid="Mr. Callanan Mr. Callanan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Callanan</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree the price is reasonable, but the price for seed last year was approximately £100 per ton and the price of manure this year was nearly £100 per ton, so the profit would not be anything like what it should be.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelPatMurphy" hpid="Mr. M.P. Murphy Mr. M.P. Murphy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M.P. Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>The farmer must take all such factors into account and, having done so, it is then a matter for him to determine whether he will go ahead and grow a particular crop.  From the statistics we believe barley is a profitable crop to grow at the moment having regard to the reasonably good price it is fetching, £65 per ton.  Long ago we grew it for £20 per ton and money was more valuable then.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelPatMurphy" hpid="Mr. M.P. Murphy Mr. M.P. Murphy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M.P. Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>It is too early to make any firm estimates of farm income this year.  However, a 10 per cent drop in farm income as referred to in the Deputy's question, would leave total family farm income 17.5 per cent higher in real terms than it was in 1970.  As the 1974 income would be shared among fewer people, the increase per head would be even greater.</P>

      <P>All I can say is that, so far as agriculture generally is concerned, the prospects are brightening, very much so, and we have, fortunately, an unlimited market now for our milk supplies at a good price.  So far as young small cattle are concerned, prospects of better prices after Christmas are reasonably good.  Generally speaking, there is no need to be as pessimistic as some Deputies opposite seem to be about agriculture.  Pessimism is bad.

      <NameTxt>Mr. M.P. Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>I am informed that there are some difficulties in regard to the disposal of sheep for further feeding but this does not necessarily mean that the sheep trade is in a disastrous state.  Sheep prices have fallen in recent months from their previous high levels but producers are protected by the fact that the export guarantee scheme which effectively puts a floor on the price of finished sheep is still in operation.  In addition, sheep producers are in receipt of over £2½ million under the mountain lamb and hogget ewe subsidy scheme and the extension to the mountain lamb scheme.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Meaney</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries if he is aware that scab in sheep has been eliminated in Counties Cork and Kerry; and if he will ensure that officials of his Department will supervise the entry of sheep from other counties to sales in Cork and Kerry.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M.P. Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>The answer to the first part of the question is &ldquo;No&rdquo;. Some outbreaks of sheep scab continue to occur in Cork and Kerry.</P>
      <P>As regards the second part, my Department are looking into the question of identifying the impediments to a fully effective campaign against sheep scab and the measures necessary to overcome such impediments. However, priorities in dealing with animal diseases problems must be observed and this precludes at present the assignment of staff to supervise the entry of sheep to Cork and Kerry.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TimothyOConnor" hpid="Mr. O'Connor Mr. O'Connor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Connor</NameTxt>
      <P>Is there any method of protection to prevent people bringing sheep from outside into marts? This is happening in many cases.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelPatMurphy" hpid="Mr. M.P. Murphy Mr. M.P. Murphy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M.P. Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>We do not wish to set up borders around counties. One cannot expect a man in Limerick to be deprived of selling sheep to a man in Counties Cork or Kerry.  The local authority can compel a buyer to dip his sheep immediately, if the authority so desires.  I am sure local authorities are anxious to ensure that this disease is wiped out.  It is pleasing to note that, while it has not been <Col N="859" /> wiped out in Kerry, the number of outbreaks there in 1974 was five.  The county did very well in 1973 with only one outbreak reported.  The Department have taken cognisance of this matter and the Deputy can be assured that every assistance that can be given will be given to the sheep dipping committees of Cork and Kerry.  I should mention that these committees are doing good work in their efforts to eliminate sheep scab.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TimothyOConnor" hpid="Mr. O'Connor Mr. O'Connor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Connor</NameTxt>
      <P>This is not the answer.  A person cannot carry a TB animal into a mart and it is only reasonable to expect that this type of protection should be available to sheep breeders.  People have gone to considerable expense to protect their flocks against this disease but, through a regulation of the Department, or somebody else, sheep affected by this disease are allowed to wander into a mart from outside and to be presented for sale.  This should and must be stopped.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M.P. Murphy</NameTxt>

The Department are trying to get people to co-operate in seeing that the law is obeyed in their own interest, the interest of their neighbours, and of the country.  It is an offence, irrespective of where a farmer resides, not to dip sheep and the local authority, the body responsible for the sheep dipping regulations, is empowered to prosecute such offenders.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelPatMurphy" hpid="Mr. M.P. Murphy Mr. M.P. Murphy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M.P. Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>With the permission of the Ceann Comhairle, I propose to take Questions Nos. 24 to 27 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There has neither been a breakdown nor a slow down in the working of the compulsory scheme for the eradication of brucellosis which operates in the 13 counties comprising the brucellosis free area and the brucellosis clearance area and there has been no undue delay in the removal of reactor animals from farms in those areas.  The Deputies may have in mind the pre-intensive brucellosis scheme which is a voluntary scheme operating in the southern counties to which the compulsory scheme has not been extended.  Participation in that scheme is not as <Col N="867" /> great as I would like it to be even though the rates of grant have already been increased significantly since the scheme was introduced in August, 1973.  The number of participants is, however, now increasing and many of the larger creameries are in consultation with my Department as to how they can assist in the promotion and the operation of the scheme.  The disposal of reactors under the scheme is a matter for private arrangement between the herdowners and the proprietors of meat factories and I am aware that herdowners are experiencing delays in having their reactors taken up by factories.  I have been informed that these delays are due to the large numbers of cattle being purchased by factories at present.</P>
    <P>The date of final eradication of the disease will depend largely on the incidence of infection disclosed in the counties not yet subject to compulsory eradication measures and on the degree of co-operation received from herdowners and all other interests concerned.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnCallanan" hpid="Mr. Callanan Mr. Callanan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Callanan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad the Parliamentary Secretary is aware of the delay.  I am sure he is aware also that the reason for the delay is that factories are more interested in capturing the intervention and slaughter premiums for cheap cattle than in taking them from the Department.</P>

      <P>I am asking the Parliamentary Secretary is he aware&mdash; and I am sure he is because he says he is aware of delays&mdash;that this is the reason for the main delay, there is more profit out of the other proposition.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelPatMurphy" hpid="Mr. M.P. Murphy Mr. M.P. Murphy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M.P. Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>Unfortunately, the Deputy's assertion is right.  There are delays and herdowners are meeting difficulties in the disposal of reactors under this scheme, as factory capacity is taken up largely by other types of animals, intervention beef and so on.  There is a delay and the Department are trying to do all they <Col N="868" /> possibly can to ensure that a change will come about, so far as factories are concerned, in taking brucellosis animals, because it is desirable that animals affected by brucellosis should be removed from farms without delay. The Minister is concerned that some herdowners are experiencing difficulties in the sale of affected animals to factories.  Let us hope there will be a change of mind in the not-too-distant future.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M.P. Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>The position is we have lost little or nothing so far as the green £ is concerned.

      <NameTxt>Mr. M.P. Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>I shall do so. MCAs were very low up to April due to the operation of the provision in the regulations that the amount of an MCA in the case of a depreciated currency cannot exceed the charge against imports from third countries. Therefore, reducing the representative rate would have brought little saving in MCAs.  The Deputy will see I am giving him all the information available&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelPatMurphy" hpid="Mr. M.P. Murphy Mr. M.P. Murphy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M.P. Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>At the same time, it could have led to the situation where, with the Irish rate reduced, and the UK rate as was then almost certain unchanged, the subsidy limited to the amount of the third countries import charge paid on our exports to the UK would be less than the increase in the intervention price.  Thus, disposal to intervention could have been made far more attractive than sales to the UK and this would have placed an intolerable burden on the intervention system. Reducing the representative rate, therefore, would have been a self-defeating exercise in the case of cattle and beef at that time.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>I presume we may take it from what the Parliamentary Secretary has said that he is describing <Col N="871" /> the situation as he sees it in relation to cattle and beef only and up to April.

      <P>I move:</P>
      <P>That a sum not exceeding £2,354,000 be granted to defray the charge which will come in course of payment during the period commencing on the 1st day of April, 1974, and ending on the 31st day of December, 1974, for the salaries and expenses of the Office of the Minister for Foreign Affairs, and of certain services administered by that Office, including certain grants-in-aid.</P>
      <P>Eighteen months have elapsed since I first came before the Dáil to present the Estimates for my Department and for International Co-operation. At that time I set out the general lines along which the Government proposed that our foreign policy should be conducted, having due regard both to our ideals and to our interests.  Much has happened in the sphere of foreign policy since that time; there has been ample opportunity to test in a practical way the basic principles put before the Dáil at that time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Before coming to deal, however, <Col N="896" /> with the main developments of the past 18 months and with Ireland's response to these events, I should like to say something first about the practical organisation of the Department of Foreign Affairs as they have been evolving in response to increasing demands upon them.  Just how much these demands have increased in very recent times is not, perhaps, generally realised.  Since 1968 there has been the emergence of the Northern Ireland crisis which at times has imposed strains on our relationship with the United Kingdom and which at other periods, especially for a period after March, 1972, involved very close co-operation with the United Kingdom Government in seeking a constructive solution to the problem of Northern Ireland.  Since January, 1973, our membership of the European Economic Community, and our involvement in the political co-operation work of foreign policy consultation between the nine member states of that Community, has involved a new order of magnitude of external activity on the part of the Government and the public service; inevitably much of the brunt of this has fallen on the Department of Foreign Affairs because of their coordinating role in EEC matters, and because of their responsibility for Irish participation in the political co-operation work of the nine.</P>
    <P>As it happens, this past 18 months has also been a period of unusual activity in the sphere of international conferences.  Among the more important of these has been the work of the Conference on Security and Co-operation in Europe, which has been continuing&mdash;one might indeed say dragging on&mdash;ever since July of last year; there has been the work of the high-level energy group which since February of this year has been preparing an International Energy Agreement which will be brought before the House for approval in a few days' time; there has been the preparation for and the early stages of the Law of the Sea Conference which is of particular importance to this country; and most recently we have had the initiation of the Euro-Arab dialogue <Col N="897" /> in which Ireland as a member of the nine has to play its part.  There has also been a special session of the United Nations devoted to economic problems arising from the increased cost of oil and raw materials.  All these have been superimposed on top of the normal but demanding routine of our work as members of such bodies as the United Nations, UNCTAD, the OECD, the Council of Europe, the GATT.</P>
    <P>While the staffing and organisation of the Department of Foreign Affairs had been expanded during the years prior to 1973 in response to the needs of the Northern Ireland crisis and negotiations for EEC membership, this expansion was in no way adequate to meet the scale of activity demanded by events since the beginning of last year.  A substantial and rapid further expansion of staff and facilities to meet these needs has had to be undertaken at short notice and under great pressure.  During the course of the present year the diplomatic staff of the Department will have been increased from 143 to about 190, with commensurate increases at other staff levels.  The number of resident embassies abroad has been increased by five, from 20 to 25, and arrangements are in train for a very marked expansion of our diplomatic relations by means of multiple accreditation.  This is an arrangement which has been employed sparingly until recently but which enables a small country like Ireland to extend very considerably the range of its diplomatic contacts without involving itself in the very considerable expense of additional resident embassies.  In order to achieve this expansion of the Department's staff rapidly enough to enable its work to be carried on without a serious breakdown, it has been necessary to adopt special recruitment procedures including, exceptionally, recruitment of eight first secretaries from outside the Department.</P>
    <P>The recruitment of third secretaries this year has also been on a large scale than ever before; 25 have been appointed already this year and appointments have been offered to a number of others.  I may add that the <Col N="898" /> increase in the number of third secretaries recruited has reflected no diminution in standard.  On the contrary, the standard has been, in my view, particularly high.</P>
    <P>Recruitment at both first secretary and third secretary levels was facilitated by the making of new temporary arrangements in respect of the Irish language requirement for entry, in anticipation of more general changes in these requirements for the public service generally to be introduced shortly by the Government.  First secretaries were not required to have a knowledge of Irish but were given credit in the competition for a knowledge of Irish.  In the case of the third secretaries, special provision was made for the first time for applicants who had been educated outside the State.  I am glad to say that this had the desired effect of attracting a number of excellent candidates from Northern Ireland, most of the residents of which had hitherto been precluded from entering the Irish diplomatic service by virtue of the Irish language requirement and the absence of opportunities for learning Irish in many Northern Ireland schools.</P>
    <P>The need to gear the Department of Foreign Affairs up to the scale of the problems now facing this country in its external relations has been given a particular urgency during the present year by virtue of the fact that for the first six months of 1975 Ireland will, in rotation, hold the presidency of the European Communities. This is no honorary office. The country of the presidency has the obligation at ministerial level to chair all meetings of the Council of Ministers and, in the person of the Minister of Foreign Affairs, to represent the Community as a whole in certain aspects of its external relations to the rest of the world.  Moreover, at Civil Service level about 160 Community committees and working groups have to be chaired by civil servants from the country of the presidency&mdash;not merely I should emphasise from the Department of Foreign Affairs, but also from many other Departments of State.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="899" /> There is a further burden which is particularly onerous for a small country.  The mechanism of political co-operation or foreign policy consultation which has emerged in recent years, and which has developed with remarkable rapidity during the last two years, is a particular responsibility of the presidency.  There is no political secretariat, equivalent to the secretariat of the Council of Ministers, or the European Commission. All the preparatory work, and followup work, in relation to political co-operation has to be carried out by the staff of the Department of Foreign Affairs of the country holding the presidency.  This involves almost 50 meetings at official level in the capital of the presidency, as well as meetings of Foreign Ministers, and also responsibility for co-operation of the position of the nine in international institutions and conferences.  To the admittedly limited extent to which the members of the Community act jointly in their external political relations, or seek to co-ordinate their positions in respect of these matters, the capital of the country holding the presidency becomes the political capital of the nine for this period of six months.  Moreover, in the event of a crisis developing which concerns the interests of the nine, the process of &ldquo;crisis management&rdquo;, involving the co-ordination of the reactions of the nine to such a problem, has to be carried out in the capital of the presidency, in consultation with the ambassadors of the other eight member states.  This was, in fact, the process adopted by the nine during the Cyprus crisis last summer when the presidency of the nine played an active role that involved intensive consultation with the other member countries through the ambassadors of the other eight countries accredited to France.</P>
    <P>A small country like Ireland cannot, of course, afford to recruit staff especially for a short period of this kind.  We have to cope with these problems with the normal staff available, though in many cases &ldquo;borrowing&rdquo; from missions abroad or otherwise.  But while no additional <Col N="900" /> diplomatic staff had been recruited to cope with the problems of the presidency it was clearly essential that the belated recruitment process of 1973 and 1974, rendered necessary by the general addition to our responsibilities arising out of membership of the Community, should be completed before the end of this year so that the additional staff would be available for the critical period of the presidency.</P>
    <P>Before concluding my remarks about the organisational arrangements of the Department, and turning to questions of policy I should like to say something about two particular aspects of the Department's work&mdash; cultural relations and information.</P>
    <P>Cultural relations with other countries have been something of a Cinderella in Ireland for many years past.  The sums of money provided for this purpose have always been extremely small and on several occasions when the country faced economic difficulties there have been severe cutbacks&mdash;on one occasion of four-fifths and on another occasion of 60 per cent of the amount previously provided.  I am glad that it was possible in the first budget introduced by the present Government to make provision for a substantial increase in the sum provided for this purpose, albeit to a figure which is still by any standards very small, namely, £38,000 for the year 1973-74 as against £20,000 for each of the two preceding years. This figure was maintained in the current year, subject to an appropriate adjustment to allow for the fact that the present financial year is one of nine months, and it would be my wish that it should be at least maintained next year also, despite the economic difficulties we face.</P>
    <P>Owing to the dedicated work of the Cultural Relations Committee, which recommends to me how this money should be employed, we get extraordinarily good value from the very small sums that we provide for this purpose.  In the current nine-month year, even with several months to go, I can say that Irish artists have been able to show their works in the United States, in France, in The Netherlands; the Irish settlement in Iceland <Col N="901" /> has been appropriately commemorated by a stone pillar designed by Robert Ballagh and executed by James Murphy and Sons; Irish musicians and singers have been helped to display their talents in the USSR, Germany, Brazil, France, Spain, Wales, Belgium, the United States and Sweden; lectures and poetry readings have been organised in France, Germany, Austria and Britain; scholarships have been provided to summer schools; and donations of Irish books have been made to institutions in many parts of the world.</P>
    <P>I am particularly grateful to members of the cultural relations committee, including those from Northern Ireland, for the work they have undertaken in relation to these matters where their varied experience and dedication have enabled much better use to be made of limited sums of money than could be done were the matter left to be decided departmentally or, may I say, at ministerial level.</P>
    <P>I turn now to the information service of the Department.  The additional resources available for information activities have made it possible to produce a new departmental bulletin to replace that which had to be suspended in March, 1973, owing to staff shortages. The new bulletin will be issued fortnightly and will circulate to some 12,000 people abroad including the media in many countries, foreign offices, embassies, institutions and individuals.  A school facts sheet on Ireland intended for use by schools abroad is in course of production in a number of languages.  A significant fraction of the budget of the information section of the Department is devoted to the organisation of visits by journalists from other countries to Ireland.  I should like to pay tribute to the willingness which Deputies, from the Opposition benches as well as from this side of the House, and officials of State enterprises and of bodies in the private sector have shown to meet such journalists and to help them to get a more rounded view of Ireland as it is today.</P>
    <P>I refer now to the sphere of foreign policy.  The dominant theme in world affairs during the past year has been <Col N="902" /> economic&mdash;the growing world economic crisis, deriving from a sudden and massive transfer of claims on resources to oil-producing countries and to a minority of developing countries possessing particular raw materials, the prices of which rose several times over. This transfer has been at the expense of the industrialised countries and the rest of the Third World.  In laying emphasis on this, rather than on the development of <i>détente</i> between the super-powers, I am not diminishing the importance of the latter, but nothing that has happened in the sphere of world <i>détente</i> during the last 12 months compares in significance with what has happened on the economic front.</P>
    <P>The problems posed by this transfer of claims on resources are two-fold. First, there is the problem of adjustment for the countries whose import prices have been thus sharply raised and whose power to command the resources necessary to maintain and expand living standards has been thus significantly reduced.  Secondly, there is the problem, an even more serious one, posed by the inability of the countries to whom this claim on resources has been transferred to spend more than a fraction of the amounts involved, and the failure to achieve any adequate system of recycling the remaining funds.  This failure has had the effect of reducing world demand, thus threatening a fall in employment in many countries.</P>
    <P>Even without this problem of recycling financial resources the difficulties posed by the suddenness and scale of the increase in prices of oil and other raw materials would have posed serious problems in any event for the countries adversely affected.  Coming at a time when inflationary pressures within these countries were already stronger than for a long time past, the additional burden of import price increases would have created difficulties which, as at present organised, the economic system of these industrialised countries is not prepared to cope with.  However, had the additional financial resources accruing to the oil-producing countries been fully spent by them on the purchase of additional <Col N="903" /> goods and services, which because of the tiny populations of some of the major oil producers is in practice impossible, this would have tended to maintain total demand in the industrialised countries and to have avoided a serious recession.  There would still have remained the critical problem of the poorer developing countries, which lack raw materials or oil, and whose terms of trade have been seriously hit by this development.  This would have required emergency action, organised by the oil-producing countries and by the industrialised countries.</P>
    <P>But the failure to recycle about half of the financial resources involved has complicated the already difficult problems posed by the suddenness of these oil and raw material price increases and has faced the industrialised world with a significant drop in total demand for its goods and services just at the moment of greatest economic difficulty, when it was already struggling to cope with the inflationary effects of the oil and raw material price increases.</P>
    <P>Ideally, this potential world economic crisis should have been nipped in the bud by agreement between the industrialised countries themselves and between them and the oil producers to ensure the full recycling of the financial resources transferred from the first group to the second, and ideally, the two groups should have joined together to provide the assistance necessary to maintain and improve living standards in the poorest countries of all.  However, neither of these two things has happened.  Industrialised countries have been divided and uncertain in their approach to the oil-producing countries.  One view is that the main effort should be concentrated on achieving a reduction in the price of oil and that a successful joint effort between the industrialised and oil-producing countries to resolve the problem of recycling of financial resources would if anything tend to reduce the pressure towards such an oil price reduction.  Another view, widely held amongst European countries, is that any reduction in the price of oil would be unlikely to be on <Col N="904" /> a scale significant enough to resolve the fundamental underlying problem of maintaining world demand and that priority should be given accordingly to this latter task.</P>
    <P>There are also divisions among industrialised countries in respect of the relative weight they attach to the holding down of the rate of growth of domestic inflation as against the maintenance of economic activity and employment.  The United States and Germany both appear primarily preoccupied with the problem of inflation whereas many other countries, especially in Europe, would prefer to give priority to the maintenance of economic activity and employment, and to preventing the disruption in world trade that can follow from the pursuit by individual countries of economic policies designed to preserve their domestic situation even at the expense of a further setback to the flow of trade.</P>
    <P>The divisions between the industrialised countries on these issues, which have had a fatal effect in so far as efforts to resolve the underlying economic problem are concerned, are paralleled by a similar division with regard to the problem of helping the poorest developing countries which face the prospect of economic collapse and famine as a result of the sharp deterioration in their terms of trade following the increase in the prices of oil and raw materials.  Certain oil-producing countries, such as Iran, and some of the industrialised countries, most notably the members of the EEC, have felt that this urgent problem could be tackled only by creating a new emergency aid fund for these countries, in which the other major industrial powers such as the United States and Japan, and the other oil-producing countries should be pressed to join.  This proposal, involving the creation of a fund of the order of £1,250 million in the years 1974 and 1975, has not however got off the ground because it has not received sufficient support from a number of key countries.  Faced with this situation, the EEC has gone ahead to subscribe its share of the smaller fund that would result if those still holding back failed to contribute, but this <Col N="905" /> would clearly be inadequate to meet the desperately grave needs of these very poor countries.</P>
    <P>This gloomy world situation has produced certain other responses to which I must make reference.  First, a number of industrialised countries, those which are members of the EEC and others who are members of the energy group of OECD, met together in Washington in February on the proposal of the United States to consider action to meet the crisis caused by the increase in oil prices.  Out of this has emerged an energy co-ordinating group, comprising all those present at Washington other than France, which decided not to participate further in this exercise.  Out of the work of this group has emerged an energy-sharing agreement designed to protect individual members of the group, or others who subsequently join it, from the adverse effects of an embargo directed against one of their number.  Ireland has participated in this exercise, whose results could be useful, especially to a country like ourselves which to a very high degree is dependent for its energy requirements on imports of oil.  This agreement will be brought before the Dáil next week with a view to approval, so as to enable this country to adhere to it on Monday, 18th November.</P>
    <P>It must be recognised however that this agreement copes with only some aspects of the problem.  The oil embargo problem loomed large this time last year when Denmark and the Netherlands found themselves threatened in this way, although in the event the embargo did not prove seriously disruptive to their economies, at least little more so than in the case of other neighbouring countries.  But the problem of the future is unlikely to be a selective oil embargo of this kind&mdash;the problem is the impact on the world economy of the massive increase in oil and raw material prices, and the failure to recycle the funds of the oil-producers.</P>
    <P>Another response to the crisis was the calling of a United Nations Special Assembly in New York in May.  This meeting was proposed by Algeria and was orientated towards the problems <Col N="906" /> of the Third World and its relationship with the industrialised countries. Great emphasis was placed on the exploitatory character of this relationship, as it still exists even after the end of the colonial period.  Proposals were made for radical changes in the relationship which produced somewhat divided reactions amongst industrialised countries.  Some of these countries, especially those with heavy investments in the developing world, reacted strongly against certain of the more radical proposals put forward at this meeting.  Others, including Ireland, recognised the basic justice of the case presented by the Third World countries and, while not being able to accept all the propositions put forward by these countries, were generally sympathetic towards their case.  In my speech to that Assembly and, again in my speech to the General Assembly last September, I expressed such an Irish viewpoint, which I hope will command the support of Deputies in this House. Copies of these speeches have been placed in the Dáil Library.</P>
    <P>In our approach to all these problems, and indeed to world affairs generally, we act as a member of the European Economic Community, and a participant in its members' political co-operation mechanism, of which I shall have more to say later.  On the economic side, where the Rome Treaty applies, we are of course bound to act in concert with other member countries, taking decisions with them in accordance with the decision-making mechanism laid down in the Paris and Rome Treaties.  Within this decision-making system our voice is generally raised in favour of more liberal policies <i>vis-á-vis</i> developing countries. As a country which was itself effectively a colony not long ago, and as a country which within its own corner of the world is poorer than its near neighbours, we have a particular and instinctive sympathy with the developing world, as it faces the problems of the post-colonial era, and as it tries to drag itself up from a poverty unimaginable to us.  Our perception of the relationship between industrialised and developing countries tends to be somewhat different from that of some of our neighbours, most of whom have <Col N="907" /> considerable investments in developing countries.</P>
    <P>Of course we ourselves have our own material interests to preserve and protect, and as a country whose industrial sector is at a relatively early stage of development, we have a number of economic activities here which are particularly vulnerable to competition from those developing countries which are starting to industrialise. We also have an interest in preventing the European market from being flooded with agricultural products which we produce, or which are close substitutes of those which we produce.  Because few of the developing countries are situated in temperate zones, where the range of agricultural production is similar to our own, this is not however a major issue for us.</P>
    <P>I mention these matters however in order to illustrate the fact that in our foreign relations we must necessarily be concerned not merely with the pursuit of our ideals, but also at times with the harsh reality of the need to preserve our material interests. And at times these two can be in conflict with each other.  When this happens we are sometimes faced with very difficult choices and it would be dishonest to obscure the fact that where vital material interests of ours are affected, we, like other countries of the industrialised world, are sometimes inhibited from pursuing our ideals as wholeheartedly as we would like to think of ourselves as doing.  It is important that we recognise this fact, lest we delude ourselves into thinking that because we have less material interests in the developing world than some of our neighbours, we are on that account more moral than they, and proceed to lecture them on deficiencies in their attitudes towards these countries.  It serves neither our ideals nor our interests if we obtain for ourselves a reputation for hypocrisy in this way.</P>
    <P>Nevertheless, that said, the fact remains that in general our policies towards these countries are more liberal than those of some of our neighbours and that both within the <Col N="908" /> EEC decision-making system, and in our consultations with our eight Community neighbours within the framework of political co-operation, we have shown more sympathy and understanding for the developing world than some others have felt able to do.  I believe that this is recognised amongst the developing countries, many of whose political leaders are highly sensitive even to nuances of difference in the attitudes of the industrialised countries towards them and their problems.</P>
    <P>What is still perhaps not fully recognised in Ireland is the extent to which our membership of the EEC has brought us into a new and direct relationship with countries throughout the world between whom and ourselves until last year there was virtually no political or economic contact.  Thus, during the current year the Community has been negotiating trade arrangements with what it describes as the Mediterranean group of countries&mdash;namely, Spain, Algeria, Morocco, Tunisia, Israel and Malta.</P>
    <P>At the same time it has been renegotiating the Yaoundé Convention which has hitherto governed the relationship of the original six members of the Community with their associates&mdash; mostly former colonies of members of the six&mdash;and with members of the Arusha group, former British colonies in East Africa which have become associates of the Community.  This negotiation has, moreover, been extended to a group of countries known as the &ldquo;Associables&rdquo;, which are former colonies of the United Kingdom. In all, 46 developing countries are involved and the Community, ourselves included, is seeking to establish a new and more favourable basis for the trade relationship between the Community and these countries, as well as to make provision for new forms of aid to help their development.</P>
    <P>The Community has also been pursuing its association agreement with Turkey and reviving its association agreement with Greece, which was &ldquo;frozen&rdquo; during the period of the Colonels' dictatorship.  It is preparing to discuss with Portugal an improved economic relationship with that <Col N="909" /> country.  There are discussions also with Canada.  Trade agreements have been signed with countries such as Brazil and India&mdash;which I had the honour to present to the relevant committees of the European Parliament on behalf of the Danish Presidency at the end of last year.</P>
    <P>The international economic ramifications of the Community are indeed wide-ranging and in the development of these relations we have to play our part&mdash;from January next for six months in our capacity as the country holding the Presidency of the European community.</P>
    <P>An important new development, now imminent, is the implementation of the provisions of the Rome Treaty with regard to common commercial policy under which the Community will, as from 1st January next, deal, for example, with State-trading countries on a Community basis, rather than through trade agreements negotiated by individual members.  In view of the importance of this new arrangement and certain problems it has posed for us, I should like to dwell for a few minutes on this particular aspect of the Community's external relations.</P>
    <P>Unfortunately, arrangements for the new contractual relationship between the Community and the State-trading countries are not as far advanced as they should be and it now seems clear that there will be a hiatus between the termination of the existing individual bilateral trade agreements which we and other member countries have with State-trading countries, and the entry into force of the new arrangements.  We are very concerned lest this should lead to any interruption in the development of our trade with the State-trading countries, especially as at this particular time their economies are relatively immune from the effects of the world economic crisis and therefore provide expanding markets for our products. Our trading relationship with the USSR and countries in Eastern Europe is somewhat different from that of other member states.  Whereas the other eight members of the Community have had diplomatic relations with the Soviet Union and with other <Col N="910" /> countries in Eastern Europe for many years past, and have long-standing agreements and treaties on commerce and navigation, some of them going back 40 years with the Soviet Union, for example, we have only just opened diplomtic relations with the USSR and have yet to do so with other countries in Eastern Europe.  Moreover, we do not have long-standing agreements and treaties of commerce and navigation but only trade agreements of relatively recent origin; that with the USSR dates only from the end of 1973.</P>
    <P>The position of the USSR in relation to trade is that that country requires a juridical framework for the development of trade with other countries, and although the other members of the Community, like Ireland, have denounced their trade agreements in preparation for the new arrangements to be entered into by the Community with the USSR, that country takes the view that, nevertheless, so far as the other eight members of the Community are concerned the provisions of their earlier agreements and treaties on commerce and navigation continue to provide most favoured nation treatment to the USSR on a contractual basis.</P>
    <P>We raised this problem at a meeting of the Council of Ministers on October 15th and proposed that the difficulty thus posed for Ireland, which resulted from the fact that we had not in the past had diplomatic and trade relations with the USSR, should be met by a unilateral statement by the Council to the effect that the Community has always granted the State-trading countries most favoured nation treatment and that in present circumstances, particularly in view of the possibility of new negotiations with these countries, it does not intend to alter this treatment.  On the basis of this Community statement we are seeking to devise a formula which will ensure the continuation of most favoured nation treatment in our relations with the USSR while at the same time not breaching the Community requirement that individual bilateral trade agreements should not subsist between <Col N="911" /> member countries and countries outside the Community after 31st December next.</P>
    <P>Another lacuna in our relationship with State-trading countries is the absence of co-operation agreements with these countries.  Such agreements are not inconsistent with the requirements of the Community commercial policy.  A number of State-trading countries have indicated an interest in the conclusion of such agreements with Ireland&mdash;notably Rumania, Poland and Bulgaria, and negotiations with Rumania are, in fact, under way at the present time.  The Government is concerned to overcome as rapidly as possible the problems posed by the absence until recently of a commercial and diplomatic relationship with the State-trading countries, so as to provide Irish industry with easier access to these markets and to ensure that there will be no disruption of this trade as from the end of this year when our existing trade agreements have to terminate.</P>
    <P>In the time available I do not feel that I can dwell in more detail on the manifold ways in which the Community's external economic relations affect us in Ireland.  I have, however, said enough, I think, to indicate the enormously wide range of economic relationships into which we have been brought by membership of the Community and I should be happy to develop in more detail any of these aspects should Deputies wish to discuss them further.</P>
    <P>I now want to deal with the question of the Community's political co-operation procedures, under which the nine member States seek to coordinate their foreign policies in a separate forum from the Council of Ministers.  This practice goes back for some years but it has notably developed during the past 18 months or two years.  This imposes a considerable strain on our limited diplomatic resources, and this strain will be particularly evident during the first six months of next year owing to the fact that the work of organising political co-operation is not undertaken by the European institutions or <Col N="912" /> by a separate secretariat, but by the member state which at any given time holds the Presidency.</P>
    <P>For a small country like Ireland, this political co-operation mechanism has, however, considerable value.  It enables us to further our own views on major issues throughout the world so as to promote the peaceful resolution of disputes, the pursuit of <i>détente</i> and easing of tension, and the improvement of the relationship between the industrialised countries and the developing world.</P>
    <P>Of course, the corollary of having this opportunity to influence the external political attitudes of a group as powerful as the European Community is that in arriving at common attitudes we ourselves must also be willing to give and take.  No one need have any illusions that the other eight are going to adopt a position just because Ireland holds a strong view on the particular matter in question. But Ireland can, in conjunction with other like-minded members, exert some pressure in favour of the adoption of its viewpoint on matters of external political policy, at any rate where the vital interests of major member states are not concerned.</P>
    <P>In recent months the nine have, in fact, been able to reach a common position on a number of important international issues&mdash;in particular the Cyprus crisis, and the evolving political situation in Greece and Portugal.  Indeed, in the Cyprus crisis last summer the Community played a significant and distinctive role.  The &ldquo;crisis management&rdquo; procedure was put into effect&mdash; this meant that the ambassadors of the other eight countries in the capital of the Presidency&mdash;then as now Paris&mdash; were in continuous consultation, and reporting back to their Governments as appropriate, with a view to agreeing on approaches to the Greek and Turkish Governments that might help to secure peace on the island.</P>
    <P>The support given by the nine to the evolving democratic régimes in Greece and Portugal has also been significant.</P>
    <P>The latest manifestation of European political co-operation is the Euro-Arab dialogue.  The purpose of <Col N="913" /> this dialogue is to establish a new basis for relations between the member States of the European Community and the Arab states.  The dialogue will embrace a wide area of practical co-operation in the economic and technical fields between Europe and the Arab world.  Agreement to open a dialogue between the European Communities and the Arab countries was reached in June of this year and, following a luncheon meeting of all the Foreign Ministers of the nine in New York during the UN General Assembly five weeks ago and with the Foreign Ministers of the Arab countries work will shortly start at the level of the Commissioners appointed for this purpose by participating countries.  The Deputy Secretary of our Department, Mr. Seán Kennar, has been appointed to represent Ireland.  It is envisaged at present that there will be five working committees in the fields of agriculture, industrialisation, equipment, financial co-operation, cultural and technical co-operation.</P>
    <P>The relationship between the affairs of the European Economic Community, properly speaking, and the political co-operation mechanisms of the nine members of the EEC, is an evolving one.  The Community's system of decision-making, on the basis of proposals by the European Commissioners, does not, of course, operate in the sphere of political co-operation, where decisions are taken by unanimity but without the European Commission playing any formal role&mdash;although the President of the Commission is now present throughout these meetings.</P>
    <P>Meetings of Foreign Ministers dealing with political co-operation and meetings of the same Ministers acting as the Council of Ministers of the EEC in the past have taken place quite separately.  For several years past the practice has been that the European political co-operation ministerial meetings have taken place four times a year&mdash;two during each Presidency in the capital of that Presidency.  However, the development of European political co-operation has been such that the need for discussions more <Col N="914" /> frequently than four times a year has become felt during the current year, and the practice has grown up of holding additional meetings on European political co-operation before or after, or even in intervals during, meetings of the Council of Ministers in Brussels or Luxembourg.  Moreover, with the development of this process an increasing number of topics are handled which have both European Community and political co-operation aspects.  The presence of the President of the Commission ensures that discussion of political co-operation does not stray over into the European Community area without those present being alerted to this, so that, where necessary, discussions can be continued in the Council of Ministers on EEC aspects of the matters concerned.</P>
    <P>The parallel arrangement for Community decision making and political co-operation is, of course, to a certain degree cumbersome and at times confusing. Perhaps for this reason and, perhaps, also because of a desire to be seen to be making some progress with the institutional development of the Community at a time when there is general concern at the lack of progress in this and other areas, proposals have recently been put forward for a closer co-ordination of the two decision making mechanisms and for the participation of heads of Government on a number of occasions each year. These proposals are currently under consideration, together with a number of major policy issues such as regional policy, inflation, employment and energy policy, with a view to establishing whether sufficient progress can be made by agreement among member states on these issues to warrant the holding of a summit in Paris before the end of the year.  The Ministers of Foreign Affairs of the Community will review progress in these matters at a meeting in Brussels next Monday prior to the next Council of Ministers.</P>
    <P>The Irish position on these matters can be briefly stated.  We are conscious of the damage to confidence in the Community caused by the failure to implement the decisions of the last Paris summit, held shortly before enlargement <Col N="915" /> of the Community, and by the notable failure at the Copenhagen summit held under a year ago.  We would not wish there to be a repetition of these failures and we feel, therefore, that a summit or Presidential conference should not be held unless it is adequately prepared, and unless it is clear that important and constructive decisions will be taken&mdash;and carried through in the period after the meeting of heads of Government.</P>
    <P>Secondly, we are concerned that any new arrangements for decision making in relation to political co-operation and the European Economic Community should not be such as in any way to threaten the existing Community decision making system, by weakening it or by reducing the vitally important role of the European Commission as the initiator of proposals for consideration by the Council of Ministers.  For a small country like Ireland this role of the Commission, however much from time to time we may criticise the way in which it is carried out, is of vital importance in maintaining a balance between the smaller and larger countries within the Community.</P>
    <P>I should, perhaps, add that after the bitter experience of the failure of the Community to take decisions about regional policy at the end of last year and in the early months of the present year, we would regard regional policy as a crucial test of success or failure.  We have already indicated to the other member States our concern in this matter, which has not been lessened by the emergence from the European Commission in the last few days of a proposal for the regional fund which in the view of the Government has not provided an adequate basis for such a fund.</P>
    <P>The essential elements of a successful regional policy and adequate regional fund are in the view of the Irish Government the following:&mdash;</P>
    <P>1.  The policy, and the provision of resources from the fund, should be concentrated particularly on those parts of the Community where the need is greatest&mdash;namely, Southern Italy, Ireland and Greenland.  This does not necessarily preclude the <Col N="916" /> allocation of some resources from the fund to other areas of lesser need in different parts of the Community, including parts of Great Britain.  It would indeed be desirable, if the fund is to have the full support of the peoples of the Community, that disadvantaged areas in most member countries should be seen to benefit from its operation.</P>
    <P>2.  There should be concrete recognition of the special problem that this country faces as a result of the absence of any region&mdash;even in the Dublin area&mdash;whose output and incomes per head are large enough to permit a substantial transfer of resources to the less well-off parts of the State.</P>
    <P>3.  The fund itself should be of adequate size to make a real impact on the problems of underdevelopment in the less well-off parts of the Community and should be designed to expand in a manner and on a scale that will make it possible for countries which have severe regional problems to contemplate movement towards economic and monetary union in the years ahead.</P>
    <P>The original proposal of the Commission was for a fund of 2,250 million units of account to cover the three years 1974, 1975 and 1976, out of which Ireland would receive 4 per cent.  For Regional Policy purposes there are 2.4 units of account to the £.  Allowing for Ireland's contribution to the fund this would have meant a net receipt of 80 million u.a. or £33 million over this three-year period&mdash; namely £7 million in 1974, £11 million in 1975 and £15 million in 1976.</P>
    <P>We made it plain at the time that this proposal was put forward that we regarded such a fund as inadequate to achieve the objectives of the Paris Summit and the aims of the Community as set out in the preamble to the Rome Treaty; that the proposed distribution involved the great bulk of the fund returning to the countries which had contributed to it so that the net transfer would be extremely small in relation to the size and urgency of the problems facing the Community; that the proposal that funds should aid areas covering over <Col N="917" /> half of the Community and containing one-third of its population was in contradiction to the Commission's own report, which related the regional policy to &ldquo;problems linked to certain limited geographical areas&rdquo;; that we could not accept proposals that took no account of the varying intensity of need in the regions so designated; that the proposals were also unacceptable because of the failure to take any account of the relative ability of member States to finance their own regional aid programme&mdash;a special problem for Ireland, as I have already mentioned; that the proposals failed to implement the Commission's own suggestion of retaining a proportion of the fund for certain particularly intractable regional problems; and that no account was taken of Protocol No. 30 of the Accession Treaty on Ireland.</P>
    <P>Discussion of regional policy and the regional fund was temporarily abandoned in March when it became evident that there would at that time be no agreement on an amended proposal of the Commission.  This amended proposal involved a much smaller fund of 1,450 million u.a. and would have given Ireland a similar sum to that originally proposed, representing 6 per cent of the total fund.  We made it clear at that time that neither the amount proposed for Ireland nor the share of the fund allocated to Ireland were acceptable, but the failure of this suggestion to secure acceptance was primarily due to disagreement between Britain, France and Germany in respect of their relative contributions to, and benefits from, the fund.</P>
    <P>The latest proposal of the Commision involves a fund which is slightly smaller even than the reduced figure which the Commission had in mind last March.  Moreover this figure appears to relate to a period comprising the years 1975, 1976 and 1977, so that the actual amount available from it for the three years 1974-1976 originally contemplated by the Commission would be only 780 million u.a., as against 1,450 million u.a. for these years in the Commission's suggestion of last March and 2,250 million <Col N="918" /> u.a. in the Commission's original proposal.  The share allocated to Ireland remains at the unacceptable figure of 6 per cent.</P>
    <P>Deputies will, I feel, agree with me that the Government have had no alternative but to indicate that proposals along these lines could not be acceptable to them and, indeed, that if there is no willingness to improve on these proposals, the seriousness of member States' commitments to regional policy, and through regional policy to the achievement of economic and monetary union, must be questioned.</P>
    <P>The desirability of holding a presidential conference or summit in these circumstances is clearly questionable, as a summit which failed to reach agreement even on regional policy might only serve to undermine confidence in the Community and could indeed weaken the commitment of its member States to the achievement of its objectives.</P>
    <P>Another aspect of Community policy in which Ireland has a vital interest is the common agricultural policy.  Our long experience of an unequal economic relationship with a major industrial country, Great Britain, has taught us that Ireland's economic interests can be protected only in a situation where it has guaranteed free entry for its agricultural products to major markets on terms no less beneficial than those available to farmers in these countries.  It is these features of the common agricultural policy which are of such vital importance to us, and which indeed provide the strongest economic arguments for Irish membership of the Community.</P>
    <P>We recognise of course that the particular way in which these principles are applied may not always provide satisfactory conditions for our farmers, and the common agricultural policy obviously needs to be kept under review with a view to making sure that it is achieving the objectives set out in the Rome Treaty.  Clearly in sectors of agriculture as sensitive as the livestock industry, where the problem of holding surplus stocks of livestock or meat can be very great, it <Col N="919" /> is not sufficient to provide for an intervention mechanism without at the same time ensuring guidance to farmers, through the price mechanism or otherwise, with a view to preventing the emergence of surpluses on a scale that may overstrain the system.</P>
    <P>It is because we recognise the need to improve aspects of the operation of the common agricultural policy that we have agreed to a review of this policy to be completed by the Commission by February next, but in agreeing to this we have made it absolutely clear that we cannot accept any proposals that put at risk the basic principles of the common agricultural policy, which offer to an agricultural country like Ireland the only possible guarantee of fair treatment in external markets.</P>
    <P>A major issue within the Community at the present time, and one clearly of vital importance to Ireland, is that which has been described in Britain as the &ldquo;renegotiation&rdquo; of the United Kingdom membership of the Community.  The phrase &ldquo;renegotiation&rdquo; is, of course, a misleading one. There is no question of terminating the Rome Treaty or the Accession Treaties and negotiating a new legal framework for the relationship between member countries.  What is involved&mdash;and all that can be involved is consideration of certain proposals by the United Kingdom for modifications in existing policies which, in the view of the Government of that country, operate unfairly to the disadvantage of the UK.</P>
    <P>It is the hope of the Government that the discussions between the United Kingdom and other member countries on these matters will reach a successful conclusion&mdash;and will reach that conclusion speedily.  The further development of the Community has already been held up significantly as a result of the uncertainties arising from the British request for further consideration of these policy issues.</P>
    <P>Clearly continued British membership is in the interest of this country. Our interests are obviously best served by membership, and it does not <Col N="920" /> appear that even if Britain left, it would be in our interest, economically, or politically, to follow suit, although of course a situation in which Ireland was a member and the UK was not would pose some problems for us. Were Britain to leave the Community unilaterally and in breach of her Treaty obligations, it is not at all certain what trade régime would operate as between the United Kingdom and the Community thereafter.  While industrial free trade arrangements have been made by the Community with certain other countries, such as Sweden, it is not clear that similar arrangements would necessarily be made with the United Kingdom, a major industrial competitor of the other Community countries, if it withdrew from the Community.  Were the Community to impose a common external tariff on industrial goods from Britain, this could clearly prove disruptive of trade between the UK and Ireland as a continuing member of the Community.</P>
    <P>It now seems unlikely that the question of Britain's relationship with the Community will be settled before the end of this year, but it seems probable that it will have to be settled before the middle of next year.  This means that this problem, as well as the general review of the common agricultural policy, is likely to fall to be settled within the period of the Irish presidency, thus imposing a very heavy responsibility on this country.</P>
    <P>At this point, referring to our position in relation to the British &ldquo;renegotiation&rdquo; and the review of the common agricultural policy, I must make reference to the situation that exists at present in respect to the export of cattle and meat to and through Great Britain. The problems of the British farmers, which have led to the present agitation, derive from the failure of the United Kingdom government to implement its obligations under the common agricultural policy to operate the intervention mechanism.</P>
    <P>Hitherto, in view of the arrangements that had been made to ensure that our farmers do not suffer from this, we have not pressed the question of the implementation by Britain of <Col N="921" /> this obligation.  However, if the Irish cattle and beef industry, both in respect of export of cattle to Britain and exports of beef through Britain to the Continent, suffer as a result of a combination of the failure of Britain to observe her obligations under the common agricultural policy, and her failure to prevent the obstruction of free movement of goods through her ports, this country could not be expected to continue to acquiesce in the unilateral derogation by the United Kingdom from her Community obligations.</P>
    <P>I should like to turn now to other aspects of international relations which do not specifically involve the European Economic Community.  I have already, when speaking of political co-operation amongst the nine, referred briefly to the emergence of democratic régimes in Greece and Portugal.  I should like to say how warmly we welcome these developments.  I have had the opportunity to congratulate personally the Foreign Ministers of both these countries on these developments and have offered to them our best wishes for their efforts to complete the democratisation process and to ensure against any reversal of it by totalitarian elements of the Left or Right.  Ireland has strongly supported the return of Greece to the Council of Europe, and the reactivation of the EEC association agreement with that country.</P>
    <P>With regard to Portugal, our pleasure at the restoration of democracy and freedom in that country has been all the more wholehearted because of the new Portuguese Government's determination to end colonial involvement in Africa and to give freedom as soon as possible to the former Portuguese colonies there.  Portugal does not at this stage feel that its economy is ready for full membership of the EEC but it may be possible to strengthen the Community's economic relations with Portugal.  Ireland will give the fullest support to any proposals along these lines.</P>
    <P>Deputies may be aware that for some years past we have been represented in Lisbon not by an ambassador but by a chargé d'affaires, as an expression <Col N="922" /> of our concern at the failure of Portugal to take action with regard to its colonial territories.  In recognition of the change in situation we have decided to appoint an ambassador to Portugal again and have sought the agreement of the Portuguese Government to the diplomatic officer we propose to appoint.</P>
    <P>The developments in Portuguese Africa clearly have profound significance for Southern Africa as a whole. Thus, for example, Rhodesia's ability to break through the international blockade has largely depended upon access to the outside world via ports in Portuguese Africa. Moreover, the decolonisation of Mozambique and Angola will bring about the emergence of independent African states close to the borders of South Africa, Rhodesia and Namibia. Already there have been some indications of a modification of South African policies in response to this new situation.  It is not yet clear how significant are the moves being made by South Africa in relation to Namibia but we shall give the fullest support to the High Commissioner for Namibia, Mr. Seán MacBride, in his efforts to secure South African agreement to a peaceful transition of Namibia to independence.  It is intolerable that this country, a League of Nations mandated territory which is now under the trusteeship of the United Nations, should continue to be occupied and controlled illegally by South Africa.</P>
    <P>We were particularly happy to welcome to Ireland during the year the United Nations Special Committee on Apartheid.  Deputies are aware of this Government's strong commitment to the elimination of the apartheid system and we were glad to have had the opportunity of this visit to demonstrate our particular concern about this matter.  This visit marked, I believe, a recognition by the UN Special Committee of Ireland's particular commitment in this matter, and also marked their recognition of the excellent work undertaken by the Irish anti-apartheid movement which continues to gain strength.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="923" /> As a general comment on these developments in Greece, Portugal and Southern Africa, it is, perhaps, worth saying how heartening it is to find that the desire for freedom cannot be suppressed even by a régime in power for as long as that which ruled Portugal for almost half a century, or as brutal as that which controlled Greece for a number of years.  Too often in recent years democratic systems in various countries have been overthrown and replaced by dictatorships of the Right or Left.  Now we can see that this is not a one way process and that all these dictatorships and totalitarian systems remain under constant threat from the freedom of the human spirit.</P>
    <P>It is also worth commenting that much of the tension in the world derives from the lack of freedom of many peoples and from their desire to recover lost liberties.  South Africa and Rhodesia are cases in point.  The intransigence of their ruling groups threatens peace in that area and also threatens the long-term survival of these groups themselves.</P>
    <P>Another part of the world which is suffering from an oppressive régime is Chile where in September 1973 a military <i>coup d'etat</i> overturned the democratically elected President Salvador Allende.  This coup was preceded by considerable unrest and class conflict, for which neither Government nor the Opposition were blameless. The régime of oppression which emerged from this coup showed itself, however, to be one of the most brutal in the world.  Many thousands of people were murdered by the new régime.  Even today vast numbers of the population are suffering from deprivation and want as a result of continued oppression.  In so far as interference from outside Chile contributed to this situation it must be deplored by all who are concerned with human freedom.</P>
    <P>The concern of Irish people for the fate of the Chilean people has been shown by the work undertaken here to receive refugees from Chile and to help them make a new life in our <Col N="924" /> community, integrating themselves into our society.  I should like to congratulate all those who have been concerned with this work which the Government has been glad to facilitate.  I should like to tell the Chilean families who have arrived here how warmly welcome they are to our shores.</P>
    <P>The repression of human freedom in countries like South Africa, Rhodesia and Chile brings home to us how important it is to establish a universal code of human rights.  We in Western Europe are fortunate to have such a human rights code, which transcends national sovereignty, and gives to the citizens of many Western European countries a right to appeal against their own governments should their own governments act unjustly towards them, and which gives to governments power to ensure that the enjoyment of these rights is secured by other governments.  The Strasbourg cases are examples of this process which, however slow moving, is, nevertheless, unique in the world.</P>
    <P>Unfortunately, no similar system to preserve human rights exists outside Western Europe.  The United Nations code of human rights is clearly inadequate and has far too many loopholes. The fact is that many countries outside Western Europe still reject the concept of human rights transcending national sovereignty.  This is particularly true, for example, of the Soviet Union and the countries of Eastern Europe and represents a significant part of the fundamental difference that exists between the two parts of our divided continent.</P>
    <P>This is relevant to the conference on security and co-operation in Europe which was launched at Helsinki in July, 1973 and which has continued to drag its way along ever since at a depressingly slow pace.  It is true that progress has been made there in respect of some issues.  But in the area of the so-called &ldquo;third basket&rdquo;, the humanitarian field involving such matters as human rights, personal movement, wider access to information and so forth, progress has been extremely slow.  This reflects the very deep difference in philosophy between Western and Eastern Europe <Col N="925" /> and the strong emphasis in Eastern Europe on the social obligations of the individual rather than on his personal human rights to which we in Western Europe attach primary importance.</P>
    <P>There are two other major areas of tension to which I must refer&mdash;the Middle East and Cyprus.  The progress made by Secretary of State Kissinger in securing separation of the Israeli and Arab forces on the Egyptian and Syrian fronts was a great breakthrough and one welcomed throughout the world.  But the problem remains of getting these countries and other interested parties to the Geneva Peace Conference which has yet to get off the ground. Ireland's position in regard to this whole issue has been made clear in the United Nations at various points over the decades, and in its endorsement of Resolution 242 of the United Nations Security Council on 6th November, 1973, jointly with other members of the nine.</P>
    <P>The Irish position with regard to this whole question can be summarised as follows:</P>
    <P>1.  The State of Israel has a right to exist, within secure and recognised borders, a condition of security which it has never hitherto enjoyed.</P>
    <P>2.  The territories occupied by Israel since 1967 must be evacuated.</P>
    <P>3.  The legitimate rights of the Palestinian people must be taken into account.</P>
    <P>This matter has recently come before the United Nations in the form of a resolution giving to the Palestine Liberation Organisation the right to present their case at the plenary session of the United Nations.  While we had reservations about this method of procedure&mdash;hitherto such bodies have been heard in committees of the United Nations rather than in plenary session, and we are not committed to recognising the Palestine Liberation Organisation as the sole representative of Palestine people&mdash;we voted in favour of this resolution making these reservations clear.  Because the committee process had been by-passed, it <Col N="926" /> was only by permitting the PLO to be heard in plenary session that a voice on behalf of the Palestine people could be heard at the United Nations. Four countries voted against the resolution&mdash;the United States, the Dominican Republic and Bolivia as well as Israel.</P>
    <P>It is the Government's hope that peace negotiations may start soon and that they may yield a just solution&mdash; just to Israel, which has had to live in a state of virtual siege since its establishment, and just to the Palestinian people, many of whom have been exiled from their homeland and have been forced to live as refugees for decades.</P>
    <P>Another area of serious tension is Cyprus where the coup organised with the connivance of the dictatorship then in power in Greece disturbed a highly delicate internal situation and precipitated the invasion of the island by one of the three guaranteeing powers, Turkey.  It is extremely disturbing that the situation has remained frozen since the second Turkish attack which brought a large proportion of the country, including many areas traditionally inhabited by Greeks, under Turkish control.  The plight of the refugees, of whom there are several hundred thousand, is terrible and the lack of progress in resolving the problems created by these events during the summer, is deplorable.  The adoption by the United Nations General Assembly on 1st November of a resolution on Cyprus which was accepted by both Greece and Turkey may, we hope, be a step forward and may provide a basis for progress towards an equitable solution.  In the Government's view it is vital that the independence and territorial integrity of Cyprus be preserved, that partition be avoided and that the return of hundreds of thousands of Cypriot people to their homes be secured at the earliest possible date.</P>
    <P>In the course of my speech I have had occasion to refer to a number of important conferences concerning political or economic problems.  There is one other conference which, as I mentioned at the outset, is of particular importance to this country&mdash;the Law of <Col N="927" /> the Sea Conference, which held its first substantive session at Caracas in the summer and is due to reconvene in Geneva in March next year.  There has been a certain amount of comment in the Press and elsewhere that the Caracas session was in some sense a disappointment.  That is not the way the Irish delegation saw it.  It was essential that all proposals should be put on the table before negotiations could begin.  This was done at Caracas.  The way is now open for significant advances towards a generally agreed Convention.</P>
    <P>This conference is of the most vital importance to Ireland as it will determine the principles in accordance with which our maritime jurisdiction will be determined.  This could well cover an area larger than Ireland itself, potentially rich in mineral and living resources. Its development could dominate the whole future economic structure of the country.  The Government marked their appreciation of the importance of the conference by sending the Attorney General as their special representative to outline their policy.  At the conference the Irish delegation played an active role tabling specific proposals on the high seas, on the Continental Shelf, on fisheries jurisdiction of coastal states and also for special provisions on exploitation of anadromous species, such as salmon.</P>
    <P>It is, in our view, of the greatest importance that agreement should be reached at this conference.  It would be sad and indeed dangerous if the seas of the world were to be divided up on the basis of unilateral claims and strong-arm activities.  We shall work to avoid this; we shall work to encourage a spirit of compromise in the interest of an orderly agreed settlement which is in the long-term interest of all countries participating in the conference. Accordingly we have abstained from making claims of a sort which might anticipate the results of the conference and we deprecate the actions of those who have acted otherwise.</P>
    <P>Before concluding my remarks on Foreign Affairs and turning to the International Co-operation Vote, I should like to refer to the problem of <Col N="928" /> Northern Ireland in the context of Anglo-Irish relations and indeed in the context of foreign policy generally.</P>
    <P>First, I should like to say that during the past 18 months I have been greatly impressed by the degree of interest and concern in the Northern Ireland problem expressed informally on behalf of governments throughout the world on the many occasions when I have had the opportunity to meet my opposite numbers.  We should not underestimate either the extent to which other countries are informed about this problem or the concern and sympathy that exists in relation to it.  I am conscious of the fact that at an earlier period, when British policy in relation to Northern Ireland was inadequate or negative, other countries sought informally to help towards a constructive solution by stressing their concern to the United Kingdom Government.  I have every reason to hope that should the occasion arise we could expect similar useful expressions of concern from our friends.</P>
    <P>Secondly, I want to say that a significant part of our role with regard to Northern Ireland is exercised through the medium of our relationship with the Government of the United Kingdom.  This is so because, as the state exercising jurisdiction over Northern Ireland, the United Kingdom Government has primary responsibility for the situation in Northern Ireland, and for working towards a solution that will provide peace and justice for the people of that part of the island.  If that Government failed to show the necessary imaginative insight into the problem, or to show the necessary determination to resolve the problem constructively, damage would be done which it would be difficult to retrieve.</P>
    <P>The Government have been concerned since last May at the evident drift in the situation in Northern Ireland towards deadlock and despair, and, as I mentioned at the time when the Constitution Convention was first proposed, we share the doubts expressed by the Leader of the Opposition in the United Kingdom as to the <Col N="929" /> likelihood of a constructive outcome from this initiative.</P>
    <P>What must be of particular concern to everyone who has followed the situation in Northern Ireland during this current year is the vulnerability of this society to violence from relatively small groups of people in either section of the community and to the disruption of essential services there by groups of workers from one section of the community who, as a result of past policies of governments of Northern Ireland or inaction by governments in the United Kingdom, appear to have control over these essential services.</P>
    <P>It is clear now in retrospect that no adequate preparation had been made for the contingency of an organised disruption of the life of the province such as took place six months ago.  It might be argued that this failure in preparation can be explained by the fact that the contingency had not been foreseen; this argument could not however, explain a failure to prepare for a repetition of these events, which could threaten the economic life of the province and the lives of its citizens, especially those who are most vulnerable&mdash;the minority in east Ulster.  The United Kingdom Government are well aware of our concern about these matters.</P>
    <P>The United Kingdom Government are also aware of our continuing concern at the impact of security activities in Northern Ireland on the two sections of the community there. The minority section of the community feels that the scale and intensity of security activities in their areas are clearly disproportionate to the volume of violence generated within these areas by comparison with that generated elsewhere.</P>
    <P>There is another aspect of the activities of the security forces in Northern Ireland which has caused us direct concern. This is the number of Border incidents during the past 18 months. No less than 174 of these incidents have been recorded since I last presented my Estimate in this House. A small number of these have been of a particularly serious character, <Col N="930" /> involving assault on members of our security forces or threats against them.  We have constantly pressed the United Kingdom authorities to ensure against a repetition of these kinds of incidents which clearly render much more difficult co-operation between the security forces on either side of the Border against illegal organisations.</P>
    <P>These many problems affecting relations between Ireland and the United Kingdom, arising from the situation in Northern Ireland, have absorbed much time and attention during the past 18 months.  As an indication of this there have been no less than 16 meetings at political level between representatives of the two Governments as well as many other meetings at official level. Throughout these discussions the Government have consistently adopted a constructive approach and have sought to avoid anything which would exacerbate relations between the two sovereign powers.  Any enduring solution of the Northern Ireland problem will require the closest co-operation between this state and the Government of the United Kingdom.  It is upon the just and effective exercise of that Government's responsibilities in relation to Northern Ireland that progress towards a solution primarily depends.</P>
    <P>I should like to turn now to the International Co-operation Vote.  Deputies will be aware that a large part of this Vote is devoted to development aid but that the sums voted here include only part of our development aid programme.</P>
    <P>When this Government came into office 18 months ago Ireland's total development aid, under this and other Votes, and from the Central Fund totalled only £750,000 or .035 per cent of GNP.  This was one-twentieth of the target set by the United Nations and was one of the lowest figures in Europe.</P>
    <P>Since then the Government have quadrupled the amount of development aid, doubling the necessary provisions both in our first and again in our second budget.  As a result, the amount provided in the current year is of the order of £3 million, although in the event this may not be fully spent because <Col N="931" /> some of the sums provided for may not be called upon during this year.</P>
    <P>Much of the increase has of course been required of us as a result of our membership of the European Economic Community, within which however we have consistently pressed for more liberal provisions in respect of development aid, even though this must increase our contributions to the Community. We recognise that every extra hundred thousand pounds which we are willing to contribute, and which is matched by equivalent contribution from other members, will yield a total of £22 million of extra aid to countries in need.</P>
    <P>Deputies should be aware however that the increase in our development aid provision has not been confined to the very large expansion required by EEC membership and by membership of other international organisations. Despite the increased burden imposed by these requirements, the Government have gone beyond these minimal obligations and have created a new sector of development aid&mdash;a bilateral aid sector.  This has meant that the Government provide aid directly to countries suffering from disasters, they finance projects by Irish interests for aid to particular developing countries, and through the Agency for Personal Service Overseas they finance Irish people serving in developing countries and helping with the social and economic development of these countries.</P>
    <P>Under the heading of disaster relief in the current year, we provided assistance both to Bangladesh and Cyprus.</P>
    <P>Under the heading of bilateral aid, the interdepartmental committee, which deals with these proposals under the chairmanship of my Department, have recommended the financing of courses in training techniques, in hospital administration and in the administration and development of industrial free trade zones.  These have been organised by the Institute of Public Administration and the Shannon Free Airport Development Company.  Finance has also been provided for a two-week <Col N="932" /> development programme for African owners and managers of small businesses of the Nairobi Industrial Estate in Kenya which will be organised by the Irish Management Institute within the next couple of months.</P>
    <P>A number of other projects are under consideration and it is hoped that next year the scale of our bilateral aid for projects will be significantly increased.</P>
    <P>In this connection I should like to pay particular tribute to the enthusiasm and dedication of the managements and staff of a number of our State enterprises which have worked together to prepare a programme of development aid activities to be financed by bilateral aid.</P>
    <P>With regard to the Agency for Personal Service Overseas, in the short time this has been in operation it has already sponsored almost 100 people who are serving in nine African countries and five Asian countries.  Almost a score of bodies in this country, both lay and religious, are involved in this programme and the range of skills provided is impressive&mdash;ranging from people with expertise in agriculture and fishing, through such professions as engineering, medicine, nursing, physiotherapy and pharmacy, to social workers, teachers, youth workers, community development workers and laboratory technicians.  This is an excellent start and the Government are indebted to the board of the agency for the speed with which it has got off the ground.</P>
    <P>At the present time the arrangements for the organisation and administration of bilateral aid are adequate to the limited amounts involved.  However, with the expansion of the Government's development aid programme, which over the next few years is likely to involve a disproportionate growth in the bilateral element of the programme, it will be necessary to consider how best to organise the system of allocating bilateral aid, how best to co-ordinate the different development aid activities being undertaken by various agencies and interests in this country and how best to secure the widest possible basis of public support <Col N="933" /> for this programme through the involvement of organisations and individuals throughout the country. During the next year this whole question will be reviewed.  I have already indicated, at a recent conference on development aid, my willingness to consult with the various interests involved with a view to ensuring that the permanent arrangements which we make for the organisation and administration of the bilateral aid programmes are effective and command the widest possible basis of public support.</P>
    <P>The Government are determined that the progress made in the sphere of development aid will be maintained in the years ahead.  Accordingly, they decided in July to commit themselves to a medium-term programme for the expansion of development aid.  It is the aim of the Government that, taking one year with another, the volume of development aid will increase annually by the equivalent of .05 per cent of GNP in the years ahead.  In the year immediately ahead however it may be difficult because of the particularly serious financial and economic situation facing the country, to achieve this latter aim, but the Government's commitment to increase the aid in absolute terms and as a share of GNP will be maintained.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>At the outset I should like to thank the Minister for allowing me to have a copy of his very wide-ranging address some hours before he started to deliver it.  In view of our experience on a previous occasion, and in view of the comprehensive range of the Minister's address this afternoon, he will appreciate that it was quite helpful for me to have an opportunity of perusing it some little time in advance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the course of that very comprehensive address he covered many aspects of our international relations and the effects they have on our economic and political situation.  Quite appropriately he has, too, drawn attention to injustice where it exists in various parts of the world, to world poverty, which is a pressing human problem for all of us and a problem <Col N="934" /> which the Irish people, amongst many other people, need to be reminded of quite constantly and consistently and also to various forms of repression.</P>
    <P>It is quite appropriate that the Minister should have covered these areas to the extent that he did.  At the same time, the Minister will recognise that our capacity to do something effective and meaningful, even through our membership of international organisations is, of necessity, limited.  Whether in relation to Chile, or South Africa, or Portugal, or to the problems of world hunger, our capacity is limited by the size of our own resources and by the limitation of our influence in world affairs.</P>
    <P>If there is one area of our international relations, if such it can be called, where our capacity is certainly much less limited, it is in our relations with the United Kingdom and particularly in so far as our relations with the United Kingdom relate to the problems, the injustices and the repression which have been part of the Northern Ireland scene for a considerable time. For that reason, however limited our power may be in other areas, that limited power is in stark contrast to the great possibility and potential we have in the area of Northern Ireland and our relations with the United Kingdom.</P>
    <P>However serious the effect on our economy of international crises, the oil crisis and many others&mdash;and many of them have had a very serious effect and impact on our economy&mdash;the Minister will agree that, even if one were to judge only from the point of view of economic disadvantage in this part of Ireland, the Northern Ireland problem has had a much more serious and much more damaging effect on our economy. Therefore by any criteria which could be applied I would have expected that the Minister would have spent a considerable time in discussing this problem particularly in so far as we can have any influence on the policy of the United Kingdom Government and also in so far as we can state our own policy in a positive and consistent manner.</P>
    <P>It is all the more surprising that the Minister has made what can be stated to be a rather brief reference to this <Col N="935" /> constant problem in Ireland, in view of the flow of personal statements which we have had from various Ministers over the past few months.  This flow of personal statements has given rise to a degree of confusion and a feeling in the community in general that there is a lack of leadership, a lack of clear direction, and a lack of consistency in this Government's attitude towards what is, I suppose, our most pressing and urgent problem.</P>
    <P>This concern, I regret to say, was not in any way allayed by the address of the Taoiseach to the Oxford Union recently.  I do not need to join in the reaction&mdash;I will not say chorus&mdash;of the various commentators who expressed disappointment, to say the least of it, with the speech of the Taoiseach on that occasion.  For me, and I am sure for many others, the most disappointing aspect was the fact that it seemed to show a lack of any real sense of urgency, any real sense of concern, any real sense of confidence.</P>
    <P>The content of the address, in terms of historical analysis was not very clear, and certainly in terms of future programming and policy was totally inadequate.  At a time when the people of every section in each community in the country, and the people of the United Kingdom, are looking for some new ideas, some sense of real issues, it was disappointing that the Taoiseach did not use that opportunity to good effect.  I thought that, to a certain extent, the address of the Taoiseach rather highlighted the points which John Laird was making on behalf of the Loyalists in that debate. I do not want to dwell any further on that aspect.</P>
    <P>Incidently, we are led to believe that the address which was actually delivered was, in fact, a second speech, a first speech having been withdrawn. I do not know whether the Minister or any member of the Government would like to comment on that recent press report.  If there is any substance in it, I can only make two comments on it. The first is that, if the Taoiseach is capable of drafting two different speeches on such a vital topic to our <Col N="936" /> national interest and identity, that confirms my view of lack of direction. The second is that, if the second speech was more positive than the first one, then the first one must have been very sadly lacking indeed.</P>
    <P>Another very disquieting aspect of the recent speeches by the various Government Ministers is that they seem to have aroused almost an equal measure of opposition from every political source in Northern Ireland. Up to yesterday one could have said that the only political group in the North of Ireland who had not expressed antagonism, or concern, or whatever, to this Government's suggestions from time to time were the group categorised as the moderate Unionists.  The statement by Mr. Peter McLachlan yesterday on behalf of the categorised moderate Unionists has filled up that gap.  In reply to the speech of the Taoiseach he said we should now accept that the majority view must prevail and that those holding minority views must consent to work within the framework desired by the majority.  We find that this Government's policy, and policy statements, and various statements promoted by individual Ministers, have not significant support of any section of the Northern Ireland community. The SDLP have made their reservations known publicly and privately, and the Loyalists have consistently told this Government of their reaction to some of their statements, and now we have the last element in the Northern Ireland community rowing in on the course.</P>
    <P>I regret to say that the Minister on the occasion of the recent debate on Northern Ireland took the opportunity to launch his weapons towards this party.  It was almost an attempt to ensure that there would be universal opposition from every source, north and south.  I have already replied to the Minister's suggestions in that connection and I do not intend to delay on that aspect now.</P>
    <P>I should like to refer the Minister to what he said in the course of one of the many addresses he delivered in the United States when he indicated that the Government's attitude, and their function, in relation to Northern <Col N="937" /> Ireland policy was to promote and encourage positive initiative.  The only initiative we see being promoted&mdash; whether one calls it positive or not is another matter&mdash;in conjunction with the British Government, is, unfortunately, the last shred of the dismembered Sunningdale package, the proposals about which we expect to hear more, to launch the extra territorial jurisdiction.  This was part of the Sunningdale package.  All other parts of the package have long since been dismembered.</P>
    <P>If there are any other positive steps, and that I accept is a positive step in the sense of doing something, then the Minister should make us aware of them.  With reference to that step, and pending what we hear from the Government when they introduce whatever they consider necessary in this House, I should like to mention to the Minister, and the Government, that, as Austin Currie said so clearly on the occasion of last week's Oxford Union debate, and as many speakers from both sides of this House have said, any steps in this direction, if they are being taken on the basis that the violence in Northern Ireland is coming from without, would be taken for wrong and unfounded reasons. Secondly, subject to what we may see, we have indicated that if there is any interference with constitutional rights and obligations to ensure that the citizens will be tried by the courts established under this Constitution we would view that with the greatest concern and the Government could not expect to have our support.  In fact, the Government could expect the opposition of this party to any such proposals.</P>
    <P>When the Government intend to introduce such proposals I hope they will remember that we still have at the European Court of Human Rights a complaint pending against the British Government for the maladministration of justice, for inhuman treatment, for torture and otherwise. While that complaint is pending and until such time as there is a satisfactory conclusion to it, I wonder how much we can do which would not be accepted as in some way being a tacit recognition by this Government of the <Col N="938" /> right of that Government to act in that oppressive way or in any oppressive way.</P>
    <P>The Minister stated recently that it would take a barbed wire barrier, or something in the nature of the wall dividing East and West Germany, to ensure and guard against any infringements across the Border in our country.  In the light of that I thought it would be appropriate at this time to mention to the Minister and his Government that I hope they give serious thought to these basic considerations before introducing any legislation unless these constitutional rights, fundamental human rights and other rights to which I have made brief reference, will be protected.  In this connection I should like to mention that we have been concerned at the increasing rate of cross-Border infringements by the British Army in recent months.  The Minister has made reference to this.  I understand that in recent months&mdash;I am not at liberty to disclose at this stage the exact extent of the information supplied to us&mdash;the rate of cross-Border infringements has increased considerably.  The Minister, and other members of the Government, have sometimes implied that this party have no positive attitude beyond referring to, as they have mentioned on occasions, the emotional matter of cross-Border infringements.</P>
    <P>In that connection I should like to state that I was concerned that a document which the Minister's staff supplied, on request, to Mr. Esmond Smith, of the Fianna Fáil research group, in relation to cross-Border infringements and incursions, which this gentleman clearly indicated was for the purpose of a debate which we intended to promote through our members of the European Parliament, was made available to other members of the European Parliament.  Those other members of the European Parliament had access to what we thought, wrongly now it seems, was confidential information in reply to a confidential letter.  Not only that but they assumed that such was their right and stated so publicly.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Dr. FitzGerald Dr. FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>On a point of information, this is based on the principle <Col N="939" /> that the Opposition has a right to access to information to questions publicly but that the Government should not provide information privately.  We could have said we would give no information until the Dáil meets when it could be obtained at Question Time.  It was needed for this debate and we thought we should provide it to the Deputy's party.  We must provide it equally to all parties and not give it to the Opposition only. The suggestion that it should be given to the Opposition only is a bit unreasonable.</P>

I was told there was a question down in the House coming up for answer, that it could not be given to me because it was to be given equally to all.  At other times I sought information of an economic character and I was told that was a matter that could be handled only by way of parliamentary question, so that it would be equally provided to all and could not be given to me confidentially.  This seemed to me to be a fair decision. Secondly, the information was not sought for confidential purposes but for public debate in the European Parliament. It seemed to me therefore that I had to be fair to all parties. I was under no obligation to give confidential information to members of the Opposition, and not to Government representatives.  In fact, I was under an obligation to give it to all equally.</P>

      <P>The Minister has not given any example of an occasion when any previous Government, or any Fianna Fáil Minister in Government, took the step, which the Minister has now apparently acknowledged was taken with his consent, of providing such information where it was simply requested by a Member&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>I think the less we say about it now the better it would be in the Minister's interest.  But I would say this.  Henceforward, when the national interest of this country is being pursued, the Minister need not expect Fianna Fáil representatives in the European Parliament to seek any assistance from this Government for their work in that Parliament if the Minister thinks that he is free to give that same information to others who have not sought it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>I see no such obligation.  I see it as one the Minister has established for himself.  I leave the House and the public to judge whether or not there is such an obligation.</P>
      <P>In regard to our Northern Ireland policy and the European Community, there is one obvious area where there is scope for an initiative by this Government, or a joint initiative by this Government and the British Government. One might even say this initiative has been invited by the Commission, and most recently by Commissioner Thomson, who said on his visit to this country, and to me in discussions, that, even in advance of the establishment of the regional fund of the European Community, funds would be available to the British and Irish Governments to set up joint cross-Border projects within the European Community.  In the course of his very wide-ranging address the Minister made no reference to any discussions which our Government have had with the British Government in that very positive and challenging area.  At no stage did the Minister or any member of the Government make any comment on that response of Commissioner Thomson to that suggestion which we put to him in discussions we had with him some time in advance of his visit to Ireland.</P>
      <P>Here is an opportunity for a positive initiative arising out of our membership of the European Community to help towards a solution of the Northern Ireland problem.  Yet we have not heard one whisper from this Government regarding their intentions in that connection.  I hope that by the time this debate concludes we may hear some such whisper.  I hope it will not be merely by way of excuse, apology or explanation for the silence so far but that it will convey some positive information of positive steps now being taken.  If not, we shall express our total dissatisfaction with and total opposition to the Government's lack of initiative in this area.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is also at page 38 of the Minister's speech what I find to be an extraordinary implication.  The Minister <Col N="942" /> was acknowledging the assistance we had got from the other governments and from international opinion from time to time.  He said:</P>
    <P>I am conscious of the fact that at an earlier period, when British policy in relation to Northern Ireland was inadequate or negative, other countries sought informally to help towards a constructive solution by stressing their concern to the United Kingdom Government.  I have every reason to hope that should the occasion arise we could expect similar useful expressions of concern from our friends.</P>
    <P>There is a clear implication there, if not a positive statement, to the effect that British Government policy at this time is neither inadequate nor negative&mdash;</P>
    <P>... should the occasion arise we could expect similar useful expressions of concern from our friends.</P>
    <P>If the Minister or any member of the Government can explain to me how they can suggest that British Government policy in relation to Northern Ireland, in recent times and at present, has been both adequate and positive, then the criteria by which this Government judge them are certainly much less severe, and indeed much less valid, than the criteria by which we&mdash;and indeed the people of this country&mdash; judge them.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Dr. FitzGerald Dr. FitzGerald">

    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Dr. FitzGerald Dr. FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I am just reminding the Deputy of the description I gave of the situation, which does not accord with his interpretation of it.  See page 39.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>I appreciate that the Minister subsequently talked about the &ldquo;drift ... towards deadlock and despair,&rdquo; but he has not tied that drift towards deadlock and despair to the inadequate or negative policy of the <Col N="943" /> British Government.  If we are to have a debating match now on the interpretation of it, it is there.  The Minister had time to draft his speech and consider the implications of what he said.  It is there clearly and it is not just the interpretation I am putting on it.</P>
      <P>This is an extraordinary concession. When one takes it in conjunction with our own recently developed line of disengagement of political interest in Northern Ireland, it is no wonder the Loyalists are now asserting their demands in a way they have not done previously.  It is no wonder they can cock a snoot at the British Government, the Irish Government or any other government.  It is no wonder that the minority feel that to a very considerable extent they are in a very insecure position.  It is no wonder that the people of this country generally, and indeed the people of the United Kingdom, feel that nobody knows where these Governments are going in the solution of the Northern Ireland problem at present.</P>
      <P>I do not object to silent diplomacy. I do not think anyone can object to silent diplomacy.  But silent diplomacy can be effective only when the parties to it take a clear, easily identifiable public stance on any matter.  When these two Governments, now apparently engaged in silent diplomacy, have no such clearly identifiable stance, then the Minister's plea for silent diplomacy can be interpreted as nothing more than an excuse for inactivity.</P>
      <P>The Minister said also&mdash;and here again I hope he may have an opportunity to explain if what appears to be the meaning of this text is not in fact what he did mean&mdash;on page 40:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The United Kingdom Government are also aware of our continuing concern at the impact of security activities in Northern Ireland on the two sections of the community there.  The minority section of the community feels that the scale and intensity of security activities in their areas are clearly disproportionate to the volume of violence generated within these <Col N="944" /> areas, by comparison with that generated elsewhere.</P>
    <P>Is the Minister not prepared to state as a fact that, apart from the fact that the minority section of the community may feel that it is an incontrovertible fact that the scale and intensity of the security activities in these areas is clearly disproportionate he does not have to rely on or hide behind the feelings&mdash;well-based and factual&mdash;of the minority community?  I gather from the Minister's nod that he accepts it is a reality.  At least I am pleased to give him an opportunity of stating categorically what is implied as being the feeling of the minority section only of the Northern Ireland community.</P>
    <P>Again, on pages 40 and 41&mdash;and here I am talking of the attitude of the Government in this connection&mdash;the Minister says, when referring to the discussions the Government had with the British Government:</P>
    <P>Throughout these discussions the Government have consistently adopted a constructive approach and have sought to avoid anything which would exacerbate relations between the two sovereign powers.</P>
    <P>If that has been one of the main criteria applied by the Government in their discussions and consultations with the British Government in relation to Northern Ireland policy, it is no wonder we have seen little activity from the British Government.  If our Government's concern is not to do anything which would exacerbate relations between the two sovereign Governments, it goes a long way to explain the principles of silent diplomacy, the total lack of positive initiative by either Government.</P>
    <P>When the former Government lodged the complaint against the British Government at the Court of Human Rights in Strasbourg, does the Minister think that did much to weld together the two Governments?  Was the Minister not aware of the concern expressed by the British Government at that time, of their stated opposition to the actions of the Fianna Fáil Government, of their attempts, through diplomacy and otherwise, <Col N="945" /> to have the Fianna Fáil Government withdraw the complaints?  Having regard to this Government's attitude in their consultations, and in view of their concern not to exacerbate the relations between the two sovereign Governments, had they been in the position of Fianna Fáil would they have lodged the complaints?  Even more relevant, in view of their concern not to exacerbate relations between the two Governments, are they now eagerly and enthusiastically pursuing the complaints at Strasbourg?</P>
    <P>I wish to make it clear that I am not engaging in what might be suggested as the easy way of knocking the British Government.  The Minister may smile but I recognise how much we have in common, how much it is in our mutual interest to work closely together in a spirit of neighbourly concern.  It is more vital that we show a spirit of neighbourly concern in our discussions with the British Government than with probably any other Government because we have so much in common in our historical associations, in our economic and other ties. We have human ties in the many Irish people living in England and the British people living here.  It is vitally important that we maintain good relations but I should have thought both sovereign Governments were mature and sophisticated enough in international diplomacy to recognise that does not mean we should be concerned not to exacerbate feelings between the two countries if that were necessary.  I hope the Government will not be unmindful of their obligations, will not be so concerned about hurting the feelings of the British Government that they overlook their obligations as an Irish Government.</P>
    <P>The British Government were concerned about the complaints at Strasbourg and with the international reaction to them.  The British people and their Government had widely and publicly expressed concern about torture when it was mentioned in countries such as Algeria.  Obviously they were concerned and embarrassed that what they had complained about in other countries was being done in their name in our country.  It was <Col N="946" /> appropriate that we lodged the complaints and if they had to be embarrassed about the matter it was appropriate that they should be.  In other areas to which the Government may refer, I hope they will pursue matters with vigour to ensure justice and the establishment of human rights in Northern Ireland.</P>
    <P>A second positive and equally obvious initiative concerns internment without trial.  There has been no reference in the Minister's speech to this running sore in Northern Ireland, nor was there any reference in the Taoiseach's speech at Oxford to this matter.  Silence does not always indicate lack of concern but when a matter that has been raised so constantly here and elsewhere is ignored in two speeches by the Taoiseach and the Minister for Foreign Affairs one can only assume the Government have not a clear policy in relation to internment without trial in Northern Ireland.  Apart from the injustice of internment without trial, it is significant that the Government seem to have overlooked the fact that there has been opposition from almost all sides in Northern Ireland to its continuance. The Government have not as yet publicly and clearly stated their position in regard to this matter.</P>
    <P>Lest I fail to meet the standards of behaviour and responsibility now being established for all of us by the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs, which he so clearly set down for our national guidance, whether for journalists, communicators, parliamentarians, liberals so-called or otherwise, on my own behalf and on behalf of my party may I state I unreservedly condemn all forms of violence from whatever quarter in Northern Ireland. In the light of that statement, equally I unreservedly condemn internment without trial as politically self-defeating and wrong in itself.</P>
    <P>I hope the Government will take the second positive and obvious initiative, that they will channel the support that is there for them on all sides to press the British Government to take immediate and urgent steps to end this running sore in Northern Ireland.  By doing so they will have taken positive <Col N="947" /> steps towards the establishment of peace.  It must be evident to the Minister and to others at a time when violence is continuing at a terrible rate, that the ending of internment without trial is at the very least a political risk worth taking.</P>
    <P>While the tragedy continues the irony may be that it has in many ways forged new bonds of human concern and mutual tolerance within Northern Ireland.  This brings me to a third area of which the Government appear to be totally oblivious.  Many families in the North of Ireland of different denominations who have suffered either through death or injury have recognised a common bond in their terrible sufferings.  Many of them have come together in community organisations and otherwise to work together and, while the violence continues by the extreme although limited number of men, these community organisations that have been born out of tragedy are working constantly and against many odds towards breaking down the barriers of sectarianism by their common concern.</P>
    <P>Neither this Government nor the British Government have recognised that fact.  They have done nothing of which I am aware to promote the activities of these organisations beyond commending what they may do.  They have not assisted them in financial or other terms towards establishing community recreation centres in the troubled, front-line areas.  They have done nothing to channel the undoubted determination that exists in Northern Ireland among these families who are the victims of terrible tragedies.  It is no wonder that the Reverend Joseph Parker, who has been in the forefront of the movement towards reconciliation and peace, has thrown up his hands in defeat and has said there is nothing further he can do.</P>
    <P>Where is the leadership and support that should come from Governments? Surely, difficult though it may be, there should be some attempt by our Government and by the British Government to introduce programmes for educational exchange between North <Col N="948" /> and South because we must at least endeavour to save the young.  There is a need for programmes involving regular visits between community organisations both in the North and in the South.  There is need, too, at least for the structure for a national community council, representative of both parts of the country and there should be a programme involving the coordinating of recreational activities.</P>
    <P>There may be some who will say that, politically, such moves are not very important but so much has failed in the way of political effort that efforts in other directions must be made.  We can be blamed for not looking to these other areas where so many people, such as the Reverend Parker, have been trying so hard but have been frustrated by the lack of support which they experienced.  I take this opportunity of paying tribute to the Reverend Parker and, through him, to others who try also to give examples of tolerance and reconciliation. Perhaps, sometime others will come to realise the efforts that these people have been making.  If this Government cannot make moves in this direction, it will be an honour for us and also an obligation on us to do so when we are in Government again.</P>
    <P>Here at home changes are necessary in regard to some aspects of our society but some of the situations that require changing could be considered to be the consequences of the partition that has bedevilled this country for so long.</P>
    <P>As the Leader of this party has said, and as I have said on many occasions, we could, for example, have a look at our system of denominational education. Our consideration of this question would have a positive effect on the attitudes of the Northern majority towards our society and it might induce an understanding and a tolerance in so far as the younger people are concerned.  Partition has created very effectively two different societies in this country, societies which have lived in separation and in distrust purely because of the ignorance they have of each other, an ignorance of any common interest that exists between them.  The distrust and prejudice <Col N="949" /> that is prevalent is evidence of that ignorance.  Until such time as we begin to consider the roots of that prejudice, particularly in so far as young people are concerned, that terrible weed will continue to grow.</P>
    <P>Apparently, the Government have failed to notice, too, the emergence of what one might call the spirit of nationalism both in Scotland and in Wales and in Northern Ireland also. Even the Westminster Government are acknowledging this nationalism to the point that they are now prepared to adopt structures of administrative government for Scotland and Wales.</P>
    <P>On the occasion on which the whole community in Northern Ireland were offended gratuitously by the British Prime Minister when he referred to them as spongers, there was a magnificent opportunity for our Taoiseach at least to dissociate himself from those remarks.  Had he done so he would have gone a long way towards winning the support, the goodwill and the sympathy of many people in Northern Ireland. The Prime Minister's remarks were directed generally towards the Loyalist community and these are the people who, generally, do not look to us for any sense of sympathy or concern. Apart from that, the Government missed many other opportunities in this regard.  The battle is as much psychological as it is anything else because, as the Minister has acknowledged, the fears are not real but are rooted in ignorance and distrust, Therefore, every psychological weapon available to us must be used in our efforts towards good relations.  The Minister said that many of the fears of the Northern community spring from 50 years of brainwashing.  Therefore, it is up to us to indicate in so far as possible how ill-founded are those fears. Every opportunity must be taken, too, to acknowledge the character of the Northern Protestant tradition and the contribution which that tradition can make to the emergence of a new social attitude and of a new economic prosperity both in the North and in the South and, hopefully, in the future, between North and South.  Those things have not been said as clearly as we would like them to have been said but the Government must recognise the <Col N="950" /> great scope there is in acknowledging the aspirations to independence which is part both of the Scottish and Welsh traditions and, equally, of the Northern Ireland nationalist and Presbyterian traditions.  Let us exploit that to the good rather than wait to see it perverted.</P>
    <P>Regarding suggestions made recently by the Minister in relation to Articles 2 and 3 of our Constitution I would merely comment that during a visit to America some two years ago and prior to our planning a referendum in respect of Article 44, during two hours of private discussions with Mr. William Craig, he referred to our Constitution but only to Article 44.  During the course of his discussions with American journalists he made no reference either to Articles 2 or 3.  Since then Article 44 has gone and we have seen what effects its removal have had on the Northern Unionists.  Now, we are told that these people have some ideas in regard to Articles 2 and 3&mdash;we have stated clearly that these Articles do not represent a claim by us on the Northern people&mdash;and that we should alter the truth to accommodate the lie.  I would remind the Minister of the dangers that lie in responding to suggestions of that nature.</P>
    <P>In the course of the speech on the Motion of Confidence in the Government recently, the Minister used what I thought was a strange expression in this connection when he reminded us of our &ldquo;infinite capacity to harm&rdquo;.  Was there any reference to our capacity to do good?  The Government seem to be so concerned not to offend the British Government that they rely on inactivity and thereby ensure that our &ldquo;infinite capacity to do harm&rdquo; is not realised.</P>
    <P>I would hope that the Government would recognise that there is more to governing and to international relations than not doing something.  One would hope that some of the energy which is evident in respect of some of the other aspects of the Minister's activities in relation to foreign policy, would be directed towards what is the most pressing area of our foreign policy.</P>

    <P>
      <Col N="951" /> Debate resumed on the following motion:</P>
    <P>That Dáil Éireann calls on the Government to introduce a comprehensive scheme of free legal aid in civil and criminal matters.</P>
    <P Just="Right">&mdash;(Deputy Haughey.)</P>
    <Speaker pid="DavidAndrews" hpid="Mr. Andrews Mr. Andrews">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Andrews</NameTxt>
      <P>The main theme of the argument on the last occasion was the difficulty, apparently, the Minister has in introducing a civil legal aid scheme and also the disparity that exists in the whole area of legal aid in criminal cases.  I should like to remind the House that in the Official Report of 12th February, 1974, column 512, during the Minister's introductory speech on the Estimate for his Department he stated:</P>
      <P>I attach great importance to this law reform programme and the implementation of it will proceed with all possible speed, subject to the limitation that the expert persons needed to translate proposals into legislation are thinner on the ground than I would like and this perhaps is the first problem to be overcome.</P>
      <P>The Minister has collected on a number of committees quite a group of people who are willing to give their time on a voluntary basis, engaging themselves in the specific area of law reform with which the Minister has charged them.</P>
      <P>Despite this we await the Minister's implementation of law reform in the areas called for by many voluntary organisations, which were mentioned on the last occasion.  The Minister then went on to state, at col. 512 of the Official Report of 12th February, 1974:</P>
      <P>At this stage I would like to refer to the question of legal aid.</P>
      <P>He went on to refer to this at some considerable length.  In the final portion of that paragraph he stated:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We are probably the only member of the Common Market which does not provide legal aid in civil <Col N="952" /> matters and, indeed, our membership of the Community imposes obligations on us to introduce a measure of civil legal aid in certain areas.  This is a question to which I have given much thought and I have decided, as I announced recently, to set up an informal committee to advise me on the introduction of a system of civil legal aid. The committee will consist of representatives of both branches of the legal profession, a representative of FLAC, officers of interested Government Departments and the chairman will, I hope, be a judge.  The precise terms of reference and the membership of the committee are at present being settled but I expect to have the committee established and working very shortly.</P>
    <P>The Minister has referred on at least one occasion, according to the Official Report, to setting up a committee to advise him on legal aid in civil matters. He again announced it on the 12th February, 1974.  As I understand it&mdash; I am subject to correction&mdash;this committee have been set up by the Minister with carefully worked out terms of reference.  This is the Committee on Legal Aid and Advice on Civil Matters, which is known as the Pringle Committee.  This committee are to report as speedily as possible.  On the last occasion I suggested that the Minister might put a time limit on when the committee might finally report. We look forward to the speedy conclusion of the deliberations of this committee.</P>
    <P>On civil legal aid itself it is easy to stand up in Dáil Éireann and pose many problems without offering solutions. The experts on the Pringle Committee will undoubtedly examine the question of an income level for needy litigants requiring either advice or civil legal aid.  I suggest that there should be income limits for those people seeking civil legal aid and that those limits be tied to some aspect of our social welfare system.  For instance, the income limit for those who qualify for social welfare medical assistance might be a suitable limit for those people who would be entitled to civil legal aid.  In other words, as the Minister <Col N="953" /> admitted in his speech on the 12th February, 1974 there should be some sort of means test or means limit in the case of those people who would have access to free legal aid.  This would prevent the wealthy benefiting as against the poor litigants.</P>
    <P>This will involve a substantial increase in civil litigation, that is, litigation between citizens.  The House will agree that the Judiciary is already overburdened. In addition to increasing the number of judges at District Court and Circuit Court level the Minister might ask his committee to examine the possibility of increasing the civil jurisdiction of both the District Court and the Circuit Court.  As we know, the District Court at the moment in civil matters has a jurisdiction of not more than £250.  The Circuit Court has an upper limit of £2,000.  I suggest that even now those figures have been eroded by inflation and it is unreal in 1974 to talk about the District Court jurisdiction in civil matters not being more than £250.  The same applies to the Circuit Court at £2,000.  The Minister might increase their jurisdiction in civil matters.  I suggest the possibility &mdash;it is just a proposition and there is nothing inflexible about it&mdash;of extending the jurisdiction of the District Court to £1,000 and that of the Circuit Court to about £4,000.</P>
    <P>I make this point on the grounds that we are discussing on this occasion the whole area of the needy litigant and the need for the litigant who has not got money to have access to our courts.  I make these two propositions on the basis that court costs at District Court and Circuit Court levels are far less, by definition as well as practice, than those of the High Court and the Supreme Court.  I believe an examination of my proposition might be worthwhile.  I will not say it will be worthwhile: one does not like to sound in any way too definite about one's own ideas because they are always subject to scrutiny, discussion and conclusion. These are some of the matters I should like to mention to the Minister in the short ten minutes I have to speak on Deputy Haughey's motion.</P>
    <P>I should like to come back to a question I have on the Order Paper <Col N="954" /> and which I mentioned before.  This is:</P>
    <P>To ask the Minister for Justice the number of occasions on which the Committee on Legal Aid and Advice on Civil Matters has met.</P>
    <P>As I understand it the important words there are &ldquo;Advice on Civil Matters&rdquo;.  People will have open to them advice and, having got it, they might then discover there might be no need to engage in litigation.</P>

      <P>I welcome this motion and it is particularly appropriate that while the Pringle Committee is sitting we should convey our views to the committee through this House. I particularly welcome the establishment of the Pringle Committee whose members I regard as having very special competence and concern in this field and I have no doubt their report will be quite radical and comprehensive. I expect we shall receive it as soon as possible and the sooner the better.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have been acutely aware over the years of the need for assistance and information in the increasingly complex area of people's rights under the law.  Last February the constituency party I represent, the Labour Party in Dún Laoghaire, submitted a policy statement on citizens advice bureaux and associated matters to the Government calling for State assistance in respect of the establishment and operation of the bureaux.  We are glad to know that submission in the response of the Government has been quite fruitful.  We must also recognise the invaluable work of FLAC which has provided free legal aid and advice to many people on a voluntary basis, <Col N="955" /> people in urgent need of such help. This motion particularly pinpoints, as do the work of FLAC and the demands of Deputies regarding the operation of the 1962 Act, the duty of the Government now to provide much extended assistance in this field.  As an extension of social policy I would strongly urge that there should be a very comprehensive State supported system of legal aid and advice in civil matters.</P>
    <P>I also support this motion in the light of the experience I have gained in my attendance at my own constituency information bureaux.  We have organised these in the absence of State assistance.  I do not believe it should be a function of political parties to do this but when the State falls down on a job we must attempt to step in to provide the vital information citizens need.  Every week we have ten, 15 or 20 complaints at the five or six centres we have in operation.  These are in addition to the problems brought directly to public representatives.  I have certainly found a very large and growing number of inquiries relating to people's rights under the civil law. There are those who now suffer because of lack of representation before the courts and various public tribunals.  There are people who suffer because of the growing complexities of the income tax law and the property law and they are not in a position to receive appropriate, readily available legal aid.  As Deputy Haughey quite rightly pointed out, in the field of inter-personal relations chronic hardship can result from inadequate and inaccessible legal procedures. I do not regard Deputy Haughey as a very radical Deputy. Indeed, in relation to matters of company law, income taxation or, say, relations with Northern Ireland I would regard him as rather conservative and in some respects extremely conservative.</P>

      <P>I am coming to that.  If one takes the 1962 Act I thought there was perhaps an undue amount of retrospective self-praise on the part of the Deputy in regard to that Act and the scheme he introduced.  I am referring particularly to the scheme in operation.</P>
    </Speaker>

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>It was, but even in 1962&mdash;it may seem a bit harsh to Deputy Haughey to say so&mdash;it was modelled, as the Deputy knows, on the British Act and on British procedure then operating.  I would be the last to accuse the Deputy of aping the British but that is precisely what did happen at that time because the present grossly inadequate scheme of legal aid in criminal matters was based on the scheme which had operated in Britain but which, even in 1962, was regarded as most inadequate by common consent. This was the time when the Irish Act was passed.  One authority I can quote in that regard is Desmond Greer, then lecturer in Law at Queen's University, Belfast and in the winter 1969 edition of the <i>Irish Jurist</i> he said:</P>
      <P>... the (1962) Act is in fact modelled on earlier English statutes which were subsequently modified and then repealed.  The difficulties of interpretation and application which led to their modification appear to have been overlooked (in the 1962 Act); the causes of dissatisfaction which led to their repeal seem to have been ignored.</P>
      <P>Therefore, we have the situation that even while I commend Deputy Haughey for having convinced a very reluctant Government and the Department of Justice, that the first step should be taken, even as a first step one must, in perspective, regard it as a very tentative step at that time.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>I think we share concern in that regard.  I think the Government should introduce a scheme incorporating a number of features.  My first proposition to the Minister would be a scheme of civil legal aid and advice modelled to some extent&mdash;but only to some extent&mdash;on the 1972 Legal Advice and Assistance Act in Britain because the British scheme even now, ten years later, is regarded as having very serious and grave defects.  I am assured by those with a deep interest in the field of legal aid that there are many better alternatives in existence, either in the American or Canadian contexts and particularly in Quebec in Canada.  I should like to draw the Minister's attention in this regard to a speech made by the Lord Chancellor, Elwyn Jones at the English Law Society's national conference on October 19th in Harrogate.  He called for an extension and revision of legal services to the public.  He said that the legal rights of many people were going by default under the 1972 Act in Britain. According to a report in the <i>Sunday Times</i> on the following day he said:</P>
      <P>... a recent report from his advisory committee of legal aid showed that some people do not know of their rights, or if they do, often do not have the money or ability to enforce them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Lord Elwyn Jones went on to say that the report was &ldquo;a deeply worrying indictment&rdquo; of the current British legal aid system.  We must be very careful about absorbing the British system into any innovations we may have here; I fear Irish lawyers tend to work on that basis.  The latest British report shows that there are considerable areas of law in housing in particular, landlord and tenant matters and welfare matters where expert advice was urgently needed and very hard to come by.  The eminent Lord Chancellor Jones went on to say he was seeking ways of ensuring that the services were provided in future and that one of the best ways&mdash;which I recommend to the Minister&mdash;was by the provision of more centres.  I share with Deputy Haughey his deep concern in this <Col N="958" /> regard.  We need in Dublin a wide network of free legal aid centres, and the sooner we have them the better. We should be very careful, therefore, about adopting the purely British scheme.  I fear that, perhaps, some of the more conservative elements in the legal community&mdash;and I do not want to impinge on the work of the Pringle Committee&mdash;might be tempted in that direction.</P>
    <P>I agree with Deputy Andrews that there should be a scale of contribution, graded according to disposable income, with a special automatic eligibility provision for people in certain categories, such as medical card holders.  There should be a ceiling on the amount of service provided.  I would class Deputy Haughey as rather conservative, but if I may make a conservative socialist comment, there has to be selectivity.</P>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>Some of the best socialists go for selectivity.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. B. Desmond Mr. B. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>I think there ought to be a ceiling, although this ceiling could be exceeded on application to a central commission on legal aid and advice.  The scope of the scheme should include areas of civil law such as the right of association, contractual rights, property rights, marriage break-up, landlord and tenant, consumer protection, personal injuries and social welfare and employment payments.</P>
      <P>The service should emphasise the need for early help.  It is tragic that such help is not available.  If that early advice was available, there might be no need for the parties to proceed with damaging litigation, particularly in the field of marriage breakdowns.  Publicity and accessibility are important factors here.  In promoting accessibility, there must be close liaison between the citizens' advice bureaux and legal aid solicitors. Effective referral between the two agencies must be ensured.  There should be lists of solicitors indicating their speciality.  The legal profession is ultra-conservative.  We know the difficulties of compiling lists of solicitors, but it is necessary to have such facilities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="959" /> People who appear before social welfare bureaux, redundancy appeals tribunals and so on should be clearly and fully informed of their rights of legal representation and given the opportunity of obtaining free legal aid. I would fault, perhaps, Social Welfare or Labour in that, where somebody is entitled to free legal aid in the processing of an appeal, very frequently it is only if he reads the small print of a public service circular that he discovers that he is entitled to some assistance. That system should be improved.</P>
    <P>As in any new scheme, the scheme should incorporate a research project into the interlinking areas of poverty and the legal system.  This project should be an ongoing one, ensuring that the right kind of legal aid and advice is provided for those who most need it.  It should also work closely with the proposed Law Reform Commission.</P>
    <P>There is another suggestion which I am sure would have the support of Deputy de Valera, in view of his concern over the years that we, the bureaucrats and politicians, should not be running people's lives for them. The basic objective of any scheme of legal assistance should be for people to help themselves.  Many people are unaware of their rights or of how to obtain those rights.  A long-term solution to these deficiencies would involve a proper programme of civic education at all school levels, at all public forums.  We should urge people to have a sense of inquiry, a sense of critical examination, so that they can help themselves to obtain their legal rights.</P>
    <P>Any worthwhile scheme of legal aid must be expensive.  A comprehensive scheme which would envisage 50 lawyers and back-up staff would cost between £1,500,000 and £2 million. However, in the light of the amount of suffering and distress involved, it would be money well spent.  If we can spend £1 million a year on health, we can certainly spend £1 million or £2 million on free legal aid.  Anyone who talks in terms of spending less than this each year is not talking realistically.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="960" /> In addition, a good deal should be done within the Minister's own profession to broaden the horizons of solicitors and barristers through their professional courses into such areas as the law affecting deprived people. It is all very well to say paternalistically: &ldquo;Some poor devil requires legal aid.  We will provide it for him.&rdquo; That is political and social charity of an obnoxious kind.  Free legal aid should be available as of right to citizens, and the legal profession should accept this as a fundamental aim of social policy.</P>
    <P>I would like to see in future solicitors working more closely within their own communities.  For example, 81 per cent of solicitors in Dublin County have their offices within the Dublin city area and many of them do not operate within the communities which they wish to serve.  I have noticed that many of the young solicitors who provide free legal aid particularly in south Dublin are also deeply involved in their communities at local level and make a distinctive contribution not merely in relation to free legal aid but also on a wider basis.</P>
    <P>I urge the Minister and his colleagues in government to implement these reforms as a matter of the utmost urgency.  There is a good deal of public frustration about the prolonged delays in successive Governments' law reform programmes.  As we have a former Minister for Justice and the present Minister for Justice present, it is not unfair to say that the legislative programmes and enactments to date of successive Ministers for Justice have shown a peculiar malaise&mdash;a lack of political determination, a lack of political will.  The reality is that all the good intentions in many areas&mdash;&mdash;</P>

I have no doubt that the Minister will produce many other reforming enactments but if he were to do only that I would regard him as having had a successful term of office.  I strongly recommend the motion to him and urge him to expedite the Pringle report and ensure its implementation as quickly as possible.</P>

      <NameTxt>Major de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>I was interested in Deputy Desmond's point about my approach to this.  Yes, it is just that &mdash;a concern for what is commonly called the rights of individuals.  It is something that can be pressed too far, I freely admit.  It is a concern for the common right of self-assertion for the ordinary member of the community, the common right to be an individual man.  In this area we are dealing with one of the results of modern social development, socialism, if you like, which tends to constrain and put down the individual.  It is the type of thing that has reached the depths in certain areas of England where a local authority will dictate to somebody what colour his hall door is to be painted, where there is a complete intrusion on the rights of the individual.  Here we are dealing with a negative constraint that prevents the individual from asserting his rights.  Deputy Desmond mentioned a matter in his own constituency.  I was amused because at present I am being asked about the problem of a wall being built by or under the aegis of the Minister.  A particular individual is alleging it to be an incursion on his private rights.  Bringing it to the political area is not the correct way of doing it.  If there is a right it is a legal right.  In this case I suspect that if there is any right it is a right of light. A TD is not an expert in law unless by accident he happens to be a member of the legal profession.  It is a question of getting legal advice and then being able to take the legal advice. People are not normally in a position to do that because the initial cost of determining what one's legal rights are <Col N="962" /> is prohibitive.  Even if one were to know what one's rights are, there is still an element of chance and doubt which renders the pursuance of the case a financial gamble, a gamble which the individual may not be in a position to afford.</P>
      <P>I have mentioned a factual case. Abstracting from that, if a State Department or a big corporation erects a building and infringes my rights, in order to determine my rights I must, first of all, take into account that if it is the State there may be peculiar privileges attaching to it, perhaps, hidden legislation.  If I go to a lawyer it will cost me money to find out and then I may find that I cannot go any further.  If I am advised to proceed I am almost in a worse position because everybody knows the risk of taking action against the State, hedged in by years of legislation and tradition.  If it is a big corporation there are untold resources to battle the whole way through.  The system is so inhibiting that one must simply let one's bone go by default.  This is fundamentally the question of free legal aid in civil cases.  The individual has no way of determining his rights except a costly way.  Even when he gets the best advice possible there is still a further gamble.  When it is stated that way everyone will admit that there is a problem and, I believe in principle everyone will agree that Deputy Haughey's motion is justified and should be supported.</P>
      <P>I do not think it is enough for us to do this.  I do not think it is enough to approach it in the way Deputy Desmond did without having due regard to the realities of the moment. It is very easy to say as Deputy Desmond said: &ldquo;Set up such and such and then the State will pay for it&rdquo;.  There are two fundamental objections to that kind of approach to a problem like this and in principle, therefore, I am not too enamoured of the way Deputy Desmond presented the case.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is all right to say we should set up such and such bodies, <i>ad hoc.</i> Surely that is one of the curses of our society, one of the things that <Col N="963" /> are bringing all the complications into the picture&mdash;that in every area there are <i>ad hoc</i> bodies being set up and <i>ad hoc</i> action being taken which clogs existing machinery and very often is self-defeating.  Therefore, without going off into very wide fields, staying in the field of law, we must first of all have regard to certain facts, to a certain machinery, to a certain set-up that is working and, from the point of view of law, is working well.  If it has defects we should first of all ask what they are before we talk as Deputy Desmond did, before setting up this <i>ad hoc</i> body and that <i>ad hoc</i> body, because simplicity will mean economy in the long run and complexity will mean wasted resources.</P>
    <P>What have we to take into account here?  First of all we have got to take into account the Constitution which provides that legal rights both for groups and individuals are to be determined and resolved by the courts set up under the Constitution.  We cannot get away from that unless we are to upset the whole approach to the matter.  Under that broad direction and structure of the judicial system, there is the system of the courts, from the Supreme Court through the High Court and the Circuit Court to the District Court&mdash;a definite legal structure which has served and I believe can be made to serve all the purposes involved.</P>
    <P>In approaching this problem I submit first of all to the Minister that one must have regard to that fact. One phrase used by Deputy Desmond I may have misinterpreted, but I think he suggested ideas of <i>ad hoc</i> arbitrators. The more bodies you create, the more confusion you will create and the more waste you create.  We have a sequence of courts downwards. Perhaps towards the bottom there is some diversification, and specialisation may be needed, such as at the District Court level where there may be need for special children's courts and so on.  However, they must all be oriented to the central structure that is provided and has worked.  That is my first comment.</P>
    <P>Free legal aid, yes&mdash;assist the individual <Col N="964" /> by all means by free legal aid&mdash; but you will save money to enable us to do that and you will get efficiency and certainty in advice to the individual in the assertion of his rights if you are prepared to keep a simple straight-forward structure and to use it, avoiding the temptations to rush off, <i>ad hoc,</i> with this red herring and that red herring.  Having accepted that about the courts, the next thing to be taken as a fact is that we have a very well established legal profession with two branches.  The legal profession has served the community well.  Saving always the problem of possible reorganisation, that should be accepted and the question asked about the best way of doing it, or using that profession as one of the means by which the individual will secure his rights.</P>
    <P>In that respect, Deputy Desmond mentioned what he called paternalism and patronising charity&mdash;in other words, quite often solicitors and barristers have given their services free in certain cases and Deputy Desmond appears to think that is an insult.  It also is a service.  I have known this to have been done, but if one is to take Deputy Desmond's socialist approach to this&mdash;without in any way putting any petulant meaning on it&mdash;then a question arises to be considered in regard to the legal profession as it has arisen from the point of view of the medical profession.</P>
    <P>It is becoming increasingly clear in England that if you take a body like the medical profession and remove the professional stimulus and reduce it simply to an anonymous service, humanity will pay for it, the community will pay for it, the best is lost and you will level off a lot of things at the lowest level, not the highest.  In the same way, where law is concerned, if you want to get the best advice here, if you want this thing really to work, if you do not want to have in the legal sphere what has happened in the medical sphere in England&mdash; there, the panel system, for instance, has resulted in desperate inhumanity in many cases: doctors have been reduced to mere mechanics without choice of doctor and so on&mdash;you must be very careful if you are not to have <Col N="965" /> this happening in the legal sphere, that you do not reduce the legal practitioner to the level of that kind of hack who simply in the end regards himself as being a kind of State servant with a guaranteed income with no stimulus to rise above it.</P>
    <P>Then you may be importing into the picture a perturbation that is highly undesirable.  We must remember here there is a totally different thing.  We are suggesting a proper State service in a profession where there is a very high tradition.  The danger I see in this kind of taking over, if that were contemplated, is that it would have this effect on the service which the legal profession give to the community. It is a much abused profession sometimes, but any of us who have known it appreciate how unfair the criticisms have been in this respect and how difficult the problems of the lawyer are.</P>
    <P>Time does not permit me to expand on that.  I merely want to say that in using the organisation and the mechanism of the courts, unless you are to cause some undesirable perturbations in the whole legal picture you must accept the legal profession as it is and its method of operation and have due regard to the healthy operation of that profession in its task of activating and causing the judicial machinery to work properly.  That is my second point.</P>
    <P>The next point I would make by way of question.  Why is it that it is acute nowadays to provide legal aid for people wishing to assert their rights?  I am struck by a contrast here. In the early days of the century and at the end of the last century Irish country life was characterised by a plethora of naïve legal actions asserting rights.  The problem was litigious litigation, as it used to be called.  The Minister possibly knows of instances in his own rural area.  Now it is the reverse.  Why?  Something over 50 years ago the problem was to stop people trying to assert rights and be over-litigious.  Now the problem is the reverse.  Wherein lies the fault?  Quite apart from this over-riding socialism, if I may so describe it, the community dominating the individual in every <Col N="966" /> sphere, in the legal sphere the reason for the change is to be traced to this House perhaps, to a multiplicity of legislation, administrative legislation, <i>ad hoc</i> legislation, legislation designed to plug loopholes with Ministers coming in all too frequently to plug administrative loopholes, and all this has made it very, very difficult indeed for anybody, even a trained specialist lawyer, to know in certain cases what the law is or what the right is.  That is one of the problems with which we are coping here, whether we realise it or not.  It is not a question so much of giving money for free legal aid. I would hazard the opinion that you could give all the free legal aid you liked and at the end the plight of the individual might not be any better or he might get so many &ldquo;No can do&rdquo; answers that the whole exercise would not be worth the trouble involved. This is a very salutary thought. Perhaps the best way to free legal aid, certainly the most economic way, would be a total review and reform, from the point of view of the individual and not from the point of view of administrative convenience, of all our laws or, in other words, law reform in its broadest sense.</P>
    <P>Years ago a country man could go into his local solicitor about a rightof-way or a bit of land and get a fairly certain opinion.  The solicitor would be able to say either &ldquo;Yes&rdquo; or &ldquo;No&rdquo;.  I have known cases where a solicitor said &ldquo;No&rdquo; and the litigant went to another solicitor.  In the early days if a solicitor were not sure he took the advice of a barrister.  The barrister could sit down and be sure of the opinion he was giving.  I was once very impressed reading about Dan O'Connell; a colleague had come across an opinion of his and preserved it and it was quite direct and simple and the reaction was: &ldquo;Would it not be lovely if it were like that nowadays?&rdquo; Today, there has been such a multiplicity of legislation one has not a chance.</P>
    <P>I make the point.  It is a very important point and I would like the Minister to look at it&mdash;it is the contrary point and it is the last I will make, simply to add to the confusion.  Deputy <Col N="967" /> Haughey's Succession Bill was another multiplication of uncertainty. He will not mind me saying this here: the type of legislation that makes this particular motion necessary is the kind of legislation we had in Deputy Haughey's Succession Bill.  I just mention that.  If you like, it is jocose and I know that Deputy Haughey will take the banter as well as anybody else.</P>
    <P>I want to give the Minister a chance to get in.  I have not finished.  I have hardly been coherent.  As Deputy Esmonde said, this is a broad subject for anybody who knows anything about legal administration.  I will leave it at that.</P>
    <P>Lastly, there is the matter of costs. The costs of the Minister's Department and fees all add to the complexities as well as to the cost of the individual trying to find out what his rights are.  In all sincerity, could we not look at the lot and seek simplicity, directness, straight-forwardness?  Initially, that would be the very best approach to this problem.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMarkCooney" hpid="Minister for Justice (Mr. Cooney) Patrick M. Cooney">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice (Mr. Cooney)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am obliged to Deputy de Valera for taking less time than he was entitled to in order to give me an opportunity of getting in.  To comment on his last point first, we would all dearly love to see as simple and coherent a system, so straight-forward and easily understood, that it would actually preclude litigation and the rights of citizens <i>vis-á-vis</i> each other would never be in doubt.  Because of people and their relationships with one another and because of commercial relationships, the whole question is so inherently complicated that rules for regulating these relationships must necessarily be complicated.  The simple life, as it were, is precluded by the demands made by the twentieth century.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The motion deals with both criminal and civil legal aid.  I shall speak first on the criminal legal aid side.  Deputy Haughey was Minister for Justice when this was introduced and he deserves credit for what was then a pioneering move.  As he freely admitted, it was a tentative move.  It <Col N="968" /> did not go into the field of civil legal aid.  I think Deputy Haughey used the word &ldquo;timorous&rdquo; at one stage to describe the approach of himself and his Government, an approach which was, I think, necessarily forced on them by the need of having regard to the Exchequer.  The Exchequer is in the background for all of us when we want to introduce reforms or improvements in our society.  We can only move within the constraints of the national budget and those constraints, I have no doubt, loomed large in Deputy Haughey's field of vision when he was pioneering this move in our legal system.  Nevertheless, the move was a good one and it is wrong to denigrate or run down our present system of criminal legal aid.  I believe that both the structure and the administration of our legal aid system are quite satisfactory.  It can be criticised on the level of fee made available, and the involvement of the legal profession in it can also be criticised. Whether that is the fault of the legal profession, or whether it is the fault of the level of the fee which has been offered from the beginning, is something on which we can have an argument. There are faults on both sides.</P>
    <P>I speak as a person who practised law in a country town and who, from the time this system came into being, was glad to avail of it and considered that the fees were an improvement on the fees I had been getting for similar type of work before, which are very often nil or nominal because the type of litigant in much criminal work in the District Court is not in a position to pay fees&mdash;petty larcenies and the like.  I found this system a great boon. Unfortunately&mdash;and I have to say this against my own profession&mdash;there was a rather superior approach to it, that this was a charity law, and that if solicitors came into it at all they came into it very grudgingly.  There was not the co-operation in the scheme from the legal profession that should have been forthcoming.  That is my opinion as one who practised law up to 18 months ago.</P>
    <P>There is no doubt that, having regard to the amount of time criminal work demands from a solicitor who <Col N="969" /> might have other lucrative business which has to be foregone, the level of the fee was not attractive in the context of other business to be done.  But in the context of having an obligation to provide services for people charged with breaches of the criminal law, and in the context of the level of fees up to then pertaining, they were generous.  However, that is the only criticism I have to make of the system of legal aid in criminal cases.</P>
    <P>After the first couple of years&mdash;and I will not embarrass Deputy Haughey by guessing why in the first couple of years there was some slowness on the part of the courts in granting certificates of legal aid&mdash;it became clear that it would not break the Exchequer and I found that the courts were forthcoming, and reasonable, and sensible, in granting applications for legal aid certificates.  This is still the position.  The percentage rate of applications granted is away up in the high nineties and it is only the very odd litigant, the very odd offender, or person charged, who is refused a certificate to enable him to have legal aid in criminal cases.</P>
    <P>At the moment there is agitation by both the solicitors' and barristers' branches of the profession to have the level of the fees changed.  I am having discussions, and in some cases my Department are having discussions, with both branches of the profession to see if we can reach a figure that will satisfy them, all the time keeping an eye over our shoulder on the Exchequer, as we must.  I would be anxious that the fees would be such that neither branch of the legal profession would have any excuse for dodging what I think is a professional obligation to come into the legal aid scheme, put their names on the panel, and take their turn in providing services for offenders or alleged offenders.  This is very important.</P>
    <P>There are only two criteria for granting legal aid.  One, that it is essential in the interests of justice, having regard to a number of factors including the seriousness of the charge, or if there are exceptional circumstances. This gives the court wide discretion.  The other is that the <Col N="970" /> means of the applicant must not be such that he could provide the service for himself.  My experience is that the courts are generous in granting the certificates of legal aid.</P>
    <P>During the year we made two amendments to improve the structure. These amendments were to enable legal aid to be paid in respect of preliminary hearings in the District Court.  This was an odd gap in the system and led to some injustice.  I suppose that originally it was felt that, if a person pleaded guilty and was sentenced, that was the end of the matter and that, if there was an appeal, it would be a mere formality. There have been cases of actual hardship with regard to the sentence where there were grounds for appeal on grounds of severity and legal aid was not available and this inhibited appeals being taken.  That improvement was made during the year.</P>
    <P>We also provided a further change during the year to deal with a person who, having pleaded guilty in the lower court, was sent forward for sentence only to the higher court.  This was another gap in the system.  That person was not entitled to legal aid in the higher court.  We have closed that gap, too.  At all stages in the criminal legal process, legal aid is available for offenders.  It is my hope to increase the level of legal aid for both solicitors and barristers and it is my hope that this increased level will induce more and more professional lawyers to participate in the scheme so that it will not just be a social service provided by some lawyers with a social conscience but that the profession as a whole will discharge their professional obligation and take part in the scheme.</P>
    <P>There has never been any system of civil legal aid with the one exception mentioned by Deputy Haughey and, if I might use a phrase which Deputy de Valera does not like, it was an <i>ad hoc</i> arrangement to provide assistance in <i>habeas corpus</i> cases, which of course were usually important cases involving the liberty of an individual and probably an important constitutional point.  It was important that such cases would not be inhibited by <Col N="971" /> financial considerations.  Consequently legal aid is provided on an <i>ad hoc</i> basis by the Attorney General and the Minister for Finance to defray applicants' expenses in such cases.</P>
    <P>It might be interesting for the House to know with regard to criminal legal aid that there has been a steady increase in the number of claims or applications for it.  In 1970-71, the number was 470.  It went to 1,271 in 1973-74.  That shows there is a greater public awareness of the availability of legal aid.  I have not got a breakdown as to how many of those were in Dublin.  Applications in the Children's Court in Dublin have increased and this would probably be a contributory factor.  This is another figure which it may be of interest to hear.  Taking the same period: in 1970-71 expenditure on legal aid was £13,201 and in 1973-74 it was £34,666.  This was a considerable increase and possibly&mdash;I am subject to correction on this&mdash;there was an increase in fees in that period.</P>
    <P>Even with that the budget, the amount provided, has not been used up each year.  For example, in 1972-73, £35,000 was provided and £31,699 was spent.  To the end of March, 1974, £45,000 was provided and £34,000 odd was used.  The scheme is there and my experience is that it is being used on a pretty wide scale.  It is not an extravagant scheme.  I say this looking over my shoulder at my colleague in Finance: I think it could stand some increases in fees.</P>
    <P>I agree with the spirit of the motion with regard to civil legal aid.  Everybody who has spoken here is in favour of its introduction.  What disappointed me in the debate was the lack of attention paid to the committee which is at present examining this question with a view to making recommendations to me, and more particularly with regard to its terms of reference.  If Deputies had studied its terms of reference they would see that most of their worries about the type of schemes we would like are being met.</P>
    <P>I should like to read the terms of reference: to advise on the introduction <Col N="972" /> at an early date of a comprehensive scheme of legal aid and advice in civil matters and to recommend on the form, nature and administration of the scheme and on the legislation necessary to establish it; to consider whether, pending the introduction of a fully comprehensive scheme, it would be desirable and possible to develop, as a matter of urgency, a system of legal advice centres and legal aid in certain categories of cases which the committee considered merited immediate consideration; to estimate the cost of the scheme or schemes proposed and advise on the manner in which such scheme or schemes could be financed, including the possiblility of contributions from legally-aided persons and from persons having a legal obligation to provide for or to compensate such persons.  I am sure Deputies will agree that those terms of reference cover the points which were raised here.  In regard to the need for advice bureaux, as Deputy Desmond indicated, the Government have taken a decision to set up citizens' advice bureaux.  One very important element of advice which citizens need is legal advice. As Deputy Haughey rightly pointed out, legal advice can be more important than assistance towards litigation because it can solve the problem without the need for litigation.</P>
    <P>The committee are invited, if they think fit, to come with an interim report on the question of legal advice. The committee are invited to consider the cost of the schemes proposed because it all gets back to the question of money.  The extent of the scheme depends on what we can pay for it and the committee are invited to consider how such schemes can be financed, including the possibility of contributions from persons themselves or from persons having a legal obligation to provide or compensate such persons.  It was suggested by Deputy Andrews and Deputy Desmond, that, perhaps, the scheme should be limited to certain categories of persons, for example, medical card holders.  That has a certain attraction in it, it is a cut-off point and it makes the thing financially less dangerous but I wonder if it meets the need <Col N="973" /> which legal aid is intended to, to enable persons to sustain and maintain their rights in courts.  Middle-class people, who are normally excluded from such benefits, also have the need to maintain such rights. There is a vast difference between taking an action in the High Court and paying for one's doctor.  For this reason I feel it would be unfair to suggest to the committee that there should be a cut-off point in certain categories of socially assisted persons.</P>
    <P>I would prefer to leave it to the committee to advise on this because I have every confidence in the committee. The committee is chaired by Mr. Justice Denis Pringle and the other members are: Mr. Thomas G. Crotty, county registrar, Kilkenny; Mr. Brian Gallagher who represents FLAC&mdash;I am glad to say that FLAC are formally represented on this committee&mdash;Mr. Justice Liam Hamilton; Mr. James J. Ivers, Director-General of the Law Society; Mr. Eunan McCarron, solicitor; Mr. T. Brown, social and economic adviser to the Minister for Social Welfare; Mr. C. K. McGrath, Department of Finance; Mr. J. McMahon, Department of the Public Service and Mr. Pearse Rayel, Department of Justice.</P>
    <P>I wish to take issue with Deputy Andrews, and, to a lesser extent, Deputy Haughey, on a number of points.  I would not dream of directing a committee of that eminence and that spread of knowledge and experience to report to me within a certain time.  I will leave it entirely to their own discretion as to when they will report in the knowledge that their terms of reference permits interim reports and that their terms of reference are wide and were carefully settled.</P>
    <P>Deputy Andrews went so far as to say &ldquo;Generally they are doing it on a voluntary basis&rdquo;.  The Deputy was referring to the committee, and lest there be any doubt about it I want to say that it is not a question of &ldquo;generally&rdquo;.  This is a voluntary committee completely.  Deputy Andrews also said that the committee were some type of a refuge for party political followers.  In my view this is an <Col N="974" /> insult to the members of the committee and I reject it in its entirety. When talking about delays, this Deputy suggested that the committee should make an interim report within six months and the final report six months to 18 months afterwards.  If it is speed Deputy Andrews wants that is hardly the advice to give.</P>
    <P>Deputy Andrews mentioned FLAC and said: &ldquo;They have not received that much assistance from the Government of the day&rdquo;.  If the Deputy was speaking about our predecessors he exaggerated the case because FLAC received no assistance whatever. I am glad to say that this Government empowered me to give them a grant of £5,000 per annum and they have had that for the year ended March, 1974.  They will also have a similar grant for the year 1974, a nine-month year.</P>
    <P>I am very conscious of the importance of civil legal aid.  The House will agree, having heard the comprehensive terms of reference and the status of the personnel of that committee, that I have taken practical steps to have my concern implemented into practical suggestions.  I look forward to that committee reporting as soon as possible, without attempting to direct them as to how soon they should report.  I look forward to getting a comprehensive and sensible report and to implementing it with the good will of a Government committed to social justice.  As Deputy Haughey said, this is something every Minister should look forward to being able to do.  I look forward to being able to implement legislation which will result from this particular committee's report.</P>
    <P>I take exception to the wording of Deputy Haughey's motion.  The motion reads:</P>
    <P>That Dáil Éireann calls on the Government to introduce a comprehensive scheme of free legal aid in civil and criminal matters.</P>
    <P>It is excessively narrow in the sense that it formally excludes advice.  From what Deputy Haughey has said he intends that it would be taken in the spirit of including advice.  While I <Col N="975" /> might quibble with the form I accept the spirit behind the motion.</P>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to express my appreciation, and the appreciation of Deputies on this side of the House and those on the Government side who have spoken, to the Minister for the manner in which he has accepted this motion in principle. I apologise if the wording of the motion appeared to direct the scheme towards legal assistance in court because I intended, not alone to include advice, but to be more heavily orientated towards advice than towards assistance in regard to actions in court.</P>
      <P>I am glad to find that there is in the House a complete acknowledgment of the need for a fully developed scheme whereby legal advice and assistance are made available free of charge to any citizen in need of them.  That need is self-evident.  In my view it is essential, in an enlightened society, that every citizen should be in a position to ascertain what his legal rights are in any situation and, having ascertained them, to be able to assert them when the need to do so arises.  No citizen should be denied access to the law. Every schoolboy knows the historic classic battle that took place in ancient Rome between the plebs and the patricians about the rights of the plebs to have access to the legal system that prevailed in that ancient civilisation.</P>
      <P>If our legal system is to be too expensive or too remote from the ordinary citizen then the law, and the courts, will become a sterile institution. This would have very serious social implications for us.  If a private citizen cannot avail of the law in his everyday affairs the law will become something for which he has no respect or regard and, indeed, something towards which he could develop a positive hostility. That would be an entirely undesirable social state of affairs.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As the Minister outlined in his remarks, the principle of the State providing a legal service free&mdash;I use the word &ldquo;service&rdquo; as distinct from the word &ldquo;aid&rdquo;&mdash;is fairly established. The service is provided in criminal matters and I am glad to note that the <Col N="976" /> Minister has the situation in regard to the free legal aid in criminal affairs under review.  I hope he will be successful in having it updated and a bit more efficacious.  At present we have a free legal service provided to certain of our citizens from the Probate Office and, as the Minister has mentioned&mdash; in <i>habeas corpus</i> proceedings, the State does come to the aid of the citizen when deemed necessary and desirable.</P>
    <P>Therefore, the principle is firmly established; the need is equally clearly established.  To an ever-increasing extent today public attention is focused on the matrimonial and domestic area.  Here the case for free legal aid is quite incontrovertible.  Like myself, every Deputy has been approached from time to time by distraught husbands or wives who have serious problems in that area and who are at a complete loss to know how to cope with the situation.  Indeed, we Deputies approached in this way are very often also at a loss.  It would be a wonderful social improvement in our conditions if Deputies and the other people concerned were in a position to direct people with matrimonial, domestic and family problems to advice centres where they could get expert, authoritative opinion on their needs.  It is frustrating for public representatives not to be able to offer the type of assistance and advice needed in these cases.  Of course, that area is probably the one that evokes our deepest sympathy and one that causes the greatest amount of suffering.  It is the area where there are more wrongs crying out to be righted than any other.</P>
    <P>There are other areas also in the domestic sphere where free legal aid is urgently needed.  I mentioned in my opening remarks a few of them.  Every Deputy in this House, dealing with constituency matters, comes across countless cases where, in the ordinary, everyday life of the constituent, some form of legal advice, assistance or aid is absolutely necessary.  I would try to direct the scheme's main emphasis towards legal advice and assistance in family affairs, to the head of the family, whether it be husband or wife, who is endeavouring to cope with <Col N="977" /> family problems.  I do not mean matrimonial problems now.  I mean domestic problems&mdash;matters such as hire purchase contracts and so on.</P>
    <P>I do not know if many people today realise that the document they sign these days is not a hire purchase contract at all but is, in fact, a promisory note.  There are cases of young couples buying houses, paying deposits on houses, people renting houses or apartments, people buying goods, buying domestic appliances, being sold inferior products and not knowing what is the remedy.  There is there, if you like, a fairly wide area of minor law concerned with domestic transactions which can give rise to a great deal of distress, frustration and annoyance amongst the general public.  It is quite true that even intelligent people can be cheated in these areas and can be defrauded.  Very often all that they need, either to avoid being defrauded or to allay the sense of frustration and grievance they feel, is good, sound legal advice and not necessarily legal action or a court action at all.</P>
    <P>If we accept the principle, if we accept the need, then the only thing left that might cause us any problem is the question of the cost to the Exchequer.  I should like to make a a suggestion to the Minister in this regard.  While I have called for a comprehensive system&mdash;and I should like to see it as comprehensive as possible&mdash;if the cost appears prohibitive and if there is any question of the prohibitive cost preventing the introduction of any scheme, he might consider leaving out running down actions altogether.  My information is that, in one way or another, any person with a case in regard to a running down action will have that case taken up.  I know the purists regard it as undesirable that it should be left to the discretion of the legal profession whether or not they take up the case.  This is one very large area which might overload our scheme.  Perhaps, initially anyway, it could be left out of the ambit of a scheme even though I am pressing for a comprehensive one.</P>
    <P>On the question of cost, I have refrained from being critical because <Col N="978" /> I welcome any move towards legal reform and for that reason I refrained from being critical of the recent announcement by the Attorney General of the establishment of a Commission on Law Reform.  If we are dealing with scarce Exchequer resources, I would be very loathe to spend any resources on such a commission. I gather from the announcement made and from the indications given of the sort of commission it is going to be it will be expensive.  I would much prefer that that money be used in the pursuance of legal aid, assistance and advice.</P>
    <P>Also, I must confess to have been disquieted at the fact that it was the Attorney General who made this announcement and that this commission is going to be established under the jurisdiction and aegis of the Attorney General.  To my mind, law reform belongs to the Minister for Justice.  The Minister for Justice has the machinery.  He has a section in his Department and all that it is necessary is to give that section more staff and let them get on with the job. There is a great deal of law reform that could be brought into operation immediately if the Department of Justice were given the incentive and the staff to do the job.  I am looking quite doubtfully at the establishment of this Commission on Law Reform under the Attorney General, particularly if it is going to be very costly as I suspect it will be.  I would much prefer to see these resources put towards the introduction of a free legal aid scheme.</P>
    <P>I welcome the fact that the Government accept the motion in principle. That is a considerable step forward. Perhaps, in a friendly way, I should warn the Minister about his reputation in this regard.  In many areas the Minister has established the fact that he has good will towards a number of desirable reforms but I should like to point out to the Minister that faith without good works is dead.  Many of the groups and individuals who came to the Minister and found him receptive to their pleadings are beginning to feel somewhat at a loss.</P>

      <P>I do not want at all to be acrimonious about it.  I am merely making the general point that the Minister has accepted the case put to him by a number of groups for reform.  My concern and theirs is that, while we accept the Minister's goodwill, we are not getting positive action.  I should be very glad to pay a tribute to the Minister, when he leaves office&mdash;as I am certain he will in the not too distant future&mdash;for having brought in a comprehensive scheme of legal aid and assistance.  I recognise that it must be a well thought out scheme.  It must be well structured and have in-built safeguards.  We do not want to have individuals taking capricious, long drawn-out legal actions in the courts at the expense of the taxpayers.  The House would certainly accept that the Minister must have time to devise a scheme that would have these safeguards built into it but the Public Service has sufficient experience and the capacity to give us such a scheme quickly.</P>
      <P>The Minister may consider that etiquette prevents him from doing so but there is no harm for this House to say to the Pringle Committee through the Minister that we want to see action fairly soon and we want them to get on with the job.  The case is well established, the need is there and the principle is accepted.  All that is needed is a scheme.  Most of us here who are interested in the subject think we must tell the committee to get on with the job, to give us a report and have the scheme introduced quickly.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>I had been outlining various areas of Government <Col N="980" /> inactivity, in which it was all too painfully obvious that the Government showed a lack of urgency or confidence in their attitude towards Northern Ireland.  I also indicated, in view of this lack of public concern and the lack of firm initiative from the British Government, that it was not surprising one found the degree of intransigence in the Loyalist community and in the Loyalist political grouping so evident in recent times. They have felt quite free to defy any suggestion that anything other than their will should be done in Northern Ireland.  Nevertheless we have the statement of intent from the British Government that they will require power-sharing in any new administrative arrangements for Northern Ireland and, equally that there should be some recognition of an Irish dimension.  Once again it seems the Loyalist community, through their political representatives, have indicated they will not accept these conditions.</P>
      <P>If the Convention gives rise to the expected Loyalist majority and if the British Government persist in their attitude, as they should do, we may have a confrontation and an impasse between the majority in that Convention and the British Government.  The alternatives for the administration in Northern Ireland, through a Convention or direct rule, have been discussed from time to time.  Another alternative has been the suggestion of an independent Ulster, although it has not been discussed to any degree in this House.  One thing is clear in that connection, namely, the British Government have made it clear they will not financially support an independent Ulster; in fact, such an independent Ulster would rid them of their responsibility and if it were to happen they would not have any further obligation towards the Northern Ireland community.  It is obvious such a declaration would have drastic economic consequences for Northern Ireland.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On the other hand, there is an alternative that has not as yet been promoted or discussed to any considerable extent.  I am sure our hardheaded colleagues and fellow-Irish-December <Col N="981" /> men in Northern Ireland would be greatly influenced by the fact that their financial position and future could be better promoted in another way.  Incidentally, the quality of hardheadedness is one that would greatly contribute to the national ethos.  I am referring to a possibility of a commitment from the British Government, in conjuction with our Government, that there would be a phased financial contribution towards the administration of Northern Ireland, taking into account the Irish dimension.</P>
    <P>At this point the British public wish to be out of Northern Ireland.  They realise that it has been costing them a considerable amount of money for quite a time.  If the money that has been applied so uselessly for such a long period, particularly in recent times, could be applied more positively, the opportunity to exploit that possibility at least should be considered and promoted.</P>
    <P>Apart from the British Government indicating they would accept the decision of the majority of the Northern Ireland people, they should actively support moves towards cooperation in this country by way of institutions which could effect that co-operation.  Here I take issue with statements made by the Minister when he was in these benches and when he expressed support for a Northern Ireland poll.  We have always held the view that such a poll far from helping the situation would serve to perpetuate the divisions and experience has proved that to be correct.</P>
    <P>There is one effective and positive way to actively support moves towards co-operation, namely, for the British Government to indicate what they would be prepared to do prior to their eventual withdrawal from the Northern Ireland involvement.  If they were to say that over a certain period, say ten or 15 years, they would contribute during these years at least as much as they had contributed in the last years &mdash;moneys which have been to a considerable extent wasted and which have shown little result&mdash;we in our turn as a sovereign Government would equally commit ourselves to <Col N="982" /> contribute our share, although in the first instance this would have to be small in comparison with the contribution from the British Exchequer. Then we could start moving together in a real sense to the benefit of the community in the North of Ireland and also to the benefit of the community of all Ireland.  There is the possibility of channelling funds from the EEC through the institution that would be established towards effecting co-operation between both parts of the country and this would offer great potential for economic and social development.</P>
    <P>The reality of the situation is that the British public and their public representatives want to get out of Northern Ireland as soon as they can. We should take account of this fact and we should ensure our inspirations, wishes and intentions for the whole of Ireland will not be infuriated by any attempt by Britain to withdraw without fulfilling her obligation.  She has a real financial obligation arising from the dependence that was foisted on the North of Ireland for a considerable time when Britain was fulfilling an imperial world role.</P>
    <P>At the time of the Sunningdale Agreement I mentioned here that there were two or three references in the communiqué to Britain's financial interest in Northern Ireland but I questioned why there was no reference to Britain's financial obligation to Northern Ireland.  It is time we began to remind Britain of that financial obligation, an obligation which, if this suggestion were to be followed, could be discharged by her to her own advantage in meeting the wishes of her people who, clearly, are showing signs of fatigue in so far as Northern Ireland is concerned.</P>
    <P>Whether for political or other reasons it will not be too long until that very widely held view of the British public will reflect itself in a very active response on the part of British politicians.  We should take account of that and should ensure that it can achieve benefits for the whole community here.  Also, it would be a very positive move towards fulfilling our aspirations of reunification by means of peace and consent.</P>

      <P>On a point of clarification, is the Deputy referring to a phased withdrawal of British troops, to a phasing out of the British contribution or to some phasing out of British sovereignty?  He has not made clear to me what he has in mind.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>In the first instance I am referring to a statement of support from Britain.  We have requested previously that they would support any moves towards co-operation in this island, effected through 32-county institutions; secondly, that they would follow that by a statement of their intention to give effect to that support by way of financial contributions to such an institution and during a stated period, to whatever power-sharing administration one would have in Northern Ireland.  I am suggesting that we, too, would have obligations in that connection and that when there would be signs of economic and social development the services of the British Army could be withdrawn gradually.  As the Minister conceded, the presence in the North of the British Army has for some time been a source of irritation and is not achieving any results in so far as the quest for peace is concerned.</P>
      <P>What I am suggesting are heads for discussion.  Obviously there is no instant panacea to solve the problem. As the financial commitment would be implemented, the military involvement could be lessened so that at the end of the day there could be military withdrawal corresponding with the final stage of the financial commitment. However this is a matter that would warrant much discussion before any conclusion could be reached in regard to it.  Obviously this is an area the Minister has not considered so far, but I hope there will be consideration of it.  Of course it is not a question that one could argue to a conclusion in a debate of this nature.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In any such institution there would have to be a balance of representation in favour of the Northern Ireland majority.  We have recognised always that they have fears, ill-founded though those fears may be.  If they are required to engage in power-sharing <Col N="984" /> they would expect us to support the same principle in relation to any institution that they would share with us.  So far as this side of the House is concerned we would favour a disproportionate balance in favour of the Northern Ireland majority.  We said this, too, in relation to the once proposed Council of Ireland.</P>
    <P>The years of separation and distrust have caused suffering to a great extent in the North and to a lesser extent here; but we should be able now to work together towards harmony and for our mutual benefit.  The Northern majority may not be able to get a financial commitment from the British Government, but we could negotiate very effectively with the British Government in some such arrangement as I have indicated.</P>
    <P>If there is a characteristic of the Protestant ethic in the North of Ireland or elsewhere in Europe it has been that, down through the centuries, it has been noted for its independence, for its tolerance and for a determined commitment to the liberty of the individual.  However to a certain extent that ethic has been subverted in the North and used to ill-effect by those people's unreal dependence on another power, a dependence which for a considerable time they have considered necessary but which they must come to realise is anything but necessary. It is a dependance which both the British public and the politicians wish to see ended as soon as possible.</P>
    <P>Another aspect of our relations with the British Government arises in connection with the recent blockade of our cattle at Holyhead.  In this regard there are two points I wish to make. First, it is recognised that this is contrary to the Anglo-Irish Free Trade Area Agreement and, secondly, that it is contrary to our rights as members of the EEC and also to the obligations which the British Government accepted when they acceded to the EEC.</P>
    <P>Today the Government said that they did not wish to exacerbate relations between our two sovereign Governments. However this same Government, through some of their Ministers, have indicated that if the British Government <Col N="985" /> do not act to the satisfaction of our Government in this connection, we might be obliged to consider reprisals in the nature of a blocade of trade between Britain and this country. I do not know whether a statement of that kind is intended to promote understanding between the two Governments but in the first instance it must be said that the British Government have at least condemned formally what is being done by way of a blockade of our cattle exports to their country but I would remind our Government and, through them, the British Government, that the agreements which we entered into with them&mdash;the Anglo-Irish Free Trade Area Agreement or any other agreement arising from our mutual membership of the EEC&mdash;are only effective and can only be respected when it is clear that the Governments that are party to them ensure that the rights of the citizens of the respective countries are protected.  The British Government have not so ensured on this occasion.  It is small consolation to our farmers and to our people generally to know that the British Government have condemned what is being done.  It would be our wish that, either by way of reference to an intervention system&mdash;which, incidentally, they rejected&mdash;or by applying payments by way of headage grants, they would ensure that their citizens do not interfere with our rights under treaties which were entered into freely between them and us.</P>

      <P>The British farmers have said that they have no grudge against our farmers but it is for the British Government to fulfil their obligations either in the way I have suggested or, if necessary, by taking adequate security measures in the short term to ensure the free passage of our cattle to the British market. Otherwise, they will have failed to discharge their obligations <i>vis-à-vis</i> binding international treaties.  Words of pious condemnation are not in themselves sufficient to discharge that obligation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Labour Government in Britain, <Col N="986" /> putting it at its bluntest, may for reasons best known to themselves, not wish to introduce either of the alternatives I mentioned but that is their problem.  If for one reason or another they found that would alienate more of their support in the consumer level of society then they would gain from the farming community, that again is their problem.  They are not entitled to consider the short-term political advantage of their own party to the detriment of their obligations in international treaties and to the detriment of the parties who entered into those obligations with them.</P>
    <P>I should like to refer to another aspect of Anglo-Irish relations, which might be anticipated from me, the claim by the British Government, as expressed through their order in Council on 7th September claiming exploration rights over 52,000 square miles of the North Atlantic sea.  The Minister may in the heel of the hunt get the point I am making.  I think he will accept that that claim, and the statement which issued from the Government Information Service seemed to accept this principle, did, indeed, exacerbate the relations between our two Governments.  Nonetheless, we are mature enough and strong enough to a certain extent to take it on the chin.  The British Government seem to go on the expectation that, while it might exacerbate the relations which our Government are apparently so concerned not to do, nonetheless it would not mean a breakdown in diplomatic relations.  Of course, in this they are quite right.</P>
    <P>I should like to point to the fact that while that is so, as I mentioned long ago&mdash;&ldquo;long&rdquo; in terms of the life of this Parliament&mdash;at the time when it was first looked on almost as a joke by some of those who heard the proceedings in this House, they are now moving on the second leg of their claim, which is all too predictable at this stage.  They have, in the first instance, claimed the right of ownership over the Rockall.  Although our Government do not accept this, they can and have claimed the right to the territorial waters, if such exist. I know our Government do not <Col N="987" /> accept that there are territorial waters surrounding a rock, and I agree with this, but nonetheless the British Government have presented their claim on that basis for the moment.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>They have not yielded their right to that at this stage. If there is not a right to territorial waters&mdash;I agree this would not apply in this case&mdash;and if such were determined by reference to any international arbitration, now they have, in fact, come on the second leg, the alternative, and they say: &ldquo;We are now under the Geneva Convention of 1958, which is an international agreement by reference to which certain areas of the shelf were given to the British Government for exploration purposes and the superjacent waters. We are now relying on that agreement to claim exploration rights over 52,000 square miles of the North Atlantic, a considerable area of which would include the Rockall bank.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>The significant thing is that at the time of the Geneva Convention of 1958 the superjacent waters, as they were then understood, were much less capable of exploration, were much more limited naturally in 1958 than they are now by reason of the great technological advances that have been made in the meantime.  If superjacent waters capable of exploration would in fact be fairly strictly limiting the right of any country to the Geneva Convention in 1958, they would not, in fact, be so strictly limiting their rights in 1974.  Hence, the British Government have made an order in Council claiming 52,000 square miles under the extension of the shelf and the superjacent waters simply because they would claim they have the technology and means to explore that 52,000 square miles.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The end of this could be ridiculous, that only the major powers, those with <Col N="988" /> the major resources, could keep jumping to the point where the superjacent waters would, in fact, meet the superjacent waters of the shelf on the other side of the Atlantic.  That, in fact, ludicrous though it might seem, is the alternative basis of Britain's claim.  I know what might not have been envisaged in 1958 obviously cannot be used by them to this extent.  I merely press the Government very strongly to ensure that this is contested at all levels.  The Minister takes issue with me on this but I still think that formally we should state our claim to the Rockall.  This would indicate that our claim is at least as valid and as right, in terms of history, tradition and geographical proximity, as the claim made by Britain.  Otherwise, one asks what right or purpose did Britain have in making the claim in the first instance.  I know the Minister does not think that that is necessary. It is a matter of how we can best protect the interest of the country.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Industry and Commerce in reply to a question which I put to him last term, which was referred to him, as a result of a question which I put to the Minister for Foreign Affairs, asking him if we had, in fact, conducted any survey of the mineral resources in and around that shelf or had commissioned on our behalf any survey of the mineral resources in and around that shelf, replied, unfortunately, on a day when I was absent from the House, in a very flat negative.  This very Minister today made a great brouhaha about proposing the establishment of an oil company to share in the development of our oil resources off the coast but we have not even undertaken the most basic survey of what resources there may be in this bank about which we are having a dispute with the British Government.  It is beyond comprehension but at this moment that is the position.  We could be engaging in negotiations and diplomatic discussions of one form or another without knowing the full extent of what we are negotiating about.  That is something which needs to be mended as quickly as possible.  I hope the Government will, if not directly, through <Col N="989" /> somebody commissioned on their behalf, do a survey of the resources in that area so that we will at least be as well informed as any other country.</P>
    <P>Now, turning to the European Economic Community, we find ourselves, as the Minister said, in a position rather similar, as far as the regional policy is concerned, to last year.  We believe we are in the run-in to the establishment of a regional policy.  I agree entirely with the Minister that the suggestion for the diminished fund is totally inadequate (a) to give effect to the commitment of the European Community and the high-sounding principles of the Paris summit and otherwise and, (b) totally inadequate as well to the needs of the less-developed regions of the Community, including this country.</P>
    <P>The Minister has expressed strong dissatisfaction with that amount and I agree with him but it seems in the end that political muscle will win, as it did on the last occasion.  If that is to be so, there are two changes of strategy which I would commend to him.  The House will recall on the last occasion after the publication of the guidelines from the European Commission, which were totally acceptable and consistent with the principles of a real regional fund, it became evident that some of the powerful member states had different views.  The House and the country will recall that the Minister undertook urgent trips to the capitals of the European Community. He said in his speech today that we should acknowledge that others will not adopt a position just because Ireland holds a strong view. I know he went with hope and determination to Bonn, Paris and elsewhere to, in a very short trip, change the views of the Ministers concerned. We, as a tactic, criticised the Minister's initiative at that time.  We did not win much support for this view. Although the Minister did a whirlwind tour with quite a lot of publicity and promotion, he came back with nothing in the bag.</P>
    <P>We suggest the Minister would have done better to concentrate on the EEC Commission which was being <Col N="990" /> suborned by the very men the Minister was visiting.  If the Minister thought that a quick visit from the Irish Minister for Foreign Affairs would change their policy and attitudes he was, even by his own standards now, greatly mistaken and events have proved that he was.  Had he concentrated on the Commission to the point of saying to them: &ldquo;If you are to be consistent with yourselves and the Community and with the principles you have established, you will not allow yourselves to be suborned by the national interests or muscle of the stronger powers, he would have done a better job.  It is significant that the Commission now acknowledge that they did themselves a great disservice, that they undermined their own credibility and authority by allowing themselves to produce subsequently at the will and whim of the major European powers, proposals for a regional fund which were totally inconsistent with their own guidelines.</P>
    <P>The time has come again and I suggest to the Minister that his travels previously did not bring him to the right countries and that he should travel towards the Commission and give them a clear indication of what our determination is, that at least they should be consistent with their own principles.  Obviously, there will be discussion with foreign Ministers of other countries but let it be recognised that if they wish at Council level to depart from their obligations under the Community, they should be seen to depart from them.  At least, let the Commission adhere to their obligations and principles and let us support the Commission in so doing.</P>
    <P>If the Minister&mdash;as I am sure he has, very consistently and to a considerable extent&mdash;considers the balance of need in the Community and the whole purpose of the regional fund, I am sure he will agree that if there is to be a diminished fund it should be applied to very much more limited areas than those originally suggested in the previous proposal from the Commission.  I was pleased to hear in the discussion with Commissioner Thomson&mdash;I believe he reiterated this <Col N="991" /> here in Ireland&mdash;that they had torn up the map on which the regional fund was to be allocated previously. If we must have a diminished fund, as now seems indicated, let it be concentrated entirely and only&mdash;I say this advisely&mdash;on the areas of greatest need.  That would mean southern Italy and this country with, possibly, some part of Scotland or Wales and some other areas.  Then we would find that instead of £30 million in three years&mdash; which one journalist pointed out today would possibly build 14 or 15 miles of roadway in the west of Ireland and that would be the extent of the regional fund evident in this country &mdash;we would find that we could become entitled to considerably more.</P>
    <P>I believe the German Government are coming round to that view and that there is room for persuasion there.  If the Minister must visit his counterparts&mdash;I hope he does subject to concentrating on the Commission &mdash;I hope, if there is to be a diminished fund it will concentrate on very limited areas such as those I have indicated would qualify.  They are so obvious that there is hardly need for examination.  The visit by Commissioner Thomson here recently raised expectations and prior to that visit we indicated it would have that effect. Our expectations were disappointed before and these were expectations being promoted at the time of our entry to the EEC.  If there is not now a real commitment and a real sign of commitment to a regional fund and if our expectations were to be again disappointed our people's attitude to the EEC would suffer a very severe blow and the EEC itself would suffer greatly in consequence.</P>
    <P>Also, there is the fact that you can have a regional element in the other Community funds, in the common agricultural policy, the social fund and many others.  Perhaps we shall have more time to develop this during a debate on the report on the European Community and go into further details.  The regional element can be applied to many other funds.  Last year I was greatly disappointed to find that the only assistance we had sought <Col N="992" /> from the funds of the European Coal and Steel Community was towards the erection of a limited number of houses in one area to back up what was made available by the local authority.  I have no time now to go into details of other entitlements we would have.  The Minister for Local Government who got a very small sum out of those funds apparently got exactly what he sought but no other Department applied for, or received any assistance from those funds. Briefly, the types of assistance available from these funds includes assistance towards the development of ports which are connected with coal or steel importation or exportation, of infrastructures, roads and so on, telephone communication and so on. These, and many other things were available from the Community funds. We confined ourselves to one application in respect of one scheme of housing.  This is a measure of the Government's failure to pursue what is a real opportunity.</P>
    <P>Let me say that I think I was deprived of three or four minutes and, perhaps, the Minister would concede that in the course of discussion earlier when I gave way to him I lost a few minutes.  Perhaps I could continue until 8.15?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>We also have noted the lack of political will in the European Community, a lack expressed through their failure to bring a regional fund into effect and other examples.  We have stated that you must express this political will through political institutions.  We are concerned that the Council as it operates through various Ministers attending at various times seems to have become more a negotiating table than a Council of the Community in the real sense.  I am sure the Minister's hard experience has borne that fact home to him.  For that reason our party, in association with our friends in the European Parliament, the European Progressive Democrats proposed <Col N="993" /> a political secretariat, in the first instance under the Council.</P>
      <P>We also suggested something which may be in agreement with the Minister's own attitude, that each member country should have a Minister responsible for European affairs or some such office because at present, you cannot have the liaison that is desirable between the various Ministers of Agriculture, Finance, Industry and Commerce, Health and Social Welfare &mdash;except that, perhaps, the Minister for Foreign Affairs had endeavoured to provide it and he has many other obligations even in this small country. It seems vitally necessary that you would have a Minister in each member state who would be a Minister for Europe in the real sense and who would take in his own Government's and in the Council of the European Community, the European view.  That may commend itself to our Government although I know they cannot be the final judge in the matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I was glad&mdash;to a point&mdash;to hear the Minister say that it might be in our interest to stay in the Community even if Britain withdrew from it.  On this side of the House we clearly stated our position a considerable time ago that whether Britain stayed in or not we, as a matter of principle and economic advantage and as a matter of political obligation, would stay in the EEC.  From reaction we got in the European Community and from the Commission that statement of our intent was welcome.  I do not suggest it had a very significant effect on Britain but certainly it did not have any deterimental effect on us and it is fairly evident that Britain's &ldquo;renegotiation&rdquo;&mdash;and I agree with the Minister on this&mdash;will result eventually in Britain remaining a member of the EEC.  We stated our position. If she should have a change of mind let her have it in the light of what our position is.  No country can expect to change the rules of the game after entering on to the field of play, and we would not welcome any capitulation on the part of the Community. Obviously the development of the Community has been stultified because of their doubt in the face of the so-called <Col N="994" /> British re-negotiation.  We have stressed that the Community should press ahead with their programme and not allow themselves to be compromised by any doubt which would arise because of Britain's position.</P>
    <P>The Minister has mentioned the obligations he will have as President of the Council of Ministers. In this connection, there should be a rationalisation, in the interests of the small country, of the work being done by the various national organisations to which we belong.  The Council of Europe are concerned with the environment. The European Community are concerned with the environment. Even NATO, to which we do not belong, is concerned with the environment. Small countries such as ours cannot be expected to supply staff and resources to each of these organisations doing the same thing.  Now that this has been highlighted by the Minister's obligations as President of the Council, I hope steps will be taken to rationalise the situation.</P>
    <P>I shall skip some matters to which I shall, perhaps, be able to refer in the debate upon the report itself, but it is appropriate that I should mention the International Food Conference which is meeting in Rome.  I am sorry I do not have time to develop the argument and to show my support for what the Minister is doing in this connection. Let me say, however, that anything that can be done towards discharging our obligations in the relief of world hunger and poverty, which exists on a scale we cannot even imagine, will have our full support.  We are pleased to support as well any programmes towards the development and maintenance of human rights.</P>
    <P>Finally, it is noteworthy that a former Minister for External Affairs in this House has been nominated for the Nobel Peace Prize.  This is a great honour for our country, and on behalf of the Fianna Fáil Party I would like to convey to him publicly our appreciation of what he has done and our best wishes for future achievements by him.</P>
    <P>I hope the Minister will be able to take note of some of the suggestions I have made and that I shall have an <Col N="995" /> opportunity in the debate on the report itself to make further suggestions. A Leas-Cheann Comhairle, it is about as much as I deserve, because I was one of the members of the committee which suggested that speeches on the Estimates should be limited, that I now find myself guillotined by that suggestion.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MauriceEDockrell" hpid="Mr. M.E. Dockrell Mr. M.E. Dockrell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M.E. Dockrell</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to start off this very complicated debate by congratulating the Minister on his very interesting and thorough survey of Foreign Affairs.  As always, I stand in admiration at his mental processes and, as I said to him before, that does not always mean that I entirely agree with his conclusions.  However, I do like the way he arrived at them, and on 90 per cent of them I am in complete agreement with him.  Lest the Opposition should, not for the first time, endeavour to gain some meagre comfort from the fact that there was not apparently unanimity of opinions on various subjects on this side of the House, I would say that, far from that being our weakness, it is our strength, and that this party, above all when it is in Coalition, is one which allows the voices of various people to be heard. I am making that slight point at the beginning, but it is entirely overwhelmed by the grasp of the subject and the devotion to duty which the Minister has shown since he came into office and, indeed, before that too.</P>
      <P>Deputy O'Kennedy has spoken at some length on the Minister's speech, and he had some hours in which to study the documents.  In the course of his speech the Minister said in regard to the discussions with the United Kingdom:</P>
      <P>Throughout these discussions the Government have consistently adopted a constructive approach and have sought to avoid anything which could exacerbate the relations between the two sovereign powers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The spokesman for the Opposition seized on that word &ldquo;exacerbate&rdquo; almost as if it were a four-letter word and something which should not be <Col N="996" /> used under any circumstances between two high contracting powers.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">

      <NameTxt>Mr. M.E. Dockrell</NameTxt>
      <P>It is nonsense, and it is the Deputy's view of what the Government have been doing. One can always take the slick, easy view, that unless one's own side screams in public and with a very shrill voice, they have let down the side; that if they do not exacerbate&mdash;I can hardly mention that terrible word&mdash;the relations between them&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister will not mention it again.</P>

      <P>&mdash;&mdash;or if they do not leave the conference table like two teams in a rural area who have not only come to blows but who have stung the referee during the course of the match they have not done their duty.  That is the way the Opposition approach the conference, and indeed have invariably approached any conference to which the Government have been, that they must come back with a cornucopia of plenty, leaving stunned and enraged people behind them.  Of course that is not the way international affairs are conducted and Deputy O'Kennedy, who is now retiring from the field, knows that very well.  He is a reasonable person until he rises to attack the Government.  He starts off in the good old way of blaming them as much as he can for not having come away waving the green flag and singing hymns of hate.  That certainly did not exist in the last Government. The former Taoiseach, Deputy Jack Lynch, did not go into such conferences in that fashion and still less did he leave them in that fashion.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I believe the British Government stand as aghast before the appalling and terrible situation in the North as we do.  Whether all their actions will turn out to be as wise as they think them is certainly a matter for discussion but we know they do not go into it to exacerbate the situation. Far from it.  Nobody has been able to find a solution yet to that delicate situation. <Col N="997" /> I wish sometimes that in searching desperately for a solution the people who criticise our own Government and the British Government would apply the same strong criticism to the men of violence.  I wish we could have a situation in the North, even for a few weeks, in which, if the lion did not lie down with the lamb, at least the lion would stop pouncing and growling.  The difficulty is there are several lions roaming around in that jungle of terrible creatures.</P>
    <P>Deputy O'Kennedy referred to the Reverend Parker who is to go to Canada, having suffered grievous and tragic family loss.  There are many other people in the North who have suffered and are suffering tragedies. Our hearts go out to those people but we have failed to do anything to help the overall situation.  The only way in which ordinary individuals can help is by creating a climate of disgust, abhorrance and hatred of people taking the law into their own hands and taking other individuals' lives away from them wantonly and blindly.  By blindly I mean with bombs which may strike at anybody.  Only the solid opinion of the people of the North and of the South can bring that about.  Somehow all our efforts have failed in that and our Churches efforts have failed. I am not blaming them but somehow they have failed to put before the people the real brotherhood of man and what it means, what it means in power-sharing and power-giving-up, ecumenism and helping one's neighbour. Some of our Ministers have tried hard to put that point of view but somehow the people of the North still must continue on their weary, tragic Calvary.</P>
    <P>I wish the Minister and the Government well.  We need a man like the late Gandhi, though God knows when he was alive I did not think all that much of him but now that he is dead and gone I think that if we could have a man with his ideas on nonviolence, with the character of a Father Mathew and the strength of a great Calvinist preacher, it might help to lead the North out of the <i>impasse</i> in which it is.  It lies mainly with the people and however much the Opposition <Col N="998" /> may chip at the Government for saying this or not saying that the answer lies with the people of the North in the first place and of the whole of Ireland in the second.  We can pray that some day we will see that and then everything will fall into its place.</P>
    <P>Mention was made of what we in the South have lost through years of frustration, through years of Partition. It has hindered our two communities. It has driven us into ourselves in an introspective way which is not natural to Irish people.  We are an outgoing, open people; we show our joys and our sorrows, and yet we have this one subject inhibiting us.  We do not approach it with the open mind that we have in regard to many other subjects in our body politic.</P>
    <P>Somehow the Nationalists and Unionists in the North or, if you like, the Catholics and the Protestants, owing to their intense respective love of their own religions, have been impelled by their respective branches of the Christian faith to forget the overall message of Christianity.  They have forgotten that, as if they had never heard the message.  That comes back to their communities in a way we do not like to face.  We do not like to face what the outside world must be feeling, what they do not normally express in newspapers&mdash;one some times comes across it in books.  But it makes their protestations of Christianity a savage joke.  Perhaps Parliament is not the place to talk about that but it is the side of it that is rarely mentioned and hardly ever mentioned here.  It lies very close to the heart of the problem.  I may come back to the North from a different angle later.</P>
    <P>I congratulate the Minister on his fine presentation of the Estimate and on the work he has done.  We must speak here of the EEC and its regional policy.  I am a member of the Joint Committee on Secondary Legislation of the EEC.  With others, I have been in Belgium and Luxembourg.  I have met the Regional Commissioner who has been to the west of Ireland.  Before I discuss the EEC regional policy, I should like to recall that when the joint committee went to Brussels and <Col N="999" /> Luxembourg we learned something of great value and of great importance to us.  We saw the offices where the work of this great bureauracy is carried out.  They travel around like the court of Louis XIV.  Luxembourg, Belgium and France all would like to have the honour and, I daresay, the profit of housing this vast body of European civil servants.</P>
    <P>We met many of the commissioners, including, Monsieur Lardinois, who visited the west of Ireland.  I met him and had an interesting talk with him in Westport.  He saw that part of Ireland, its beauty and its remoteness. It was very good that he was able to see the problems there.</P>
    <P>Our visit to Luxembourg and Brussels, as I have said, had an immediate effect on us.  It helped to educate us on the new responsibility which not only have we got to the EEC but which they have to us.  I should like to see such visits extended to all Members of this House so that they would be able to see and appreciate the work being done there.  I would go further and express the hope that people outside the House, such as members of farmers' organisations, chambers of commerce and so forth, would be able to do likewise.  I realise it would cost some money, not a terrible lot, but it would spread valuable knowledge throughout the length and breadth of Ireland.</P>
    <P>In regard to our EEC membership, I should like to say to the Opposition that we should not be screaming and begging and howling.  We are not a group of itinerants with our hands out.  This howling at the Minister and howling at the Government that only £30 million were got and we expected more comes somewhat ill.  We would like more, but we did not go into the EEC&mdash;at least, I certainly did not&mdash; just for EEC hand-outs, glad as I am to get them and important as they are to us.  This is a beginning and all this howling comes ill from a party which by and large were in power for over 30 years and who did nothing.  Now they have suddenly woken up to what needs to be done in the west of Ireland. <Col N="1000" /> Why the devil did they not do something themselves?  God helps those who help themselves.  There was a book written in Victorian times&mdash; I never read it&mdash;called &ldquo;Self-Help&rdquo; and I am sure there was a great deal of truth in it.  It is on self-help I would like to see the emphasis laid and then, by all means, get more if it can be got.</P>
    <P>Coming back to the matter of negotiations&mdash;this is what this debate is all about; it is about our relationship with other countries, individually and as exemplified by the EEC&mdash;there has been this trouble in Wales with the Welsh farmers.  I believe it will be settled.  What will help will be a firm attitude on our side and a firm attitude on the part of the British Government. I certainly cannot see a Labour Government in Britain so sympathetic to farmers, even to Welsh farmers, that they would stand for the relationship between this country and Britain being adversely affected by the actions of farmers in riotous assembly, great as their need may have been.  I understand that the balance of votes for the Labour party in Britain comes from the cities where cheap food is of importance. Neither could I see a Conservative Government, if the Conservatives were in power, tolerating this sort of thing, even though it might be taken that the majority of those engaged in these activities would be supporters of that political persuasion. I do not think we can teach the British very much about how to handle their own farmers, especially when those farmers are stopping food passing through England to other countries. If we keep our heads and leave the matter to the two Governments who are well able to settle it and if we do nothing to exacerbate it, that will be the best contribution we can make to the situation.</P>
    <P>I have always been afraid that some day somehow in the course of our relationship with Britain the historical pendulum might swing back.  Remember, pendulums do not always swing on the same plane.  But, where Britain is concerned, we have been in a period of dealing with British <Col N="1001" /> Governments who are certainly for settlement.  If, however, a period came in which, through the ravages of war perhaps, perhaps through the loss of empire, the viewpoint might grow up in which there was a very great hardening of attitude towards this country, relationships might become very difficult.  I wonder was there any small element of that in the actions of the Welsh farmers in the last couple of weeks.  I hope not.  But this is something we should think about.  This is the first time I have expressed this view here, but it has often been present to my mind.  I refer to the fear of a recrudescence of some form of jingoism, for want of a better word, or something like that, which could react to our very grave detriment because, whilst we are a very important market for Britain they are a vital market for us and they are just as well aware of that as we are.  I believe, however, that the goodwill of the two Governments plus the indisputable legality of our position <i>vis-á-vis</i> any riotous assembly in Wales; or anywhere else, and the complete illegality of the action taken <i>vis-á-vis</i> the EEC and, in particular, <i>vis-á-vis</i> the treaties we have with the British Government, will solve any difficulties, real or imaginery.  I hope these problems will fade away.</P>
    <P>The last speaker talked about oil and Rockall.  Truth to tell, I get rather lost, as do most people, as to the position and as to how far our sovereignty over the shelf extends.  I think the last Deputy got mixed up between Rockall and the shelf.  As far as I know, it is not part of the shelf. It may be on the shelf but, as far as I know, it is not.  It is very complicated, legalistic, geophysical matter as to the extent of any oil there and the extent to which we wish to lay claim to whatever may exist there.  I believe we will lay claim to what we believe to be our rights in the matter.  I am sure the Government will do so.  In laying those claims we will not make up extravagant claims.</P>
    <P>Sometimes people have pressed the Government to take up an attitude which the majority of the Irish people would find it hard to justify.  Successive <Col N="1002" /> Irish Governments have not made extravagant claims and, as a member of the comity of nations, they have always been amongst those who claimed their due right but did not put themselves out of court by making extravagant claims.  In that respect I hope we will do all that can be done. I doubt that we have the money to do a great deal ourselves.  The financing of any oil company in this country has not yet been spelled out.  It would take a long time and it would take even longer to settle some of the mining problems nearer home.</P>
    <P>As I said, the Minister has produced a very good document and made a very good speech.  He has given us an excellent resume.  His speech is a mine of information concerning our relationships with various other countries. We are all very anxious that the terrible situation between Palestine and the Arab States should be settled amicably.  That conflict has cost us very dearly.  The closing of the Suez Canal years ago put up the cost of oil and now, of course, the cost of oil has gone to astronomic heights.</P>
    <P>We in a country like this cannot do very much <i>vis-á-vis</i> a settlement of the escalation of oil prices.  It is partly due to the conflict between Palestine and the Arab States who were so poor and are now wealthy and have seen a triumphant Palestine helped by some of the great powers in the world.  We are now suffering very much in our pockets through paying more for oil, but that is one of the least things we have to suffer.  We will have to go through a whole lot more because other things follow.  Unemployment and financial difficulties flow from that situation.  We will just have to do what we can.  I leave it to the Government. I have no easy solution to offer for the Minister's consideration.  We will have to do the best we can.</P>
    <P>I now come to South Africa and Rhodesia.  This is where I differ slightly from the Minister.  South Africa and Rhodesia present a thorny question.  We do not like apartheid. Nobody likes apartheid.  I was in South Africa and the people I met did not like apartheid.  I read a great deal about South Africa and I try <Col N="1003" /> to keep in touch with it.  There are tremendous forces for liberalism in that country.  Sometimes when we&mdash; and when I say &ldquo;we&rdquo; I mean liberal-minded people in western Europe&mdash; take too hard a line, when we boycott certain sporting events and so on, we do far more harm than good.  We cut the ground from under the feet of the liberal people in South Africa.</P>
    <P>The Government there appear to be very firmly entrenched but there are other big political parties which have a tremendous following.  They are not in favour of apartheid.  I believe the South African Government are genuinely trying to drop many of the harsher aspects of apartheid.  This is a subject one could discuss at considerable length.  One can say a lot about it but one is mainly discussing opinions.  There are certain facts, of course, but in my opinion the way to help the liberalisation of South Africa is to treat that Government as we do many other Governments&mdash;not showing any agreement with apartheid but sympathising with the liberal elements and showing that we wish to help the country in its move forward.</P>
    <P>There is also the question of the USSR.  Sometimes some of our people blame South Africa or Rhodesia or, perhaps, Chile&mdash;I do not know much about Chile&mdash;but one must be very careful about what one reads because everybody is shooting a line on these things and to understand them properly and not waffle needs a great deal of study for which very few Deputies have very much time.</P>
    <P>We now have a Soviet Embassy in Dublin.  There is no need to pretend that the majority of Irish people are in sympathy with the aims, as expressed many times, of the Soviet Union.  They are not, and it would be no service to the Government, or to anybody else, even to the Soviet Union, to pretend that there were aspects of these aims we liked.  There are aspects of Soviet legislation which are not bad&mdash;in certain directions their legislation is excellent&mdash;and there is no reason why we should not be able to get on with them.  I believe they are <Col N="1004" /> very interested in our system of treating our bogs, turning our peat into briquettes and also using it for horticultural purposes.  They are also interested in the technicalities and engineering problems raised by all that.</P>
    <P>I understand that Russian engineers are interested in the work we have been doing on our bogs.  This is not surprising when one considers that we lead the world in our treatment of peat, our handling of the raw material and the finished product.  There are a number of lines on which we can have a common front with the USSR. I am sure that while they are in Dublin an eye will be kept on them. On the whole, it is a good idea to have the Russians based in Dublin, particularly for the exchange of trade and ideas.</P>
    <P>To return to Northern Ireland, Deputy O'Kennedy raised the question of money being wasted by the British Government.  I believe he was making the point that because the British forces were in the North the British Government were wasting money. When a Government spends money on a vast scale there is bound to be plenty of waste.  However I think the position is, as has been stated by our Government, that there is a necessity for having the troops in the North at present.  Nobody, least of all the British themselves, want to see the troops staying in Northern Ireland any longer than they have to and the day will come when they will get out.  I do not view this as a waste of money. It may be wasted effort but the position, bad as it is now, would be worse without them.</P>
    <P>I wonder if we will sometime see United Nations troops based there? I do not know what the end of that terrible situation will be but the Irish people can rest assured that never, since the foundation of this State, has there been a Government more anxious to settle the Northern situation, and to settle it from the point of view of justice and right for all concerned, than this Government.</P>
    <P>The Labour element of this Government are desperately anxious to settle the Northern situation; their unions go North and across the water. <Col N="1005" /> Our links also go North and we want to settle it just as much as anybody else.  I know that Fianna Fáil also wish to settle it.  They do not wish to see another person harmed, still less another person killed, in the North whilst it is possible for people in political places to heal the wounds and bring that carnage to an end.  They are as keen as we are.</P>
    <P>With goodwill on both sides, and the very strong desire of all of us to see peace&mdash;not peace at any price but a lasting peace with justice&mdash;we will have peace there.  We do not want to pass on a patched up solution which will endure only for a few years.  We, as a Government, and above all the people in the South, want to see an end to the troubles in the North.  Although it is not our fault it is, in the eyes of many people, a lasting shame and crime on us in this House, in the North and in Westminster. We should be able to settle this problem or at least help in its settlement.  One of the ways to do this is not to exacerbate the situation.</P>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesBMcDonald" hpid="Mr. McDonald Mr. McDonald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McDonald</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to compliment the Minister on the very clear and concise way he has presented his Estimate.  I should like to pay tribute to him for the amount of work he has done during the last year.  The civil servants in the Department of Foreign Affairs, so ably led by the Minister, form a dynamic team.  I have great admiration for the people I meet in that Department.  Since I was appointed to the European Parliament my duties have brought me in contact with many of our people in Foreign Affairs, not only in the Department itself but in the Commission in Brussels and in many of the embassies throughout Europe.  They are a tremendous credit to our country. I do not think we fully realise the dedicated service they render to the State.  To give only one example, one thinks of the very long hours they so unselfishly devote to their duties.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should like to note the changing importance of this Department.  There is now greater pressure on it than ever before and we look to Foreign Affairs to do even more work for the country. <Col N="1006" /> I hope that the importance of creating a greater identity for our country and our people will be foremost always in the minds of the people who serve our country in Foreign Affairs.</P>
    <P>I should like to deal very briefly with a few points I consider to be important.  Now that we are firmly entrenched as members of the European Economic Community we ought pay more attention to our foreign policy and, certainly, expand it to some degree.  I should like to see a policy in the Department of perhaps improving the facilities for our embassy staffs in a few places.  At the same time, one is impressed by the magnificent embassy buildings we have in some European cities.  In places where we rent accommodation, there should be a policy to purchase outright.  Perhaps we could have a target of purchasing one new building a year, which would be a good investment.</P>
    <P>I should like to pay a sincere tribute to the Minister for the amount of work he does and the expert way in which he carries out his duties over a wide and varied field.  Not only does he play a very full role in the Council of Ministers but he has made quite an impression also at the United Nations.  Indeed he gets through the same volume of work at the OECD, the Council of Europe and GATT, all of which must take up a considerable amount of his time.</P>
    <P>I should like to note also the increase in the number of embassies over the past year.  This is a good policy because there are too many areas of the world, especially on the African continent, where we do not appear to be represented.  It is necessary that we, as the oldest of the new countries, should by our presence, support the emerging nations, especially those of the African continent, and give them not only recognition but help in many ways.  In the coming year I look forward to a continuance of the policy of increasing the number of our embassies abroad.</P>
    <P>I should like to compliment the Minister and indeed the Government, on substantially increasing our aid to <Col N="1007" /> the International Co-operation and Development Aid Organisation.  We have almost met the target laid down in this respect by the United Nations. Even though the amount of money in our case is not very substantial, it shows we are conscious of the difficulties and plight of many millions of people throughout the world.  With the cattle crisis and the difficult economic situation being experienced in our country, over the last few weeks we have heard many speakers advocating that we should seek animal food aid in Europe for cattle that may die this coming winter.  I was contemplating putting such a question to the Council of Ministers.  Then, looking at the statistics of the millions of underfed people and the vast areas of famine throughout the world, areas with which we have traditional ties, I felt it would be rather embarrassing to ask for aid to feed starving cattle this winter knowing there are many millions of people experiencing famine conditions throughout the world.  It is just over 100 years since we had a famine.  But we must consider taking modern modes of transport into consideration, that in 1970 Ethiopia was nearer to our country than was Britain in 1846 or 1847.  I know many of our people have contributed to famine relief in Ethiopia but I do not think we can afford the luxury of ignoring the plight of so many of our fellow men throughout the world, even though they be quite a long way from us.</P>
    <P>I want to express my full support for the Government's policy on the Northern Ireland situation.  I want to stress the fact that we should, in foreign affairs, strengthen our information service to ensure that our people here, whether North or South, are not the victims of vicious propaganda from whatever source it may emanate. Unfortunately the major European papers do not differentiate in their daily headlines between our country, North and South.  I do not know what we should do about this, but nevertheless we should be conscious of this problem.</P>
    <P>I should like to devote a few moments now to the role our Minister <Col N="1008" /> will play in the Community between January and June, 1975.</P>
    <P>Recently I was reading some of the documentation and I found that Robert Schumann said the following in his declaration on behalf of France with regard to the proposal for a single authority for French and German coal and steel production in May, 1950.</P>
    <P>Europe will not be made all at once, nor according to a single plan. It will be built through concrete achievements which first create real solidarity.</P>
    <P>When one considers the progress of the Community and the achievements of the Council of Ministers this year, one realises Schumann was a shrewd operator because he assessed the situation to an extraordinary degree.</P>
    <P>If the EEC is to progress&mdash;it must because it cannot stagnate&mdash;there must be some kind of government.  If the Council of Ministers is to adopt the role of the European Government, the president of the Council should be a full-time one in that he should spend most of his time dealing with the problems of the Community.  Next year I look forward to our Minister giving that dynamic leadership that the EEC needs if it is to progress, if it is to start taking decisions and giving leadership, not presenting itself merely as an organisation that can do nothing more than react to problems internally and from the international point of view.</P>
    <P>At the moment the Community needs dynamic leadership.  I hope our Minister will take every opportunity to bring about greater democratisation in the Community, that he will avail of every chance to demonstrate this fact to the peoples of Europe.  Many of them have great difficulty in identifying our country as an individual nation; when I say that I speak of the citizens of the various European countries. Now is our opportunity, when our Minister will have his first term as president of the Council of Ministers, to put our country on the map.</P>
    <P>We are committed to the task of bringing to a successful conclusion the continuing process which leads from the EEC to a European partnership in the full sense, founded upon <Col N="1009" /> and dedicated to the safeguarding of the traditions and the way of life of the member countries, their democratic forms of government and respect for the rule of law.  In the next six months I hope the Minister will endeavour to break new ground, perhaps in supporting and strengthening the power of the European Parliament. It is necessary that there be a strong identification of the peoples of Europe with the Community through their representatives and this can only be done through the Parliament. It is an opportunity for us to advocate and make progress towards European union not just in 1980 but, if possible, before then.</P>
    <P>I know the position and policy of our country with regard to NATO, but we must ensure that this position and policy do not hinder the formation of a Community defence system.  This is increasingly necessary when one considers the possibility of a lesser United States involvement in the defence of Europe.  Perhaps we may have a discussion in greater detail on this question.  The matter of European defence has been exercising the minds of the political committee of the European Parliament for some time.  There will not be a unanimous report on the problem because both the Danish members and ourselves have not the same views on the subject as have the German and United Kingdom members.  It is an extremely important matter that I hope will be discussed more fully.</P>
    <P>I welcome the establishment of the Soviet Embassy here and their policy of <i>détente.</i> However, I can assure the House that as soon as a defence vacuum is created in Europe it will not be left vacant for long.  When one considers the history and progress of the Russian people, one realises they have a very definite pattern of operation and I am not so simple as to think they have changed their tactics. I hope the Russian personnel who have come to live here and who represent their country will enjoy the experience and their life here.</P>
    <P>The voluntary work being done presently by the Irish clubs in Camden <Col N="1010" /> Town and in other centres in the United Kingdom is of tremendous importance.  These people have given wonderful voluntary service for many years and I hope that social workers and advice bureaux will be established in more areas.  The workers who are helping Irish people in distress should be given more meaningful financial support by the State.  Last year was the first time the Government recognised the problem but there is a considerable amount of work to be done. It was unrealistic of successive Governments to ignore the costly and necessary work a few people, mainly religious, carried out for so long.  I hope we will increase the Estimate for the provision of social workers in the various Irish centres in the United Kingdom.</P>
    <P>I regret I have not been able to deal more fully with the very exciting philosophy of European union.  But we shall have a debate soon on the EEC when we shall be able to discuss that problem to a greater extent.</P>

      <P>When the debate was adjourned on the 29th May last I had been replying to various matters that had been raised in <Col N="1011" /> respect of Leinster House accommodation&mdash;for instance, the provision of a stand-by generator and air conditioning as it affected us in this building. Many Deputies made reference to the type of heating used in Government buildings.  Deputies Callanan, MacSharry, Geoghegan and Coogan were critical of the type of fuel used and were anxious that native fuel should be used.  In this connection I would remind the Deputies that both gas and electricity have been classified as native fuels.  Obviously this is because both sources are generated here and, consequently, they have been used extensively down through the years for the heating of State buildings. I might add in passing that the classification was not determined by the Office of Public Works.</P>
      <P>It has long been the policy of the Commissioners to use turf whenever possible for heating those buildings which are their responsibility and it is only for sound technical reasons that they depart from this policy.  For example, in the case of telephone exchanges it is vital to avoid in so far as possible the creation of a dust laden atmosphere.  This is because of the sensitivity of the telephonic instruments.</P>
      <P>Deputy MacSharry was critical of the use of gas, electricity or oil in some 96 Government offices throughout the country.  This point has been covered by my reminding the Deputy that these fuels have been classified as native.</P>
      <P>Deputy MacSharry, too, was under the impression that turf is burned in only one Government building in Kildare Street.  The building referred to is heated from the central heating station in Kildare Place, which heats also Leinster House, Government Buildings, the College of Science, the Departments of Industry and Commerce and Transport and Power, the National Gallery, the National Library, the National Museum and the National College of Art.  The fuel used is turf brickeens and this station is the largest turf burning system in the country.  It uses about 5,000 tons of fuel per year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1012" /> Regarding accommodation for Government staff, Deputy Fitzpatrick mentioned in particular the new building in Kildare Street.  The fitting of this building, in which will be centralised the headquarters staff of the Department of Agriculture and Fisheries, is now almost complete and the occupation of the building, which is taking place in stages, should be completed before the end of April next. The building, which was constructed by a private concern, is being acquired by the State by way of a sophisticated form of hire purchase.  Initially the State paid a capital contribution of £500,000 towards the cost of the project. In addition an annual rent is being paid, but in accordance with long-standing practice details of the rent are not disclosed.  In accordance with normal practice the cost of fittings and furnishings is being borne by the tenant&mdash;in this case, the State&mdash; and the total cost of this operation will be in the region of £1 million. In addition to accommodating the staff of about 1,000 of the Department of Agriculture and Fisheries, the building will accommodate also about 250 personnel from other Departments.</P>
    <P>Deputy Enright suggested that in many cases civil servants are expected to work in substandard accommodation where there is substandard furniture. While I accept that there are many offices in Dublin and throughout the provinces where conditions could be better, this is a situation to which, down through the years, adequate attention was not paid.  However steps are now being taken to set up within the Office of Public Works a unit whose task will be to make improvements all round.  It is a task that is formidable: it will take a good deal of time, effort and money if we are to bring the accommodation concerned to a satisfactory standard.</P>
    <P>Deputy Tunney was critical of the locations in Dublin of Government offices and he commented on the imbalance as between north and south of the Liffey.  If such an imbalance existed up to now, we are presently in the process of having it rectified. Deputy Tunney will be glad to hear <Col N="1013" /> that.  The State has rented a very large building in Marlborough Street. A fair amount of space has been rented, too, in the Phibsborough tower building and plans are in hand for a new building for a meteorological office on the site of the former Marlborough House, Glasnevin.  Consideration is being given also to a proposal for the erection of another large office block to house about 700 members of staff on the north side of the city.</P>
    <P>Deputy MacSharry inquired about the number of staff from the Departments of Lands and Education who would be transferred to Castlebar and Athlone and asked when the transfer would take place.  Selected sections of the staffs of both Departments are to be transferred to Athlone and Castlebar. The building in Castlebar was designed to accommodate between 200 and 300 people while the building in Athlone will accommodate between 100 and 150 personnel.  Present indications are that movement to Castlebar will commence in the latter half of 1975 and to Athlone in early 1976. At this stage it is not possible to be more definite.</P>
    <P>Deputies White and MacSharry raised the question of the decentralisation of Government staff.  This question is being considered as a matter of Government policy.</P>
    <P>In my opening speech I stated that work is proceeding on the erection of new office buildings for the Departments of Lands and Education at Castlebar and Athlone, respectively, and that later there may be buildings erected in other places.  Deputy McLaughlin suggested the centralisation of Government offices in one building in provincial towns.  I accept the desirability of that idea and this has been achieved already in a small number of centres such as Carlow, Drogheda and Letterkenny.  The process will be continued but, of necessity, it will take a long time to centralise all Government staffs in one building in each town.  It will happen in Castlebar and, perhaps, Athlone.</P>
    <P>Deputy MacSharry inquired also about the position of the stand-by <Col N="1014" /> generator at Leinster House.  It has been decided to provide a generator for emergency use at Leinster House and Government Buildings.  Planning of a suitable scheme is under way.</P>
    <P>Deputy Lemass referred to houses occupied by the Department of Lands in Upper Merrion Street.  These buildings have been occupied by the Department for a long time.  They are like a labyrinth, with connection from one building to another.  These buildings have been joined together, and one could go astray if one were not guided from one office to another.  The development of the properties, with a view to providing proper accommodation, is under consideration.</P>
    <P>Deputy MacSharry wanted to know on what the sum of £1,200,000 for telephone capital would be spent?  This money will be spent on more than 75 works in all, comprising new telephone exchanges, extensions to existing exchanges, engineering headquarters and engineering depots.  I have a huge list here, but if the Deputy wishes to get a copy of the list it will save me reading it out.</P>

      <P>Deputies Lemass, Enright and Tom Fitzpatrick <i>(Dublin Central)</i> referred to the shortage of accommodation in the National Library. This is being dealt with in conjunction with the Department of Education and steps are being taken to improve the position.  As the House should know, we have already possession of a building in Kildare Street&mdash; I think it is No. 4&mdash;and negotiations are proceeding for the acquisition of another one further down at Leinster Lane.  With the final acquisition of that place we will be able to arrange for an extension of accommodation within the precincts of or around the present site of the National Library.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy McDonald referred to the need for the provision of proper facilities for the EEC meetings in Dublin from January to June, 1975.  This matter is being dealt with in conjunction with the Department of Foreign Affairs and we believe that adequate <Col N="1015" /> facilities will be available in good time.</P>
    <P>The programme for national school buildings was queried.  Some suggestions were made and some Deputies were critical of the rate of progress of buildings.  Expenditure from State funds on national school buildings in the financial year 1973-74 was approximately £3,832,000.  In the current financial year the figure will be in excess of £6,500,000, which is the largest amount ever expended for this purpose.  A large proportion of the money is being spent on the erection of new schools in new areas in towns and cities.  The provision of school accommodation in these new housing areas is an urgent necessity.  Thirty-six new schools, including five for mentally handicapped children, have been completed since April last and in the same period major improvement schemes were completed at 15 schools.</P>
    <P>During the financial year it is expected that permanent places for 16,000 children will have been provided and that some portion of the extra expenditure can be attributed to increase building costs.  There has been an acceleration of the school building programme.  There are now more than 100 new schools in the course of erection and approximately the same number of major improvement schemes in progress.  A type of school is now being built to provide for the requirements of the new curriculum.  New features include shared teaching areas, general purpose areas, recreational and gymnastic facilities.  Where improvement schemes are undertaken the schools are up-dated to present-day standards.</P>
    <P>Over recent years a programme for the provision of an increasing number of schools for the mentally handicapped has been undertaken.  In addition to the five such schools which have been completed during the current financial year works are in progress on 11 new schools and on two improvement and extension schemes. A number of others are at various stages of preparation.  These schools have to be specially designed with <Col N="1016" /> extra facilities and more space per pupil.  In a number of cases the Department of Health are associated with the progress in providing a day centre for the care of the more severely handicapped.</P>
    <P>I want to deal with some of the suggestions and some of the criticisms Deputies made during the course of their remarks.  Deputy MacSharry suggested that there may be duplication of work between the Office of Public Works and the Department of Education.  There is no duplication. In brief, the Department of Education are the policy framers; the Office of Public Works are the executors of that policy.  The Department of Education make the policy and the Office of Public Works carry out their instruction.</P>
    <P>The position as regards construction of schools is that the smaller schools are designed by the Office of Public Works architects and the contract arrangements for those are made directly by the Office of Public Works.  The remainder&mdash;admittedly the great bulk nowadays&mdash;are designed by architects employed by the managers who make the contract arrangements themselves.  The operations involved are monitored by the Office of Public Works.  The Department of Education are not involved in this monitoring at all.  Once a decision is taken to build a school and the amount of the grant determined, it is necessary to involve the Department of Education only in the event of some question of policy arising.  Generally speaking, Deputies will appreciate the importance and desirability of having an organisation backed by long experience in the administration of contracts and of avoiding the proliferation of departmental units which could handle such work.</P>
    <P>Deputy Geoghegan, during the course of the debate, referred to the question of the removal of trees which might be a danger to schools with particular reference to a certain school in his own area.  The reply to him on the 29th May was:</P>
    <P>A new school is at present being erected on the site of the old school <Col N="1017" /> at Tiernakill which had to be demolished at the commencement of operations.</P>
    <P>Deputy Geoghegan was informed by the former Parliamentary Secretary, Deputy Lemass, on the 3rd November, 1972, that demolition would be necessary. Before the old building was demolished it was damaged by a falling tree during a severe storm and alternative accommodation was sought by the managers.  The possibility of making available the married quarters at Maam Garda Station was investigated but this could not be done as the premises were required by the Garda for official purposes.  The manager provided accommodation for the older pupils in a private residence, which, it is understood, belongs to a teacher.  No other premises were available. It is hoped that the new school will be ready pretty soon.</P>
    <P>On the general question of removing trees which might be a danger to schools generally, this is primarily a matter for school managers or for the county councils, if the trees are near the county roads.  If there is a problem about identifying trees which might be dangerous, they might consult with the local forestry inspectors.</P>

      <P>I did not know the Deputy was there.  Deputy John Ryan suggested that closed-down national schools should be made available for community purposes.  A great majority of national schools are not owned by the State but by local trustees.  So far as State-owned schools are concerned it is settled policy that the Office of Public Works will negotiate the sale of these buildings, wherever they are a surplus to other State needs, to local groups for the purpose of community halls.  Several such sales have already taken place.</P>
      <P>Deputy Taylor asked about the closing down of national schools and by whose authority they were closed down.  The closing of national schools is decided by the Department of Education. The Office of Public Works are not consulted and they have no function whatsoever in the matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1018" /> Deputy Enright referred to the urgent need for the provision of a new school at Shinrone, which I understand is his own native parish.  He asked a question about this on 28th May. Tenders for this work have been received and the contract will be placed immediately the local contribution is lodged, which the manager has been asked to do.  He was reminded by phone to expedite the lodgment and the contract was placed two days later. That was very good timing by Deputy Enright.</P>

This may happen on rare occasions but only on the final instalment, or it may have been retention money.  If the Deputy has any such case in mind and if he lets me know I shall have it expeditiously finalised.</P>

    <P>In regard to the building and improvement of Garda stations throughout the country, Deputy MacSharry wanted to know what new stations are to be built this year and what stations are listed for improvement. I have a list which is not very long and which I shall read out.  It gives the new stations and stations with work in progress as: Skibberreen Country Cork; Multyfarnham, County Westmeath, Ballinahowan, County Westmeath; Ballinacargy, County Westmeath; Knockcroghery, County <Col N="1019" /> Roscommon; Bunbeg, County Donegal; Clonroche and Rosslare Strand, County Wexford; Rosmuc, County Galway; Enniskerry, County Wicklow; Shannonbridge, County Offaly; Raphoe, County Donegal; Cooldaff, County Donegal.  Centres at which work is expected to commence during 1974: Croom, County Limerick; Kiltullagh, County Galway; Corofin, County Clare; Limerick divisional headquarters; Ballyshannon, County Donegal, district headquarters; Kanturk, County Cork, district headquarters; Castleblaney, County Monaghan, district headquarters; Granard, County Longford, district headquarters; Fenit, County Kerry; Bruree, County Limerick; Inchigeela, County Cork; Emly, County Tipperary; Kilkelly, County Mayo; Millstreet, County Cork; Broadford, County Clare; and Swords, County Dublin.</P>
    <P>Improvement schemes at existing Garda stations&mdash;works in progress&mdash; Store St, Dublin; Blanchardstown, County Dublin.  Stations where work is expected to commence during 1974 &mdash;Mountjoy, Dublin; Emyvale, County Monaghan; Midleton, County Cork; Geashill, County Offaly; Minor improvement schemes at existing Garda barracks&mdash;number where work is in progress, 33; number where work is expected to commence in 1974,40.</P>
    <P>Deputy White mentioned Ballyshannon and suggested that instead of building a new district headquarters there we should try to buy a building known as the &ldquo;Brothers Residence&rdquo; which is vacant or about to become vacant.  I have asked for a report on this building and when it comes to hand the position will be considered. It is only very rarely, however, that a building erected as a dwelling is found to be really suitable for a purpose such as a Garda district headquarters or divisional headquarters.</P>
    <P>Deputy Geoghegan, who seems to have covered a very wide ambit in the debate although he did not speak for very long, referred to the poor condition of Garda stations in County Galway.  While buildings in exposed locations, such as in Connemara, <Col N="1020" /> suffer more than others from severe weather, I agree that many of the stations are not in as good a condition as I would wish.  The Office of Public Works are finding it extremely difficult to recruit the professional and technical staff required to look after all their buildings.  Special efforts are being made to secure extra staff and I hope that as a result it will be possible to give the attention required to Garda stations and all other buildings for which the Office of Public Works are responsible.</P>
    <P>Deputy Enright also mentioned Portlaoise Garda station but as this was the subject of a question last week I think all the information required has been given to Deputy Lalor and Deputy Enright.</P>
    <P>Deputy John Ryan suggested that married members of the Garda should have the right to purchase the official houses they occupy.  This matter was previously considered in consultation with the Department of Justice.  The position generally about applications by members of the force to purchase houses is that they cannot be granted because it is necessary to maintain a supply of officially-owned quarters to facilitate the transfer of members.  If Garda members bought their houses and were then transferred the gardaí coming to replace them would not have accommodation.  Up to now it has not been possible to devise a scheme to allow gardaí to buy out their houses.</P>
    <P>Deputy McLaughlin referred to the Garda stations at Sligo and Manorhamiltion. One scheme of improvement has been carried out in Sligo and a further more expensive scheme is being planned.  The legal formalities for the acquisition of a site at Manorhamilton for a new district headquarters are almost completed and plans for the new station will be put in hands as soon as possible.</P>
    <P>An improvement scheme costing approximately £23,000 is being carried out at present.  The works include central heating, a new sanitary block, modernisation of cells and public office including the provision of booths for telex and radio.  Progress is slow mainly due to the inability of the contractor to secure skilled labour.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1021" /> Deputy Leonard sought information about a customs station at Monaghan. Plans are ready for a customs road station at Monaghan but problems have been encountered about foundations because of the nature of the site.  Tests have been made and the results are being examined.  It is hoped to have the problems resolved and construction work put in hand in the very near future.</P>
    <P>Among all the rural Deputies the question of arterial drainage was one which was not laboured by them but they expressed their own views and the sentiments of their constituents.  I know that all the rural Deputies, especially those whose territory includes rivers, are being belaboured at meetings on the vexed question of arterial drainage.  It is a problem that must be solved by getting more money for the implementation of these works. Deputies Callanan, MacSharry, McLaughlin, Taylor and Ryan in their speeches to the House expressed their own personal views and the sentiments of their constituents, and I know from my own constituency and from every constituency in Connacht that this question is foremost in every farmer's mind.  What the powers that be do not understand is that by implementing arterial drainage we are extending an industry, one of the greatest industries in the country, agriculture, and it is my fervent desire that the Minister for Finance would grant us more money every year.</P>
    <P>I share in the sympathy of Deputies for the many farmers who have to wait so long for the benefits of arterial drainage.  The national drainage problem is a very great one indeed and it can best be approached in an orderly way, in particular by keeping to the settled priorities.  Even then each scheme must be preceded by painstaking, protracted and specialist investigation. The cost of a scheme generally runs into several million pounds, and takes a number of years to carry out.  Because of the great demand for and shortage of capital, arterial drainage must measure up to other investments by the State for public benefit, and it is for this reason <Col N="1022" /> that a cost benefit study for each proposal has to be made.</P>
    <P>Deputies have mentioned certain catchments: the Fergus, Corrib/ Mask/Robe, Dunkellin, Mulkear and Nore, the Owenmore, and these are all priority catchments.  They will all reach their due turn and I am happy that in the current budgetary period it has been possible to provide a substantial additional amount for the drainage programme. Mention has been made of the desirability of continuity of employment for men on drainage maintenance.  I will concern myself with the matter to see how far it can be achieved, but this sort of operation is mostly confined to the summer season, when water is low and weeding can be seen and eradicated.  The reply to specific questions about the Mulkear catchment is that a scheme would be of the order of £2 million and an acreage of 7,600 in Limerick and 3,260 in Tipperary suffers from lack of drainage.  As I stated, this will be dealt with in due course, having regard to its order on the priority list.  However, this is one of the most important items in the budget and I shall do my utmost to ensure that more finance will be provided because I know the problem as well as any other Deputy.</P>
    <P>Deputy MacSharry did not understand three items of information in the Book of Estimates.  Deputy John Callanan raised this matter also. Deputy MacSharry said that under subhead G.1 only £2,000 has been provided for comprehensive drainage surveys.  This provision is to cover expenses, apart from salaries, and so on, which are met out of subheads A and B.  The £2,000 in subhead G.1 is only what is known as a contingency fund; suppose, for instance, a squad of men were employed just for a few days.  It might also be used for entertainment or some item like that. It might not be used at all.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Kenny</NameTxt>
      <P>No, there is not.  I can tell the Deputy that I found it difficult enough to understand the method of book-keeping employed in these matters.</P>
      <P>Deputy Enright asked for information regarding the Shannon drainage. In February, 1965, the then Government announced that special steps were to be taken with a view to the preparation of a drainage scheme for the Shannon Basin.  In July, 1965, the investigation was postponed because of the difficult financial position.  In 1967 the investigation was resumed, but on a tiny scale.  Trial borings have been carried out on part of the main channel and the results plotted, but no subsequent field survey was made because the engineering staff and the necessary funds have not been available.  The hydrometric survey being made of the country generally includes, of course, the Shannon catchment.  With the restricted funds being allocated to arterial drainage it is not possible to say when the Shannon proposal can be resumed in a serious way.  It may be taken that the progress made so far is very small in comparison with the amount remaining to be done upon this enormous project.</P>
      <P>Since the Shannon drainage scheme was mooted in 1965, the potential of the river Shannon as a recreational cruiseway and for other aquatic sports has projected itself.  With the growth in the world-wide demand for aquatic sports generally and our membership of the Common Market these resources must be assessed and taken fully into account in the cost/ benefit analysis of any possible arterial drainage schemes for the Shannon.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Callanan and Deputy MacSharry raised the matter of the Owenmore drainage.  The Owenmore <Col N="1024" /> catchment has an area of 160,000 acres and is situated mainly in County Sligo with some small areas in Counties Leitrim, Mayo and Roscommon.  The main channel is the Owenmore river and the principal tributaries are the Unshin, or Arrow, and the Owenbeg. It is estimated that some 21,000 acres of land and 5,000 acres of bog would stand to benefit from a comprehensive drainage scheme.</P>
    <P>An engineering survey of the catchment was commenced in 1963 in conjunction with the survey of the adjoining Bonet catchment of County Leitrim.  The field survey of the Owenmore, including the Lough Arrow catchment, has since been completed and the plotting of data and design of a scheme is proceeding, with a view to ascertaining whether a scheme, under the Arterial Drainage Act, 1945, would be feasible.  This work will not have progressed to the stage where a preliminary engineering report and estimate would be available for some years.</P>
    <P>If this report indicates that a scheme would be feasible and economic, the proposals would then be subjected in due turn to a cost/benefit analysis to determine their worth as a capital investment. Assuming a favourable outcome, a formal scheme would then have to be prepared and the various statutory requirements met.</P>
    <P>I am aware of the considerable demand for this drainage and I recently received a deputation consisting of public representatives from the area and members of the Owenmore and Arrow drainage committee who pressed the matter very strongly.</P>
    <P>Deputy Crinion approves the new approach to spoil disposal as evidenced on the Boyne arterial drainage scheme. I am glad that note has been taken of the new approach by our arterial drainage engineers in this vexed question. The success of Trim in the &ldquo;Tidy Towns Competition&rdquo; was a great tribute to the success of this approach on the Boyne.  It is in keeping with the current concern of the public and the State in relation to the protection of the environment and helps to indictate that given the will, the policy and the money, arterial drainage does <Col N="1025" /> not necessarily damage our scenic areas.</P>
    <P>Deputy Taylor said that the Office of Public Works should again have a function in rural improvement schemes and bog development schemes.  We have not had any function whatever in regard to those for the last seven or eight years.  The rural improvement scheme has been replaced by the local improvement scheme.  This is a contributory scheme.  I do not know whether it functions at all in County Clare.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FrancisTaylor" hpid="Mr. Taylor Mr. Taylor">

      <NameTxt>Mr. Kenny</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Leonard asked whether we could do a piecemeal job on arterial drainage.  We are not allowed by law to do that.  When a statutory declaration is made to carry out an arterial drainage scheme it must be finished.  When it is finished, it is signed, sealed and delivered and nobody can introduce new works after the scheme is sealed.  That leads to a lot of misinterpretation.  When the scheme is finished it is finished and by law no new works can be done.  The maintenance then is done by the Office of Public Works with the contribution of the full amount from the local authority.</P>
      <P>Deputies, especially from the maritime counties, mentioned coast protection. The difficulty here is not wholly financial.  Each proposal for a scheme may have its own peculiar problems involving study of the conditions over a long period.  The work is of a very specialist nature and adequate, competent staff are not available to deal with the work load as rapidly as I would like.  I am keeping the service under review to see if progress can be accelerated.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In regard to the case of Enniscrone mentioned by Deputy MacSharry, I am pleased to say that a scheme will very shortly be sent out for consideration <Col N="1026" /> and for the views of the county council and other interested local parties.  The scheme in Enniscrone has been going on for quite a while.  To get a scheme of coast protection off the ground is a most complex thing.  The regulations and conditions safeguard not alone the Department of Finance but also the local authority because they have to contribute to it and then look after it when the work is finished.  In regard to this scheme, Department of Finance sanction was sought on 2nd September, 1974, for a 50 per cent grant towards a scheme estimated to cost £150,000. This was a big increase on the original estimate of £85,000 due to additional work, with increase in prices.  Notwithstanding reminders sanction has not yet been received.  We have reminded them verbally again&mdash;and by verbally I mean verbally because I have been in Enniscrone and I have seen the conditions.  It will be a loss to Sligo County Council, to the people concerned on the actual ground and to the Department of Finance because it will take more to do it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RaymondMacSharry" hpid="Mr. MacSharry Mr. MacSharry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacSharry</NameTxt>
      <P>It is very dangerous at present.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Kenny Mr. Kenny">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kenny</NameTxt>
      <P>It is very dangerous for people passing along the road.  So far as Deputy Geoghegan's area is concerned and so far as Inishbofin is concerned, no proposal has been received and it is for the local authority in the first instance to submit to the Office of Public Works cases which they consider should be dealt with under the Coast Protection Act, 1963.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Mention has been made of the necessity for a scheme of grants to enable local authorities to do small jobs without reference to the Office of Public Works.  It takes careful, expert study to establish whether a coast protection problem exists and is remediable economically and if such be the case it would clearly be a job that should be done under the Act.  When local authority engineers or Office of Public Works engineers look at a scheme they might have the best intentions in the world but they cannot anticipate the reaction of the sea against something that is man-made.  I have seen that in many places.  There can be <Col N="1027" /> an excellent piece of work against the water but the sea reacts in a different way.  I have seen places where piers and harbours have been built, at an enormous cost and they were not successful.  The same applies to coast erosion.  When one tries to defend the land against the sea the sea has a different reaction.  The best laid schemes of engineers are apt to go wrong and the sea still wins.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RaymondMacSharry" hpid="Mr. MacSharry Mr. MacSharry">

    <Speaker pid="RaymondMacSharry" hpid="Mr. MacSharry Mr. MacSharry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacSharry</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Kenny Mr. Kenny">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kenny</NameTxt>
      <P>I know that.  The Act has only been in operation since 1963 and the Office of Public Works have done a fair amount of very good work. Coast protection is a costly operation and should be embarked on only after full and adequate consideration of all available facts and information.</P>
      <P>I must refer again to that man of endurance, Deputy Geoghegan.  The Office of Public Works, except in a very few special cases, have no responsibility for the upkeep of the smaller fishery piers and landing places around the coast.  They may, however, carry out schemes of improvement which may be initiated by other Departments, Agriculture and Fisheries, Gaeltacht and so on.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A question has been raised of a survey of all such structures with a view to having them repaired.  This question was raised by Deputy Geoghegan.  Such a survey has been carried out, county by county, by the Department of Agriculture and Fisheries.  It is representative of county councils, Roinn na Gaeltachta, Bord Iascaigh Mhara and the <Col N="1028" /> Office of Public Works.  The west coast has been surveyed from Donegal to west Cork and already the Department of Agriculture and Fisheries have in many cases implemented the recommendations made.</P>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>Is that the survey team I established?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Kenny Mr. Kenny">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kenny</NameTxt>
      <P>As far as I know it is not.  Anyway, the west coast has been surveyed.  The harbour at Inishbofin in County Galway is a transport rather than a fishery one.  However, a survey has been made with a view to a scheme of improvement.  Deputy Taylor raised the matter of harbour dredging.  Dredging near piers and in harbours is maintenance and is the responsibility of the local authority.</P>
      <P>Deputy Coogan mentioned a crane and slip on Innisheer, County Galway. In April last Roinn na Gaeltachta approved the execution of the following works at Innisheer: the provision of a slip and a road recently constructed by the county council; a hand-operated winch to serve the slip; and a light on the quay.</P>
      <P>Deputy Lemass inquired about Dún Laoghaire harbour mooring facilities. All space available in the harbour for the mooring of yachts has been allocated. In May, 1972, Deputy Lemass, who was then Parliamentary Secretary, met representatives of the yacht clubs and the position about moorings in the harbour was explained.  At that meeting it was suggested that if the demand and potential was as great as represented by them, the proper course would be for all yacht clubs in Dún Laoghaire&mdash;there are four&mdash; to get together, assess their long-term requirements and make a case for the development of separate facilities outside the harbour.  The commissioners are not aware that such a case has been made and policy matters would not rest with them.</P>

Deputy Lemass asked if I <Col N="1029" /> could give a brief outline of proposed developments for the creation of a new national park at Glenveagh in County Donegal.  As negotiations for the acquisition of the estate were concluded only recently and as the legal formalities have yet to be finalised, there has not been sufficient time to formulate a scheme of development. I will make an announcement at the appropriate time.  I have not time to go through all the miscellaneous items that were raised&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrendanCrinion" hpid="Mr. Crinion Mr. Crinion">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Crinion</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank you, Sir, for the opportunity to bring this matter before the House.  The beef trade position has gone beyond a joke.  The benefits of the green £, the rise in the intervention price and the disposal of large amounts of intervention stocks have been whittled away by the totally unacceptable behaviour of a few of the meat factories.  There are odd meat plants buying on the open market and selling nearly their entire output to Britain and making a profit. The price being paid this week to producers at the marts is about 24p per 1b.  The intervention price is 34½p to 35.4p and 67.3 per cent of prime bullocks are going into intervention and 7.8 per cent of prime heifer beef after going in at 32.1p to 33.7p where another 25 per cent get the full slaughter premium of £20.94 per beast or over 3p per 1b.  The discrepancy between what the farmers are being paid and what the factories are receiving is far too large to be explained away by saying it is a function of supply and demand.  The factories have an unlimited demand at good prices through intervention for their products.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the present situation of oversupply factories can get cattle at totally unprofitable prices to the producer. These low prices are forcing producers to hold on to their big cattle, which is further depressing the price of stores that will now be going into the feeders' yards.  The Department of Agriculture and Fisheries have a certain amount of muscle through the operation of the slaughter premium and the intervention system. If over 90 per cent of the prime <Col N="1031" /> cattle are benefiting from these subventions the Department must try to ensure that the benefits get back to the producer.  The Department have the whip hand and they should not be afraid to use it.  The Department can assist by ensuring that factories buy a large proportion of their cattle through the marts and refuse to handle those factories' meat for intervention and refuse to pay the premium unless an extra payment is made to the producer.</P>
    <P>That gives one an idea of what is happening.  I will go back now to the prices more or less per month since July.  In July the factories were paying 28p per 1b.  The minute the slaughter premium came in they dropped the price of cattle to the exact amount of the slaughter premium down to 26.5p plus £9 slaughter premium.  Then, as September came in and the premium went up, down came the price again and towards the middle of the month it had gone down to 22.5p to 23p plus the slaughter premium.  Then the green £ came in and in October the price in the factories rose a little bit from 23p to 26p per 1b.  plus the slaughter premium of £20.94 but, with the slaughter premium going up at that stage, so did intervention from 34.5p to 35.4p.  Then the Minister brought in the meat factories to the Department and in his answer to me last Thursday he said they would contribute 1p a 1b. to a voluntary fund to assist farmers with young cattle to purchase feeding at a reduced price. What I call that is small &ldquo;conscience money&rdquo; when one remembers that they also agreed at that meeting to pay a minimum of 27p all-in&mdash;that is, counting the slaughter premium; 27 from 35 leaves eight and most of it is going in at 35.4p and 1p a 1b. on a 10 cwt. bullock is roughly £6; six multiplied by eight is 48.  That is what they are getting under this agreement and then they say to the Minister: &ldquo;We will contribute 1p to a voluntary fund.&rdquo; It is like what they called in America earlier on when they set up trusts or foundations, &ldquo;conscience money&rdquo;.  This is exactly the same thing.  They are barefacedly robbing <Col N="1032" /> the farmer of £48, taking it that they paid that.</P>
    <P>To develop the point further, I will show where they are paying so little for intervention.  Earlier this year, in January, as reported in the papers, the factories were paying 28.5p to 28.8p for bullocks and they were getting 30.5p from intervention, plus the hides and the offals, which they had for themselves, and in a great many cases a butcher or a factory will consider these are nearly sufficient to pay expenses.  Take a comparison now. They say some of it had to go on the open market.  Now Smithfield is where most of the factories go and the price at that time was 31.5p to 33p for hindquarters and 19p to 22p for forequarters. Then, in April, which is a slack period&mdash;this covers the whole April-May period&mdash;prime bullocks were making 31.5p to 31p and the prices at Smithfield were 34p to 35p and, in certain cases, it was as high as 38p for the hindquarters and 22p for the forequarters.  Those factories were not, of course, making a loss.  They were selling both in Smithfield and into intervention at 30.5p.</P>
    <P>At that point they had the ball at their feet and supply started to come in and they decided they had better start making real profits and, as I pointed out, since July each time the slaughter premium came in down went the price and they made their profits. To give an idea of the situation, even after the Minister's agreement, at the moment the price in the factories is 24p to 26p a 1b.  One might get an odd one which would go beyond 26.5p, plus the slaughter premium of 20.94p, which is running from 27p to 29p.  In Smithfield it is 31p to 33½p for hindquarters and 17½p to 18p for forequarters. In Smithfield it has not fallen very much&mdash;about 2p or 3p at the most.  Our intervention has gone up considerably but our price has actually dropped.</P>
    <P>On the radio the other day a representative of a meat factory admitted that they were making profits.  He said: &ldquo;We must make profits now so that we can compete with the other factories which are making extreme profits when there is a bit more competition.&rdquo;<Col N="1033" /> A friend of mine, a banker, told me that the profits the meat factories are making are fantastic and exorbitant and that no business in the history of the state has ever made the profits they are making.  If they are killing and paying the price at the gate of the factory and making £45 to £50 a head, when you consider that about 29,000 cattle are being killed per week at the moment, you realise that that involves some money.  It's not chickenfeed by any means.</P>
    <P>Another area in which I think there is abuse is that five factories are putting between 90 per cent and 98 per cent of their kill into intervention at 35.4p.  I have seen dockets from those factories showing that they are paying 23p and 24p a lb plus the slaughter premium which brings it up to 27p.  They are putting the slaughter premium on to the end of the bill and paying it to the farmer to make him happy.  He says: &ldquo;I have got my slaughter premium&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>I maintain that they have not gone to the Department for the slaughter premium because you cannot get intervention and the slaughter premium together.  They pay the farmer the 27p and when you see over 90 per cent going in&mdash;which means that practically everything has gone in&mdash;you see that they are bluffing the farmer or the person who is putting it in and collecting intervention.  I build my whole case on the position in those five factories; and, as I said, 67.3 per cent of prime bullock beef and 7.8 per cent of heifers, which means that 75 per cent of the recent kill, has gone to intervention.</P>
    <P>Is there any control?  Does not this call for a public inquiry to show where exorbitant profits are being made?  <i>The Farmers' Journal</i> shows a beef farmer up to here in water, with one hand up, shouting for help.  Two civil servants are looking at him and one says: &ldquo;I nearly think they need help.&rdquo; That was quite a while ago.</P>

      <P>12th January last.  The Department cannot say that they were not warned.  There is another very <Col N="1034" /> serious aspect of this.  I pointed out the legitimate one of the prices they are paying and the price they are quoting to the people bringing in cattle.  Some of the factories are not satisfied even with that.  Exorbitant profits are not sufficient.  They have to go out into the sale yards.  Here they can buy cattle at 3p a lb less. Last week's prices in the sale yards were: first quality beef bullocks from £12 a cwt to £15 a cwt, £12.50 to £15.40, and £12.50 to £15.10.  The figures I have been talking about are from 23p to 25p a lb and there is no slaughter premium there.  This is what the farmer has to take.  He is not able to get into a factory with his cattle.  Today I was in a mart buying some stores and the price was £14 a cwt with the normal beef price at 23p a lb.  Some of the buyers were buying for a factory.</P>
      <P>There is another serious aspect. With oversupply the buyers for the factories are forming rings.  They decide what price they will pay.  I have seen two of them talking together. They start the bidding at about £20 lower than they intend to pay.  They talk and bid at the same time.  When they come to within £1 or £2 of the price they intend to pay, one drops out.  The next time the procedure is reversed and the other man buys.  A third person is in the next time.  I heard that they toss coins to see who will take different lots of cattle.  The normal lot is four or five and if a lot of ten comes in they toss a coin to see who will get them.  The factories who go out and buy in the open market are making an extra £20.  That puts their profit up to £65 or £70 a beast. The Department are allowing this to happen.</P>

      <P>The point I wish to make will not take one minute. A fleshy cow, weighing 8½ cwt, made £40; but if that animal went into intervention she would have made £150.  An animal weighing 7½ cwt made £12.10p and she could have made anything from £33 to £56.  An animal weighing 6 cwt made £5 and she should have made between £26 and £36.  I call for a public inquiry into the working of the meat factories.</P>

      <P>The Department do not hold any brief for meat factories or for marts.  The Minister has, again and again, stated his views so far as cattle prices are concerned in a clear manner.  The Minister wants all the benefits to go to the farmers, those accruing from intervention and slaughter premiums.  We publish the prices payable under the intervention system and we indicate the amounts of the slaughter premiums at different periods, and we give all the relevant information to the cattle producers to enable them to judge what prices should be obtained either in marts or in processing plants.</P>
      <P>I feel sure the Deputy knows that we have a free enterprise system of buying here and this has been the position down through the years.  Legislation has not been passed in this House to empower the State to move into factories, take them over and dictate what must be done.  The Minister has had discussions with factories and he has obtained an agreement on minimum prices payable to producers.  I am sure everyone will agree that the condition of cattle varies very much. I am satisfied that better quality cattle have made prices in excess of those quoted by the Deputy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Crinion has alleged that some of the meat factories are engaged in racketeering and that some marts <Col N="1036" /> have set up a system of rings to deprive farmers of their rights.  That is a serious allegation.  The Deputy asserted last week that fraudulent methods were being used.  I understood from him that some were guilty of trying to get, by some devious means&mdash;it could only be obtained through some fraudulent method&mdash;the premium and intervention price benefits.  The Minister would be very perturbed at such assertions and allegations.</P>
    <P>I have already asked Deputy Crinion to supply the Department with the particulars in his possession so that we can make investigations.  I asked him to pinpoint where this racket and these rings obtain so that the Department can take some useful action. The Department could advertise the fact and it could be referred to in the course of statements in this House. However, the Deputy has not done so. He has not availed of the invitation to supply us with the information that would help us make a detailed investigation of the position obtaining.</P>
    <P>It seems from the Deputy's statement that fraud is involved and because that is the case it would be a matter for the Department of Justice.  That Department investigate fraudulent activities on the part of any society, group or individuals.  We have a number of marts and 24 processing plants all in the market for the purchase of live animals.  It is true to say that the sales in recent months have been exceptionally high relative to the position obtaining last year.  There is no doubt about that.  The Minister has, by virtue of that position obtaining, expressed his views, strongly and forcibly, that as far as he was concerned all the benefits should go to the farmers.  It was implied in that statement that any farmer, or group of farmers, who felt they were not getting what they were entitled to or that fraudulent methods were prevailing at marts or at factories, should supply the Department with the information. If that information is forthcoming the matter will be investigated.</P>
    <P>On the question of sales it should be remembered that this is a free enterprise.  The Deputy has alleged that some meat factories are operating a racket but I cannot <Col N="1037" /> understand how any section of our farming community could allow such factories to operate a racket against their interests or how their organisations would stand for such rackateering. However, if it is happening, the Deputy should send the details to the Department.  The Deputy mentioned that between 90 per cent and 95 per cent of their purchases obtained intervention benefits.  According to the reports in my possession, and to the Department figures, only about 55 per cent of steers, heifers, and about 35 per cent of cows slaughtered were taken up under intervention arrangements. That being the case I cannot understand how a mart or a processing plant was able to obtain 90 per cent or 95 per cent of their purchases accepted for intervention purposes.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M.P. Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy should send us the figures.  The Deputy has also stated that 30 per cent of steers and heifers slaughtered qualified for slaughter premiums.  I wish to repeat that the Minister is firmly behind the farmers in an effort to ensure that they get the best possible price for their animals.  The Deputy has told the House that many cases of rackateering have come to his notice but he should pass on the information.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When we give the intervention and slaughter premium figures we do so <Col N="1038" /> in order that the farmers know the prices obtainable for their animals under these systems.  I am very perturbed to learn that this rackateering exists and that farmers are being deprived of their rights.  I do not know what further the Minister can do.  He is reviewing the position from week to week and has had discussions with the meat processors.  I am not satisfied with the figures given by the Deputy. The information at my disposal does not lead me to believe that a profit of more than £70 per animal is being made.  I cannot understand that.  If the Deputy gives the Department the information I guarantee him that the details submitted, with the names and addresses of the farmers he alleges have been victimised, will be treated confidentially.  It is only right to give that assurance because otherwise people would be slow to submit particulars to us.</P>
    <P>The House can rest assured that the Minister takes serious cognisance of this position.  He has worked hard and earnestly in Brussels to secure these advantages for our farmers and he does not want them whittled away by meat processors or marts.  The Minister will be only too pleased to carry out any investigation necessary on this vital matter.</P>

The list indicates in each case the Government Department responsible for providing chairmen.

      <P>My Department in conjunction with all other Departments and Offices have been carrying out an intensive programme of work in preparation for Ireland's Presidency; this has included the appointing of chairmen to each committee and working group.

      <P>The Government received notice of the terms of the order referred to in the Deputy's question some hours before it was made.  As soon as they ascertained the exact areas to which the order referred, the Government informed the British Government that they did not accept that the British Government were entitled to designate areas of Rockall plateau or other areas closer to the Irish than to the British coast.  Subsequently negotiations took place at official level between representatives of the two Governments.  It has been agreed that further negotiations will take place at an early date.</P>

      <P>An extension of the scope of this scheme is not at present contemplated. It is pointed out however that persons over pension age who are in receipt of a limited State pension may already be eligible for free television licence provided they are in receipt of a social welfare type pension. For example, as a result of the relaxation of the means test over the past 18 months a married person with a State pension of less than £23 a week, and no other means, would qualify for a partial old age pension and be eligible for a free television licence.</P>

I myself am in favour of the principle of the maximum devolution of appropriate functions from my Department to the local authorities and have given effect to this principle in a number of ways. As regards house grants, what I have done is to have administration devolved temporarily on an agency basis to certain local authorities, in the hope that the experience gained will assist in the consideration of the merits of a formal statutory transfer of all the work to local authorities. The devolution involves the administration of new house grants by Meath County Council and of reconstruction and individual water and sewerage grants by Longford and Westmeath county councils.</P>

Such a scheme, costing not less than £20,000, does not now require my Department's approval as to technical details, but if generally in order may be executed by the council out of the block allocations for such works allocated each year.  The council were advised on 4th November that 13 of the schemes are so in order.  The remaining three schemes, those referred to in Questions Nos. 357, 359 and 372, do not qualify as small schemes and the council will have to consider proposing these as part of the ordinary sanitary services programme.</P>
