      <NameTxt>Mr. M. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>I intend introducing legislation to combat discrimination in employment, which will include discrimination on grounds of sex in the recruitment, promotion and training of workers.</P>
      <P>I consider this to be an essential supplement to legislation on equal pay.  Indeed, in the circumstances of our society here such legislation is fundamentally important if equality in a real sense is to be achieved.</P>
      <P>The area is, however, a complex one necessitating a great deal of consultation and I do not envisage being able to introduce this legislation before the end of the year at the earliest.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Labour if (a) the Factories Act, 1955, (b) the Office Premises Act, 1958, and (c) the Mines and Quarries Act are satisfactory in the context of the EEC or if they will need updating.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOLeary" hpid="Mr. M. O'Leary Mr. M. O'Leary">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>With your permission, a Cheann Comhairle, I propose to take Questions Nos. 9 and 10 together.</P>
      <P>The legislation mentioned by the Deputy is being examined in detail with a view to formulating proposals for any legislative changes considered necessary in the light of the present and future needs of workers in the matter of safety, health and welfare, including the impact of environmental conditions.  I hope to begin introducing legislation in this area later in the year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>An examination of safety regulations <Col N="936" /> showed that 44 sets of regulations called for revision.  Action was completed on 21 sets and I expect to complete the revision of the remaining 23 sets at an early date.  These regulations cover the safety and health of workers in contact with specified materials or specified processes.</P>
    <P>11.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NoelTLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Labour if he is satisfied that sections 10 and 11 of the Factories Act, 1955, which deal with cleanliness and overcrowding are being generally observed; and the number of prosecutions taken in the period April to September, 1973.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOLeary" hpid="Mr. M. O'Leary Mr. M. O'Leary">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>The inspectors of my Department find that, while the standard of cleanliness varies from time to time and from place to place, the situation in most cases is generally satisfactory.  Where there is room for improvement, the inspectors inform the occupier and keep the matter under observation with a view to ensuring that proper standards are reached and maintained.</P>
      <P>I should, however, mention that section 10 of the Factories Act has presented some problems of detailed enforcement because for the purposes of the Act, a &ldquo;factory&rdquo; can be anything from a shipyard to a film studio.</P>
      <P>With regard to section 11 of the Act, which deals with the allocation of space necessary to ensure that, specifically, health is not at risk because of overcrowding, my inspectors find that the provision is being observed.</P>
      <P>No prosecutions under section 10 or 11 were taken in the six months April to September, 1973.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>The number of applications submitted to the EEC Commission for assistance from the <Col N="937" /> European Social Fund in 1973 was 22.</P>
      <P>The total amount of fund assistance sought in these applications was £5,250,000 in round figures.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes.  We are in the fortunate position that, perhaps, we have done better than other applicant countries in that we obtained the optimum results from the applications we made.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M. O'Leary</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>Having regard to the fact that Germany received something of the order of 34,000,501 units of account from the old social fund in 1973, would the Minister not acknowledge that there is a greater urgency for the Government to promote these fields effectively and properly to the people concerned?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M. O'Leary</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M. O'Leary</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>The Ceann Comhairle will appreciate the importance of the questions.  In respect of the IDA textile retraining applications under article 4, would the Minister inform the House why the amounts sought for 1974-75 are less than the amounts granted for 1973?</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelOLeary" hpid="Mr. M. O'Leary Mr. M. O'Leary">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>The group mainly involved in promoting the advantages of the fund to industry are the Confederation of Irish Industry.  They have expressed themselves satisfied with the amount of cash and the use we are making of the fund so far.  I am not aware of any of the interests &mdash;in the State or in industry&mdash;who are dissatisfied but the Deputy may rest assured that no stone will be left unturned in seeing that every unit of account we can get from the fund will be taken by the Government.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>As I explained to the Deputy, the group dealing with industrial interests are the Confederation of Irish Industry.  They are the agency mainly involved in this kind of work, to assure industrialists of what they may take from the fund. The Deputy is aware that there must be a State subvention in any project that is put before the fund.  The CII express themselves quite happy with the work and the information available.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister <Col N="939" /> agree there is not enough talk about allotting some part of the Social Fund to rural areas?  There has been much talk about the Confederation of Irish Industry but would the Minister agree that the money is relevant also to a purely rural, non-industrial situation?</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelOLeary" hpid="Mr. M. O'Leary Mr. M. O'Leary">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>In my view industrial development does not simply relate to urban needs; it is obviously industrial development around the country on a regional pattern.  That is the intention of the Government in seeking money from the Social Fund.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>I endorse the anxiety of the Deputies opposite to ensure that the fund is fully utilised. We shall continue to see that it is utilised to the full.  I may add that a recent issue of one of the European bulletins referred to the substantial backing this Government received from the fund by contrast with other member countries.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelOLeary" hpid="Mr. M. O'Leary Mr. M. O'Leary">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>As the Deputy is aware, one does not bring nearer the end of a dispute by predicting when it will end; in fact, it may postpone termination of the dispute.  I am not aware accidents have occurred but I am aware it is a serious situation where repair and maintenance of traffic lights in Cork are held up because of a dispute between two unions. The responsible body involved, the Congress of Trade Unions, are attempting to mediate and to see if a solution can be found.</P>

      <P>I might mention that the Government will co-operate closely with the proposal of the Council of Ministers of the EEC to establish an action programme aimed at the humanisation of the living and working conditions of workers.  Indeed, this programme reflects proposals submitted by the Government to the EEC Commission in the matter.</P>
      <P>While we in this country can benefit from an examination of what is happening in other countries, it is essential that the measures we take must be relevant to the Irish social, economic and political situation.</P>

      <P>As indicated in the report of the Industrial Inspectorate for 1972, the survey of noise levels in 908 industrial premises in which 93,985 persons were employed was completed during 1972. It was found that 5,195 workers were exposed to excessive noise levels.</P>
      <P>The medical consultant attached to my Department, whom I appointed last year for a period, for the purposes of the environmental health hazards survey in industry has since been in communication with a number of the firms concerned.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Lands (Mr. T. J. Fitzpatrick,</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>Cavan):</i> I think I have already made my attitude to land bonds perfectly clear.  In my reply to the debate on the Lands Estimate on 18th October last.  I said that, as Minister for Lands, I would fight for as much cash for the purchase of land as the national purse could afford.  In pursuance of that I may say that the question of the use of land bonds to finance the future activities of the Land Commission is at present the subject of a very searching examination in my Department and in the Department of Finance.  Pending the outcome of these deliberations, I think it would be premature for me <Col N="950" /> to make any further statement in the matter.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnCallanan" hpid="Mr. Callanan Mr. Callanan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Callanan</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister seriously consider making land bonds redeemable at par, say three years from date of issue?  The Minister is aware that the greatest objection to land bonds at the moment is that they are not guaranteed and have to go on the stock exchange on chance.  It is like having too many sheep at a fair; everybody wants to sell.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Cavan):</i> As I think I made clear, it would be my ambition to abolish land bonds altogether.  If I succeed in that the suggestion made by the Deputy would not arise.  If the Deputy has in mind applying his proposal to previous issues of land bonds, that would not be possible.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Crowley</NameTxt>
      <P>In view of the immense amount of land that the Minister has under his Department for distribution, would he not consider distributing all this land as quickly as possible and, as a result, he would have a considerable income and would therefore be able to pay cash in the main for any land he would be acquiring?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Cavan):</i> There may be such arguments, but the difficulty will be to reach the existing target.  As the Deputy will probably realise, it is becoming more and more difficult to acquire land for planting. The Department of Lands have never exercised compulsory powers to acquire such land.  It was comparatively easy in the past to acquire the sort of land required, indifferent or bad land, but it is very difficult to find such a thing as bad land at present.  It may very well be that the entire policy in regard to price and compulsory powers and so on, will have to be looked at.</P>

When land is offered to the Department of Lands the policy has been, if there is any doubt as to whether the land would be useful for agricultural purposes as distinct from forestry purposes, that the Land Commission inspectors are asked to have a look at it.  If they advise that the land is suitable for agricultural purposes the Department of Lands pull out in favour of the neighbouring farmer.</P>

      <P>The effect of this section is to adapt all references to &ldquo;financial year&rdquo; or &ldquo;local financial year&rdquo;, which are governed by the Interpretation Act, 1937, or by the earlier Interpretation Acts of 1923 and 1889.  The adaptation has the effect that, in relation to periods occurring after 31st December, 1974, the terms will be construed as references to a period of 12 months commencing on 1st January in each year.  The section also effectively repeals the existing definition in the Interpretation Acts except in so far as they concern periods occurring before 1st January, 1975.</P>

      <P>I would like to ask the Minister if he could elaborate a little on the kind of statutes or statutory instruments to which section 22 of the Interpretation Act of 1889 applies.  I do not want to be out of order by referring to section 3 but the Minister will appreciate that section 3 deals with those to which it does not apply. Could the Minister give us some example of the kind of statutes and statutory instruments to which the Interpretation Act will apply?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Perhaps the best way I could do it would be to explain <Col N="973" /> what the various subsections mean. The first subsection defines the statutes and statutory instruments to which section 2 applies, that is to say statutes and statutory instruments&mdash; whether past or made before or after this Bill&mdash;containing references to &ldquo;financial year&rdquo; or &ldquo;local financial year&rdquo; being references which are defined as meaning a period of 12 months ending on 31st March by the relevant provisions of the various Interpretation Acts.  These provisions are section 22 of the Interpretation Act, 1889, section 5 (1) of the Interpretation Act, 1923, which defines a financial year and paragraph 10 and paragraph 16 of the Schedule to the Interpretation Act, 1937, which define &ldquo;financial year&rdquo; and &ldquo;local financial year&rdquo; respectively.  In statutes passed and instruments, made before the Act of 1889 in the case of &ldquo;financial year&rdquo;, and before the Act of 1937, in respect of &ldquo;the local financial year&rdquo;, the construction of the expressions depends on specific definitions in each case or on the surrounding circumstances.</P>
      <P>Section 3 of the Bill applies to these pre-Interpretation Act references. Subsection (2) provides that references to &ldquo;financial year&rdquo; and &ldquo;local financial year&rdquo; occurring in statutes and statutory instruments, to which this section applies, are, as respects periods occurring after 31st December, 1974, to be taken as references to periods co-extensive with the calendar year.  Thus, the first calendar financial year will commence on 1st January, 1975.  As from that date Government Departments and local authorities will prepare their Estimates and, of course, they will render their accounts on a calendar year basis.  A further consequence is that local rates will be struck and will also be collected on a calendar year basis.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Under subsection (3) of this section the Interpretation Act definitions will continue to apply as regards periods occurring before 1st January, 1975. Under section 4 the period 1st April, 1974, to 31st December, 1974 will constitute a separate transitional period. The effect of these provisions together means that the current financial year, <Col N="974" /> 1973-74, is the last 12 month period under the present dispensation.  It will be followed by a nine month transitional period ending on 31st December, 1974, and thereafter we will enter into another 12 month period, the calendar year of 1975 and each calendar year thereafter.</P>

      <P>I am grateful to the Minister for that explanation.  I would now like to refer him back to a point which I raised on the Second Reading of this Bill which arises in subsection (2) and (3) of this section and, indeed, later in the Bill as well, but we might as well deal with it here.  I refer to the wording which arises, for instance, in subsection (2) in lines 34 and 35 where there is the phrase &ldquo;in relation to after the 31st day of December, 1974&rdquo;.  I am sure the Minister will remember that I raised this point.  It seems to me on the face of it&mdash;I am not saying it is not effective in achieving what the Minister is trying to achieve&mdash;to be a very clumsy form of wording.  It seemed to me it would be more intelligible if it were to include such a phrase that would have it reading &ldquo;in relation to any period commencing after the 31st day of December, 1974&rdquo;.  I would like to have the Minister's comments on that.</P>

      <P>I suppose the draughtsman has used one word instead of three.  That is the first comment I can make.  The second one is that I recall my boyhood days when at school an excellent teacher of English used to chastise us for using phrases like: &ldquo;I am after me dinner&rdquo; and used say that that sounded as if you were chasing your dinner down the street.  He would not permit such a phrase to be used in an English essay.  It is regarded as being precise legal terminology and much safer than using any more extensive phrases which, as Deputy Colley would know as a lawyer, can sometimes give rise to more doubts than a paucity of words.  A paucity of words might be inelegant but sometimes more precise.</P>

Normally the complaint is the other way round.  However, it seems to me that in this case we have at the very least a most inelegant phrase and I would be surprised if the Minister's aesthetic feelings have not been somewhat upset by this wording.  It seems that to say about something &ldquo;in relation to after the 31st day of December&rdquo; is really unforgivable. However, it is not a matter of major moment and if the Minister's aesthetic soul can live with it I suppose mine can too.</P>

The effect of this section is that such references are, as respects periods occurring after 31st December, 1974, to be taken as references to periods co-extensive with a calendar year.

    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 1:</P>
      <P>To add to the section a new subsection as follows:</P>
      <P>(3)  Notwithstanding anything contained in any other enactment, where, by virtue of subsections (1) and (2) of this section, a statute or statutory instrument is construed and deemed to have effect in the way specified in subsection (1) of this section no court decree shall be obtained for non-payment of the second moiety of local or municipal rates and no distress shall be levied against any ratepayer in respect of the same prior to the 15th day of February, 1975.</P>
      <P>I will confess at the outset that I am not entirely happy with this amendment because I can see certain difficulties arising and I have no doubt that the Minister will point out a number of these difficulties.  Nevertheless, I felt obliged to put down the amendment because on the Second Stage discussion I urged the Minister and, indeed, Deputy Callanan did also, to take account of the actual position as distinct from the legal position arising. If I may, I should like to quote a small portion of what I said on the Second Stage which is reported in volume 270 of the Official Report, at column 197:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is difficult certainly on a legal basis but I think it is possible for the Minister or his colleague, the Minister for Local Government, to take special steps to direct local authorities and rate collectors to exercise the discretion they are entitled to exercise in regard to insisting on payment of rates at a particular time.  It would be appropriate in relation to this transitional period that any discretion that can be exercised in the case of ratepayers who are suffering genuine hardship as a result of the changeover, should be exercised on a much <Col N="977" /> wider and, perhaps, more sympathetic scale than is normally possible for local authorities and rate collectors. There is a special problem here for ratepayers and there is no use in trying to blind ourselves to the fact that it does create special problems.</P>
    <P>One could argue on the strict legality of the matter and imagine there is not a problem but there is, in practice, a problem and there will be for a number of ratepayers.  That being so, it behoves the Minister or his colleague the Minister for Local Government in so far as they can do so, to ensure that ratepayers who suffer hardship as a result of this are not harried and hounded by local authorities or rate collectors in the special circumstances which will arise.</P>
    <P>I had hoped that the Minister would review this problem in a realistic and sympathetic way because it is a real problem that can arise for certain ratepayers.  Unfortunately, the Minister in his reply, as reported in the same volume at column 203 said:</P>
    <P>That is the law.  Many people pay them then or within a certain time afterwards.  Indeed rate collectors use many devices to secure early payment because the sooner they receive payment the higher commission they earn.  A large number of people pay their rates earlier than the end of March or December. I accept there is a difficulty as far as the farming community is concerned but the present practice in relation to the farming community is one that has arisen because of consideration in rural areas of the peak periods of income which farmers have.  I do not see any reason for a change in that.  It will be a matter for each local authority to adopt its own procedures for the collection of its own rates.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanTreacy" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Seán Treacy">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>I hesitate to interrupt the Deputy.  Quotations, of course, are in order but very long quotations could hardly be deemed to be in order.  Perhaps the Deputy might be a little more brief when quoting from the Official Report.</P>

    <Col N="978" />
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>I have quoted one paragraph and I propose to quote another half paragraph to establish the point I am trying to make, if I may. I will not be very long on this.  The Minister continued:</P>
      <P>Of course, local authorities, if they do not obtain payment of the rate when it becomes due, are obliged then to resort to borrowing, and borrowing as we know today can be a most costly process.</P>
      <P>The point I want to bring out in this is that there is a real problem and I think the Minister has acknowledged it in that quotation.  It is no answer to the problem simply to stand on the law and to say that that is the law. We know that is the law and we said so on Second Stage.  What we were seeking was for the Minister to undertake in this House, either on his own behalf or on behalf of the Minister for Local Government, that all the discretion which was available within the law could be exercised on a special basis in relation to the transitional period because of the special problems that are arising.  However, from the quotation from the Minister's reply which I have given, it emerges that the Minister was not prepared to give that undertaking but rather was standing on what the law is and then leaving it to the local authorities to do whatever they thought fit.  He did advance the argument, in order to justify this stand that he was taking, that if there were a substantial amount of rates withheld after what would be, with the transitional period, the statutory date for payment, this would mean additional borrowing by the local authority with additional cost to the local authority and, therefore, to the ratepayers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I suggest to the Minister that if this should arise and if there is substantial borrowing necessary by the local authorities for the reasons I have mentioned, then there is a very strong case in these special circumstances for the Exchequer to discharge the cost of that borrowing for the local authorities.  I say that because this transitional period, which is the one <Col N="979" /> that is causing the problem, is not being brought about by the local authorities; it is being brought about by the Minister and by the Government in introducing this Bill.  I am not saying they are wrong in introducing it, but I am saying that when serious problems can arise for ratepayers directly consequent on the action of the Government in promoting this Bill then there is an obligation on the Government, and on the Minister for Finance in particular, to do anything possible to ease the consequences of those changes and the hardships that arise on ratepayers.</P>
    <P>I was prepared on the Second Stage to accept, because of the legal difficulties which are in this context enshrined in this amendment, if the Minister would give a firm undertaking in the House that the Government would give a special direction to local authorities in this matter, that this was probably the best approach to the problem, being flexible and not being tied exactly to the law as it stands. As the Minister knows, even within the law as it stands there are certain powers open to local authorities and rate collectors to give time in certain circumstances to ratepayers who are in difficulty.</P>
    <P>However, the problem that arose for me and for us on this side of the House is that the Minister, although pressed to do so, did not give that undertaking and, consequently, I was left in the position that in order to do anything about it I was obliged to put down this amendment.  I freely concede that there are difficulties in the way of this amendment but I think we would probably have to live with those difficulties rather than allow a situation to obtain in which no different approach would be adopted by local authorities and rate collectors in regard to the problems arising in the transitional period from the approach they would normally adopt in the collection of rates.  There is the difference &mdash;I pointed it out on the previous reading&mdash;that it can easily happen that a number of ratepayers, particularly farmers, will have to pay three moieties of rates in a period of about ten months.  In these circumstances, it <Col N="980" /> is no use standing on the law.  We have got to recognise that these problems exist.  This amendment is an effort to try to meet these problems.  I freely concede it is not the ideal way to meet them but, in the absence of a better suggestion from the Minister, this is at least some approach to it.  It may be, when the Minister is dealing with this amendment, he will give us more assurance than he did last time.  If he does, then I will reconsider the position in regard to this amendment.  I hope the Minister will see that it is very important that a special approach be made to the particular problems arising in the transitional period.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiBrugha" hpid="Ruairí Brugha Ruairí Brugha">
      <NameTxt>Ruairí Brugha</NameTxt>
      <P>I would encourage the Minister to give some consideration to the thinking behind this amendment because he has himself mentioned the question of the law. In the present situation we know that the second moiety is due on the 1st October but, in practice, there are very many cases in which rate collectors have found it good practice to allow the period to be extended.  In fact, in quite a number of cases of which I have knowledge, it was extended as far as the 15th or 20th March but not later.  Again, in practice, what occurs after that is that the collector, or the collecting authority, then moves because it is not desirable that it should go past the financial year's end.</P>
      <P>The situation that can develop here &mdash;to which I think Deputy Colley has been referring&mdash;is that with the change in the financial year moving backwards to 31st December, the great majority of rate collectors and collecting authorities will follow the line the Minister has mentioned, that is, the question of law, and will insist on collection by 31st December.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Reference has been made to the 75 per cent but, with some fairly substantial increases in rent, what many ratepayers will be called upon to pay might be very little less than that for a full year.  If there is not some provision, if the Minister cannot find some way of introducing flexibility for a period&mdash;perhaps for the first two years at the outside, to enable the <Col N="981" /> situation to settle down and enable many concerns to adjust in their own financial situations to paying by 31st December&mdash;it could cause considerable difficulty.  The situation is not one moving from 1st April to 1st June; it is moving backwards from 1st April to 31st December.  I would urge the Minister to consider the introduction of some flexibility into this situation.  It has been discussed by us in a genuine endeavour to reach some sort of workable compromise in the interests of quite a large number of ratepayers.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I thought it might be of assistance if I were to come in and say that the alarm that Deputies have sounded&mdash;and I am quite prepared to accept that it is sincere though I find it hard to accept it&mdash;is without any justification whatsoever. All the discretion of which they speak is available to rate collectors and to local authorities and I have no reason to suspect that in this year rate collectors are going to turn out to be heartless, ruthless, inconsiderate people who will not have regard to the capacity of people to pay at different times of the year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would regard this amendment as a vote of no confidence in local authorities, as a vote of no confidence in local representatives, as a vote of no confidence in the rate collectors. It is most unfair to suggest that there should be any change in the general demeanour and attitude of rate collectors towards ratepayers.  If rate collectors have brought to their attention <Col N="982" /> the problems of particular ratepayers they will allow them to pay by instalments, whatever way is best suited to the ratepayer, or to leave over payment until such time as the cash is at hand.  We believe it would be doing a disservice to ratepayers if we were to try to devise some formula in this legislation which would appear to entitle postponement to a certain date or would appear to impose obligations upon rate collectors to adapt themselves to some new formula.</P>
    <P>Deputy Colley has already recognised that rate collectors have ample discretion as to the manner and rate at which they collect rates.  I think that this is the best way in which to leave it.  We have not left anything to chance in that.  Already the Minister for Local Government has directed the attention of local authorities to the problems which could arise; discussions have taken place throughout the length and breadth of the country with local authorities and their rate collecting departments, urging them to use the discretions which are available to them to ensure that there will be the least possible disturbance in the normal pattern of payment.  I think this is the sensible way in which to do it and not try to tie ourselves into statutory knots which might become very difficult to unravel and which, in the course of tying, might well be an embarrassment to the ratepayers whom I assume Deputy Colley and Deputy Brugha are endeavouring to help.</P>
    <P>I gave an assurance on the last Stage, and I give it again, that the Government are most anxious that the change would not involve any additional difficulty or hardship for anyone.  We want this change to go through smoothly; we believe it can go through smoothly and that the best way to do it is to leave local authorities with all the discretion they have rather than commanding or directing them to do something.  Indeed, as Deputy Colley knows, Ministers have not got power to direct or command local authorities in certain fields.  If we believe in local government then we ought leave the people involved in local government to get about local <Col N="983" /> government with the least possible direction, command or interference from the Dáil.  It is because we have confidence in public representatives and in their capacity to influence their own local councils, to ensure that rate collectors are as considerate in this year as they have always been in the past, that we feel there is no justification for alarm.  We accept that Deputies are justified in expressing their worries in this regard but we would trust that they would have as much faith as we have in the people who are involved in local administration.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnCallanan" hpid="Mr. Callanan Mr. Callanan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Callanan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am afraid the Minister misunderstood the amendment. The Minister stated that we are interfering with local authorities.  The local authorities have to close their accounts this year on December 31st unless one does something which will allow them some kind of a bridging loan until February.  The Minister spoke of rate collectors.  Rate collectors have discretionary power within the limit for collecting rates, but they have no discretion whatsoever to allow a man go beyond the end of the financial year.  They can use what discretion they like during the financial year.  At present it is stated also that rates are due when they are struck, or on demand, but they are usually not demanded until June or July because the demand notes have not been issued.  They have been paid traditionally for years; the good ratepayer paid his rates in September and again in March.  That has been going on for years.  Some people with very small rates might pay the whole lot in November or December.  An odd substantial ratepayer&mdash;who had a bit of spare money&mdash;might oblige the rate collector by giving him the second moiety at Christmas.  But the normal times for collecting rates from the farmer were September and March, September because it was then he sold the grass fed stock and March because it was then he sold the stock he had in feeding for the winter.  Those were the two traditional times for paying rates.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>What we are trying to say is that <Col N="984" /> this year, of all years&mdash;a disastrous year for farming&mdash;the farmer will have to pay the second moiety of his 1973-74 rate in March.  He will get a demand note for 75 per cent according to the Minister.  We have not the final figures for Galway yet, but they will be up substantially even for three-quarters of the year.  He will have to pay a moiety some time in the summer. Unless something is done he will have to close his account before the 31st December.  That means that he will have to pay three moieties in the one year.  No matter how nice the rate collector is, he must close his account at the end of the financial year.  Therefore, he has no authority to give the farmer, or any ratepayer, a longer period than 31st December, 1974.</P>
    <P>The Minister is a Dublin-based man and is not in touch with the country. The other day he said that everybody had more money in his pocket this year than ever before.  If he went down the country he would realise that circumstances for the farmer this year are worse than in any year since the economic war.  Therefore, it is unfortunate that he decided on this year as the year in which to collect the rates in three moieties.</P>
    <P>In our amendment we want to find out if something can be done.  To say that we are trying to take power from the local authorities is to misrepresent us.  Rate collectors have authority to give time within the financial year. When the financial year has passed&mdash; usually 31st March, or this year, 31st December&mdash;if a ratepayer has not paid his rates he is put on the arrears list. Rate collectors are not paid commission on any moneys collected after that date.  Having regard to the peculiar circumstances this year, can the Minister do anything about this?</P>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister, on the Second Stage in the portion of the speech which I quoted earlier, referred to the fact that rate collectors earned commission on rates paid early.  That is not quite precise but I know what he has in mind.  We are asking rate collectors to exercise discretion in the special circumstances of the transitional year, reinforced by the situation described by Deputy Callanan. <Col N="985" /> Are we asking them to forego some of their remuneration in order to assist ratepayers?  If so, we are being unrealistic.  I understood the Minister to say that discussions had taken place with local authorities throughout the country and that they had been urged to exercise as much discretion as possible in this special transitional period.  The Minister is drawing a very fine distinction between what appears to have been done on the instructions of some members of his Government.</P>
      <P>He seemed to think that what we were asking was that local authorities be commanded to do certain things whereas what he described as having been done presumably would not fall into the category of commanding them.  Whatever category he wants to put it into on the basis of what he disclosed as having happened, he has gone very close to what we have asked him to do.  While discussions would be useful it would be even more useful if a letter were to issue to local authorities, presumably from the Minister for Local Government, or maybe the Minister for Finance, specifying that what the Minister said was dealt with in discussions, in other words, urging the local authorities to exercise all the discretion at their command in the special circumstances of the transitional period.</P>
      <P>As I said earlier, it is unrealistic to expect rate collectors to forego part of their remuneration if that is to be a consequence of the special exercise of discretion in this transitional period and, on the face of it, that would appear to be so.  From what the Minister says about the discussions it seems to me that he is getting very close to what we are urging him to do.  Could the Minister elaborate further and assure us that, in addition to the discussions, a letter would issue to this effect?  Then there would be no arguments afterwards in certain local authorities as to what they were urged to do.  This would go a long way to meet the point we are trying to make.</P>

      <P>Rate collectors may leave rates uncollected in a particular financial year as long as they are in a position to show that the rates are <Col N="986" /> temporarily uncollectable, or that they are irrecoverable.  There are many circumstances of different kinds in each year which make it difficult, if not impossible, for them to collect within the year.  Rates are often collected in arrear, as I am sure Deputy Colley being a practising solicitor knows.</P>

      <P>As I said, we have had discussions with local authorities and negotiations have taken place with the rate collectors regarding any variations which might be appropriate <Col N="987" /> this year in relation to their bonuses. We do not want anybody to lose.  We want the transition period to go through as smoothly as possible and with the least difficulty for everybody. I think it is possible to do this and I will ensure that the general intention of this amendment is carried out. What I ask is that it be not pressed.</P>
      <P>Local authorities rarely resort to court proceedings and still less often to execution procedures in order to recover rates.  That shows how humane and considerate the rate collecting departments of local authorities are.  There can be cases where specific circumstances would come to light which would justify the local authorities in issuing proceedings in order to ensure payment of the rates. For instance, in cases where a local authority become aware that a person is about to sell his house, or that a person is in financial difficulties with a lot of creditors forming a queue and ready to pounce it would be prudent and proper for that local authority to protect the general body of ratepayers by seeking court remedies in order to ensure that judgement should be registered for rates long overdue just as in respect of any other debt.  The number of times that would happen in any year in relation to all of the country could probably be counted on one or two hands.</P>
      <P>In my view it would be wrong to provide in the statute a restriction which would prevent a local authority from moving in in a case where clearly it was in the public interest to take court action.  Those are the rare cases and we should not allow the rare cases to make bad law.  We would be making bad law if this amendment were accepted.  The amendment is unnecessary because we have already taken the steps to ensure that the objective is achieved.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like the Minister to inform the House when the discussions he spoke of took place and who was involved in them.  When Wexford County Council, of which I am a member, met on three or four occasions to deal with estimates we were informed by the officials that <Col N="988" /> they had not a clue as to how they would be treated during the coming year in regard to the agricultural grant, the health grant and other State grants.  A 25 per cent reduction in the health charge was promised each year.</P>
      <P>The members of that council questioned the officials about that matter but did not obtain any information. In my view the discussions must have been very poor ones.  When were these discussions held?  Who was involved in them and what county officials attended them?  If instructions were given by the Department of Local Government council officials should be better informed as to what will happen in the coming year.  All we know is that there will be three collections of rates in the coming year, at the end of March, six months later, and a final collection at the end of December.</P>
      <P>If county councils are out a lot of money at the end of December by reason of the change in the financial year their overdrafts will be in a very shaky position.  Has the Minister any intention of relieving that position? Local authorities will find themselves in serious difficulties because there is no possibility of collecting a big percentage of the rates at the end of this present year.  It is essential that during the next two or three weeks we should be made aware of the amount of the State grants so that we can prepare our estimate.  We are not in a position to prepare them from the information available to us.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I understood the Deputy to contradict my interpretation which now appears to be correct. I should like to point out to the Deputy that the income tax year will not be changed and, accordingly, the Deputy's worry should not activate any rate collector at all because, in practice, the income tax year will not expire until 5th April, 1975.  Even if we were not changing this year from the old financial year to the new calendar year the situation would be precisely the same as far as the income tax liability of the rate collector is concerned.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In reply to Deputy Browne, I should like to state that the meeting the people from the Wexford County Council attended was held in Waterford. In common with people from other local authorities there, the representatives of Wexford County Council were advised as to the steps to be taken to ensure the smoothest possible transfer.  This Bill is necessary before final decisions can be taken and when these meetings took place, between October and January last, it was only possible to give general guidelines as to how to make the necessary arrangements in the preparation of this year's estimates, the <Col N="990" /> general conduct of the financial year and the collection of rates.</P>
    <P>When this Bill is passed it will be possible to give more precise information regarding these matters, payments, refunds, and collections, just as the Deputy has in mind.  It is a difficult period.  We are not saying it is not a difficult problem but if we keep postponing making the right decision because of difficulties we are going to have during periods of transition we will never do anything.  If one is to be afraid of change one will not achieve very much in this world.  We believe these changes are necessary. We are going to make the change as smooth as possible and ensure that nobody is any worse off.  If possible we would like to see everybody a little better off.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanBrowne" hpid="Mr. Browne Mr. Browne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>Nobody is afraid of change.  Change is necessary and essential but we know exactly what we have to pay to the various Departments in loan charges and so on. At this stage we have not a clue as to how Departments will deal with us.  It is a simple matter of coming to decisions as far as the various Departments are concerned, particularly the Departments of Health and Local Government.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnCallanan" hpid="Mr. Callanan Mr. Callanan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Callanan</NameTxt>
      <P>We have been asked to strike a rate on assumptions.  Two meetings have already been held in Galway and the final meeting will be held on Monday next to declare our rate but we are going on assumptions. The various local authorities are being asked to prepare their estimates on assumptions.  Apparently it was in order for the Department to assume this Bill would go through and we have to assume the same at county council level.  Therefore, why have the Department not given some indication to the local authorities of what they can expect to receive by way of grants?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Again, I should like to emphasise the position of the rate collectors. These people have salaries with bonuses.  The bonus is given in an effort to get the rate collectors to collect their rates efficiently and speedily.  Any rate collector in my <Col N="991" /> county could lose between £300 and £400 if he lost any of these percentages. In the old days rate collectors were paid a bonus for having collected a certain amount on 30th September, so much by 31st October, for having collected 65 per cent at the end of December and for having collected 95 per cent at the 31st March.  Rate collectors cannot be blamed for trying to achieve these targets and there is no use us asking anybody to lose money.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesCTunney" hpid="Mr. Tunney Mr. Tunney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tunney</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to add my voice to what has been said already.  However, unlike rural Deputies, who have based their case on the situation in respect of farmers, which is not very favourable, I would be concerned with the question of city dwellers, who are accustomed to dealing with their rates problem at certain times of the year.  Without studying the situation, a city dweller nowadays assumes from reading his paper that there will be a reduction in rates; but he will now find that at Christmas time, in addition to all the expenses associated with that season and notwithstanding the unfavourable economic conditions prevailing, he will be faced with his rates bill.  While we here may say we are familiar with the situation, the rank and file are outside, and no doubt in Dublin city there will be thousands of people who in December will not be able to meet this new demand to be made on them at that time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I anticipate from the Minister his acceptance of the inevitability of there being problems at that stage.  I am not too happy with his reminding us of the powers vested in the rate collector in the matter of extending the time for payment.  I detected from that that while the citizen may be satisfied with the extensions which rate collectors have been applying to date, we all know that those extensions have been very limited.  Perhaps it would be better to indicate precisely that there will be the time extension that has been requested in respect of this year. That would help to avoid the consternation which otherwise will prevail <Col N="992" /> next Christmas&mdash;not consternation in the sense that rates will not be paid but in the sense that there will be no Santa Claus visiting homes and that the customary purchases of that season will have to be foregone.  We should indicate now that, in respect of this year at least, the final moiety will be collected at some point removed from the Christmas season.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>I imagine that by now the Minister knows there are potentially serious problems involved in this matter.  In moving this amendment I said I was aware that this was not the most satisfactory way of dealing with the question.  I am aware of problems which could arise as a result of the amendment being incorporated in the Bill but I explained that I had tabled the amendment because I was not satisfied on Second Reading that the Minister had met the points we had made in a way that would give some reassurance to the effect that a sympathetic and understanding approach would be adopted towards ratepayers who, through no fault of their own but as a direct consequence of this Bill, might find themselves in difficulties.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the course of the discussion on this amendment the Minister has gone a good deal further than he went on Second Stage and has told us about discussions that have taken place with local authorities.  I am not sure whether those discussions were conducted by his Department or by the Department of Local Government but from something he said it appeared that what was involved was the discussion of the kinds of administrative problems that would arise.  It was not quite so clear that any great emphasis would have been placed in those discussions on the point we are making here, which is that there should be an understanding approach to the problems which are arising directly as a consequence of this transitional period. The Minister has undertaken, if I have understood him correctly, to convey to the Minister for Local Government our very strong suggestion that there ought to be communication in writing to each local authority <Col N="993" /> urging them to use the maximum discretion possible in dealing with the special problems arising in the transitional period.  In the light of that undertaking by the Minister I am prepared not to press the amendment, an amendment which, I realise, could create problems of its own.</P>
    <P>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 2.</P>
      <P>To add to the section a new subsection as follows:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(4) Notwithstanding anything contained in any other enactment the local or municipal rates payable in respect of any property for the period from the 1st day of April, 1974 to the 31st day of December, 1974 shall not exceed 75 per cent of the local or municipal rates payable in respect of the same property for the period from the 1st day of April, 1973 to the 31st day of March, 1974 provided that the rateable valuation of such property shall not have been altered for the duration of the period from the 1st day of April, 1974 to the 31st day of December, 1974.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>The purpose of this amendment is to ensure that the rates charged during the nine-month transitional period from the 1st April to the 31st December next will not exceed 75 per cent of the rates charged in the present financial year on any rateable hereditament in respect of which there has not been a change in valuation. In substance, that is what the amendment is all about.</P>
      <P>One of the reasons why this amendment is down is that on Second Reading we sought from the Minister clarification in regard to what the Government proposed to do on the question of the relief of health charges and loan charges for local authorities during this transitional period.  I think I am right in saying that in regard to health charges the Minister said there would be an announcement on this before the end of this month.  I do not think he said anything specific in regard to the other charges.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Col N="994" />
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Which charges?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister said there would be an announcement on health charges but we have heard nothing specific in regard to loan charges.  There is some evidence to suggest that loan charges on local authorities might, during the nine-month period, be in respect of a 12-month period of repayment.  That is something of which we would disapprove. I understood the Minister to say that it was not his intention that it should work out that way and I would assume that if this amendment were accepted it would not be possible to do it that way.  Our main concern is to ensure that when the rates for the transitional period are being charged they would not exceed 75 per cent of the rates chargeable for the previous 12-month period since they are only for a nine-month period.</P>
      <P>Having regard to what the Government have said they would do in regard to a reduction in health charges and in certain charges in connection with housing on the rates for local authorities, it seems to me that if the Government do what they have said this will provide the necessary elbow room for local authorities to enable them to meet the necessarily increased charges they will be facing in other areas.</P>
      <P>On the last occasion I referred to the temptation that must exist for some local authorities when striking a rate for a nine-month period to take the opportunity to impose certain higher charges than they would otherwise do if there were a clear comparison between what they are doing now and what they did last year.  On consideration of this matter it seemed to me that in order to ensure this would not happen and that ratepayers would not find themselves paying what would amount to a 12-month charge for a nine-month period, the best way to ensure that was to provide in the legislation, as is suggested in this amendment, that the charge for nine months should not exceed 75 per cent of the charge for the previous 12 months.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="995" /> That allows room for inflation in other charges, taking account of what the Government have said they will do with regard to relieving rates of health and certain housing charges. That being so, I hope the Government will see no objection to this amendment. I hope they will accept it, so that ratepayers throughout the country can rest assured they will not be misled or charged a great deal more during the nine-months transitional period than they would be entitled to expect, having regard to the fact that it is only a nine-months period and not a full year.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>There are two reasons why we find the amendment is not acceptable.  I am sure the first is not one that Deputy Colley intended, but the amendment would have the effect of absolutely prohibiting any local authority from making their own determination regarding the type of services they wanted to provide for their own people.  For instance, if they wanted to improve parks or facilities for youth clubs, it would prevent them from striking a rate to meet those services because the effect of this amendment would be to freeze all local authorities and take from them one of the few powers they have, namely, the power to decide what rate they want to strike to meet the services required by their local communities.</P>
      <P>The second reason is that the amendment is not necessary to achieve what the Government have in mind, and which we have reiterated on a number of occasions.  In a nine-month period local authorities should have to meet only three-quarters of a 12-month bill.  The local authorities will be striking a rate to cover services for nine months, no more and no less. We have said this very clearly to local authorities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We said we would be announcing this month the position in relation to the transfer of the cost of health services and local authority housing from local funds to the central Exchequer. The Minister for Local Government has already notified local authorities that instead of having to <Col N="996" /> bear 50 per cent of the 1972-73 charges which they would have had to bear if operating on a 12-month basis, for the nine months they should consider themselves liable for 37½ per cent instead of 50 per cent, namely, three-quarters of what they would otherwise have had to pay.  In fact, they would have a lesser sum to pay in the nine-month period than if they were in the 12-month period.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">

    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>It is in respect of health and housing, taking the 1972-73 liability which lay on local authorities to meet those items.  Last year by virtue of the State taking on 25 per cent, the local authorities had to pay 75 per cent in the 12-month period.  In the next period which will be nine months, instead of paying 50 per cent of the 1972-73 sum they will levy for 37½ per cent which will be the appropriate sum for nine months.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Perhaps the Deputy is not aware that now there are calendar watches.  However, if he keeps an eye on us he will learn how to go modern and be with and ahead of the times.  With regard to loan charges, those charges which would have to be met by the local authorities are being considerably reduced because the central Exchequer is absorbing the immense liability which formerly lay on local authorities.  I refer in particular to housing charges. Therefore, this burden is not as serious as it was a year ago or as <Col N="997" /> it might have been if the Government had not been changed.</P>
      <P>So far as local authorities are concerned, in respect of housing loans they get contributions from those who are making repayments to them by regular instalments so that they do not have to run up a considerable debit. If there is a debit at the end of the year, there is no reason why local authorities should not carry it into 1975.  There is no necessity for all of it to be collected before 31st December, 1974.  Accordingly, we cannot see there is a need to accept Deputy Colley's amendment.  I am sure the Deputy will accept from me that it would be an impertinence for the Dáil to tell local authorities that they might not strike a rate next year which they did not strike the previous year.  That would be tying the hands of local councillors and would prevent them from exercising one of the few freedoms or rights they have, namely, the right to strike a rate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>Unless the Minister can explain more precisely what he meant by his first reason I cannot accept his argument.  On the face of it, it does not seem to me that this amendment ties the hands of a local authority to any extent more than confining them to 75 per cent of the rate struck for the previous 12 months&mdash;that is, for the current year.  So far as they are confined to that, this means that with the Government reducing the liability of rates for health and housing charges, to that extent the local authorities have that much room to manoeuvre.  The only limitation proposed in this amendment is that the overall total should not exceed 75 per cent of the previous 12 months rates.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Therefore, there is no restriction in any way on a local authority improving their services with regard to parks or anything else except the limitation that the overall total would not exceed 75 per cent of the amount charged for the previous 12 months.  I believe this is no infringement on local authorities.  I think it is very much in the interests of the ratepayers throughout the country that they would be assured that this House has provided, in relation to the transitional period, <Col N="998" /> that whatever rate bill they get will not exceed 75 per cent of the amount charged for the previous 12 months. According to the Minister the Government are reducing the charges on the rates and this leaves the local authority considerable room to manoeuvre. It also ensures that ratepayers will not be compelled to pay more for the nine months' period than would reasonably be thought to be necessary for that nine months' period.</P>
    <P>In so far as any major improvement in services is contemplated by the local authorities, there is a lot to be said for ensuring that such a major improvement is not embarked upon during the transitional period. Ordinary improvements to services, yes, but the transitional period is not the time to do it because it can mislead the ratepayers if a major expansion of local authority services is embarked on during the transitional period.  If only nine months of the cost are involved, it will not be clear to ratepayers the full extent of the liability which will fall on them thereafter. Most ratepayers would be grateful to the House if it were to enact this amendment and would regard it as a reasonable protection of their interests in the special circumstances of the transitional period.</P>

      <P>What Deputy Colley has said should be borne in mind by the Minister.  There may well be a temptation to go on a spending spree because a lower rate will have been announced.  One of the biggest items which has come before Dublin Corporation so far in the estimates we have been looking at is the increase in wages and salaries.  The prices of fuel, oil and electricity have increased vastly and it has been estimated that there will be considerably greater increases by the end of the year.  This will tend to eat up quite a proportion of the supposed 25 per cent saving. The Minister should give some undertaking that he will protect the ratepayers from the excessive rate burdens they will have to face this year and next year.  It will amount to an enormous sum which they will not be able to pay, in my view.  I should like the Minister to bear that in mind.</P>

      <P>Deputy Briscoe has put his finger on the problem.  There are massive increases in charges which have to be borne by local authorities the same as every other person in this State by reason of world commodity prices and so forth.  There are increases in wages in the pipeline and local authorities will have to meet them.  To accept the amendment would be, in fact, to say that we ought to impose a wage freeze order on the local authorities, that we should say to local authorities: &ldquo;You shall not buy oil.  You shall not consume electricity beyond the cost of what you consumed last year.&rdquo;  That is not on.</P>
      <P>It is not responsible to say to any Government: &ldquo;You will have to pay everybody else's bill.&rdquo;  This Government, no more than any other democratic Government in the world, have not got a pipeline into some wonderful Central Bank of the World with unlimited money that can be pumped into it and come out at the far end like oil.  It is just not on.  Any Government's revenue is only as good as the revenue they collect from their citizens.  There seems to be little point in suggesting in an amendment like this that we ought to put a freeze on local authorities to stop them spending any more money than they need for a continuation of the existing services or the improvement of the services.</P>
      <P>If the local representatives decide that the local services should be improved it is not for us in Dáil Éireann to say: &ldquo;No, you will not improve them.&rdquo;  If there is anybody in this House who believes that we should kill local government, that we should abolish every local authority, I would ask that person to stand up and declare his or her attitude here before the public.  In essence that is what this amendment is suggesting.  Local authorities would be deprived of the one discretion they have, the one power they have, that is, to strike the rate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We hope that, as happened last year by reason of the central Exchequer taking over a large section of the rates liability, the rates in a number of local authority areas, if not all, <Col N="1000" /> will go down.  It is up to the local representatives to do their duty and, if local representatives decide to be slick this year and try to jump in with a few pet schemes of their own and charge them on the rates in the hope that the ratepayers will not see what they are up to, I feel certain that the media in the public interest will identify what the local representatives are up to and, when the local elections are held, if the people do not approve of what is being done they will turn their rightful indignation against those people who acted in a way which they regarded as being contrary to their wishes.  The question is: do we believe in local government or do we not?  If we believe in local government we must leave the discretion to the local authorities.  If we want to take it away from them, let us do it openly and boldly.  Fianna Fáil did it when they abolished Dublin Corporation.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Briscoe</NameTxt>
      <P>I resent very much the Minister's attempt deliberately to misrepresent what is being said and what is in this amendment.  The amount of money being spent on improvements is minimal in relation to the other increases with which the local authorities are being faced.  The number of improvements is way below what everyone would desire.  Every councillor of every party is conscious of the fact that this costs money.  I do not think it is fair for the Minister to suggest that, because members of this party propose that the central Exchequer should take over the payment of, say, rates on private dwellings, <Col N="1001" /> this is, in fact, saying that local authorities should be abolished.</P>
      <P>He referred to Fianna Fáil abolishing Dublin Corporation but he did not pay any attention to the fact that his own party did that in 1924 when they suspended Dublin Corporation for six years for a similar offence, as it were, of not striking an adequate rate.  Our party believe in local authorities. We believe in the powers of local authorities.  Any improvements suggested this year are minimal in cost as well as everything else.  The major proportion of any increase in cost is due to the inflationary situation in which we find ourselves.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesCTunney" hpid="Mr. Tunney Mr. Tunney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tunney</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister did not find it possible to accept the other amendment but he should accept that because of this extraordinary change which is occurring for the ratepayer, the ratepayer is entitled to some consideration. The Minister may endeavour to bring what I regard as irrelevant considerations into this.  He can attempt to accuse Members on this side of the House of not having due regard for the local authorities.  I would say out straight to him that my regard for the individual person, my regard for the ratepayer, is superior to that which I hold for any local authority.  If the Minister wants to put any twist on that he is entitled to do so.  It should be the responsibility of every Member of the House to show his concern for that person.</P>
      <P>It is not very long since the Minister was in the forefront of those who would claim that the ratepayer could no longer bear the burdens that fell upon him in the matter of this special taxation.  This year we have a complete innovation in the payment of rates.  The Minister has refused the request in the previous amendment to allow one month's grace and now he is not prepared in respect of one nine-month period to guarantee the ratepayers, who are already finding it difficult to make ends meet, that wherever the balance of the money required to pay for these services will be raised the ratepayers will not be required to pay any more than was appropriate in respect of the year that has passed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1002" /> It is not too much to ask that the Minister should examine areas open to him to make it possible to give the ratepayers this guarantee.  I can speak on behalf of the same type of constituent that the Minister has the honour to represent and we know that in Dublin at present there is emerging a new poor class, the rate-paying public.  Apart from cost of living increases and increases which we understand are yet to come, the least we might do is to assure the ratepayer that when the end of the year arrives he will not have been asked to pay any more in rates than was required in the preceding year.  In view of the fact that the Minister refused to accept the previous amendment, if he has any genuine interest in the ratepayer, he should accept this one.  Let him forget about this anonymous, bureaucratic local authority.  All the institutions in the country exist in the interests of the individual citizens and the sooner we realise that we must give some control to the individual over these terrible institutions which exercise so much control over the citizens, the better.  I am not hesitant in suggesting that whatever case can be made for local authorities not being able to supply or provide community halls or playing pitches, however desirable these may be, my concern in respect of this crisis year is that the ratepayers of Dublin will not be put into the position of having to sell their houses to pay their rates.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dowling</NameTxt>
      <P>This has been a very enlightening debate for me especially. Like previous speakers, I think this is a very acceptable amendment and that it should be written into the legislation.  I do not accept the word of some Ministers.  In relation to another matter recently, the question of the claw-back of children's allowances, the Taoiseach said one thing and the cabin boy and mutinous crew said another thing.  A directive was issued by the Department of Finance on that occasion that the allowance be clawed back in full on a particular day but the Taoiseach on another occasion indicated that this was not so, that there was flexibility.  One cannot rely on the word of some Members <Col N="1003" /> of the present Government in the House.  For that reason it is necessary to have this provision embodied in legislation.</P>
      <P>I would tell the Minister for Finance that any suggestion of a wage freeze for local authority personnel will be resisted here and throughout the country.  If that is a kite the Minister is flying, indicating a wage freeze on local authority workers, it will not be tolerated. Apparently, this is something the Minister has in mind.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dowling</NameTxt>
      <P>Another fact that came to light was the Minister's suggestion that if a local authority representative suggested an improvement, the media should take up the matter and spotlight it to ensure that this irresponsible action of an irresponsible person was seen for what it was.  It is desirable and necessary that local authority services throughout the country be improved and our members will continue to press for improvements.  We are not concerned whether the media, the Minister, or anybody else points to this as irresponsibility.  We feel we have responsibility to the people we represent to ensure improvements in <Col N="1004" /> the services.  I am rather amazed that the Minister for Finance indicated that to suggest improvements was irresponsible and that the media should continue to expose people who make such suggestions.  This anti-improvement mentality is something new because when the Minister was a member of Dublin Corporation he made suggestions for improvements&mdash; and rightly so&mdash;and some were carried out; some were not; but when he is in Government, to suggest this is irresponsible is something that makes me think.  It is now clear that the Government will not allow any improvements in local authorities in the coming year.  That is an irresponsible attitude and our members will press where necessary to ensure that improvements will take place.</P>
      <P>It was very enlightening to hear the Minister suggest that Dublin Corporation was abolished some time ago.  It was abolished and the Minister was one of those responsible for its abolition because of his suggestion that Dublin Corporation should not meet in full its responsibility in regard to the rates.  Rates must be paid to provide for the services that are necessary.  The Minister at one stage suggested that the corporation should not strike a rate.  I wonder what would be his reaction now if Members of the House and of the local authority suggested Dublin Corporation should not strike a rate to meet their responsibility for various services. The Minister went on to state that the local authorities should have regard to the wishes of the community in relation to local responsibility&mdash;and rightly so.</P>
      <P>We always have had that point of view.  To suggest that we were responsible for the abolition of Dublin Corporation is complete nonsense and the Minister knows it.  It was he, his party and his colleagues in the Labour Party who were responsible for their abolition.  In relation to a statement made by the Minister yesterday&mdash;&mdash;</P>

Anything more than £1 in the £ rates which ratepayers would have to pay next year should be met by the Exchequer.  Anything over and above 75 per cent of last year's rates should be made good by the Exchequer. I do not wish to delay the House but I would remind Deputies again that the last year has been disastrous for the farmers and I cannot afford to pay three moieties of rates in one year.  That is why we insist that the Exchequer meet 75 per cent of extra rates, and that is why we put down this amendment.  In an emergency year such as this the Exchequer should come in to help.</P>

      <P>It seems Fianna Fáil are talking with Ard-Fheis hyperbole. It is interesting to hear what they are saying now and to anticipate what they will say after 6 o'clock during Private Members time.  They are now trying to add considerable, according to their own assessments, to the money they would spend on local authorities &mdash;they want to add considerably to the Exchequer expenditure next year. At the same time, they are looking for reductions in income tax.  They cannot have it both ways and I would suggest that they retire and make up their minds on what precisely they want to do.  They should not be coming in here pretending that they can add vastly to the central expenditure and at the same time give massive tax reduction.  I was interested in what Deputy Callanan had to say.  He put his finger on what Deputy Dowling was suggesting.  Deputy Dowling never disappoints.  One always expects a certain standard from him.  He never departs from it&mdash;he always lives up to it.  I suppose he is Fianna Fáil's successor to Martin Corry.  One can always get a laugh but one would expect a little more responsibility from a Deputy.  What led to the abolition of Dublin Corporation was a breach of a promise, to which Deputy Callanan referred.  It was a promise to protect local authorities against any increases in health charge, and it was because of a failure to live up to that promise&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>On the Fianna Fáil suggestion thrown up here today about the abolition of rates, it is time people knew that the suggestion was coupled with a Fianna Fáil plan to impose a new property tax at Government level which would have been far above any relief given to the owners and occupiers of private residences.  One can say a rose by any other name would smell as sweet, but when it is covered with the thorns of a new central taxation, a property tax which Fianna Fáil would have imposed, it is quite clear that the ratepayers would have been saddled with a new punitive and inescapable tax.

      <P>The effect of the Fianna Fáil amendment would be to impose a wage freeze on all local authority employees.  It would also lead to dismissals because of the increased costs local authorities would have to meet&mdash;this pattern has been going on ever since local authorities came into being in this country&mdash;and it would also mean a running down of services.  What we in Government have said is that the rates for next year for the nine months period should be the appropriate rates for three-quarters of 12 months.  That is the fairest way of doing it and that is the correct way of doing it, not trying to relate the expenses of local authorities in the next nine months to expenses which were applicable in the financial year 1973-74.  The truth is that there is little reality in the Fianna Fáil amendment, and I would ask the Members opposite to withdraw it now.  They have made their point. I think they are quite right to underline the necessity for every local authority not to collect any more than nine months' rates in a nine months' period.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In so far as it is within our power in Government we shall ensure that this is done.  If we see any local authorities abusing the nine-months' period by trying to jack up the rates to meet some scheme or some new expenditure which has not been properly identified to the public, we shall see that the public are made aware of what any particular local authority or local representative is doing.  Deputy Dowling seemed to think that was a threat.  I do not think it is.  I believe in full and frank democracy, and it is because I believe in real democracy that I believe in democracy at local level, where the local representative who wants a better service has to justify it to his own people, because it will be quickly pointed out to any local authority what will be the cost of any local service.  It is when you try to tuck things away in the Central Exchequer that it becomes more and more difficult for the ratepayer and the taxpayer to find out who is imposing <Col N="1009" /> the charge.  We believe in local democracy.  This Bill proposes to keep everything as simple as it is at the moment, and all we have had in the course of this debate is an attempt by the Members opposite to multiply the complexities of the problem.</P>

He talked about the poor, overburdened taxpayer. Everybody agrees the taxpayer is overburdened, but at least he is taxed on his ability to pay, whereas the ratepayer is not taxed on his ability to pay.  What we are asking is that if there is an excess of expenditure the Exchequer should meet it, and the Minister should come straight out and say that the Exchequer will meet it or that it is not able to meet it. He should not be playing two games. He played one game when he was on Dublin Corporation and was urging his fellow councillors not to strike an adequate rate; now he is urging them, <Col N="1010" /> as it is a Coalition-dominated council in any case, to strike the rate when it comes up.  The Minister is being most dishonest in his arguments and in his reply to these amendments, and is very unfair in his criticism.</P>

      <P>I just want briefly to reply.  We have, by virtue of the decisions of this Government, already taken on about £14 million which used to lie on the local ratepayers, and for the year 1974, between the various reliefs we are giving, we are taking on to the Exchequer about £27 million.  This will go on, so that by the time the programme of transfer of burdens from rates to the Central Exchequer is completed, we shall have on the Central Exchequer £75 million. We believe that is of massive assistance to the ratepayers, and the ratepayers realise this and do not think it is prudent now that we should add further to the burden of the Central Exchequer in respect of a proposal here which would, as it were, remove all responsibility from local authorities for the fixing of the rates.  Deputy Briscoe is a member of Dublin Corporation and I think at heart he wants some power to be left to the local authorities.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>I move:</P>
      <P>That Dáil Éireann, in view of the inflation now raging in the economy and the consequent hardship being inflicted on most income tax payers and in particular on those with very low incomes who were never intended to be subject to income tax, calls on the Government to increase substantially the personal, earned income, marriage, child and age allowances under the income tax code and to provide by legislation that, thereafter, such allowances will be adjusted annually in relation to movements in the cost of living index.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This is a motion which, as you know, Sir, under our Standing Orders, would normally have come before the House last week; but the Government, for reasons best known to themselves, decided on two occasions last week to propose and vote that this motion should not be discussed by this House then.  I would point out that this motion was put down by me <Col N="1013" /> during the Christmas Recess and before the rejection of the national pay agreement.  We know that there are further proposals now under consideration. However, the proposals which were rejected would, I think, have been a great deal more attractive to most of the workers if prior to their voting on them this motion had been either discussed or an indication given by the Government of their acceptance at least of the principle behind this motion.</P>
    <P>It is rather sad that the Government found it necessary to play politics with this motion, as they did last week, and then to come along today and hold a meeting with the Irish Congress of Trade Unions and subsequently with the Irish Employers' Confederation&mdash;a very brief meeting in each case&mdash;during the course of which the Taoiseach informed those parties that the Government proposed to do precisely what they are called on to do in this motion.</P>
    <P>I believe if the Government, before the voting took place on the Employer-Labour Conference for terms of a national agreement, had approached this problem on the basis on which they are now proposing to do so and on the basis urged in this motion, it might well be that the proposals would have been acceptable. But, for reasons best known to themselves, the Government decided not to do that.  It was clear to most people, if not to the Government, that it was essential that the Government should take action if the national pay agreement were to be accepted.  The action open to them substantially lay in the field of personal taxation.</P>
    <P>I do not profess to understand why it was not possible for the Government a short time ago to make the announcement they made today.  It is reprehensible that last week, when this motion was due to come before the House, the Government should on two occasions vote it down and then announce today that they proposed to do precisely what they are called on to do in this motion.  It may be that the Minister will have a satisfactory explanation for that conduct by the Government; but in the absence <Col N="1014" /> of such an explanation people can only conclude that the Government were playing party politics, not just with this motion but with the whole prospect of a national pay agreement, an agreement which the Government profess to regard as being of vital importance to our economy.  Certainly that is a view we take, and our actions in government and indeed in opposition have confirmed that that is our attitude.</P>
    <P>It is, however, of some satisfaction to us that our motion has finally wrung out of the Government the statement issued today to the effect that the Government propose in the forthcoming budget to announce increases in income tax personal allowances to commence on the 6th April next and also to provide, as is called for in the motion, that these increases will mark the first step in a policy towards reviewing the personal allowances regularly and at frequent intervals.  That is from the statement issued by the Government Information Services today.  It does not go as far as this motion goes, but at least it is a step in the right direction.  It does show that the Government, despite their mishandling of this situation, are learning something.</P>
    <P>It is difficult to discuss this motion while ignoring the context of the national pay agreement but in that context I believe that the Government statement, while it is welcome, should, if it is possible at all, be firmed up by the Minister in his contribution to this debate.  All the indications are that in the absence of a very firm commitment by the Government the new proposals for a national pay agreement will not be accepted.  You will have noted, Sir, that having refused to give Private Members' time under Standing Orders for this motion the Government then, in the name of the Minister for Finance, put down an amendment.  That amendment, of course, is an attempt to justify the Government's inaction in this field in the last budget by suggesting that the previous Government were inactive in this field.  It is merely a smokescreen behind which the Government are trying to hide.  If the Government believe what is in the amendment, and I propose <Col N="1015" /> to show that the considerations that applied in the past are not by any means the same as those which apply today, that is that the previous Government failed to increase income tax allowances adequately in accordance with the fall in the value of money, if that is so then this merely highlights the failure of the present Government when they assumed office and brought in their budget to do anything about it.  I would remind you, Sir, that in the last budget brought in by this Government, new increased rates of taxation were imposed on almost everything you can think of and an absolutely record amount of new taxation was imposed.  I am not even talking about the yield, which is greater than was estimated but even on the estimate submitted by the Minister it was historically high.  I believe that that approach was economically unsound, to say the least, but at least one could expect that in circumstances of that kind the Government would have seen to it that income tax allowances would have been substantially increased.  There are a number of reasons for this&mdash; firstly, because social justice would have required it and, secondly, because the Government were increasing VAT rates as well as everything else.  Remember, you pay the same VAT rate whether you are rich or poor.</P>
    <P>Therefore, the Government, in a context of vastly increased taxation, should have increased the income tax allowances in order to assist those who were being hardest hit by the new taxation being imposed.  Furthermore, in the context of an increasing rate of inflation and the desire to achieve a national pay agreement it was essential for the Government, if they wanted to create the climate in which a national agreement would be acceptable, to make these further concessions in income tax allowances. They did not do so.  All that was done in this Government's budget in relation to income tax was to increase from a maximum of £74 to £104 the wife's earned income relief at a cost, in the present financial year, of half a million pounds.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1016" /> Whatever the Minister may have to say in the course of his contribution to this debate about failure by previous Governments to adjust income tax allowances, he cannot gainsay the fact that in a previous budget in 1972, when for very sound economic reasons no new taxation whatever was imposed by the Government then in office, they managed to provide more relief in expansion of social welfare services in that year than was done under the extraordinarily high taxation imposed in this year's budget. More was done in that year than in this year if one excludes EEC money but at the same time, the following increased allowances were given in income tax.  Personal allowances were increased in respect of the single and widows allowance by £50 to £299 and £324 respectively and the marriage allowance was increased by £70 to £494.  The child allowances were increased by £20 each.  This took approximately 50,000 taxpayers from the income tax net and reduced the income tax bill for a single person by £17.50 a year, a married man with no children by £24.50 a year and a married man with four children by £1 a week.  That cost £11 million in that year.  In addition, the age relief for persons of 65 or over was raised by £25 for single and widowed people and by £50 for married persons. A special increase in child allowance for the incapacitated of £50 was introduced and the upper limit of £500 on non-reimbursed medical expenses for each person was abolished. There was no upper limit thereafter.</P>
    <P>Therefore, in so far as the Minister wants to make any case about the past, he must remember that to the extent that his case is valid he is simply making a case to show what he should have done in his budget and failed to do it.  However, if any comparisons are to be made it is far more valid to compare the budget of 1972 with the budget of 1973 because the circumstances of those, while not the same, were quite similar, far more similar, say, than the budgets of 1957, 1958 and 1959 to which the Minister refers in his motion.  The comparison between the budgets of <Col N="1017" /> 1973 and 1972 is startling where one finds on the one hand enormously increased taxation and virtually no relief in income tax and on the other hand in 1972 no increased taxation and fairly substantial relief in income tax apart from social welfare.</P>
    <P>I suggest that the Minister's amendment takes no account of such things as the fact that the country is now much wealthier than it was in the 1950s, that inflation is now running at an historically high rate and all the indications are that it is going to go considerably higher.  Furthermore, from the Minister's point of view, there is now a broad tax base available which was not available in the past. I am sure the Minister is well aware of the problems which faced Ministers for Finance in the past, where there was an undue reliance on what are known as the old reliables&mdash;beer, tobacco, spirits and taxes.</P>
    <P>As a general approach to the whole problem of taxation, Fianna Fáil broadened the base by introducing turnover and wholesale tax and, ultimately, value-added tax.  The result is that the base of tax for the Exchequer is now so broad&mdash;and, indeed, was increased substantially by the present Minister in his last budget&mdash;that there is no comparison between the situation which faces the Minister for Finance today and that which faced Ministers for Finance in recent years.  The present Minister has, ready made, this broad base of tax which provides him with a substantial amount of revenue that would not otherwise be available and a revenue which is related directly to the degree of inflation in the economy.</P>
    <P>I do not know&mdash;and the Minister does not know&mdash;at the moment what the out-turn will be in the current year in regard to value-added tax.  But the figures available at the moment seem to show that, from April to December of 1973, value-added tax brought in £96 million : the budget Estimate for the whole year was £116 million.  Consequently, whereas&mdash;on the basis of the estimates&mdash;75 per cent of value-added tax for the whole year should have come in by the end of December, in fact, 83 per cent only <Col N="1018" /> had come in.  That would suggest a gain to the Exchequer in the region of 8 per cent.  The odds are that that will go considerably higher before the end of the financial year.  But I cannot say that with certainty and neither can the Minister.  Nevertheless, what is clear is that the receipts from value-added tax are considerably higher than the Minister estimated, and he estimated them reasonably generously having regard to the commitments he was entering into in the budget.</P>
    <P>Apart from the broad base provided&mdash;a base which is related directly to the inflationary situation&mdash; the fact is that, with the degree of wage and salary increases which have taken place and are likely to take place now, relief from income tax under the headings we have sought in this motion can result in virtually no cost to the Exchequer.  For instance, it is reasonable, I think, to estimate that, in relation to the terms of the proposed national agreement&mdash; if they are accepted&mdash;between one tax and another, 30 per cent will come back to the Exchequer.</P>
    <P>Therefore, there is quite a difference between the situation now and that which obtained in the past.  I would remind the Minister, since he wants to go considerably far back in his amendment&mdash;I think the public would prefer that he dealt with the present situation and what is looming up&mdash;that when we took over Government in 1957, which is the year to which he refers in his amendment, we found the country a considerably poorer place than it is now, and that the overall strength of the economy is now quite different, apart from the factors to which I have already referred.</P>
    <P>The great difficulty in the past was the enormous cost to the Exchequer of granting income tax relief.  I tried to point out that that problem is by no means as great today as it was in the past, for the reasons I have outlined. Indeed, I think the actions which the previous Government took in the 1972 budget will bear that out; that we were able, without any increase in taxation, to give the substantial <Col N="1019" /> income tax relief I detailed earlier.  From the point of view of the Minister, that position has improved even further since then.  That being so, there is less excuse for the Minister than for any predecessor of his failing to give these reliefs&mdash;which he did fail to do in his budget and of which he failed to give any indication until we dragged it out of him with this motion which he tried to prevent being discussed last week.</P>
    <P>I would remind the Minister, if he needs reminding&mdash;I am never too sure just how far the Minister, like his colleagues, has lost contact with the people; I rather suspect from some things that happen that the loss is somewhat substantial&mdash;how people feel at the present time about these income tax allowances.  In case he does not know I want to tell him there is no single factor about which people feel a greater sense of grievance than the present income tax allowances. I want to tell him, too, that I believe that apart from the question of social justice, from the point of view of stability in this State, it is vital that adequate allowances be given in income tax under the headings we have sought in this motion; that is the personal, earned income, marriage, child and age allowances.  It is essential that substantial increases be given under these headings.</P>
    <P>By quick calculation, the Minister will see that if he wants to adjust the tax allowances to allow for the fall in the value of money since we adjusted them in the budget of 1972, he will have to increase them by something in the region of 25 per cent.  If he is going to get up here and try to make a case that allowances should have been increased considerably more than they were prior to 1972, then whatever ultimate figure he arrives at as regards the shortfall, he should add that to 25 per cent; to arrive at the correct figure, he should, on his own figures, increase these various allowances.</P>
    <P>There is a considerable degree of concern in the country at present on the part of income tax payers in regard to various aspects of the taxation <Col N="1020" /> code.  There is a widespread demand for a complete revision of the income tax code and for the abolition of anomalies which arise at present.  The majority of income taxpayers, if asked what was the first priority for action by the Minister for Finance in regard to any reform of the income tax system, would tell him that it is precisely what is proposed in this motion : substantial increases in the various personal earned income, marriage, child, and age allowances, plus a provision that they will be adjusted hereafter in accordance with the cost of living.</P>
    <P>The statement issued today on behalf of the Government does not make that commitment.  If I may quote it again:</P>
    <P>The increases will mark the first step towards a policy of reviewing the personal allowances regularly and at frequent intervals.</P>
    <P>If the Minister and the Government can make such a commitment, why can they not make the commitment called for in this motion?  It would be far more effective if such a commitment were made than the kind of statement made here on behalf of the Government.  It would be far more effective if there was a firm commitment to review these allowances annually in accordance with the cost of living.  The statement by the Government is, I think, intended to convey something very close to that.  The Government would have derived far greater benefit by making a firm commitment. There is nothing to be got by the suggestion in the Government statement without that commitment. That is getting the worst of both worlds; it is making the commitment but not getting the value of making it.</P>
    <P>It may be asked why such commitment is made at this time and why it was not necessary in the past.  There is a very good reason for that.  First, never before have our people experienced the present degree of inflation. It is agreed on all sides of the House that the inflation which is to come will be considerably greater than that being experienced at present.  This produces a new situation.  If a worker <Col N="1021" /> is making a claim for an increase in wage or salary he must consider not only an increase which will give him a real improvement but also&mdash;and this is even more vital&mdash;how much he needs to keep up with the cost of living.  His experience tells him, and all the indications of an increasing rate of inflation are, that he must make an estimate of how much the cost of living will increase and then ask for considerably more if he is even to keep pace with the fall in the value of money.  The consequence of this is that wage claims in future are likely to be enormously inflationary in themselves.  Nobody can legitimately blame the people who make such claims having regard to what has been happening in our economy. If the Government were to act on this motion by increasing the allowances and if they were to meet the commitment we have called for by adjusting allowances annually in relation to the cost of living, that would go a long way towards reducing the number of inflationary wage and salary claims which would be made.</P>
    <P>One of the factors which must be taken into account is that the bigger the increase the more will be taken off in taxation.  We have now reached the stage, as indicated in this motion, where many people who were never thought of as being liable to pay income tax, and who by any reasonable standard can only be regarded as poor people, are paying income tax, and sometimes relatively substantial income tax in relation to their earnings. We cannot allow this situation to continue.  It is a situation which will become increasingly more difficult and intolerable for many wage and salary earners because of impending inflation.  The Minister could make a very substantial contribution to reducing the impact of this if he were to adopt what is proposed in this motion.</P>
    <P>The question of income tax allowances is becoming inextricably mixed up with negotiations for national agreements.  If we want national agreements&mdash;and we say on both sides of the House that we do&mdash;then the Government have an obligation to do <Col N="1022" /> what they can to make such an agreement acceptable and to create a climate in which a national agreement is acceptable.  Up to now the Government have singularly failed to create any such climate.  They now have an opportunity to do so, or at least to contribute to it without interfering in any way with free collective bargaining.  It seems to me that because of impending inflation, the time is coming when negotiations on national agreements should be conducted in relation to post-taxation income rather than gross income.  In a situation of rapidly accelerating inflation, it would seem to be a more equitable way of approaching the problem of wage increases.  If the Minister, even at this late stage, approached the problem of personal taxation on the lines suggested in this motion, he would make a substantial contribution to the stability of the economy.  In the circumstances in which we exist, and with the possibility of a national pay agreement being negotiated and accepted, he would be contributing to the creation of industrial peace.</P>
    <P>I accuse the Minister and his colleagues of gross neglect of duty and incompetence in failing to create such a climate in the budget and subsequently. Even when the national pay agreement was about to be voted on, the Government were inactive.  Only when it had been rejected and new terms had been put forward was there any sign of activity by the Government. That activity, though very belated, was welcome.  I do not believe it is sufficient in the sense that there is not a firm enough commitment to an adjustment of income tax rates in line with the cost of living.  Although there is enough of a commitment to make a problem for the Government there is not enough of a commitment to get the benefit of it.</P>
    <P>The Minister should firm up the general statement of the Government's intention in regard to the immediate increases proposed, something which should have been done a long time ago.  I hope it is not too late, and if the Minister is going to use this debate for the purpose of firming up <Col N="1023" /> the Government's position my motion will be a worthwhile exercise.  If, however, the Minister wants to use this debate solely for the purpose of arguing about what previous Governments did, or failed to do, he is not going to contribute anything to the vital concerns of this nation at this time. He is simply going to draw attention to the gross failure, on his part in particular, and on the part of the Government in general, to deal with this problem in the last budget when he had the opportunity and when he imposed all the taxes which he imposed.</P>
    <P>The options of the Minister for Finance in the coming budget in regard to taxation will be a great deal more limited because he used up so many of them in the last budget. However, the Minister did not make the adjustments necessary and he is now being forced into the position of having to make those adjustments come what may.  I have pointed out where he can make those adjustments and meet those commitments without undue strain on the Exchequer.  He can do so because of the greatly increased receipts from VAT, and because of the greatly increased receipts he will get as a result of the increases in wages and salaries which are coming up.</P>
    <P>I hope the Minister will approach this motion on a realistic and constructive basis.  I said before when the Government tried to prevent this motion being discussed that I thought the Government would have welcomed the fact that this motion was coming up in order to make their position clear, in order to make the kind of statement the Government made today.  I hope the Minister will approach this on a more constructive basis than his amendment indicates and that as a result of the motion being put down, although we have achieved a statement from the Government, we will achieve something more which could be of vital importance to all the taxpayers of the country and the future of the economy.</P>

      <P>I move the amendment in my name:</P>
      <P>To delete all words after &ldquo;Dáil Éireann&rdquo; and substitute &ldquo;notes that personal allowances under the income tax code were not increased in the financial years 1957-58 to 1972-73 inclusive at a rate commensurate with the depreciation in money values.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>I am not surprised that the Fianna Fáil Party, some of them at least, had the decency not to speak on Deputy Colley's motion at all.  It is a welcome development for Fianna Fáil to appear in Dáil Éireann in sack cloth and ashes seeking pardon and forgiveness for their own sins.  I would prefer, in charity, to interpret their conduct in that light rather than to assume that they are all suffering from the same disease as their Leader, that of forgetfulness.  If there is in our society today anger at the injustice of the code of income taxation it is because of the many years of omission on the part of Fianna Fáil in this field, sins of omission which were not at all cured by their tardy action, after 15 years of omission, in the budget of 1972.</P>
      <P>I propose to give examples of that omission.  When Fianna Fáil came to power in 1957 there were 185,000 income tax payers; I repeat, 185,000 income tax payers.  On the day they left office there were more than 700,000 income tax payers.</P>

      <P>That is a shocking and scandalous figure, but what is even more scandalising and frustrating, what is even more a cause or should be a cause of shame to any Government in a democracy, is that as they increased the number of people from whom income tax was squeezed from 185,000 to over 700,000 the number of surtax payers decreased from 9,600 to only 6,650.</P>

      <P>When I use phrases like &ldquo;sack cloth and ashes&rdquo; I am, perhaps, erring on the side of charity. <Col N="1025" /> There was never in any democracy in the world a Government who acted so scandalously and unfairly towards the ordinary worker as the Fianna Fáil Government.  They multiplied the number of income tax payers, including the people who were called upon to pay tax when they were earning £6 to £7 per week while income earners in the surtax brackets, who are multiplying every year, had alleviation given to them, or every encouragement given to them to engage in tricks of avoidance or evasion.</P>
      <P>The Fianna Fáil Party were aware of this.  They knew the scandal was going on and although their attention was drawn to this by Income Tax Commissions which they appointed, although the way to remedy this scandalous situation was shown to them by these commissions, they deliberately decided not to take action against the avoiders and the evaders in the high income nets.  At a budget meeting in April, 1970, the then Minister for Finance, Deputy Charles Haughey, strongly opposed, and carried the day against the introduction of anti-avoidance provisions for the well-tto-do.</P>
      <P>These are the people who had the cheek to table a resolution for discussion and decision in 1974.</P>

      <P>Even if the evidence was not there, the evidence appears in the official figures of surtax payers which reduced from 9,600 to 6,500 over a period of 16 years during which the Fianna Fáil mafia looked after themselves and left the poor in the gutter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A typical example of the Fianna <Col N="1026" /> Fáil attitude was revealed at last week's Ard-Fheis where the Fianna Fáil Party, collected to express what they love to call the &ldquo;grassroots opinion&rdquo;, decided against the taxation of capital gains.  They came in here to act a hypocritical role but would not, at their Ard-Fheis, oblige their party leaders to stop the scandal of millionaires making tax free profits in this country while the poor are obliged, week after week, to pay their pittance of income tax hard and all as it is for them to bear it.</P>
    <P>In 1957, when Fianna Fáil came to power, the personal income tax allowance was £150.  It took them until 1972 to increase that figure to £299 and at that time the figure ought to have been £330.  In 1957, too, the widow had an allowance of £175.  By 1973 it should have been, £385, but Fianna Fáil brought it up to only £324.  Married persons with an allowance of £310 in 1957 should have had £682 allowance in 1973, but they got an allowance of only £494.  There was an allowance of £100 in respect of children in 1957.  This should have been £220 in 1973 but, instead, the allowances were scaled to £132, £147, £155 and £170.  We became the only country in the world operating 18 different children's allowances under the income tax code, depending, in the first place, on the ages of the parents, because that controlled the ages of the children and then on the ages of the children.  These were all dodges to avoid giving the average Irish family the kind of income tax allowances to which they were entitled.</P>
    <P>The dependent relative's allowance of £60 was not increased in the 1972 handout when it should have been increased to £132.  The housekeeper allowance, which widowers as well as many others require and which was £100 in 1957, was not increased either in 1972 when it should have been increased to £220.  The earned income relief, which was £400 in 1957 and which should have been £880 in 1972, was increased in that year to only £500.  The aged&mdash;those most deserving of our charity and of some handout from the opulent society in which <Col N="1027" /> we now live&mdash;should have had an increase from £150, the 1957 figure, to £330 in 1972 but instead they got only £175.  That is the scandal and the miserable record that Deputy Colley trumps up here today as an indication of Fianna Fáil's conscience in office.  Can it not be said that we have done a great service for Ireland by putting Fianna Fáil out of office?</P>

      <P>At least they have recovered some sense of conscience if only for the reason of trying to embarrass the Government of the day. Deputy Colley queried why last week we did not allow his hypocritical motion to be taken.  I shall be frank with him.  As a former Minister for Finance he knows all the constraints, all the problems, all the difficulties and all the lack of information that face any Minister for Finance in the early weeks of a calendar year and approaching budget time.  He knows exactly how those constraints were even greater last November and December and how difficult it would have been for any Minister for Finance&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Colley knew well that no responsible Minister for Finance could have given any undertaking in November or December&mdash; four, five or six months from the date of the budget&mdash;regarding future tax patterns.  However, as soon as it became apparent to us, and this was only during the past week, what the possibilities for next year would be&mdash;and never in the history of western Europe have there been so many uncertainties as those facing Governments today&mdash; we gave assurances to those people who represent the workers, those who are most hard pressed by the 16 years <Col N="1028" /> of neglect on the part of our predecessors in government.</P>
      <P>The income tax code is in a mess. It is an impenetrable jungle for the ordinary man.  Nobody can find his way through it unless he can afford to pay a new professional class, the income tax advisers, who have been able to fatten because of Fianna Fáil's failure for more than a decade to do anything in regard to the income tax code.  That code has become a fertile field for the spiv and the smart aleck out to make a quick profit at the expense of his fellow citizens, at the expense of all taxpayers.</P>
      <P>We propose to end all this.  Deputy Colley challenged me with not giving an indication earlier of how this would be done.  I challenge him to read the many pronouncements I have made during my term of office to date.  On innumerable public occasions and here in this House I have given support to the original commitment of this Government in their statement of intent to reform the whole taxation code.  The truth is that Fianna Fáil do not like this prospect, as was shown by their recent Ard Fheis.  Their friends, their money supporters, do not want change, and Fianna Fáil do not want it either.  But there will be change and we will not be impressed in any way by the protests which undoubtedly the Fianna Fáil well-paid lobby will be able to have printed on behalf of the party to the effect that we are causing difficulties for this country by introducing tax reforms, tax reforms of a kind that every other country in Europe and in the progressive world has long since introduced.  The people have become scandalised and frustrated&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>&mdash;&mdash;by the knowledge that there are innumerable tax avoiders in our community.  In fairness to these tax avoiders and evaders, the failure of Fianna Fáil to reform the taxation code has tempted, urged and propelled these people along paths of tax avoidance and evasion.  In our <Col N="1029" /> budget last year we took action against tax avoiders and evaders but we were criticised from the benches opposite for what we were doing.  We increased the penalty on people who avoided payment of tax.</P>

      <P>We put a limit on the lavish business entertainment that could be engaged in while Fianna Fáil were in office.  We put a limit on the capital allowances for motor cars.  We put an end to the scandal of loss-buying transactions whereby people were deliberately building up a loss situation in one company so that they might set it off against the immense profits they were making in another. Also, we put an end to the abuse of the friendly societies which were being registered at the rate of four and five per month.  Registration of one of these companies involved seven or eight people with more than £1 million or £2 million each putting the money into friendly societies in order to make a quick tax-free profit. These practices were being carried out under the previous administration. They did nothing to stop these scandals.  In January this year while in pursuit of my objective to bring about tax reform I uncovered another scandal&mdash;that of people setting off massive amounts of interest on money that they had borrowed for the purpose of making quick speculative gains.  I stopped that loophole, too, and have been chastised since by Fianna Fáil for doing so.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am now prepared to accept that Deputy Colley is renouncing the leader writers of <i>The Irish Press</i>.  In fact, there had been more than that by way of comment regarding the steps I took to kill off the efforts at tax avoidance and tax evasion. Perhaps the people are entitled to some information about the kind of scandal Fianna Fáil knew was going on but about which they did nothing.  Some of the situations we have moved against are like the following: a man with a returned income of £13,000 claimed to be paying interest of £14,000, as a result of which he paid no income tax; another case was that of a man with a returned income of £5,000 who claimed to have been paying £5,000 interest; another with an income of £24,000 claimed he was paying interest of £33,000; another with an income of £15,000 claimed to have been paying interest of £15,000; another with an income of £20,000 claimed to be paying interest of £18,000; a person with an income of £25,000 claimed to have been paying interest annually of £100,000.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Why were these people doing that? Because they were able to use a provision in the income tax law that was intended for the relief of the ordinary taxpayer who was paying a house mortgage.  They were using that to get massive capital gains, tax free, which the Fianna Fáil Ard Fheis last Saturday said: &ldquo;Do not touch&rdquo;.  If ever I needed justification for what I did I had it last week when the friends of the evaders said: &ldquo;No, do not touch&rdquo;.  These are the people who come to Dáil Éireann and ask the people to take them seriously, to regard as sincere their request that <Col N="1031" /> allowances under the income tax code should be increased.  We intend to increase them.  We intend to reform the whole taxation code, not merely in relation to income tax but in relation to all other forms of wealth.  We ask no thanks for it; it is long overdue in Ireland.  This country is now the laughing-stock of the progressive world for our failure to move against the people who have been able to make massive capital accumulations and make no contributions under the ordinary income tax code.</P>
    <P>When we came into office last year we were faced with many perplexing problems.  One of the most conflicting problems that faced us was whether in the first year we should do something to alleviate the most miserable and most neglected in our midst or whether we should try to spread relief by giving some help to those who had an earned income at the same time as we gave some money benefit to those who had no income other than what they received in public welfare. We make no apology for making a decision in favour of the people who were solely or mainly dependent on public welfare for their very existence.</P>
    <P>Of course, as we did that we had the begrudgers.  We had the people who were disappointed, those who should not have been caught in the tax net and who were upset that alleviation had not been give to them. However, by and large we have no doubt that the ordinary, decent people in no way seriously begrudged the massive alleviation we gave to those who depended on social welfare for their income.</P>

I am sure I speak for Deputy Colley and his predecessors, as I speak for my successor, when I say that no Minister for Finance in this country or elsewhere is content with what he can do in a budget.  However, where a choice lay&mdash;as it did with us&mdash;between looking after the most underprivileged in the community or the remainder we made our choice and we make no apology for it.  So far as votes were concerned there was no mileage in so doing because now there are more taxpayers in the country than recipients of social welfare&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>We came to our decision on the basis of a social and moral obligation which we as a Government recognised.  In the forthcoming budget we hope again to look after those who are most deserving of help, and this year that includes the income tax payers.  It will be said that as we go about the reform of income tax and the total reformation of tax we are killing the goose that lays the golden egg.  When I hear this utterance I say: &ldquo;Some strange geese, some strange ganders, some rather queer goslings&rdquo;.  These people who are supposed to be laying the golden eggs are laying them in the Bahamas, in the Channel Islands, in the Isle of Man, the Canaries or on the London Stock Exchange, in New York&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am saying that these people who have not been paying their due share of income tax, or anything towards income tax, show very few characteristics of geese.  Geese are supposed to be simpletons, to be foolish, scattered, unwise.  The Fianna Fáil geese who are laying the imaginary Fianna Fáil golden eggs for the benefit of our economy have not left the golden eggs in Ireland.  They have taken them elsewhere and, so far as one can judge by their operations, they show very little simplicity. They show a great knowledge of all the loopholes in the law that have been left for them by their friends.  I believe any resemblance between the tax evader and the Fianna Fáil goose is not coincidental; it is deliberate.  It is a pretence that they have left after them a just tax code.  It is most unjust. It is a shame and a disgrace.  So far as the Government are concerned, we will do our level best to change it.</P>
      <P>Naturally, this will cost an immense amount of money.  Deputy Colley suggests there is a great bonanza in VAT, that it is yielding revenue that was never previously anticipated or available to a Minister for Finance.  He knows the cost of government rises in the same way as the cost of anything else.  In his final year in office the cost of government outran the revenue. When he left office he had prepared the Estimates for the year in which I took over.  They were £47 million short&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>The truth is that of course the cost of Government is rising.  While one may create an illusion of massive revenue and of resources without limit, the commitments against these resources are also considerable.  There is no surplus of revenue notwithstanding the increased yield of VAT or, indeed, any other income source.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We accept our obligation and we will discharge our obligation.  We will not&mdash;I repeat not&mdash;wait for once in every 15 years to make improvements in income tax allowances.  They will be made, as we announced today outside the political arena to the Irish Congress of Trade Unions and the Confederation of Employers.  In the forthcoming budget we will provide relief for income tax payers and we will, as the years go on, if we remain in Government, provide such reliefs as the cost of living may require.  We believe this is the correct way to do it.  We have done this because we realise that, in recent months particularly, agitation has developed about the inadequate personal allowances under the income tax code.  Rightly or wrongly many people probably took this into account in relation to their <Col N="1035" /> vote on the original offer by the employers.</P>
    <P>It is fair to point out that the Government were not a party to those negotiations because neither the employers nor the employees wished to have the Government as a party to wage negotiations.  There is free collective bargaining and, within the operation of free collective bargaining, it was not open to the Government to participate.  Since the rejection of the original offer of the employers it has been made known to us that the view of responsible people in the trade unions is that one of the factors which could have influenced people was the high incidence of income tax.  We had already decided&mdash; and my many utterances on public occasions are proof of this&mdash;that there had to be substantial reforms in the whole taxation code.</P>

      <P>
        <i>(Dublin Central):</i> I second Deputy Colley's motion.  This motion has been tabled for a considerable time.  It is quite obvious that we were prohibited from debating income tax especially as it affects the lower wage earner.  One of the vital issues facing the country today, and involving the national wage agreement, is the whole question of the income tax code.  If the people on the opposite benches were where we are this evening they would not shoulder their responsibilities as we will.  We believe that a national wage agreement is the best settlement in the interests of the country and we intend to be responsible in our approach.  On numerous occasions in the past when national issues were being discussed we saw the irresponsible attitude adopted by the then Opposition some of whom are Ministers today.  When I recall the deplorable performance of some of those Ministers I shudder.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We are deeply concerned about the income tax code.  We are concerned for the lower salary and wage earners.  These are the people who carry the biggest part of the income tax burden.  We regret that the Minister made no definite statement in his communiqué today.  He said that the Government propose to increase the income tax personal allowance and to introduce other tax reforms which will operate from the commencement of the coming financial year.  We welcome this, but what else could he do?  Look at the economy over the past 12 months.  Look at the inflation which has taken place.  Could any <Col N="1037" /> Minister for Finance bring in the next budget without making a substantial increase in tax free allowances?</P>
    <P>Over the past 12 months the increase in the cost of living has been running somewhere in the region of 10 to 15 to 20 per cent.  The income of wage earners has been eroded. Various unions were very conscious of the fact that, before any final settlement could be arrived at, the question of income tax had to be tackled.  This was due to the rampant inflation which the Government allowed.  I do not blame the Government for all the inflation but they mishandled various aspects of the economy.  Due to that we are demanding that substantial increases must be made in tax free allowances.</P>
    <P>We heard a great deal from the Coalition parties when they were putting forward their views in the 14-point plan as to what they would do about the cost of living and how they would increase social welfare benefits and reduce income tax.  What concessions in the income tax code did the taxpayer enjoy last year?  The Minister got additional revenue of £70,685,418, due to various increases in VAT and other forms of taxation. The only concession given to the taxpayer was an increase in the marriage allowance.  The Minister very generously gave an increase of £30 a year on the marriage allowance.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Dublin Central):</i> This is the only concession we have seen from the Minister.  He criticised us for our failure to do anything about this matter over the past number of years.  The people will be expecting a substantial increase and it will be no thanks to the Minister.  We introduced a system of revenue collection which will help the Minister considerably.  We introduced the turnover tax originally which was bitterly opposed by the then Opposition. We know the debates which went on in the House when that was introduced.  We introduced VAT.  I am quite convinced that at the end <Col N="1038" /> of the financial year the Minister will have well in excess of what he budgeted for last April.  It was stated in the 14-point plan that VAT would be taken off food.  That was done but the Government transferred taxation and increased taxation on every other commodity that the housewife uses and even on school books also.</P>
      <P>Even at the time of the last budget the Minister admitted he would get an extra £2 million but it was stated in the 14-point plan that the removal of tax from food would reduce taxation. The taxpayer has paid more in the past 12 months, substantially more He was deceived by the last budget. The Minister said deliberately that less tax would be taken from consumers. This was deceptive; it did not happen in practice.  When the Minister gets his final returns we shall see the amount of revenue the people have contributed in the past 12 months.</P>
      <P>Something substantial will have to be done in the next budget if we are to relieve the low wage earners.  At present the single persons allowance is £299.  A young worker coming to Dublin has to pay £8 a week for digs and pay for the normal enjoyment-one would expect him to have and he cannot possibly continue with such a low income tax allowance especially in view of the massive inflation that has taken place in the last 12 months. Any young lad in digs will tell you how much his costs have increased in the past 12 months.  There is every case for a substantial increase in the allowance for a single person and no thanks will be due to the Minister. He has not spelled out what these allowances will be but many people will be very disappointed if they are not sufficient to recoup what they have lost in the past 12 months of inflation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The married person's allowance is £494.  We know how difficult it is for young married people who are trying to buy homes.  First, when they are single it is difficult for them to accumulate money for a deposit due to the low income tax allowance but when they get married they must face the burden of mortgage payments and the cost of furnishing a home.  Newly <Col N="1039" /> married couples are entitled to a substantial increase.  I am sure the Minister is aware of the enormous expense newly married couples must meet and we expect from him a substantial increase in this category also.</P>
    <P>I have already mentioned the only concession, a small one, given in the last budget of some £30 extra income tax relief for a married woman.  That was the only concession given to the taxpayers out of increased revenue of nearly £71 million.  The married women will look forward anxiously to the coming budget.  There is no use in saying they will get something like they got last year because it will not be accepted and would not be sufficient. The wife, in my opinion, now has to work of necessity.  Some years ago a wife went out to work to get additional money for luxuries but I believe the young married woman must now work in order to make ends meet.  This is happening in other countries, including the United States. In the early stages of married life it is demoralising for a married woman, having gone to work, to find at the end of a week that she has to pay tax on practically everything but £2 per week.  One can imagine the frustration of a young couple trying to get started in life and furnish a home while having big mortgage commitments. This has discouraged married women from going to work and industrialists have said there is a scarcity of women in certain industries.  If the Minister is sincere, he will have to give a substantial increase to the married women.  Coming in with a small increase of £30 as he did last year is not good enough.  I think it cost the Exchequer about £500,000.</P>

      <P>
        <i>(Dublin Central):</i> One million a year is very small compared with what the Minister got in increased revenue.  I ask the Minister <Col N="1040" /> to think seriously about the tax rates on people trying to make ends meet. Due to the present high cost of living and high building society rates, they are not able to meet their liabilities.</P>
      <P>The more I think about the last budget the more disgraceful I think it was of the Minister to make the provisions he made in regard to children's allowances.  We heard so much about these allowances but when an income of £2,500 was reached the Minister had a clawback provision in the Finance Bill.  Does anybody consider £2,500 a big income today for a married man with children? The Minister's action in this regard was disgraceful.  It is the people in the middle income group who are feeling the strain of the cost of living. Many of them pay voluntary health subscriptions because they have not the same medical concessions as other citizens but the Minister thought it fit, if they had £2,500 a year, to deprive them of the increased children's allowances.  If the Minister canvasses his own constituency and gets the views of people in this income bracket, he will find there is very little luxury attached to the way they live.  The Minister should seriously consider the allowance for married women because something substantial will have to be done in this regard.  The same applies to old people.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. R. Ryan)</NameTxt>
      <P>It is difficult to give a concrete <Col N="1041" /> example.  It is difficult to foretell what would happen.  It could happen, through some oversight or for some other reason connected with human nature, that a modification of a statute or of a particular adjustment might not be carried through in time by an order under this section and that in carrying through the modification of the adjustment at a later date some degree of retrospection might be necessary.  If we were not confined to a nine month period in the way in which we are&mdash;that is a very severe restraint&mdash;it might not have been necessary to have this correction of the matter later, but as I said on the last occasion it is possible to use this section only to the extent of meeting the objectives of the Act itself.  It cannot do anything beyond the aims of the Act itself.</P>
      <P>Accordingly there is no need to fear that anything could be done which would be outside the jurisdiction or the power or the authority conferred by this Act.  What we would be particularly concerned about is that the retrospection we have in mind here might be very necessary in the interests of a private individual rather than for the protection of the public side of our society.  We fear that if we do not have this provision we could possibly do an injustice to somebody which I am sure Deputy Colley, like everybody else in this House, would not wish to do.</P>
      <P>The provisions of this subsection are wide but we consider that they are necessary in the public interest and that they should be as extensive as they are.  As I have said, we cannot go beyond the authority conferred by the Act.  This helps us to clear up expeditiously any imperfections which may arise due to human error.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>On this Stage I want briefly to say that we agree with the principle of the Bill.  We agree that the transitional provisions in it are necessary.  We think it is unfortunate that they should operate at a time when, as Deputy Callanan indicated earlier, they will create considerable difficulty for certain sections of the community.  I withdrew an amendment earlier on the basis of the Minister's undertaking as to what he would try to do about the problem we were dealing with.  I was disappointed that he did not see his way to accept the other amendment, which would have ensured that the ratepayers could be quite certain that whatever happened during the transitional period they would not be charged more rates than 75 per cent for the nine month period of what they had been charged in the previous 12 months.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I will not go back over the arguments in that respect but I must say I am disappointed that the Minister could not see his way to accept that I hope that in the implementation <Col N="1043" /> of the Bill by the local authorities and by the rate collectors due regard will be had to the views expressed here in regard to ratepayers who will experience considerable difficulty in certain cases because of the provisions of the Bill and through no fault of their own.  In particular, I hope local authorities will note that the fact that the amendment I proposed to restrict to 75 per cent for nine months was rejected does not mean there is a licence to shove up rates to an enormous extent and to conceal this fact because the rates will be only for nine months.</P>
    <P>Speaking for this side of the House I can say that we intend to be vigilant in this regard.  Any effort made to take advantage of this transitional period in order to conceal what is really happening, as far as we on this side are concerned will be exposed rigorously and with, I may say, a certain amount of venom.  We certainly do not wish to see this Bill, which we accept in principle, being used for this purpose.  We tried to provide remedies to ensure this would not happen but the Minister did not see his way to accept them.  We will do what we can to see that the ratepayers are not defrauded or misled in this respect.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Minister for Finance (Mr. R. Ryan) Richie Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. R. Ryan)</NameTxt>
      <P>I have already said, and I repeat, that the Government are determined that this transition will go through as smoothly as possible and that in the process of transition nobody will be the loser and nobody the gainer.  The Minister for Local Government has taken pains to ensure and is taking steps to ensure that every local authority will be made fully aware of their responsibilities in this matter but he is not confining it to local authority level.  He will also be making the public aware of what is occurring.  We will also be doing this in regard to national responsibilities. The public will be made fully aware of the changes that are taking place in this financial year&mdash;that there will be a once and for all nine months period and that it will be followed by a national and local authority <Col N="1044" /> financial year which will be related to the calendar year.</P>
      <P>If any Member of this House has any suspicion that any person or body or institution or authority is endeavouring to manipulate this transition period in any way which will be contrary to the normal pattern, I would ask him to notify the Minister for Local Government or myself, as the case may be, as to what is happening and we shall take all steps open to us to correct it.</P>

      <P>The Government have already given their word and they will observe that word and they will not take any advantage of the situation. There is no point in the Government trying to do so, because we have an objective here too, to have this change work as smoothly as possible.  It will not be to the Government's advantage if somebody upsets the apple cart.  This is just one of many changes that are necessary in this country and we want them all to go through as smoothly as possible.  We are by this Bill ending an anachronism which comes down from the year 1752, because it was only in that year that the British Exchequer accepted the Gregorian calendar of 1582.  I suppose the delay of 170 years in moving to the Gregorian calendar was probably due to certain suspicions about popish practices.  We have not moved as fast on this occasion.  It has taken from 1752 to 1975 to end this anachronism of having a year from the 1st April to the 31st of the following March.  Of course, the National Coalition Government only came into office in 1973, so we cannot be blamed for a dilatory action before that.  However, just as the world benefited by the adoption of the Gregorian calendar, I hope that Ireland will benefit by the adoption of the Ricardian calendar.</P>

I understand that on the last occasion when the Committee Stage of an Electoral (Amendment) Bill similar to this was being discussed in 1969, the Ceann Comhairle informed the House in the following manner, and I quote from column 272, Volume 238, of the Official Report of 5th February, 1969:</P>
      <P>An Ceann Comhairle: When suggesting changes in the boundaries of a particular constituency under consideration Members will be allowed to deal with changes in other constituencies with which the constituency under consideration forms a group.  This would be in accordance with the normal rules of debate and, consequently, would not need to be dealt with by a special Order of the House.</P>
    </Speaker>

      <Col N="1048" /> I take it that position still obtains and will obtain throughout this debate.</P>

I take it that the Chair is indicating to the House that the Chair is prepared to deal leniently with Deputies discussing particular constituencies and to recognise that it will be necessary for them to refer to other constituencies following the changes proposed in any particular constituency under discussion.  We will not adopt too rigid an attitude on this if that proposal is accepted.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Mr. Molloy Mr. Molloy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>On section 1, I should like to mention that the Minister, in circulating this Bill, followed it with maps which illustrated to the Deputies and to people interested exactly what his proposals meant in so far as they were delineated on a map.  The circulation of the maps was a great convenience to persons dealing with this <Col N="1049" /> Bill.  In the amendments which I have suggested should come before the House, which amendments have been circulated, it has not been seen fit to circulate a similar map illustrating the changes.  A facility similar to that which followed the circulation of the Minister's Bill was not provided. Deputies, in trying to interpret the amendments which Deputies on this side of the House have put down, will be in some difficulty trying to determine where exactly the boundaries of a particular constituency are. I would ask the Minister whether it would be possible even at this late stage to circulate maps showing the proposed amendments.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>I have no objection at all to Deputy Molloy or to the Fianna Fáil Party submitting the maps to which he refers to his party or to all the Deputies, if Deputy Molloy wishes to do so.  I can understand that they might have great difficulty in finding out what the Deputy wants.  As a matter of fact, it is a good job that Deputy Molloy did not think of this earlier.  I came across proposals in the Department, made when Deputy Molloy was Minister for Local Government, and the map-makers would have had a difficult job for the next couple of years drawing up maps showing Deputy Molloy's proposals.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not object to Deputy Molloy preparing maps or having his backroom boys do so if he feels it might help.  But I am sure the Deputy does not expect the Government to prepare the documentation for the Opposition.  Is this a new precedent which Deputy Molloy would like to establish?  I would remind the Deputy that it was difficult to get items to which we were entitled when he was on this side of the House.  I think the Deputy is now suggesting that we should supply the documentation showing what he wants.  We are doing well by supplying maps showing what we propose to do, but to suggest that we should also supply maps showing what Deputy Molloy wants&mdash;and I assume that every time a change was suggested by any person in the House the Deputy would feel that we should prepare further maps&mdash;is a little bit <Col N="1050" /> ridiculous.  I have no objection to the Fianna Fáil Party preparing maps.</P>

      <P>Section 1 is only a definition section.  It is stated in this Bill that &ldquo;the Minister&rdquo; means the Minister for Local Government.  Following section 1 we are to read &ldquo;the Minister&rdquo; in the rest of the Bill as meaning &ldquo;the Minister for Local Government&rdquo; and he is authorised to carry out such revisions of the constituencies as are arranged.  I expressed the view on Second Stage that this party were prepared to recommend to the Minister that an independent commission should be established to carry out these revisions.  The arguments in favour of that proposal were discussed.  It was clearly shown that when the Minister's party were on this side of the House these were the sentiments they then expressed.  On their transfer to the Government benches they have dropped completely that proposal and reneged on the strong arguments which they made previously for such a commission. In the Minister's reply on Second Stage he stated that if Fianna Fáil were still in favour of a commission, as they appeared to be, that Deputy J. Lynch should approach the Taoiseach, Deputy Cosgrave, in the New Year to discuss it.</P>

I am not going to press for a vote on this section, but I wish to indicate that we object to the Minister carrying out this function. In this section we are defining that the Minister for Local Government is the person with the authority to carry out the revisions.  In the Fianna Fáil Party we are in favour of establishing a commission and we would issue an invitation to the Minister's party and to the Government to arrange, through an all-party committee or through some other suitable method, to discuss the establishment of a commission which in future&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>May I comment on what Deputy Molloy has just said.  It is remarkable to notice the change which a transfer across the House can make in the thinking of certain people. The first we heard from the Fianna Fáil side about accepting an outside commission was after Deputy J. Lynch had conceded, on the night of the count, that he might not win the election and he said then that he thought it might be a good idea to have a commission to revise the constituencies.  I do not wish to detain the House on this.  For all the years since this State was formed, Fianna Fáil on every occasion did not bother with a commission but drew up the constituencies themselves.  Having corrected what Fianna Fáil did wrongly, we might consider a commission the next time.  I notice that Deputy Molloy did not even put down an amendment suggesting something like that might be done because, in fact, he knows well that even members of his own party at present would not accept that it should be done by a commission because they feel that sometime in the dim, distant future they might get back in again and they would like to do what they have been doing for years.</P>

      <P>This section is quite important even though we will agree to it, because it allows the number of Deputies to be elected to this House to be increased from 144 to 148.  I am sure the Minister would like to give the House good and valid reasons why the representation in this House should be increased by a further four Deputies.  Even though the census changes allow for an increase of four Deputies, the constitutional position would allow for a retention of the existing 144 Deputies.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">

      <P>I will give a good reason for this.  It is that we believe that the representation should be as good as it can be and for that reason we are entitled to have the extra four and we give it.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cunningham</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister could adhere to the 1,000 either way. In the rural areas of western Ireland he could go to the upper limit.  Take, for instance, Donegal, where the tolerance is over 1,000.  It takes more people in that very big county to elect a Deputy than it takes in Dublin, and if the Minister carried that tolerance right through the 26 counties we would have a situation such as Deputy Molloy has been talking about.  In the densely populated constituencies a Deputy will represent fewer people&mdash;&mdash;</P>

The number of Deputies elected to this House depends on the tolerance factor and the population.  The Minister is making provision in section 2 of this Bill for representation in this House Deputywise and numberwise.

      <P>Then we will have irretrievably decided on the number provided for in this section.  I want to get at the reason why the Minister decided on 148.  It is his duty to give to the House all the factors he brought into consideration when he decided the number would be 148.  Of that number the country will have a Deputy from Donegal representing 21,000 people and will have a Deputy from Dublin a much smaller area, representing 19,000 people.  This discrepancy <Col N="1056" /> accounts for the 148.  What had the Minister in mind?  Is there something sacrosanct about 148? could it not be 147?  We could have a different representation from one of the Dublin constituencies or one of the other very densely populated constituencies where a Deputy, if he is any good, could walk from one end to the other before his breakfast and do himself and his constituents a lot of good.  Could he not have spread it a little and saved the country the expense of an extra Deputy?  He could have done that and he would then be putting the constituencies on a more equal footing, perhaps not territorially but certainly numerically.  There is a lot to be said for this.  By putting the figure 148 there he has discriminated against a county like Donegal which I have the honour to represent&mdash;and I hope I will represent it again as one of the 148.  The Minister should tell us why that figure should not be 147.</P>

The High Court decided that 20,000&mdash;a tolerance of 1,000 up or down from 20,000&mdash;would be the figure, and so the figure which was produced when the number of people was divided by 20,000 was 148.  It did exactly the same for Deputy Molloy when he was on this side of the House, because he suggested 148. It just shows that he could count or that his officials counted as well for him as they did for me.</P>

      <P>While no firm figures are available of the present population in the Dublin area, according to the Planning Authority in 1973 the population was somewhere between 878,000 and 889,000.  They say that, by 1975, the figure will be somewhere between 903,000 and 927,000.  Therefore, if we wanted to give extra seats to Dublin unfairly, we could have given them on the figures.  I have given you up to 44 seats; we have given you 43 but that was with an addition from outside it, from Wicklow and Kildare.  But, in fact, they could qualify&mdash;only the census is not <Col N="1064" /> there to prove it and, therefore, they cannot be changed&mdash;for up to 46 seats.  I do not know what all the wailing is about.  I particularly cannot understand what all the wailing is about from Deputy Cunningham in view of the fact that even though he says Donegal is not getting a fair deal, he did not put in an amendment nor did he ask Deputy Molloy to put in an amendment to change Donegal to anything else.  I think he felt he would be fairly safe in a five-seater in Donegal.</P>

      <P>The first thing I should like to convey to the Minister is that we are dealing with the Committee Stage of this Bill only and that it is possible for the Opposition Parties, or any other Member of the House, to put down amendments to this Constituency Bill for Report Stage.  The Minister has stated on at least two occasions in answer to a point made from this side of the House, that if one felt that way about it why did one not put down an amendment and, because there was not a particular amendment put down, therefore, the argument did not stand. I should like to assure the Minister that this may be only our first set of amendments. We wish to see how we progress with the Bill.  We still have the right, on Report Stage, to put down any amendment we feel necessary or worthwhile. I would like the Minister to retain that bit of information and to find some other arguments to answer the points that have been made from this side of the House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister made another point which I would like to answer.  He referred to an estimate given to him by the Planning Authority in the Dublin area as to the possible population of the Dublin area today or next year. The Minister is fully aware that that is a spurious argument.  In dealing with this Bill, we are confined to the limits of the Constitution and the legal interpretation <Col N="1065" /> of that Constitution as given by the courts.  We have no right to enter into the realm of speculation as to how many persons there were in Dublin yesterday, how many today, tomorrow or next year.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>We can deal only with the number of persons as recorded in the census of population, 1971, which the Minister has in his possession.  The Constituency Bill we are discussing can be based only on the figure of the Irish population contained in this booklet&mdash;<i>The Census of Population of Ireland, 1971</i>.  No other estimate or speculation as to how many persons there are or there may be has any relevance to any part of the debate in this House.  Because, if the Minister wants to extend that argument, it can be extended in support of increasing representation in areas which he has deprived of representation under this Bill.  It is also a well-known fact that in several of the western counties the population has increased substantially since that date in 1971.  We cannot take that into consideration in discussing this Bill; we cannot take it into consideration in deciding the number of Deputies for the Dublin area.</P>
      <P>The section we are debating deals with a request to the Minister, through this Bill, to authorise an increase in the number of Deputies elected to this House from 144 to 148.  There are valid considerations we should like to put before the Minister and valid criticisms we should like to bring before the House of the Minister's actions in dealing with this Bill.  Deputy Cunningham was making one of those valid points; that, in dealing with the drawing up of a constituency called Donegal, the Minister chose to provide a five-seater constituency and he exceeded the national average in that constituency. We have already understood here that the deviation from the national average allowed&mdash;following the court decision &mdash;is roughly 1,000 above or 1,000 below.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the constituency which the Minister has suggested in Donegal there is a population of 105,509 persons, creating five seats.  The population <Col N="1066" /> per Member is 21,102,979 above the national average per Deputy which is 20,123.  Deputy Cunningham was not arguing that the Minister was right or wrong in creating a constituency called Donegal, making it a five-seater and including 105,509 persons in that area.  His point was that if the Minister were to follow the same population per Deputy, 979 above the national average, and apply the same principle to all the other constituencies in the country, it would not have been possible to create 148 seats.  The Minister gave figures for the population of Dublin. I do not know how that is relevant to section 2.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LiamCunningham" hpid="Mr. Cunningham Mr. Cunningham">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cunningham</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Mr. Molloy Mr. Molloy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>What is relevant is the population of the whole country. As given in the 1971 census, the population was 2,978,248 persons.  At that time, and until a Bill is introduced and passed by this House to change it, the number of Deputies under the law is 144.  With a population of 2,978,248 with 144 seats, the average per Deputy would be 20,682. In Donegal the Minister created a constituency where the average per Deputy is over 21,000.  If we could not have section 2 which will increase the number of Deputies from 144 to 148, the tolerance range would be from a minimum per Deputy of 19,682 to a maximum of 21,682, the average being 20,682 as stated.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister said it was necessary to increase the number of Deputies, but he has not yet given the House any detailed valid argument.  There were vague references in his introductory speech on the Second Stage to EEC legislation.  He also made vague references to the fact that the Opposition, when in Government and dealing with the revision of constituencies, had decided to create the additional four seats.  It is very strange if that is the only argument the Minister can advance.  Are we to continue in this House on that basis?  The parties now in Government were elected because they claimed they would provide some improvements in <Col N="1067" /> the system of Government.  They made certain specific promises but the community will judge them when they get the opportunity.  It is very weak arguing on the Minister's part when he says that he is doing this because he thinks Fianna Fáil when they were in office intended doing something similar.  It is time the Minister stood on his own feet and gave his own reasons for doing his own thing.  He should have the courtesy of attempting to convince the House that he is doing these things because he and his Government feel that they are right. They should not continually use the argument that they think Fianna Fáil were going to do it and therefore, it is all right.  We are flattered of course, but the community are entitled to a better explanation from the Government of their intentions when bringing legislation before the House.</P>
    <P>Members might be interested to know that it is possible for the Minister to carry on with the existing number of Deputies and not increase them by four as provided under this section.  On the basis of a Dáil membership of 144, a number of constituencies could retain their existing representation.  Some of them would be affected but a number would not. Among those which could retain their representation would be the existing constituencies of Carlow-Kilkenny, Clare, Cork City North-West, Cork City South-East, Mid Cork, NorthEast Cork, South-West Cork, NorthEast Donegal, Dublin North-West, Dublin South Central, West Galway, East Limerick, Monaghan, Sligo-Leitrim and Wexford&mdash;15 constituencies.</P>
    <P>Eighteen constituencies would be too small and could be topped up. Nine constituencies which were too large could have ceded population to the constituencies which needed topping up.  In that way no increase would have been necessary.  However, the Minister has decided to increase the number of Deputies by four. Would he give good and valid reasons why there should be four extra Deputies?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Molloy must have forgotten the section of the Bill which we are discussing or lost his notes on what has been happening in this House for many years.  In my Second Reading speech I made it plain that we were providing for 148 seats.  Had we divided the population by 20,000 this is the number we would have arrived at.  We could not have had 149.  We could have had 147 or 146.  The second reason I gave was that Fianna Fáil had already decided to have 148.  In the interests of the country we thought there should be 148 Deputies.  The Government were entitled to take that decision.  It is only fair to point out that this will leave an average per Deputy of 20,123. The average in 1961 was 20,127; in 1959 it was 20,127 and in 1947 it was 20,103.  Since 1947 Fianna Fáil have always gone for the highest number. Is Deputy Molloy worrying because he knows the result is almost certain to be four more against Fianna Fáil? Is that what is wrong with him?  It looks like it.  When he was in this Office it was all right to propose 148 but, having moved across the floor, he thinks it should not be 148 and he waxes eloquent about the small number we should have.  We could have a smaller number but the reason 148 was decided on was that the Government considered that number was best for the country.  The Government were entitled to do that and they have done that in section 2.  All the running around the country which Deputy Molloy has done does not alter the fact that the section proposes 148.  The Deputy has his alternative. If he does not like the figure, he should challenge a vote on this section but if he likes it he is wasting the time of this House.</P>
      <P>My view is that we are debating sections 1 and 2 of this Bill because the troops have disappeared and the Deputy is afraid to go too far with it tonight.</P>

The Minister also stated that he had projected populations from the planning authorities for Dublin for 1972 and 1973.  I was <Col N="1070" /> very interested, looking at Munster, and the fact that the Minister was manipulating tolerances&mdash;&mdash;</P>

I am speaking not only for the Munster Deputies on this side of the House but also for those behind the Minister because I am aware they are inhibited from making those points to the Minister.  I hope the Minister has the projected figures from the different planning authorities for Munster for 1972, 1973.</P>
      <P>The population in Munster is approximately 800,000, according to the 1971 census.  It is interesting to see that the representation for Munster remains at 40 as it was under the measure introduced here five or six years ago but Dublin will grow from 38 to 43 seats.  The population difference is in the region of the value of two seats.  The Minister should explain why it is proposed to give Dublin five extra seats and leave Munster static.</P>
      <P>In my opinion the majority of the province of Munster is a growth area and is looked upon as such.  It is a disappointment that the Minister should decide that the capital city, Dublin, the growth of which we are all so concerned about, should be recognised to this extent.</P>

      <P>If the Minister had adopted the same criteria for the <Col N="1074" /> rest of the country as he did for Donegal there would be fewer Deputies in the country&mdash;approximately 144 &mdash;and consequently there would be a saving of finances.  But, applying to Donegal what the Minister has stated in connection with Dublin, if there were a constituency revision in Donegal as of now, the population figures have increased to such an extent that the projected figure would be sufficient for two constituencies. The Minister is giving Donegal less than any other constituency and is applying the same rule more or less along the western seaboard by allowing a high tolerance.  That is what these figures are all about.  They are about the proportion of population per Deputy.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cunningham</NameTxt>
      <P>It is the Government who should be worried.  The Minister is responsible for having a look at the 144 existing seats and the Government have decided on four more.  If the Minister was a member of a Government that cherished all the <Col N="1078" /> people of the nation equally, if they remembered the sparsely populated areas from Malin Head to Mizen Head, with four seats he could do a good job for the country and for the people in the west by putting them there as far as he could.  However, he did the opposite.  He said Donegal was only entitled to one Deputy for every 21,000 people while other populated areas are entitled to a Deputy for every 19,000. We are trying to let the people see how this open Government work, how this Government of the just society operate. This was the Government who promised the people if they were elected all the problems would disappear.  They then use the jackboot and tell us they will steamroll the Bill through in spite of anyone.  That is what the Minister is saying.  He is quite entitled to say it, but will the people of the west of Ireland, of Donegal and of Munster, like to be the victims of that jackboot?</P>
      <P>There could be a situation where the Minister would have to put the four seats into Dublin; for instance, if there was a 21,000 limitation, where the High Court decreed it could not be exceeded.  That would be a different matter.  We are trying to explain the situation as logically as we can.  The Minister may not see the logic of our arguments but I can see clearly the situation where in Munster, Connacht, and part of Ulster he could have used perhaps not the four seats but at least three seats.  However, he did not do it. We leave the Minister to the country, to the people in the western, southern and northern areas to judge.  We said we would give 148 and we are leaving it to the people to judge whether our method or the Minister's method is the one that does justice to the people.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>Let me go back to the argument I started with.  We decided on 148 Deputies because that is the maximum allowed, that was the practice and the Government decided that was best for the country.  Those are the simple facts.  I would suggest that the argument <Col N="1080" /> here tonight is not, in effect, an argument on the Bill at all.  It is a delaying tactic.  I am surprised at the people who have been making this argument.  Maybe they were a bit quiet over the past week-end.  They might not have got an opportunity to say what they wanted to say.  Maybe what they did say was not well received.  Maybe some of them said things which, when they had a look at them afterwards, they discovered were entirely untrue and they now find themselves in a spot of bother. They come into this House now and they try to put across this sort of thing and give the impression to the people who were or were not at the Ard-Fheis that they were not as bad as they appeared to be.</P>

    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>I am interested in Parliamentary procedure and I like to study it very carefully.  I am interested in probing your reasoning. It seems to me that if we can discuss the totality of the seats we must equally be permitted to discuss the manner in which that totality is put together.  In other words, the total consists of the sum of the parts.  If one is entitled to discuss the total one surely is entitled to discuss how the parts are put together to arrive at that total.  However, that is not the main point I want to make on section 2.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1081" /> I am in favour of 148 seats.  In fact, I would like to see this House consisting of many more Deputies. I am interested in this, not from the point of view of any one constituency, but from the point of view of the House itself.  I think we should direct our minds towards considering what would be the ideal number of Deputies in the House from the point of view of the House itself.  I think that around 200 Deputies would be the ideal number from the point of view of the working of the institution.</P>
    <P>I have some considerations in mind in that regard.  First of all, within limits, the greater the number of Deputies we have the better, from the point of view of the contribution the House can make to the affairs of the nation.  You must get a better cross-section of ideas and opinions from a larger number.  The more Deputies you have here the better the chances are of getting more ability and better contributions.  Of course, there must be an upper limit.  There are too many people in some Parliaments in Europe.  In the Westminster Parliament there are over 600 members. To my mind that is far too many.  A Parliament of that size loses something of great value.  It becomes large and impersonal and mechanical in its workings.</P>
    <P>We should aim at a House big enough to comprise all the best brains and the best political talent the country has to offer while, at the same time, retaining a certain intimacy. It would be ideal if membership of the House were such that everybody would know everybody else.  That would lead to a better type debate.  For instance, if I happen to know the Minister who is putting through a piece of legislation, if I happen to know something of his thinking and his outlook, I would probably be in a better position to discuss the legislation he is putting forward.  A House should not be so big as to lose that intimacy.</P>
    <P>We must also look at the practicalities involved.  First of all, there is the question of providing the members of the Government.  Our Governments require 13, 14 or 15 <Col N="1082" /> people and, when you add the Parliamentary Secretaries, the total number of Deputies involved in the Administration is something in the region of 20 to 25.  In the normal course of events with a House comprising about 140 to 150 Deputies, there will be somewhere in the region of 70 to 75 Deputies on the Government side.  Out of those 75 or so Deputies it is necessary to get 15, 20 or 25 people who are of Ministerial and Parliamentary Secretary calibre.  That in itself may be difficult and when you take the members of the Government and the Parliamentary Secretaries out of the Government side of the House, you are at present left with only 40 or 50 back bench Members.  That is getting a bit thin.</P>
    <P>I would like to see a House with 80 to 100 back bench Deputies on the Government side, who would be in a position to have an indirect, perhaps, but nevertheless an important influence on Government policy.  One would like to see on the Opposition side of the House also somewhere in the region of 100 Deputies.  In that way one would get a better representation of the Opposition point of view from the country at large. All in all, everything points to our needing many more Deputies than we have at present.  I would certainly think that in so far as the Constitution permits we should have the maximum possible number of Deputies from the point of view of the capacity of the House to provide good calibre Government, good calibre Opposition, and good calibre back bench influence on the Government.</P>

    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>In his own person Deputy Paddy Belton probably negates every argument I am making. There is another aspect of our work here which will become increasingly important, that is, the demands that our membership of the European Community will make on us.  At the moment we send ten members to the European Parliament.  That is only, as it were, the tip of the iceberg. <Col N="1083" /> More and more here in the House we will have to provide members for committees.  As Deputies know, we have already in existence the Joint Committee on the Secondary Legislation of the European Communities.</P>
      <P>That committee comprises 26 members altogether, 18 of whom are Deputies.  Other committees are contemplated.</P>
      <P>There is, I understand, a wish now on all sides of the House to have a committee which will deal with the affairs of State and semi-State companies. Members will have to be provided for that committee.  I foresee far greater demands on the time of Members of the House, in this House, apart from the requirements of their constituencies.  We shall have to send Deputies to the European Parliament and apart from Members of the European Parliament itself, there will be greater demand for Deputies to attend different European committees, bodies and organisations of one kind or another.  Apart from the European dimension, we shall have to call a great deal more on Deputies to provide the membership of committees. That will deplete the number of Deputies readily available in the House on sitting days to contribute to the debate and keep the mechanics of Parliamentary business operating effectively.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Therefore, I am very much in favour of at least the 148 Deputies provided for in section 2.  I hope that, as the opportunity presents itself, and as our population increases&mdash;we all welcome the fact that it is steadily rising&mdash;and it becomes constitutionally possible to do so, we will continue to increase the number of Deputies.  There is, however, an upper limit to the ideal size of a debating chamber of this sort.  I recall when Deputy Burke was having an argument with the Minister for Local Government as to what should be the appropriate number of members on Dublin County Council discussing the situation with him and suggesting that while it is important to get adequate and comprehensive representation of the people one must also always keep <Col N="1084" /> an eye on what is the right size of the Legislature or the local body from the point of view of the working of that body.  In discussing this legislation I hope we shall always keep that aspect in mind.  That is what is involved in section 2: what is the best number of Members to have in this House from the point of view of the working of the House.  I would put that figure at about 200 but constitutionally we are a long way from that as yet.  I hope we shall avail of any opportunity that presents itself to increase the number of Deputies from the point of view of the effectiveness of the Chamber as a Legislature.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LiamCunningham" hpid="Mr. Cunningham Mr. Cunningham">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cunningham</NameTxt>
      <P>I began by instancing the figures in Donegal and pointing out that on that basis we could still have 144 Deputies.  I should now like to deal with it from the other end, that is to take one of the densely populated constituencies which got away with a tolerance of 19,000.  This would mean that Deputy Haughey's proposals could, in part, be met.  For instance, if the Minister and Cabinet decided there was need for a greater number of Deputies they could have kept to 19,000 all the way instead of saying 21,000 in Donegal, 20,800 in Mayo and something similar in Cork where a larger tolerance gives fewer Deputies in Munster and Connacht. The Minister and the Government could have decided to take the maximum of the lesser tolerance and apply it all the way from, say, one of the Dublin constituencies throughout the country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I did not make any calculations and I do not know how many extra Deputies would be involved but it would certainly be a few more than 148 because that figure is based on a division of the total population of the Republic by 20,000.  That is what I understood the Minister to say. Instead of that, and while he says 20,000 is the average, in a fair number of cases he used a figure of 19,000 thus leaving the smaller representation to the west and south and north of the country.  If he had stuck to 19,000 and had gone from the city to the ends of the country at that rate of <Col N="1085" /> tolerance we could have&mdash;not all Deputy Haughey suggested&mdash;but more Deputies elected.</P>
    <P>There is a case for this, as Deputy Haughey said, in view of the fact that Deputies from both sides must in the interests of the country and in the interests of the EEC attend meetings in Europe.  Not only have we a selfish interest in having Deputies from this House to represent us and look after us in the EEC, some well and some not so well, as the House has seen from reports coming back, but it is also in the interests of other EEC countries.</P>
    <P>At any rate, it is necessary in view of this to have greater representation. I do not know if this would be a problem for the Minister&mdash;if it would be possible to have another category included in this legislation.  Perhaps it would not be possible without a change in the Constitution to have allowance made for the absence of Deputies in Brussels and Strasbourg. Has the Minister inquired about this? Before Report Stage I hope he will inquire whether we can provide for this without an amendment of the Constitution.  Deputies at the moment are supposed to look after the interests of their constituents in this Parliament and to look after the interests of this country and of our fellow EEC members in the European Parliament. Such a situation, with the present representation, creates problems for us at home and aggravates our problems abroad.  Of course when sitting down to draft this Bill the Minister had only one thought&mdash;to straighten out the constituencies to do Fianna Fáil down.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Cunningham does not like this to be said of him but I would expect that a person who held Parliamentary Secretary rank would at least know what he is talking about.  He does not, and he should get Deputy Molloy to tell him that it would not be possible to provide for 19,000 and therefore to increase the number of Deputies.  The Constitution allows a maximum number of 148.  Deputy Haughey spoke about increasing the number to 200.  It <Col N="1086" /> would require a change in the Constitution to do that.  Many people may think this is not the right time and many people say there are already too many Deputies.  Deputy Haughey had a point and he made it but he did not say we could do this under the Constitution.</P>
      <P>I am surprised at Deputy Cunningham suggesting that it is possible to do it under this Bill.  We could not increase the number, and Deputy Molloy admitted that 148 is the maximum number that could be included in this Bill.  Therefore, there is no point in talking about something that cannot be done at all.  Whether several Deputies go to Europe and whether they are doing a good job there is not relevant.  The situation is whether we want 148, which the Government do, or we do not.  Deputy Cunningham spoke at length as to why we should have fewer than 148 and he tried to make an argument in favour of having more&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="PadraigFaulkner" hpid="Mr. Faulkner Mr. Faulkner">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Faulkner</NameTxt>
      <P>I shall deal briefly with a couple of points.  The Minister said that a change from one side of the House to the other seems to bring a change in attitudes.  That could be said about the Minister more than anybody.  We have heard him in Opposition make a strong fight to have a commission set up to deal with constituency revisions.  Nobody made a stronger fight.  It might be said that his outlook has changed considerably with the change to the other side of the House.  I would hope that the half promise that he made that he would consider a commission after this Bill goes through, if it does go through, will be honoured in the not too distant future.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1088" /> I shall make a couple of comments on some of the statements made by the Minister.  When he was defending the proposal in the Bill to have 148 Deputies, he said he was tied by a decision of the High Court, but he realised shortly afterwards that the High Court decision referred to tolerance. Later the Minister said he is tied by the Constitution.  That is not so.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy knows this more than anybody.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PadraigFaulkner" hpid="Mr. Faulkner Mr. Faulkner">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Faulkner</NameTxt>
      <P>The Constitution permits the Dáil to decide on the number in relation to the population to be represented&mdash;between 20,000 and 30,000.  Therefore, the Minister is not tied to the figure of 20,000.  I am not suggesting he should not use the figure of 20,000.  Like the rest of the Deputies on this side I am in favour of 148.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>However, I think the general tenor of the argument from this side of the House relates to the distribution of Deputies; and the argument, generally speaking, has been that rural areas should have a better tolerance than city areas.  The Minister, when replying to the argument put forward on this side of the House in relation to that, stated that we do not give representation to mountains and valleys. I am sure the Minister will agree that while the most important work of a Deputy in this House must be to deal with legislation nevertheless it is only fair that people in any constituency should have a reasonable opportunity of being able to meet their Deputy. When the case to which the Minister referred came before the High Court I was a witness.  I pointed out that in the smaller constituencies like the city constituencies it was relatively easy for constituents to meet their Deputies, while in some of the rural constituencies constituents had considerable difficulty in contacting their Deputies because of the great physical size of the constituencies.  I think it can be noted in the revision of constituencies that the rural areas have the higher tolerance.  I think the Minister himself, as a Deputy representing a rural area, will recognise <Col N="1089" /> that it would be much fairer if in rural areas the Deputy represented a lesser population, because it would give a better opportunity to the constituents to see their Deputy or to be able to contact the Deputy.  I know it is possible to ring or to write, but I am sure the Minister knows as well as I do that many people much prefer to speak to the Deputy than to phone. For that reason I find it difficult to understand why the Minister, coming as he does from a rural constituency, would have a situation where the areas of denser population have a lower population per Deputy than some of the rural areas.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>It appears that everybody seems to be missing the point. Deputy Faulkner is usually very fair and I am sure he has forgotten or he would not have made the argument, because in my reply to the Second Reading of the Bill I pointed out that this question of representation for areas has been settled by the Constitution, by the courts, and by the people.  The Constitution requires equality of representation throughout the country and makes no distinction whatever between rural and urban areas.  The High Court in 1961 was quite explicit on this point.  It declared that there was no directive whatsoever contained in the Constitution that these matters of difficulties of communication, differing economic interests, differing modes of life or the convenience of constituents or difficulties of Deputies or any of the other matters relied on by the defendant should be taken into consideration when the Legislature was performing its function in enacting the electoral law.  That is what the High Court said.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Five years ago, as Deputies know, an attempt was made to change the Constitution, and it was suggested that matters other than population should be taken into account when distributing Dáil seats.  Again the people rejected the proposal in a referendum in 1968; that is nearly six years ago now.  The question of special rural representation or rural bias in representation has been settled by the Constitution, by the courts and by the people.  I cannot understand <Col N="1090" /> why Deputies on the Opposition benches should continue to make representation as if this House had authority to set aside all these decisions and to create other types of representation.  I know, as Deputy Faulkner says, that the rural Deputy who has to travel many miles to meet constituents has a complaint.  He usually says he would be better off in the city where the city Deputy has his area within three or four streets, until he talks to the city Deputy who tells him there are so many people to deal with that he would far rather to be out in the country.</P>

      <P>The competition is very keen.  There is no question of anybody trying to do a disservice.  My job here as Minister is simply to see that the Constitution and the ruling of the court are carried out.  I am doing that to the best of my ability, and I believe that we have set out the proper way to do it.  I am amazed that the case being made across the floor is being made, because the opposite is what was being said when the Government who were defeated last year were over here.  Deputy Faulkner is quite correct; I was one person who believed that there should be some type of body set up for the purpose of deciding how Dáil seats should be allocated, how the constituencies should be drawn up, but Fianna Fáil did not agree with me, and they outvoted us on motions in this House to that effect.  Surely it is too much to accept that when immediately they go over there&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>Immediately Fianna Fáil went across the floor of the House they saw merit in this proposal. <Col N="1091" /> Five minutes after Deputy Jack Lynch conceded that he lost the election, he said that he thought it was a good idea and it has been echoed more or less by Fianna Fáil Deputies, with exceptions.  As far as we are concerned, we believe that 148 seats, on the basis which we laid down, is what is needed, and that is in section 2 of this Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Mr. Molloy Mr. Molloy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to clear up the Minister's amazement at our argument on this section.  What is involved here is whether the number of seats should be increased by four.  It is all very well for the Minister to inform the House that he has to comply with the Constitution.  We know that a court case which ruled on a constitutional issue in relation to electoral laws and the interpretation of the Constitution gave no direction as to how the tolerance range should be applied, and the Minister who is charged up to now with the task of revising constituencies can operate that tolerance in whatever way he wants.  It is the view of the Fianna Fáil Party&mdash;and this is an argument we are putting before the House and we know it to be the view of many of the Deputies behind the Minister&mdash; that that tolerance range should be operated in favour of those areas where the population is scattered, which is, generally speaking, in the rural areas in Ireland and, generally speaking again, in the western areas.</P>
      <P>Broadly speaking we see no objection to increasing the number of Deputies from 144 to 148.  What we seriously object to is the manner in which the Minister has distributed those four extra seats through this country.  Not alone has he allocated these four seats to one part of the country, the Dublin area, but he has also&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I am afraid Deputy Molloy was either not listening or does not understand my accent.  I thought I had made it clear.  I hope Deputy Molloy will listen now to what was set out in the High Court judgment. A few minutes ago I said that the High Court in 1961 was quite explicit on this point.  It declared that there is no directive whatever contained in the Constitution that these matters of difficulties of communications, differing economic interests, differing roles of life, the convenience of constituents, the difficulties of Deputies or any of the other matters relied on by the defendant at the time should be taken into consideration when the Legislature are performing their function of enacting electoral laws.  Does Deputy Molloy deny that that is a clear statement by the High Court that we cannot give representation to valleys or to wide areas or to long roads which Deputies have to travel?  Is that not a direction to this House that they cannot do that, or does it mean something different to Deputy Molloy from what it means to me?  Surely that is quite clear for <Col N="1093" /> anybody to understand.  The Deputy may as well get two doses together now, because he also said that the Constitution does not so lay it down. The Constitution provides that the population-Deputy ratio shall so far as practicable be the same throughout the country.</P>

I should like to point out to the Minister that when this High Court case was heard I made the very same arguments as I am making now in an endeavour to secure what I felt would be the proper procedure, and that is that in rural areas Deputies should represent a lesser population than in city areas.  It can hardly be said at this stage that I am making the case for purely political reasons.  I made these statements because I felt that that would be the proper thing to do and it would also help to retain intact the county boundaries.</P>

      <P>I accept that it was not.  It is a pity it was not accepted. Nevertheless, I agree with Deputy Molloy in what he says because the judgment referred to by the Minister referred to a much wider situation <Col N="1095" /> than the one we are dealing with here. In so far as the tolerance is concerned, that is within the discretion of the Minister.  The Minister could, if he so wished, decide to have a Deputy in a rural area representing a smaller population within the confines of the tolerance which is allowed.  I should also like to ask the Minister what he had in mind when deciding on the number or the size of the population to be represented by each individual Deputy, because he must have taken something into consideration.  I am sure it would be reasonable to expect that the Minister would have taken into consideration the difficulties in relation to the very large areas in many of the rural constituencies.  He certainly had the discretion to do this if he so wished.</P>

      <P>This is a most important section.  It refers to the number of Deputies in Dáil Éireann.  It says that the membership of Dáil Éireann after the passing of this Act should consist of 148 members.  The Minister in his opening remarks said that the Government decided to increase the number to 148 Members.  It was probably the only section of the Bill on which the Government were unanimous. The House is entitled to know why the Government so decided.  I am worried about this section because no other Member of the Coalition Government, not one backbencher, has spoken in favour of the Bill.  It appears to me that the backbenchers behind the Minister are not in favour of this section of the Bill.  We have not heard a single word from them other than the Minister trying to jackboot his way through the Bill.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dowling</NameTxt>
      <P>I know they will have an opportunity of supporting the Minister in relation to the increase in the number of Deputies.  During the years since I became a Member of this House I have been a member of various committees.  I should like to know from the Minister if the decision of the Government to increase the number of Deputies was because suggestions were made at meetings of the Committee on Procedure and Privileges that specialised committees would be set up in the future.  If that is one of the reasons for increasing the number of Deputies it is a very good one.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It will be necessary in the future to have specialised committees to deal with problems just as there were specialised committees in the past.  If that is one of the reasons for increasing the number of Deputies then it is a very good one.  We have heard also that the Estimates should be taken in committee.  This would be a substantial strain on the existing Members when you take into consideration the various Deputies who are members of such committees and those with other duties in relation to Dáil affairs.  We require to know if <Col N="1097" /> this is one of the factors which has brought about the Government decision to bring in this section.</P>
    <P>There is also the question of the EEC Committee which meets in this House.  It is likely this will be expanded to meet the ever increasing problems of the EEC and this will cause a substantial drain on the number of Members available.  We should be told if this was one of the factors which brought about the Government decision.  I believe this committee will expand in the future and that we will also have an Estimates Committee. We will thus deal with many of these problems outside the House.</P>
    <P>The Dáil must proceed with legislation and with the business of the nation.  Therefore it is necessary to have increased membership of this House.  The Committee on Procedure and Privileges do valuable work.  This committee is likely to have much more work to do in the future than it has done in the past.  With all those committees meeting there is a good reason for expanding the number of Deputies.  If more than one committee meets at the same time this is an extra burden on Members of the House so it is necessary to have increased membership of this House.</P>
    <P>We have the all-Party committee on the Constitution which meets from time to time.  This is likely to be a prolonged affair which may drag on over a considerable period and they may want the views of additional Members of the House.  This committee may expand like the other committees I have spoken of and this will also be a drain on the resources of the House.  This is a good reason for increasing the number of Deputies.  I should like to know if these factors were taken into consideration when the Government decided to insert this section into this Bill.  We have the Committee on Public Accounts, a very important committee, doing a substantial amount of work.  This committee may need to be strengthened in the future.</P>

      <P>In the future, with the volume of money now being spent, the money which we have been promised and the money which the Government have indicated they will spend in the future we will need an expanded Public Accounts Committee to deal with this extra money which the Government are to find somewhere. This will also be an increased burden on the Deputies.  We will, therefore, need additional Members of the House if we are to keep the affairs of the House going.  The Committee on Public Accounts are a year behind with their work and if this committee are to expand their work we can see it will be necessary to have increased representation in this House.</P>
      <P>It was necessary recently to set up a committee to deal with procedure. This committee did very good work and it may happen that the present Government will set up another committee like this.  Such committees are very desirable, and we can see the necessity for increasing the number of Dáil Deputies.  However, we should be told if that is the reason behind the Government decision on this.  The Committee on Dáil Procedure met for a considerable period.</P>

Many Deputies are working on the various committees, but the public who come into the gallery of this House are not aware of this and when they see very few people in the House they complain. I want them to realise the substantial work which is done in these committees.  With the expansion of Dáil committees it is desirable to have an increase in numbers.  The Dáil Committee on Procedure is one instance of the type of committee <Col N="1099" /> which is likely to be set up in the future and which is likely to draw from this House a considerable number of Deputies to specialise in the examination of procedure here.</P>

Therefore, a substantial case can be made for increasing the representation from 144.  It is necessary that we have additional numbers.  If we take the committees I have already mentioned&mdash;the Committee on Dáil <Col N="1100" /> Procedure, the Public Accounts Committee, the Committee on Procedure and Priviliges, the all-Party Committee on the Constitution, the EEC Committee and include also members of the European Parliament&mdash;one can see how Deputies are occupied with various committees.

      <P>It is necessary that we should at least tell the public the reason why we want an increase in representation.  I will be asked to vote for or against this and I want to tell my constituents the reasons why I will vote for it or against it, as the case may be.  A strong case can be made for increased representation but we want the Minister to tell us whether these are factors or whether other factors have been taken into consideration. There was the highly technical committee which sat on the Companies Consolidation Bill.  A number of experts were drawn from various sides of the House for this committee. It would be obvious to people who visited the House when this or other committees were sitting that certain people were missing from the House. However, they were engaged on other work within the confines of Leinster House.  We should show clearly why we need additional personnel here. There was also the Income Tax Consolidation Bill and again a committee met.  It is necessary to have an increase in the number of Deputies but an explanation should be given as to why they are required.  I do not want to make a case on behalf of the Government. I am sure the Minister will be making a case.  So far he has not given any reason as to why one should support section 2.  He should clear the air and tell us the thinking behind this section.  I will have to be convinced that there is this necessity.  The number of committees that sit would be one of the reasons why I would support this section.  If that is not the factor I would have to rethink the situation and possibly speak again and again.  There is no doubt that committees will be set up in the future&mdash;&mdash;</P>

I would not like this section to go through without adequate discussion. As the Minister said, some people think there are too many Deputies in Dáil Éireann.  That may well be and to people who think there are too many it is necessary that we should indicate the necessity for additional personnel.  I hope the Minister will give us a clear indication of the Government's reasons.  I should also like to hear statements from the backbenchers of the Government parties that they are behind this Bill because I believe there was quite a lot of confusion and contention and indeed political gut fights in relation to the compiling of it.</P>

I have argued why there should be an increase in numbers and the reason that might motivate me to support the higher number of Deputies by mentioning the works of the various committees.  On the other side of the coin, I would say that there could be a reduction in the number of Deputies. Again, perhaps the number of the committees already functioning could be reduced; perhaps two committees could do the work of one.  It occurs to me that we could get outside experts to deal with problems such as Dáil reforms instead of draining the resources of the House here needed to ensure the continuity of legislation.

      <P>Deputy Haughey made a case here tonight and he repeated almost word for word&mdash;because he was not making notes&mdash;the arguments of the Committee on the Constitution in December, 1967.  Deputy Dowling came along a few minutes later and he repeated it word for word.  Again, I compliment Deputy Dowling on his memory.  The fact that he repeated it again and again showed that he was not quite sure that he had such a good memory, and he made the same <Col N="1106" /> arguments Deputy Haughey had made earlier.  This was the committee on which I had the honour to sit in 1967. The report was brought out and the then Government did not do anything about it.  Let me repeat what I have said twice tonight already; the move across the floor has made great converts of a lot of Deputies; having gone across they suddenly decide&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Health why an Irish product (name supplied) costing 50p which contains 23 per cent protein and 5 per cent calories per gram was withdrawn from the general medical list of drugs and medicines in favour of a foreign product (name supplied) costing £3 which contains 50 per cent protein and 4 per cent calories per gram; and if, in view of the fact that some doctors regard the Irish product as being at least as good as the foreign product taken in the appropriate amounts, he will make a statement on the matter.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrendanCorish" hpid="Minister for Health (Mr. Corish) Brendan Corish">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Health (Mr. Corish)</NameTxt>
      <P>The Health Act, 1970, provides that a health board shall make arrangements for the supply without charge of drugs, medicines and medical and surgical appliances.  The Irish product mentioned is a food and may not therefore be prescribed as a drug or medicine.  Hence it is not available under the general medical services.</P>
      <P>I have already indicated, in reply to a previous question regarding this product that if a doctor recommends it as a food supplement for an eligible patient health boards have authority to provide it and do so.  In at least one health board area it may be issued to patients by public health nurses without the need for a doctor's recommendation.</P>
      <P>Both products mentioned were being prescribed when the re-organised general medical services came into operation.  When it was clearly established that the Irish product was a food&mdash;and this was widely indicated by the manufacturers&mdash;it was withdrawn from the prescribable list.</P>
      <P>There is another product of the same manufacturers which may be prescribed under the scheme for protein deficiency.</P>
