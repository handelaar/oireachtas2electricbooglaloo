      <P>asked the Taoiseach if it is proposed to issue an up-to-date version of the Constitution incorporating the amendments made by the Fourth and Fifth Amendment of the Constitution Acts, 1972; and, if so, when.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanMoore" hpid="Mr. Moore Mr. Moore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moore</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Taoiseach if any proposals other than those by Members of the Oireachtas have been submitted to him by any organisations in respect of the amendment or the replacement of the Constitution; and if he has directed that these be examined with a view to their adoption by the Government.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LiamCosgrave" hpid="The Taoiseach Liam Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>Such proposals have been made from time to time by various organisations and groups.  The terms of reference of the All-Party Committee on Irish Relations, relate, <i>inter alia,</i> to constitutional matters and, as I have already indicated in reply to parliamentary questions on 28th November, 1973, and 23rd October, 1974, the Government would wish, in the first instance, to consider any proposals which the committee might make in this area.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DavidAndrews" hpid="Mr. Andrews Mr. Andrews">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Andrews</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Taoiseach if he will explain the difference <Col N="10" /> in the salary scale being offered for the post of Director of Public Prosecutions as between male and female applicants.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LiamCosgrave" hpid="The Taoiseach Liam Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The difference applies to professional positions generally, whether new or otherwise, in the Civil Service.  It is being reduced in accordance with the equal pay provisions of the national agreements 1972 and 1974, to which the State, as employer, is party.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Mr. Molloy Mr. Molloy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Taoiseach accept that there is an element of discrimination in having a difference in these salaries?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LiamCosgrave" hpid="The Taoiseach Liam Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, but as I explained to the Deputy the position is that under the two agreements which I have mentioned this differential is being reduced.  The procedure is that the Employer/Labour Conference national agreement, 1972, provided for the removal of 17½ per cent of the former differential from the 1st June, 1973, and the 1974 agreement for the removal of 33? per cent from the 1st of September, 1974, or for a different arrangement by mutual consent between the negotiating parties.  Civil Service pay differentials were reduced under the agreements by 17½ per cent on the 1st of June, 1973, and will be further reduced by 50 per cent from the 1st of December, 1974.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Mr. Molloy Mr. Molloy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Taoiseach not agree that the phasing, such as he has outlined, would be generally acceptable where it was being applied to existing posts, but, where a new post is being created, surely it is a bad principle to start off with discrimination straightaway?  Would not it be better, where a new post is being created, to have the salaries equal?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LiamCosgrave" hpid="The Taoiseach Liam Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>Apparently the pay and salary conditions apply to all posts; they are all governed by the existing arrangements.  The position is that the Anti-Discrimination Pay Bill, 1974, provides for full parity by 31st December next year.  In the meantime, I understand that any further phased reduction of the differential would fall to be negotiated within the terms of the national agreement <Col N="11" /> under the Employer/Labour Conference.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Mr. Molloy Mr. Molloy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="Mr. J. Lynch Mr. J. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Taoiseach indicate if there will be an interview board to interview the candidates deemed to be eligible and would he indicate now who will be the members of that interview board?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LiamCosgrave" hpid="The Taoiseach Liam Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>As the Deputy will appreciate, that is a separate question. However, it is the intention to have an interview board.  As the Deputy knows, the members of the board were specified in the Act and it will consist of certain named persons.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnMKelly" hpid="Mr. Kelly Mr. Kelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>Trade statistics are not compiled on a weekly basis.  Exports of pork and bacon, including hams during October, 1974, amounted to 1,943 metric tons.  The corresponding figure for October, 1973, was 4,143 metric tons.</P>

      <P>Economic policy, under successive Governments, has never emphasised quantitative rather than qualitative aspects of economic growth.  Indeed, the Third Programme prepared under the previous Government's authority, specifically stated that:</P>
      <P>A rise in economic prosperity is of little value for its own sake; it is only valuable if it makes possible, and is used for, an improvement in the quality of life.</P>
      <P>The present Government's views on the qualitative aspects of economic growth were clearly set out in the statement of intent published in February, 1973, by the parties comprising the Government.  This stressed the social goals of economic activity and the actions of the Government since taking office have given evidence of this concern.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Finance if, in view of the OECD recommendation that Ireland should now have a long range strategy for future development, the Government intend to produce such a programme.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I indicated in my budget statement of 3rd April last that the Government had decided that it would not be possible to publish a meaningful development programme for the years ahead in the light of the unsettled world situation. Developments since then have merely added to the uncertainties surrounding the future economic outlook.  The question is, however, under continuing review.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="Mr. J. Lynch Mr. J. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister not agree that it would be in the interests of the country that the Government should put forward certain economic aims and aspirations based on reasonable assumptions?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>The difficulty today is to produce assumptions that could be proved to be reasonable.  Any plan can be only as good as the assumptions made.  As the Deputy is aware, economists are more at variance with one another today than they ever were about the assumptions that can be made for the future because of the multitude of uncertainties that exist across the entire economic scene.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="Mr. J. Lynch Mr. J. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister not agree that the reality of economic assumptions is a hazard of political and economic life?  Having regard to the stated policies of the two components of the Coalition in relation to putting forward a programme or plan, would the Minister not agree that it would not be unreasonable to expect such a plan or a programme from the Government even in the present economic circumstances?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>A number of countries comparable to ours, including Denmark, decided recently not to publish economic programmes because of the uncertainties that exist. When many of the problems now facing the world become more recognisable as to their ultimate implications, then it would be appropriate to issue a plan.  We have not come to a decision not to publish one.  The exercise of revising expectations is continuing all the time and as soon as one can assume with reasonable certainty the pattern of likely performance <Col N="17" /> in the world economic scene a plan will be published.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="Mr. J. Lynch Mr. J. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister not agree that rather than let the economy drift in an aimless sea of uncertainties it is the obligation and duty of the Government to put forward some plan, some realisable economic goals towards which the country could work?  Should there not be some indication to industrialists and others whose responsibility it is to maintain economic growth&mdash;a responsibility in association with the Government, I suggest?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>The easiest thing to do would be to produce a plan but what is entirely different is the task of ensuring that the targets set out in the plan can be attained.  That has become an extremely hazardous matter having regard to the present state of the world economy.  The EEC Commission have had under consideration the preparation of a European plan and, for the same reasons as apply to governments, they cannot see that any useful purpose would be served by the preparation of a plan at the present time on the basis of assumptions that would be speculative in the extreme.</P>

      <P>I raised this matter in a different context at the time Deputy Jim Ryan was Minister for Finance.  Am I correct in stating there are certain regulations regarding the amount of water and flavouring that may be added in the manufacture of cigarettes?

      <P>The cigarettes to which the Deputy is referring are not manufactured here.  There are certain provisions relating to the manufacture of cigarettes here and they are rigidly enforced.  The Deputy's question refers to the importation of certain cigarettes.  The information which he is seeking could not be given without giving confidential information about the affairs of certain firms and I am sure he will accept it would be wrong for any Minister to disclose information which the Revenue Commissioners receive in a confidential way in the ordinary course of their duties.</P>

    <P>
      <Col N="25" /> The commissioners have no proposal to extend the pier at Ballycotton, but they have been requested by the Department of Agriculture and Fisheries to investigate proposals for the provision of a slipway and powered winch and they hope to do this in the coming year.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Kenny</NameTxt>
      <P>A survey team set up by the Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries to examine the fishing ports and landing places in County Cork recommended that an 18-feet-wide slip and a power winch be provided at Ballycotton.  The Department of Agriculture and Fisheries submitted the survey team's recommendations to the Office of Public Works in March, 1972, for detailed investigations, reports and estimates of costs.  A total of 56 locations were recommended for improvement.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Kenny</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose, with the permission of the Ceann Comhairle, to take Questions Nos. 25 and 26 together.</P>
      <P>The Commissioners of Public Works have not taken any action resulting in the diminution of the amenities of Dún Laoghaire harbour and there is no question of CIE closing any part of the harbour.  The Commissioners have no proposal to introduce automatic railway gates at the West Pier nor have they power to do so.  Such gates would not be needed to preserve any existing amenity there.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoelTLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not know why these two questions should be taken together.  Can the Parliamentary Secretary say whether the development work being undertaken by the Office of Public Works to cater for multipurpose ships will interfere with the amenities of the harbour?</P>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Kenny Mr. Kenny">

    <Speaker pid="NoelTLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I hope not.  Some years ago there were proposals whereby CIE would instal electrically controlled continental type gates on the railway at the West Pier.  People who want to use the West Pier at the weekends often find it necessary to go about three-quarters of a mile up the road and down again if they wish to get there.  I am only talking of a <Col N="27" /> pedestrian gate and it is an amenity that should be provided.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Kenny Mr. Kenny">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kenny</NameTxt>
      <P>An amenity for cars?</P>

    <Speaker pid="NoelTLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, cars and boats and other things that use the harbour &mdash;to allow them in and out without having to keep a man in attendance who could not be there all the time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Kenny Mr. Kenny">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kenny</NameTxt>
      <P>As far as I know, existing amenities are not threatened by the absence of a gate.  If you provide an automatic gate you attract vehicular traffic through those gates and in the end you would be as badly off.  It is as bad to be burned as scalded.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoelTLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>The Parliamentary Secretary must be aware that there is a large area there suitable for car parking and that these amenities are not being fully used because this gate is closed so often.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Kenny Mr. Kenny">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kenny</NameTxt>
      <P>The provision of a gate would attract more traffic and the less traffic you have on that end of the pier the better.  People can enjoy themselves by going up the road and coming down again.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoelTLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>But they have to get into it.  Going beyond the Parliamentary Secretary's area of responsibility, as you proceed from the West Pier northwards you are coming on to sandy beaches and if those gates were automatic these amenities would be opened up both in the Parliamentary Secretary's area of responsibility and that of the Minister for Transport and Power.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Kenny</NameTxt>
      <P>As I indicated in the course of a reply to supplementaries to a previous question by the Deputy on 19th July, 1973, an application was made on behalf of an oil company for a lease of the entire Fort Lenan property. That project is not being pursued and in the circumstances it is proposed to dispose of the fort proper and appurtenant lands.  All interested parties would, of course, have an opportunity of bidding for the property. It is also proposed to proceed with negotiations for the disposal to the sitting tenants of the land lying to the east of the fort.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cunningham</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not interested in the disposal of the land at the moment, although it is something which the Office of Public Works must deal with.  What I am really worried about is the deterioration of the buildings.  I would urge that the buildings be disposed of or that the Parliamentary Secretary accede to the current requests that this property be given to local organisations for use, even temporarily.

      <NameTxt>Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries (Mr. Clinton)</NameTxt>
      <P>No.  Over the next three months the rate of premium on eligible cattle exported to continental member States will increase steadily from £10.78 per head to £26.40 per head.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardCollins" hpid="Mr. G. Collins Mr. G. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>No.  doubt the Minister is aware of the glut existing in the factories; they cannot take in the number of cattle being offered to them. Would the Minister say, if the full premium were being paid for these cattle mentioned in the question, that would ease somewhat the pressure on the factories at present?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MarkAClinton" hpid="Mr. Clinton Mr. Clinton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Clinton</NameTxt>
      <P>I have serious doubt about that, because I do not think that is the restriction.  On 6th November the Community average price was £26.92, and in Ireland it was £11.36.  Therefore, there is a very substantial margin there.  Even if you make allowance for <Col N="38" /> the £4 per cwt. for the accession compensatory amount and, say, £2.50 for transport, there is still a substantial margin between the market price here and the market price on the Continent.</P>

I am sure he is aware that the cattle that would be exported, that would be more or less the finished article, at that period were making from £14 to £16 per cwt. and in some extreme cases a little bit over it.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware that our exports to the Continent this year are very considerably down on previous years?  At the time I put down this question there was only a total of 17,000 head of cattle in 1974 as against 63,000 the year before, and 100,000 the year before that.  Therefore, something is seriously inhibiting our export of fat cattle to the Continent.  If the Minister has agreed to pay the amount of the FEOGA money as a subsidy for <Col N="39" /> the export of fat cattle to the Continent, does he not thereby recognise that that subsidy is worthwhile; and if half the subsidy is worthwhile would the full subsidy not be twice as much worthwhile?

    <Speaker pid="MarkAClinton" hpid="Mr. Clinton Mr. Clinton">

      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>If there is a question of over-supply and the Minister recognises that a subsidy is of some benefit in that situation by granting the amount of the FEOGA subsidy, is that not a tacit admission that a full subsidy would be much more valuable, and why then would he not grant the full subsidy?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MarkAClinton" hpid="Mr. Clinton Mr. Clinton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Clinton</NameTxt>

      <P>Milk producers can expect a substantial increase in their returns for milk in 1975 as compared with this year.  I have taken steps to bring this to their notice in conjunction with a campaign of publicity currently being conducted by An Bord Bainne on behalf of the dairy industry with the aim of encouraging an increase in milk production in the coming year.</P>

      <P>The Deputy will accept that this year the average price for milk was 23½p.  On top of that we got 4½p in October.  I know that the milk supply for the year was practically ended then and it left only 10 per cent to get this increase.  However, that brought the average for the year up to 24p.  The average for next year will be increased by that amount, which will be more than 28p, and in the new pricing arrangements that are coming up we can expect a further increase of some sort.  That will bring the price of milk next year to something in excess of 30p per gallon.  That is a good price and should be sufficiently attractive to induce people to go into milk production.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Leonard</NameTxt>

It is a drafting point and it is also a technical point.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to ask the Minister about the position in regard to the appropriate day, which is defined in this section.  As I read it, the appropriate day is related to the coming into operation of section 13. As I read it also, section 13 will be brought into operation by order under section 36, subsection (3).  That subsection provides:</P>
      <P>This Act shall come into operation on such day or days as may be fixed therefor by any order or orders of the Minister, either generally or with reference to any particular purpose or provision and different days may be so fixed for different purposes and different provisions...</P>
      <P>The subsection gives the Minister power to bring all or different portions of the Bill into operation by order. We have the position that the appropriate day means the day on which section 13 will come into operation, presumably by virtue of an order made under subsection (3) of section 36.  That, to me, seems to be a bit convoluted because section 13 is possibly the most important section in the Bill.  It is a section under which the functions are taken from the Minister and transferred to the new board.  That is really the basic purpose of this piece of legislation and it, therefore, seems to me that the appropriate day should be made by order of the Minister direct.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="54" /> If it is sufficiently important to have the establishment day defined specifically by order, surely in relation to the appropriate day on which section 13&mdash; the very important fundamental section 13&mdash;comes into operation, the right thing would have been to appoint the appropriate day by order.</P>
    <P>I am reinforced in that opinion when I read in subsection (5) of section 13 the following words:</P>
    <P>The functions of the Minister under section 29 of the Principal Act are hereby transferred to the Board and without prejudice to the generality of subsection (8) of this section the references in the said section 29 to the Minister shall each be construed as referring to the Board.</P>
    <P>It would seem to me that the day section 13 is passed, the day it becomes law, it will carry with it, by virtue of subsection (5), this transfer of power.  If that is so, why do we need to have an appropriate day made by order under section 36?  Perhaps the Minister would clear my mind on these various aspects.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Haughey is correct about the day on which it is passed, but I am quite sure he understands that the board will be in operation for a period before they will take up their duties.  You cannot appoint a board today and expect them to start off immediately tomorrow dealing with different matters. They must familiarise themselves with the matters which they will be considering.  While I see the point Deputy Haughey has been making&mdash; I know the Bill is long&mdash;if he reads all the sections together he will understand that legally the phraseology used is correct.  He need have no fear that any mistake has been made.</P>

    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">

    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>I have two points here.  One is concerned with the drafting.  It would have been much better and neater if the Minister had said: &ldquo;I will appoint the establishment day by order and I will appoint <Col N="55" /> the appropriate day by order.&rdquo; Then we would be much more clear on where we stood.  Apart from that, there is the additional difficulty that subsection (5) of section 13 would seem to say that the moment section 13 comes into operation subsection (5) will in itself transfer to the board certain powers, the powers of the Minister under section 29 of the Principal Act.  Is there not room for discrepancy there?  The board might not have been brought into being.  The establishment day might not have been appointed to bring the board into being under the Act when subsection (5) of section 13 would purport to transfer powers to the board.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not know why Deputy Haughey should imagine that any Minister would do what he has suggested because it would be a very foolish thing to do.  Naturally the order must be made before it would be possible to transfer powers to the board.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>In other words, the Minister is quite clear that he must make an order under section 2, I think it is, appointing the establishment day for the board and bringing the board into being before subsection (5) of section 13 will operate to transfer powers to the board.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to clarify it for Deputy Haughey because apparently he has misunderstood something.  I am not quite sure what it is.</P>

    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to know what the Deputy is misunderstanding, too, but I am afraid he has not explained it to me.  I will try to explain it and perhaps Deputy Haughey will then tell me where exactly the lines are crossed.  The appropriate day is the day on which section 13 of this Bill comes into operation.  This will be the day on which the board, as provided for in section 3, take over the decisions function in relation to the appeals.  Section 13, in common with the other sections, will be brought <Col N="56" /> into operation by a commencement order of the Minister under section 36. The appropriate day is referred to in section 13 (7), section 19 (1), (2), (2) (b) and section 21 (3) (a).  The establishment day is the day so appointed by order of the Minister under section 2, as Deputy Haughey says, and the board will be legally established from that day but it will take over responsibility for the appellate functions only from the day on which section 13 is brought into force. Does that clarify the position?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>I want the Minister to be clear on this in case he is not. It means that the order must be made appointing the establishment day for the board before the rest of the Act can be brought into operation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>That is not unusual, as Deputy Haughey knows perhaps better than anybody else, in Bills before this House.</P>

    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>It is somewhat complicated and convoluted, I suggest, to have subsection (5) of section 13 operating the moment section 13 comes into operation to transfer certain powers to the board and that board can only be established by order appointing an establishment day under the same Bill.  It would be much better all round if it had been left quite clearly and striaghtforwardly establishing the establishment day by order and establishing the appropriate day by order and leaving it clearcut like that.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>

If we had finished with it long ago, some of the amendments which were put down last night and this morning would not have been introduced.  I am sure Deputy Haughey will appreciate the humour of this because of section 42 (b) of the last Land Act which was passed here and the fact that if it had been passed through the House when it should have been, a very important section would have been left out.

      <P>&mdash;&mdash;from falling into any legislative traps.  It is quite clear that before he can make an order under this Bill establishing the day to bring the board into being, the Act must be in operation.  Correct?  You cannot make an order under this Bill until the Act is in operation.  You have got to bring the Act into operation by virtue of an order under section 36 and, if your order under section 36 brings the whole Act into operation, then you will have the anomalous position of subsection (5) of section 13 transferring powers to a board which does not exist because you have not been able to make the establishment order bringing it into being.  It seems to me that the inevitable logic of this situation is that, by virtue of this convoluted draftsmanship, you will have to make an order bringing the Act into operation only in so far as it would enable you to make an order to have an establishment day and only then will you be able to make another order bringing into operation the portion of the Act which includes section 13.  I think I am absolutely correct in that.</P>

      <P>Deputy Haughey is not correct.  I would refer him to the Interpretation Act, 1937.  Section 10 (1) says:</P>
      <P>Where an Act of the Oireachtas or any particular enactment contained in any such Act is expressed to come into operation on a day subsequent to the date of the passing of such Act, the following provisions shall have effect, that is to say:&mdash;</P>
      <P>(a) if the day on which such Act or such enactment (as the case may be) comes into operation is to be fixed or ascertained in any particular manner, the instrument, act, or thing whereby such day is fixed or ascertained may, subject to any restrictions imposed by such Act, be made or done at any time after the passing of such Act;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>(b) if such Act confers a power to make or do, for the <Col N="59" /> purposes of such Act or such enactment (as the case may be), any instrument, act, or thing the making or doing of which is necessary or expedient to enable such Act or enactment to have full force and effect immediately upon its coming into operation, such power may, subject to any restrictions imposed by such Act, be exercised at any time after the passing of such Act.</P>

      <P>I have been aware of that.  To make an order establishing the board, the Minister will have to have that portion of the Act which enables him to make the order establishing the board in operation. Therefore, to make that order he must bring that portion of the Act into operation.  When making that, he must exclude section 13 at least from that first order, otherwise there will be the absurd position of subsection (5) of section 13 conferring powers on a board which does not exist.</P>

      <P>I want to discuss it. I suggest that we substitute &ldquo;31st March, 1975&rdquo;, for &ldquo;31st December, 1974&rdquo; in my amendment.  This amendment was put down in March, 1974.  At that time it seemed perfectly reasonable to suggest that the Minister appoint the board and make an order establishing it before 31st December of this year.  As Deputy Molloy pointed out frequently, we on this side of the House are very anxious that this legislation be enacted.  We acknowledge that the legislation in Government planning needs to be amended and improved in certain respects.  Therefore, on the whole, we welcome the Minister's proposals.</P>
      <P>We are anxious that this new board be brought into being as quickly as possible and the powers be transferred from the Minister to the board.  I put down this amendment so that the House would enjoin on the Minister the necessity of establishing this board before the end of the year.  In March that seemed a perfectly reasonable proposition.  This Government have been dilatory in bringing in legislation.  I excuse this Minister in this regard because he brought in some legislation.  In fact, if it were not for him, there would not have been anything before us.  Admittedly his major legislation was&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>This very important legislation has been on the books since the beginning of the year.  The Minister, I know, wants it passed as much as we do.  It is only now in November that we are getting around to dealing with it.  This is a very serious reflection on the efficiency of the legislative machinery of this Government.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>We can talk about that too, if the Minister wants.</P>
      <P>This Bill should have been in operation long ago.  As I said, when I put down my amendment in March and proposed that the Minister should be compelled to establish a board before the end of the year, that was reasonable.  I recognise that at this stage it would be completely unreasonable to ask the House to place on the Minister a compulsion to establish the board before 31st December, 1974.  Accordingly, I do not want to press the amendment in its exact terms.  In my view the Minister should accept some limitation on himself in this regard.  I think the 31st March, 1975, would be reasonable.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We all know there is a temptation when a Minister has got legislation on <Col N="62" /> the statute books for himself or his Department to recognise that that is the end of that job.  Of course, it is not. The detailed work must then be done &mdash;the selection of people and the appointing of a competent board.  That is very important.  It is not as easy as some people might think if a Minister is conscientious and serious about the kind of board he wants to establish.  It is important that he start work on that immediately the Bill is passed.  In my opinion we are not unreasonable in asking the Minister to give us an undertaking in this section that he will do this within a reasonable period.  I suggest 31st March next.  If the Minister is prepared to accept that, I would be prepared to withdraw my amendment on the basis that he would bring in such an amendment on Report Stage.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>The trouble about this is that Deputy Haughey is asking me to name a date.  While I have no objection to picking any date, let it be 31st December or 31st March, the Deputy knows what happens when matters of this kind are being debated here.  Deputy Haughey, when discussing another Bill, helped to make it better.  I hope when this Bill is going through, he will help to make it a better one too.  I will accept reasonable amendments.  He also knows that there is no guarantee from his side of the House that the Bill will be allowed to go through before 31st March.  To get the Bill through this House, and the Seanad, I hope will be easy, but I have my doubts.  Deputy Haughey has almost 100 amendments down.  There are 129 amendments, five of which arrived in the last 24 hours.  I have no idea whether somebody is looking up another dozen amendments to be put in inside the next couple of weeks.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FlorenceCrowley" hpid="Mr. Crowley Mr. Crowley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Crowley</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister disagree with amendments?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>I neither agree or disagree with amendments before we debate them in the House.  At present they are simply amendments and until they are debated in the House I will not know what the people who have tabled them mean.  I want this debate to go on on a reasonable basis, but it <Col N="63" /> is not reasonable for Deputy Haughey to suggest that I must pick a date because we have not been bringing in legislation.  We have brought in, and dealt with, more legislation in the last 12 months than was dealt with in the 12 months prior to Fianna Fáil's departure from office.</P>
      <P>The first Planning Bill was passed by the Dáil in 1963.  In 1968 a Private Members' Bill was introduced in this House, dealing with this matter, but this was withdrawn on a promise by a Fianna Fáil Minister for Local Government that he would introduce a Planning Bill.  Deputy Haughey has blamed me because this Bill has been knocking around for five or six months, but the Deputy will agree that if there had not been a change of Government such a Planning Bill would not have seen the light of day for the next ten or 12 years I make that statement having judged the record of the last Government.  I want to be reasonable about this.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FlorenceCrowley" hpid="Mr. Crowley Mr. Crowley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Crowley</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Haughey stated he appreciated that I was anxious to have this Bill passed.  I am very anxious because there are certain things happening which should not happen and will not happen when this Bill becomes law.  The only way we can have those things dealt with is by having a smooth passage of the Bill in this House.  I do not mean that I am objecting to points being criticised by the Opposition because that is their job if they feel something is wrong.  If they feel something can be improved, it is their duty to say so but there should not be criticism for the sake of criticising.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On Second Stage I announced that I was prepared to accept reasonable amendments which would improve the Bill and that offer is still open.  As far as I am concerned it is not the Government, or I, as Minister, who will make this a good Bill.  This House will make this a good Bill, and that is the way I want it.  We can only do that if we do not try to cod each other.  There is a danger that a certain <Col N="64" /> amount of acrimony will creep into this with the result that the Bill will be long drawn out and would not have the desired effect.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FlorenceCrowley" hpid="Mr. Crowley Mr. Crowley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Crowley</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister should desist immediately from that practice.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to be of assistance to the Minister.  It is important that we put into this section a restriction on the time which can elapse before the Minister establishes this board.  This House, and the Seanad, will pass this legislation which will eventually be signed by the President, whoever that may be, but nothing of significance will happen until the Minister makes an order establishing the board.  This Bill is all about establishing this board. I want the House to put a restriction on the Minister as to the time we will allow him to establish this board.  If we do not put in this amendment, then the Minister need not establish the board or he could take up to 12 months to do so.  The Minister could nullify the legislation we will pass by not making the order appointing the establishment day.</P>
      <P>The House will give the Minister this legislation, and there is no doubt about that, because we want to see this Bill introduced just as much as the Minister does.  We will give him this Bill as expeditiously as we can, but we are going to discuss it in detail because it is a very important piece of legislation.  We will bring all the intelligence and skill we have to bear on this in order to help the Minister to have a first class piece of legislation passed by this House, not like the Finance Act which we never had a chance to examine properly.  We have an opportunity to examine this legislation properly.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When this Bill is passed the Minister will have to approach the Government to establish this board. I want him to be in a position to say to the Government that his proposal must be agreed because he is statutorily bound to establish the board by <Col N="65" /> 31st March.  In my view this amendment will strengthen the Minister's hand and help him achieve the primary purpose of this legislation, the establishing of this board.  If this restrictive clause is inserted in the section, the Government will not be able to fob the Minister off by saying that there are more urgent things to be done.  The Minister will be in a strong position to inform the Government that he is statutorily compelled to form this board by 31st March.</P>
    <P>I do not think the Minister should resist my suggestion because otherwise we, and the Minister, will have no guarantee that the primary purpose of this legislation will be achieved in any sort of reasonable time.</P>

      <P>Although I have no strong feelings about the point of view put forward by Deputy Haughey&mdash;in a sense I agree with him that it would be quite wrong if a Minister were to abuse the power given him by an Act by failing to bring it into force&mdash;I thought I heard the Deputy agreeing that the Minister was anxious to have the Act in force.  While there is no guarantee of permanence in the tenure of any particular individual of any particular office, I am sure the same is true of any Minister for Local Government who will find himself with this Act.  However, I cannot accept the points of view advanced by the Deputy in support of what he said when he appeared to use his amendment as a peg on which to hang a criticism of the Government for their failure to bring forward legislation.  I should like to give the House an explanation of the time schedule into which the Bill fell.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Second Stage was completed&mdash; I am speaking from memory&mdash;in June. Around that time a flood of Bills arrived here and I can remember Deputy Brennan being inclined to scoff at the idea that these Bills would be finished by the summer.  This House has had experience of what happened in battles between the Minister and the Opposition spokesman for Local Government, Deputy Molloy, and it was evident that where <Col N="66" /> there were nine or ten other Bills waiting for passage, some of them fairly important and urgent, there was no point in launching on to the trackless ocean of Committee Stage of the Planning Bill.  Had we done this it would have meant that no other Bills would have been handled.</P>
    <P>Quite deliberately the Planning Bill was taken out of the immediate programme and the other legislation was dealt with expeditiously.  This House, in the period October, 1973 to July, 1974, passed 36 or 37 Bills, which is not far off a record in recent decades.</P>

I want to kill the untruth that this Government have been lackadaisical or slack in bringing forward legislation.  So far from that being the case, almost a record was achieved last year in regard to the passage of legislation sponsored by Ministers or Parliamentary Secretaries who had no previous experience of sponsoring legislation in either House.  That parliamentary period of October, 1973, to July, 1974, included, among the Bills, the marathon debate on the Bill on constituency revision&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>I just want to say that the Parliamentary Secretary has come in here tendentiously to try to side-track us into an acrimonious debate on the non-event of the parliamentary legislative programme of this Government and I am strongly tempted to debate that issue with him. However, in deference to the Minister, who wants to get on with this legislation, I will refrain from doing so.  I should like the Minister to understand that we on this side are exercising restraint in the face of gross provocation by the Parliamentary Secretary who succeeds time and again in turning this House into a shambles by his <i>ex parte</i> interventions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>He has misinterpreted the case I have been making for my amendment. I have a perfectly valid case which I want to hear the Minister himself deal with&mdash;he is the competent person to deal with it.  My case is that it would be desirable for the House to put into this legislation <Col N="69" /> a limitation on the Minister on the bringing into being of the new board, because it will help him to get his new board through the machinery of the Government.  I know enough about the mechanics of government to know it is not always an easy matter to get a new board like this approved, to get the personnel approved by the Government and the machinery operative.  It is my belief that the Minister's hand will be strengthened if we put into this Bill an obligation on him to have the board established by 31st March next. That is a perfectly reasonable proposal. Apart from anything else, it is good legislative practice, when we are giving the Minister this power, to say to the Minister: &ldquo;You have this power to establish this board but we want you to do it in a reasonable period of time.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>If the Minister thinks 31st March is too soon&mdash;it might be, allowing for the fact that it has to get through this House, which may be a long procedure, particularly if the Parliamentary Secretary comes in; it has to get through the Seanad and perhaps come back to us&mdash;perhaps he might like to suggest some other date.  I am prepared to accept that, but we should put some date into this section compelling the Minister to get the board into operation by that date.  Just one final point I would make in reply to the tendentious intervention of the Parliamentary Secretary, whose job as Chief Whip should be to expedite the business of the House and not to be coming in here interrupting the business&mdash;&mdash;</P>

Possibly Deputy Haughey has overlooked something in regard to this amendment.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>I shall not go any further than that.  I have had comparatively short experience in this House but I can remember&mdash;to take an instance which Deputy Haughey produced a moment ago&mdash;the Finance Bill during the summer when it was fairly and squarely agreed between the Opposition spokesmen on Finance, the Opposition Whip and myself, that the Committee Stage would be completed in three days.  The early sections and amendments to that Bill were made into such a horse's collar that we had to sit all night in the end, which made this House into a real shambles.  Anybody who spent the night here will know that that is exactly how to describe it.  The fault for that lies entirely on an Opposition which is unable to make up its mind how long it is going to take to deal with or process a particular piece of legislation and which changes its mind to suit what it thinks to be its humour or convenience from moment to moment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="73" /> If we get that kind of behaviour with regard to the Planning Bill, we will be making a very bad start, and I refuse to carry the blame for that. If we get that kind of treatment on the Planning Bill it may very well be that it will not have passed both Houses, or have come back to this House with whatever amendments the Seanad may make, by 30th June.  The Minister will then be in the position to which he adverted, of perhaps being obliged to ask for an amendment on account of the fact that it has been unreasonably held up.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 2:</P>
      <P>In page 3, between lines 34 and 35, to insert the following section before section 4:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;4.&mdash;(1)  The chairman of the Board shall be either&mdash;</P>
      <P>(a)  such judge of the High Court as is for the time being nominated with his consent by the Government, or</P>
      <P>(b)  a person who is a former judge of the High Court and is appointed by the Government.</P>
      <P>(2)  If immediately before the exercise by the Government of a power under subsection (1) of this section there is in force a nomination under that subsection, then on the exercise the nomination shall cease to have effect.</P>
      <P>(3)  A judge of the High Court who is chairman of the Board shall on ceasing to be a judge of the High Court also cease to be chairman of the Board.</P>
      <P>(4)  A person who ceases to be chairman of the Board by virtue of subsection (3) of this section may be appointed under subsection (1) of this section&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is proposed to insert a new section <Col N="74" /> before section 4.  The functions of the board are important and the Government, having given careful consideration to the question of the chairmanship felt there were various considerations both in favour of and against the appointment of a judge. But the guiding principle is that justice must not only be done but must also be seen to be done.  Accordingly, the new section provides for the appointment of a judge, or former judge, of the High Court as chairman.</P>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>We welcome the Minister's amendment in this regard. The House will notice that, on this side of the House, we put down an amendment in my name which would have enacted that the chairman of the board would be a judge of the Supreme Court, the High Court or Circuit Court to be nominated by the Chief Justice.  May I ask are both amendments being discussed together?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>In principle my amendment is the same as that of the Minister.  Whatever the malicious promptings that might come from behind him, I think the Minister would not deny that in putting down his amendment, he has adopted the principle enshrined in mine.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>Considered.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>Considered the principle.  I would have thought that I would be using proper parliamentary phraseology if I said the Minister is meeting me with his amendment.  In my amendment I wanted to have a judge appointed as chairman of this board.  Mind you, I could quote a very good precedent for that proposal because, in a measure which I think the Fine Gael Party put forward when in Opposition, they enshrined that principle, that of a judge being chairman of a board.  The case for appointing a judge can be very strongly argued because this board will certainly be exercising judicial functions.  It will be taking decisions very closely related to the sort of decisions the courts must take.  It is very important that somebody <Col N="75" /> with judicial experience and knowledge should preside over this new board.</P>
      <P>Of course, there is a very fundamental difference between my proposal and that of the Minister, in that I wanted the person to be nominated by the Chief Justice.  In making that proposal I was influenced by the fact that the Chief Justice is responsible for the efficient operation of our courts. He has to allocate judges to the different branches of the work of the courts; he has to apportion the work between the judges at his disposal and he has a very serious responsibility in that regard.  Therefore, it seemed to me that it would be only fair&mdash;if we were going to call on a judge to do this work&mdash;that the Chief Justice would be the person to decide which judge should be appointed because he would know better than anybody else, perhaps, what judge would be most suited to this type of work, from the point of view of training, temperament and experience. Also, with his knowledge of the workings of the courts and the manner in which the work of the courts is allocated between the different judges, he would be best fitted to know what judge could most easily be allocated to this function.  All in all, it seemed to me there was a very strong case to be made for asking the Chief Justice to make this nomination on the one hand, from the point of view of the courts themselves and on the other with a view to ensuring that the best type of judge be appointed to take over the running of this new board.</P>
      <P>It is no harm to point out at this stage that this will be a vitally important board.  This board will take decisions of fundamental importance and significance.  These decisions will be important from the point of view of our environment, surroundings, the growth and development of our towns and cities and, from the conservation point of view, this will be a vital institution.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The board will be taking decisions of vital commercial significance; some of them will mean the gain or loss of hundreds of thousands or even millions <Col N="76" /> of pounds in certain circumstances.  It is necessary that I should point out now the fundamental importance of the board and, therefore, how legitimate it is for Members on both sides to insist that the new chairman be a person of the highest standing, competence and qualifications.  I am very glad the Minister has met us in this regard.  In fairness I must say that we were probably pushing an open door with regard to this matter.  Even though the Bill as put forward originally did not envisage a judicial person to be appointed as chairman, once we drew attention to the matter the Minister immediately accepted our viewpoint.  We welcome that and acknowledge he has met us in that way.</P>
    <P>I should like to hear the Minister's views on the fact that the Chief Justice will not now be the person to nominate the judge to be chairman. I wonder if there is some case in the Minister's amendment for putting in a provision to the effect that the Chief Justice would have to be consulted? I notice that the person will be appointed by the Government, not by the Minister.  While welcoming in principle the Minister's amendment, I should like to hear his thinking on the matter and how he sees it in operation.</P>
    <P>Another question that arises in connection with the new proposal is how it will affect the workings of the courts.  I understand that the judges are pretty fully occupied at the moment.  Is it the intention to appoint another judge to the High Court to enable this additional task to be fitted into their work schedules without any dislocation of these schedules?  I should like to hear the Minister's comments on this matter.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>Of course the Deputy is correct in saying that the President of the High Court or the Chief Justice must be consulted.  The question of appointing a judge was suggested in a Private Member's Bill and, therefore, it is not something new.  Although it was proposed by the Opposition, it is generally agreed we had it in mind but we wanted to see the general attitude.  In fact, it <Col N="77" /> was suggested by a member of the Opposition that a judge should be the last person to be appointed; someone suggested it should be a person with normal associations who would be closer to the position than a judge. This was suggested by a fairly high-ranking member of the Opposition but perhaps Deputy Haughey was not present when this happened.  In any event, we agree that the person should be a judge or a former judge and I think this is the proper way to deal with the matter.  Incidentally, the appointment will be made by the Government, not by the Minister for Local Government.  Again, this is the correct thing to do.</P>
      <P>The question was raised whether somebody would be appointed to replace the judge.  This would be a matter for the Department of Justice but, as Deputy Haughey is aware, an additional judge was appointed last year and I am sure if a vacancy occurs there will be an appointment. This is my personal opinion and, naturally, I cannot give a decision on what the Government would do on the matter.  However, if we take someone for this job, a person who will be working full-time, a vacancy will exist and that will have to be filled. I thank Deputy Haughey for the reasonable way he dealt with the matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister has indicated that naturally the President of the High Court or the Chief Justice, or both, will have to be consulted by the Government before a judge is asked to take this task.  I gather from the wording that a serving judge will be appointed and that the provision about a person who is a former judge of the High Court is primarily there to enable a judge to carry on as chairman&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>I should not like the Deputy to take that interpretation because it may not happen.  As the amendment suggests, it is one or the other.  I should not like to tie myself or future Ministers to do something not spelled out in the section.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>Subsection (4) states:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="78" /> A person who ceases to be chairman of the Board by virtue of subsection (3) of this section&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <P>that means a person who ceases to be chairman because he has been disqualified by ceasing to be a judge of the High Court&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <P>may be appointed under subsection (1) of this section.</P>
    <P>That seems to indicate that the thinking behind paragraph (b), subsection (1) of the new section is that as a matter of practice the chairman will be a serving judge but that this protection is put into the new section; if he ceases to be a serving judge he automatically ceases to be chairman of the board but we reserve the right to appoint a person who is a retired judge to be chairman.  That appears to be inserted to ensure that if a judge is acting as chairman and if he ceases to be a judge on age grounds or for some other reason, even though he is automatically disqualified from being chairman he may be reappointed.</P>
    <P>I should like the Minister to confirm that the main emphasis will be on appointing a sitting judge.  All of us are anxious to get that assurance from the Minister.  If I remember correctly the age limit for judges is pretty high; I think it is 72 years for a Supreme Court judge and 70 years for a High Court judge.  I do not wish to cast any aspersions on their competence after they retire but I should not like to think that as a matter of practice we would appoint a retired judge.  I should like to hear from the Minister that basically he is thinking in terms of appointing a serving judge and that the proviso in paragraph (b) subsection (1) is largely intended to enable a person to continue as chairman in the event of his retiring as a judge.</P>
    <P>Perhaps the Minister will elaborate more fully on the situation regarding the availability of judges for this appointment.  Is he satisfied that the situation at the moment is such that he could take a judge out of the existing complement and appoint him to this extra work?  Does he think it will be necessary to enlarge the number of judges?  We would like to know <Col N="79" /> a little more about that because it is important.  The Minister knows better than anybody else that this board will be occupied full-time if they are to take away a great deal of work from the Minister personally.</P>

Therefore, we shall have to consider the appointment to the High Court of an additional judge who would be allocated fully to this task.  Perhaps the Minister would give us his views on these aspects.</P>

      <P>Deputy Haughey is as aware as anybody else that we are hardly likely in the foreseeable future to be faced with a situation in which there would not be people available for appointment as judges.  Therefore, we can be assured that if it is found necessary to appoint extra judges, these appointments will be made.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Haughey will appreciate that we have had long experience of the appointment of judges and that we always do the right thing. The reason for the provision here for the nomination of an existing judge is that Article 35.3. of the Constitution provides that no judge shall hold any other office or position of emolument. Subsection (1) of the section before us provides for a judge being <Col N="80" /> nominated and for a former judge being appointed.  Judges continue to work to a fairly advanced age and while I cannot say definitely to Deputy Haughey that under no circumstances would a former judge be appointed, my personal opinion is that if we are to have somebody to do the job, it would be a serving judge.  Incidentally, last year the Government introduced a regulation which was considered to have been rather good, that was, that people appointed to various types of boards and who were receiving emoluments of any kind would not be entitled to continue after the age of 70.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>It is my personal opinion that that was a foolish regulation.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Haughey is endeavouring to have it both ways.  He was objecting to the appointment of a former judge because of the question of age but says, at the same time, that it would be all right to have people of more than 70 years of age on boards.  However, so far as the situation before us is concerned it is not likely that the chairman would be somebody who would be more than 70.  Therefore, if it is decided to appoint a judge or former judge, my personal opinion would be that the appointee would be a serving judge. I am sorry that I cannot be more specific on this.  The amendment here provides for the appointment of either a judge or a former judge.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>I would not be responsible for that appointment but I would imagine that as has been the practice in the past, when a judge was required he was appointed without delay.  I have no reason to think that this would not continue to be the case. All Governments must do this.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not wish to appear supercritical but I would have thought it wise for the Minister for Justice, acting on behalf of the Government and of the Minister for Local Government, to have had talks with the President of the High Court for the purpose of ascertaining what is involved here&mdash;whether the President would be able to make a judge available readily or whether the appointment of a new judge would be necessary.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>I am surprised that Deputy Haughey should dwell on this point.  We all know that if a judge dies somebody else is appointed to fill the vacancy so created.  In the case of a judge being taken away to act as chairman of the board we are discussing, the likely course would be that somebody else would be appointed to take his place.  We need have no doubt as to this matter being dealt with in the normal way.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>It is not a normal matter.  It is an entirely new departure. Here we are going to take a judge of the High Court who, up to now we must accept is fully occupied in dealing with the volume of business coming before him, and appoint him to a rather full-time job elsewhere.  It seems to me that the nature of this new job is such that the judge who will be appointed chairman will be practically unavailable for normal judicial duties in the High Court.  Is that also the Minister's view?  Has the President of the High Court been consulted and, if so, is he of the opinion that the situation is such that he can <Col N="82" /> spare readily a High Court judge for this task or will he say to the Government that if they want one of his judges for this board, he will have to have an additional judge to do the work of the High Court?  We are entitled to have answers to these questions.</P>
      <P>Further, is it the opinion of the Minister that the judge who will be appointed to the new board will be able to undertake normal judicial duties in the High Court?  Will he be available to the President of the High Court for any work or will he spend half of his time acting as chairman of the board and the other half on normal judicial duties?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>There are so many hypothetical questions there that it would be impossible for anyone to attempt to answer them.  The Deputy knows that I cannot decide here as to whether an additional judge should be appointed.  Until such time as we find out how this new provision will work nobody can say whether an additional judge will be required.  So far as we know it should be possible for the chairman to carry out some other duties also, if not at the beginning, perhaps after a while.  An additional judge was appointed last year. That required legislation and legislation would be required again if we were to appoint yet another judge.  If the person appointed to chairmanship of the board were still a High Court judge, there would not be a vacancy as such but if it should be found that an additional judge is required the necessary legislation will be enacted.</P>
      <P>So far as consulting the President of the High Court is concerned, we must remember that we are dealing here with an amendment to a Bill that has not been passed by this House yet.  Would we not seem rather foolish going to the President of the High Court and asking him whether if this amendment is accepted, and if this Bill is passed, he would be able to provide from his present establishment a judge to act as chairman?</P>

    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>I would have thought that to be a normal precaution <Col N="83" /> to take before putting down the amendment.</P>

      <P>Thank God for that.  In the normal way, if we require an additional judge the House can be assured that provision to that effect will be made.  As matters stand, there is provision for an extra judge and we believe it may be possible to use that additional judge as chairman of the board.  The point we are debating is not what would happen when the judge is appointed.  All that is before the House in this regard is whether the person appointed should be a serving judge or a former judge.  Any vacancies in the High Court afterwards is not a matter which is before us and I prefer not to pursue it at present.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>I think it is very much a matter before the House and a very important matter.  I regret to have to accuse the Minister of some dereliction of duty in this regard.  I certainly assumed, when I saw the Minister's amendment, that he would have had discussions either personally or perhaps for protocol reasons, through his colleague, the Minister for Justice, with the Chief Justice and the President of the High Court because I do not think it is right and proper in the case of legislation like this to do what amounts to commandeering one of the High Court judges for a new job without any reference to the President of the High Court whose job it is to keep the High Court functioning and in a position to deal with the business coming before it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If a new judge was appointed by this Government in the recent past for reasons other than political patronage&mdash;and I am prepared to accept this&mdash;and if an additional judgeship was created, presumably it was done because of pressure of business in the High Court and because the President of the High Court, the Chief Justice <Col N="84" /> and the Minister for Justice, who would be the Government advisers in this matter, had persuaded the Government that the volume of business in the High Court was such that a new judge was needed to cope with it. The Minister cannot come along now and say that there is no problem, that we have a new High Court judge and that everything will be all right and that they will be able to absorb this monumental task without difficulty.</P>
    <P>I assume that the present High Court judges are fully occupied discharging the amount of business coming before them and dealing with it as adequately as they can.  This would be an enormous new imposition on a number of judges in the High Court.  I was not too clear about it but I thought the Minister's view was that an existing judge would be able to take on this job and also be able to carry out some of his existing functions as a member of the High Court.  I think I understood the Minister correctly.  I think that is a rather rash assumption and that we should proceed here on the basis that whatever judge is appointed chairman of this new board will, to all intents and purposes, be unavailable to the President of the High Court for normal judicial duties.  This is something we should clear up at this point.</P>
    <P>Is it the Government's intention immediately to seek the necessary legislation to appoint an additional judge so that the President of the High Court will be able to allocate a judge for this new task without interfering in any way with the functioning of the court which is his responsibility?  This is a very important matter and if the Minister and the Government have not adverted to it and have not had consultation about it with the President of the High Court and or the Chief Justice, I think they have been remiss and they are asking the House to take a step in the dark by passing this amendment and inserting this new section, placing this new responsibility on the High Court judges without any reference to their capacity to undertake this new work load.</P>
    <P>I say all that in the context of welcoming this amendment.  We welcome <Col N="85" /> the Minister's approach and we are prepared to abandon the stand we had taken up that the new judge should be nominated by the Chief Justice.  But if we do that, if we agree with the Minister that this new judge can be appointed by the Government, at least there is a heavy obligation on the Government then to consult with the President of the High Court.  I should have thought it would be good legislation to put such a mandatory consultation process into this section.  If that is not so I think the Minister must confess that he was remiss in not having had those discussions on this new responsibility to see what the position would be.  It is no good for him to say: &ldquo;I am not the Minister for Justice and whether a new judge will be appointed is a matter for that Minister and the Government&rdquo;.  We are facing a new situation and we are entitled to know where we stand in this regard.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>No, but let us stick to the facts which are that there is a proposal to appoint a judge or former judge.  On that basis Deputy Haughey wants to get the Government to make a declaration that they will appoint another High Court judge.  The amendment has not yet been accepted by the House.</P>
    </Speaker>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>Let us be reasonable. The amendment suggests that a High Court judge or a former High Court judge be appointed.  Again and again I have said that if a serving judge were appointed and it was necessary to appoint another judge, this would be done as it was done in 1973 when it was found necessary to do so.  The House will accept that.  To suggest that because an amendment is proposed here that a judge or former judge be appointed as chairman would mean that we should immediately <Col N="86" /> rush off and consult the President of the High Court as to whether he could spare somebody is not reasonable.  It is not at this stage a matter for the President of the High Court; it is a matter first for this House to accept the amendment and, having accepted it, Article 22 of the Schedule to the Bill says:</P>
      <P>Subject to the provisions of this Act and to any regulations made by the Minister under the Principal Act or under section 18 of this Act and to the provisions of this Schedule, the board shall regulate its procedure and business.</P>
      <P>We have not even yet decided what the chairman of the board or the board will be doing.  All these matters have yet to be dealt with.</P>
      <P>Deputy Haughey asked if I had said that a judge could act as chairman and also do other duties.  What I said was that a serving judge might find that possible.  I do not know; I cannot judge what is likely to happen.  I said a serving judge might find that he could deal with the matters which come up as chairman of the board and with other matters.  I cannot judge, but my personal opinion is that it should be a serving judge.  That is not the amendment, which says a judge or a former judge.  I believe this amendment should be accepted as it is.  It is perfectly straightforward and, as Deputy Haughey said earlier, it goes a long way towards the amendment which he himself had put down earlier.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMKelly" hpid="Mr. Kelly Mr. Kelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>Let me say, without upsetting Deputy Haughey again, that although I see the sense in what he is saying, and I think it would be wrong if the Government were to throw judges into work other than the work of the courts without regard to the capacity of the existing court structure to bear the strain, I should point out that it has almost never been the case in any recent year that at least one judge, and sometimes more than one judge of the High Court or of the Supreme Court, or sometimes several courts together, has not been employed, and often heavily employed, in some work other <Col N="87" /> than court work.  Whether this is right or not is a question on which there is no need for me to enter but if the House considers, for example, the Special Criminal Court, that has constantly been taking up, for the last couple of years, the attention of a judge of the High Court, a judge of the Circuit Court and a justice of the District Court.  Quite apart from that activity, which is special enough and employs three judicial figures, thus reducing the manpower in the courts they belong to, judges have been pressed into service for things which they are thought very well qualified to do.  One instance is the Commission on Company Law Reform which was headed by a judge.  The same judge headed the inquiry into the price of building land.  Another judge, admittedly of the Circuit Court, presided over the commission which inquired into the conditions of the police service.  Those were things which had no connection with the work of the court at all and probably, although the Minister for Justice would be in a better position to speak with authority on this, the president of any of the four courts takes into account, in making up his mind on how many judges are needed and making representations to the Government on the subject, the extent to which members of his court are commonly engaged on outside work.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>While I accept that it would be wrong for the Government to assume that without the creation of further judges the courts can simply take up this burden and carry it, along with all the rest of the work they have to do, it is worth pointing out that it is very common indeed for judges to be employed sometimes for long periods on work which is other than the work of their own courts.  I may have missed some discussion on this but I think clause <i>(b)</i> of subsection (1) goes a long way to meet this difficulty because it permits the appointment of a former judge of the High Court.  A former judge of the High Court is, I think, at this moment or was very lately, sitting in the Special Criminal Court because the Offences Against <Col N="88" /> the State Act permits a large range of people to sit there apart from judges.  A former judge is eligible.  I imagine that if the President of the High Court said to the Government: &ldquo;I simply cannot spare any more judges&rdquo;, the Government's reaction would be either to appoint an extra judge, as the Minister hinted, or else to look for a retired judge who might still be well capable of doing this job and might welcome it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>The only thing I will say about the reasonable contribution by the Parliamentary Secretary is that he was absent from the House when we were discussing this question and both the Minister and myself were agreed that it would be much more desirable to have a serving judge appointed if possible.</P>
      <P>The Minister and the Parliamentary Secretary may be under a serious misapprehension about the work involved in this task.  The Parliamentary Secretary has been talking about judges presiding over other bodies but those have all been commissions of inquiry &mdash;fairly leisurely types of operations. I know because I appointed quite a number of them in my time.  As a rule there is no particular time limit set to their task.  That is an entirely different type of operation from what we are talking about here.  We are talking here about the inexorable pressure of day-to-day appeals.  I think the Parliamentary Secretary at least is under a serious misapprehension if he is comparing what is involved here with a judge presiding over a commission of inquiry of some kind.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is fairly well established practice now that a judge can take on the additional work involved in presiding over one of those inquiries or commissions without interfering unduly with his work in the courts but there is something fundamentally and radically different involved here.  This will be a very hard-working, grinding job and there will be a very considerable volume of business coming before this new board, day in day out.  The volume of business will be of very great pressure and of very great commercial importance in many cases. <Col N="89" /> It is in no way to be compared with presiding over a commission of inquiry.</P>
    <P>I want to repeat that more thought should have been given to the situation which this will bring about.  My amendment suggests that the nomination would be made by the Chief Justice.  If that is not to be done, at least there should be consultation and consultation at an early stage, even while this Bill is wending its way through the House.  The matter should be discussed with the President of the High Court or the Chief Justice to see what the situation is and whether a new judge will be needed, and that would take legislation.  Let us get the legislation under way.</P>
    <P>This comes back to the very thing we were talking about under section 3. It might be that the board could not be established because there was no judge available to act as chairman. I would see that, in the normal way, the judge who is going to take over this job, if he is a serving judge, as I hope he will be, will be pretty fully occupied and to all intents and purposes will be unavailable for ordinary judicial duties.  That being so, we should know now where we stand because if a new judge has to be appointed that will be a process of some length and it would be as well to be getting on with it now.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>I think Deputy Haughey is under a misapprehension and perhaps I should have noticed this earlier on.  He is talking as if he envisages this chairman taking oral hearings and&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>Then he would be doing what Deputy Cunningham was doing and what Deputy Begley is doing at present, along with other duties.  I believe this will not be the time consuming job which Deputy Haughey seems to think it will be.  I agree the job must be done properly and if necessary, an extra judge will have to be appointed.  It was only a one section Bill the last time it went through <Col N="90" /> here.  I am not quite sure whether legislation would be needed for another one.  There may have been some provision made in the last Bill to cover that.</P>
      <P>But it is a relatively simple matter which could be dealt with.  I think Deputy Haughey, in his efforts to ensure the thing is perfect may be going to an extreme which is not necessary.  I believe the section as proposed will do the job properly, and, particularly in view of the fact that it is what he himself appeared to want and what was agreed on here by most Deputies anyway, there is no point in discussing it very much further.</P>

      <P>Let me make this point, because I am sure it will help Deputy Burke.  He was not here when I mentioned it.  If a judge is appointed as chairman, he will still be a judge, and it will be a duty to which he will be nominated.  The fact that he ceases to be chairman of the board does not mean he also ceases to be a judge.  It has nothing to do with his appointment as a judge.</P>

If he is not performing his functions as designated he should not be there in the first place.  Therefore, instead of laying a notice to that effect before the House, there should be a vote of the House on this issue the same as there would if he were being removed from a judgeship.</P>

      <P>I take it that the chairman of the board, who, under this amendment, will be a judge, will be taking over the work of planning now entrusted to the Minister and delegated to the Parliamentary Secretary. It will be a full-time job for one man if he wishes to do it properly, and I believe that the Minister or Parliamentary Secretary concerned regarded it as a very onerous job because each application had eventually to be signed by the Minister or the Parliamentary Secretary to whom the Minister delegated the powers under the planning Act.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Planning appeals run to over 3,000 per year and each planning appeal is a very important item for the planners and, indeed, for the applicant. Sometimes it is necessary for the Minister who is responsible for planning appeal decisions, in order to satisfy himself to go and see what he is about to sign for and to make himself familiar with the advice given to him by the officials of his Department. He has to have the best information possible on the matter before him.  If the Minister has in <Col N="93" /> mind the appointment of a person who will have other duties as well, then I think he is mistaken.  I agree with what Deputy Haughey has said, that it is important to have somebody who will be engaged full-time on this work as chairman of the board.</P>

      <P>I am just wondering about this.  A judge is a professional man fully trained in law, but as regards planning permission, rather than have a man from Dublin, who had never been down the country, being brought to my county to decide a planning application, I would prefer to have Deputy Molloy or Deputy Tully as the Minister or Deputy Begley or Deputy Cunningham <Col N="94" /> as Parliamentary Secretary making the decision, because they have to go back to the people.  But if some faceless man makes a decision we must take it or leave it.  I would like to know what qualification this board of faceless men will have.  A least if the Minister or Parliamentary Secretary makes a wrong decision, he will have to answer for it in this House or down the country.</P>

In the light of all the facts and all the personalities and personages that can be considered for such a position, I think the person most acceptable to both sides of the House eventually, in spite of our reservations as expressed by Deputy Callanan, would be a judge.  I am not sure of the exact number of High Court judges that are appointed at any particular time, but I understand the number would be about six.</P>

      <P>Assuming there are three or four of them still alive who are retired and who were former High Court judges, you are talking about a group of persons who may not number more than 12.  Therefore, the chairman of this board has to be selected from this group of 12 persons.  I wonder if the Minister has considered the position that might arise should none of those people accept the position of chairman of this board.  It may not be an attractive type of post for them.  It is very tedious work.  There is a heavy work load at times and, if it is to be done conscientiously, can involve them in work which to one man may be of <Col N="95" /> interest, but which other judges would feel it was not their cup of tea.  It may be a bit extreme, but I wonder if the Minister has considered the possibility, seeing that there are only a small number of High Court judges, that none of them accept the position.  Has the Minister made any soundings with the judiciary whether or not there are persons there willing to accept this position?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>There may be a certain amount in what Deputy Molloy says; possibly the judges might not like the appointment.  I am quite sure a number of them do not like the appointments they have at present, but they are servants of the State, and I am quite sure that if they were asked to do the job by the State&mdash;I have not the appointment of them; the appointment will be made by the Government&mdash; they will do it.  While Deputy Molloy's point may be valid&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Mr. Molloy Mr. Molloy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>Have they been consulted?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>No, you could not possibly, because as I pointed out on a number of occasions, this is only an amendment.  Incidentally, it is only fair to point out that the Fianna Fáil amendment suggests a judge of the Supreme Court, the High Court or the Circuit Court.  All of us can suddenly, out of the blue, produce wonderful ideas which have not been worked out.</P>
      <P>I am quite sure the Fianna Fáil Party considered Deputy Haughey's amendment.  They certainly considered ours.  Both sides came up with a judge and, therefore, what Deputy Molloy says is possibly true: it may be that neither a serving judge or a former judge will be anxious to be appointed chairman.  I can sympathise with him and so, I am sure, would he if that were the attitude taken but, at the same time, I do not think we would have a situation where a judge would be asked to take on this job and would say he would not accept it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Mr. Molloy Mr. Molloy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister has no ground on which to base the assumption <Col N="96" /> there would not be a refusal to accept this onerous position from the small number of High Court judges available.  The logic of the Minister's argument defeats me.  Acceptance of the Opposition amendment depends on the goodwill of the Government. If the Government have not a similar amendment down and were prepared to accept our amendment involving the appointment of a judge we would assume that the Government, charged with the implementation of the Bill when it becomes law, would have the necessary consultations with the Judiciary to ascertain in advance whether this onerous responsibility would be acceptable to the Judiciary. It is quite a reasonable point.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Molloy is begging the question.  Some time ago a Special Court was set up here.  Does the Deputy suggest that the Government consulted with the judges to know if they would accept office in this court?  We are trying here to improve the Bill through the medium of discussion.  Red herrings make no difference at all; we have the proposal before us that a serving judge or a former judge be appointed and that is what we are discussing.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>It is not unreasonable for us, while agreeing with the Minister and the Government on the appointment of a judge to this important new post, to ask what provision has been made for this appointment.  The Minister knows we agree with him on the desirability of appointing a judge, <i>pace</i> Deputy John Callanan from Galway.</P>
    </Speaker>

    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>We are a democratic party and we try to abide by majority decision.  The majority of us are in favour of a judge and Deputy Callanan will go along with that decision, though he is free to voice some doubts about the validity of it. We are generally agreed we want a judge and we are grateful to the Minister for meeting our point of view, but it is not unreasonable for <Col N="97" /> us to ask him in this context if he has considered all the implications and made appropriate provision.  Will a judge be available and does the Minister know he will be able to appoint a judge without seriously interfering with the work of the courts?  These are reasonable questions.</P>
      <P>I hesitate to talk about a &ldquo;spare&rdquo; judge in relation to their awful majesties but, if there is not an available judge, would it not be judicious of the Minister to put a simple one line section into the Bill providing for the appointment of a judge?  That is a valid proposition.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>It most certainly is valid because the appointment of a judge to this new post is not on all-fours with any other appointment any judge has ever taken on before.  That is the fact.  This is a totally new and onerous type of position which no judge has ever before been asked to accept.  I believe, though Deputy Molloy does not agree with me, that any judge taking on this task will have to be full-time on it and will not be available for ordinary judicial duties.  That will almost certainly mean the appointment of a new judge and the Minister should face up to that situation.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>As it stands, the position is quite simple; either a serving judge or a former judge will be appointed. I have a preference for a serving judge but, if it is not found possible to provide a serving judge, the House can be assured that it will have before it a simple Bill such as was introduced last year when we found another judge was required.  We introduced a Bill and he was appointed.  We will have no objection to doing it again.  As Deputy Molloy said, a person could be appointed as a High Court judge especially to do the job if necessary.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>Thank you.  When I finished on a rather acrimonious note on the last day I was trying to prove that one could hardly discuss rising unemployment, with which this Private Motion deals, without discussing the effects which rising prices have directly on that situation.  I was ruled out of order and I do not want to pursue that line further today.</P>
      <P>The motion deplores the failure of the Government to produce coherent policies to deal with rising unemployment. The Minister for Industry and Commerce has already spoken to the motion and his words are on record. I failed to find anything in what he said which would in any way alleviate or allay the anxiety of those who are genuinely concerned about employment in the various industries and service industries.  This debate started on the 6th of this month and, since then, the position has deteriorated further, with each week showing lengthening queues at the unemployment exchanges.  Each day has failed to bring anything from the Government or the Minister by way of a suggestion, let alone a policy, to deal with the overall position of rapidly rising unemployment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Many people waited for this White Paper on the economy.  It was delayed for a month for reasons which we all <Col N="99" /> know.  It now comes before us with nothing in it in the form of a concrete suggestion other than that wage demands and demands for higher incomes should be moderated if made at all.  The Government spent many days during the Cork by-election campaign trying to convince the people that the economy had not really suffered any serious setback. The Minister for Local Government has insisted that the building industry is not suffering from any deterioration whatever, contrary to what everybody else in the country thinks.</P>
    <P>Against that background the White Paper points out, as the Taoiseach and Ministers pointed out to people in various sectors of the economy when they brought them in for a summit meeting, that we really are facing a serious position.  We have got to make up our minds one way or the other. Are we or are we not in a crisis position? Are we facing rising unemployment? Is the position serious?  Does it warrant the appeals made in this White Paper?  We are all aware of the resilience of Irish industry.  It has been built up over the years and it is capable of coming back if given the chance.</P>
    <P>When we were in office, on one occasion the British found themselves in a serious position with regard to the deficit in their balance of payments. They took unilateral action and applied a levy on all imports into England.  They made no exception for our goods.  We thought we might get some preferential treatment.  A deputation went across to discuss the matter with them.  When we failed to get any exceptional treatment from the British when they applied the levy to our goods, as they did to all other imports, we promptly applied a subsidy to exports in order to enable industrialists to overcome the serious situation which they were facing, and to prevent any lay-offs, redundancies or short-time working in industrial employment.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JosephBrennan" hpid="Mr. Brennan Mr. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>They say it can be done.  I should like to draw attention to the warning which that union issued to every Member of this House today about the serious situation they are facing.  In their submission to the Minister they point out that under EEC regulations it is possible to take action and they outline the action they propose to take.  In the last paragraph they say&mdash;and it is up to the Minister to refute it&mdash;they believe that adequate provision is made in the articles of accession to the EEC in sections 68 and 69 to provide for this contingency.  They number remedial actions from one to seven.  They say that, under the terms of the Anglo-Irish Free Trade Area Agreement, in Article 19 there is special provision to cope with this unusual situation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We all know that the Treaty of Rome provides that where a member country finds itself in a serious situation, if it can be proven that it is attributable to membership, action can be taken either unilaterally or by agreement with the members concerned. This is what the Common Market is all about.  We have no evidence whatever that anybody is seeking a means to offset the serious situation into which we are plunging week after week.  I have had numerous contacts with industry in recent times, and particularly with people in the clothing industry, who pointed out that they will have to close up their business owing to imports from low-cost countries, particularly Portugal and Korea.  Nobody is investigating <Col N="101" /> whether this is dumping or, as it was put in an article in a newspaper recently, whether we are paying for sweated labour in other countries.  The price we are paying is the laying off of our own employees in the clothing industry.</P>
    <P>Everybody in the clothing industry, and particularly in what is known as the CMT industry&mdash;the cut, make and trim industry&mdash;knows perfectly well that we are faced with a serious situation and that factories will have to close unless something is done to enable them to continue.  We are applying certain measures.  We are complaining about what we cannot do owing to membership of the EEC but, in non-EEC countries like Portugal and Korea wages are at their lowest, and such countries are flooding the market here today.  This is evident in the shops in Dublin.  They are flooding the market with cheap shoddy clothing which is under-selling anything our factories can produce with the costs they have to meet, with their overheads and with the expenses and taxes which face them.</P>
    <P>The purpose of this motion is to extract from the Minister for Industry and Commerce, or some other responsible member of the Government, a statement which will allay the anxieties of industrialists about what they are facing in the future.  Will any remedial action be taken to prevent what is becoming a serious and rapidly developing unemployment situation?</P>
    <P>The Minister tried to show that we were no worse off than any other country.  It has been frequently said in this House that the test of any Government is their ability to act in a difficult situation.  I challenge anybody to produce any evidence of any effort made, let alone any demonstration of their ability to tackle, the numerous everyday problems which are occurring in the present economic situation.</P>
    <P>Is anything being done to intensify the &ldquo;Buy Irish&rdquo; campaign at a time when it was never more needed?  Has any extra money been put into that campaign at a time when, to use their own phrase, we should put our money where our employment is?  Somebody <Col N="102" /> sent me Christmas cards the other day for a very laudable and worthwhile cause.  They asked me to buy the cards to help a benevolent society.  When I turned the cards over I saw they were printed in England.  These are the things that count.  They are small when taken individually but collectively they amount to a great deal.</P>
    <P>Recently the Taoiseach, when opening a debate here, pointed out that workers were now at least in the happy position of knowing that, if they are laid off, unemployed or redundant, there is ample provision made to pay them a substantial amount of what they were earning prior to their unemployment and that, if they become redundant, they will get generous redundancy payments.</P>
    <P>When I was Minister I had the pleasure of seeing the pay related scheme piloted through both Houses. This made provision to pay married men with dependants if they were unemployed almost as much as they had been earning.  I also had the pleasure of piloting through the House the amendment to the Redundancy Bill. This made provision for redundancies so far as they were likely to occur. The Taoiseach referred to these two safeguards recently and insinuated that in some way he or his Government had something to do with the making of these provisions.</P>
    <P>The Minister should take note of the submissions from the boot and shoe industry and the Irish Shoe and Leather Workers' Union submitted today.  He should also take note of the serious position of the clothing industry at the present time, particularly the shirt factories in Donegal.  I am not using this issue as propaganda.  Many shirt factories in Donegal are likely to face redundancies, short time or even closure, unless something is done.  I have this on good authority from the people directly involved.  I appeal to the Minister not to regard this as a Fianna Fáil gimmick and as something which was done for the sake of occupying Private Members' time.  He should consider the people who are facing increasing unemployment.  No employee is sure if his employment is secure in the weeks ahead.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="103" /> The Government should make a statement, formulate policy and give some assurance that they will take action to offset and minimise this. There are a number of things they can do.  Why have they not done anything? Why have they not made some suggestions? Will the Members of the Coalition go into the Lobbies and vote against this motion?  This motion was put down for the purpose of shaking the Government out of their complacency and making them realise that, if they are to continue as a responsible Government, they must show signs of tackling the problems facing them.</P>

      <P>It is an important element in any proper reception and adequate approach to a problem to first analyse the component parts of the problem to see what policy matters the issue has thrown up.  That is what is attempted in the White Paper.  A short time ago we met representatives of the employers, the farmers and the trade unions in an effort to speak plainly to them and to reach conclusions in continuing talks on what should be the necessary elements in a united approach by all concerned to the problems of the Irish economy in the post oil increase era.  There is a difference between this period, with its increases <Col N="104" /> in the prices of oil and other commodities necessary for industry and previous periods when this country faced economic difficulties.  That was the overriding concern of the Government in presenting this White Paper &mdash;that this issue, the range of problems faced by the Government and the country, should be taken out of the ruck of party politics and that public representatives, whatever their political viewpoint, should be able to see above the partisan heat of charge and countercharge what were the problems, international and national, faced by the economy at the present time.  We commenced in the White Paper, which has been in the hands of Deputies for some weeks, by outlining some of the repercussions on the home economy of certain international events.</P>
      <P>The discussion on the previous occasion on this motion was somewhat coloured by the approaching by-election in Cork.  Far from Government spokesmen in that campaign pretending that matters were otherwise, they spoke of the serious problems before us.  In much the same spirit, the White Paper continues by saying that the responsibility of the Government is to tell the people just how things are so that together we may get, by agreement, a common approach to those problems.</P>
      <P>It is interesting to see the dramatic illustration of the changes in the more serious circumstances we face now by contrast with the period before the oil crisis.  The situation arising from the oil crisis is dealt with in the White Paper which contains a table of the pre and post energy crisis forecasts of percentage change in GNP for 1974 over 1973.  In that table one can see the expectations of the major economies prior to the energy crisis and the current position.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It can be seen from that table that in the United Kingdom, prior to the energy crisis, they were going for a growth in GNP of 3½ per cent; the United States, 2¼ per cent; Japan, 7½ per cent; Germany, 3¼ per cent; Italy, 7¼ per cent; France, 5½ per cent and Canada, 5½ per cent.  For the same countries, in the wake of events associated <Col N="105" /> with the oil crisis and the increased price of energy importation from abroad, figures drawn up by the same agency, OECD, for the United Kingdom show they now face a drop of 2 per cent in their GNP.  The same goes for the United States, a drop of ½ per cent.  Japan faces a drop of 1½ per cent and Germany, where they previously looked forward to an increase of 3¼ per cent, now faces an increase of 1¾ per cent.  Italy, where they expected beforehand an increase of 7¼ per cent, now faces 3½ per cent while France, formally 5½ per cent, is now a mere 4¾ per cent.  Canada, 5½ per cent prior to the oil crises, also experienced a drop.</P>
    <P>The same goes for all countries. Formerly they expected a repetition of last year's growth but now they are lucky to come near the half way stage in the expectation of last year. The burden of the Government's case before the by-election, throughout this debate, and in any discussion we have had with any of the interests this autumn, is that governments depend on an understanding by the general public of the kind of world economic situation we live in.  Whatever anybody might think in this House, whatever any Member might put forward as his solution to the problem, no solution can command any respect if it ignores some of these problems from abroad.</P>
    <P>On the balance of payments situation one can see the changes that occurred from the expectations of the world before the increase in oil and commodity prices and the situation immediately after.  It is as though this is the great break of this century, certainly the great break in development since the Second World War. While we can say that, with temporary stops and turns, the economies of the developing countries of the western world have over that period expanded, it can be said that our path in the years ahead is very uncertain. In all the countries the Governments are engaged in this discussion with their social partners&mdash;the employers, the unions and the farmers&mdash; in an effort to find the best means of averting the worst repercussions of this worldwide recession.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="106" /> We face a special problem from our close economic ties with the British market.  Although we have diversified our export outlets over the last few years, mainly as a result of our membership of the EEC we remain dependent on the United Kingdom for the sale of more than half of what we produce.  Anybody who examined the proposals in the recent British budget know that Chancellor Healy could not be described as being euphoric in his expectations of the performance of the British economy in the coming year.  He has forecast that there will be low growth and high unemployment arising from the expectations of his budget.  The proposals brought forward by the British Chancellor amount to a mild reflation of the British economy.  While this cannot but help us in our own exports in that area, industrialist in Britain complain that they face a very lean and meagre future as regards the profitability of their industries.</P>
    <P>Therefore there is little prospect of our major market expanding sufficiently to take up the slack that is occurring in some of our industries which are suffering a recession.  Of course, it is not all gloom.  It is well to keep a sense of proportion. Whilst our unemployment figures are very high, high enough to give grounds for serious concern, figures in recent years have also been very high. There was a very serious situation in unemployment in February 1972 Admittedly that was a later month than now and our situation is qualitatively more serious but I mentioned that to suggest that the crisis the Opposition speak of has not yet arrived, though we are in a most serious situation.  It is a situation that we cannot regard with any complacency, nor do we.</P>
    <P>The information on job creation continues to be very hopeful.  In the period up to the 1st April, 1974 to 31st December, 1974&mdash;and this is the opinion of the IDA also&mdash;this information shows a very good record in terms of job commitments.  The IDA predict 21,000 job commitments in this nine-month period as against 23,000 for the full financial <Col N="107" /> year 1973-74.  A number of the undertakings approved will be capital intensive, necessitating a great deal of construction work.  This will mean some assistance to the building industry which is encountering problems.  Another industry experiencing difficulty is the textile industry but the problems of that industry did not commence this year or last year. The Committee for Industrial Organisation, in the course of reports produced in the 1960s, pointed out certain structural weaknesses in this industry, problems of management and equipment.  It was clear then that that industry, at some stage in the free trade future, would be in severe difficulties.  The down turn in the British market has accelerated this process which, potentially, was there since the early sixties.  All concerned with that industry knew those problems were there.</P>
    <P>The problems were compounded by the fall in demand in the British market.  Many of the firms which have closed or announced redundancies in recent months have been incurring trade losses for some time.  The greatest difficulties occur in the woollen and worsted section, which has contracted sharply in recent years as a result of import competition.  Deputies opposite know that there is no reason for surprise in this development.  In 1966, when we signed the Anglo-Irish Free Trade Area Agreement, this spelled closure for many industries on the home market.  The full lash of that agreement on the home market will not be felt until next year but already we are, in practical terms, in a situation of complete free trade with Britain with certain foretold consequences for such traditional industries as textiles and woollens.</P>
    <P>The same goes for the clothing sector which has been under stress and strain.  There has been a general down turn in clothing markets throughout the world.  Anyone who is interested can read the figures for himself in the OECD reports.  He can see that it is not just a special pleading by a member of this Government, looking at our situation.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="108" /> There is a very sharp downturn in the UK clothing market and that, of course, has a particular significance for the Irish clothing industry because it is in that market that the greater part of the Irish export outlet in clothing is found.  Much of our competing imports, of course, come from the UK, so we lose both ways.  Home demand at present, according to information available, is not proving exceptionally buoyant&mdash;it could indeed be described as very sluggish.  Therefore, prospects for employment both in output and exports are not particularly encouraging in the months ahead in that industry.</P>
    <P>Our position in regard to footwear is well known also.  There is increasing import competition from the UK and other members of the EEC.  This predicament of the footwear industry, as many Deputies know, is not of recent origin.  For some years&mdash;again we can go back to the reports of the Committee of Industrial Organisation of the sixties, an excellent series of reports analysing the structural problems of the industry&mdash;we have known that the footwear industry at some stage in the free trade future would face very great difficulties. Footwear imports have been increasing rapidly in recent years but the rate of import increase was not anticipated to reach the high level it has reached.  Eighty per cent of imported footwear comes from the UK.</P>
    <P>In the engineering industry, declining home demand is the major factor affecting output.  Reductions in tariffs under the Anglo-Irish and EEC agreements operate here also.  The Minister for Industry and Commerce made the point, and I was glad to hear Deputy Dowling make the same appeal earlier in the debate, in regard to the effect of buying Irish in the home market, although it is questionable whether our market has ever been a home one in the sense that other markets in the EEC have been.  This was one of our worries in the past when we argued against too cavalier an approach to free trade in this country.  We pointed out when considering this matter that historically we have never had a home market closed off from external competition, <Col N="109" /> a situation not operating for our main competitors who, over the years of their supremacy in industrial production, were able to build up a strong consumer loyalty to national brands in every section.</P>
    <P>Deputies opposite have asked where in the White Paper we see a response to the problems before us.  If one reads carefully, if one looks at the White Paper impartially, there is a clear commitment that the criteria governing our approach to the economy at present are the preservation of living standards and the maintenance of employment at whatever cost and against whatever international odds that exist.  We must preserve and extend our employment at a time of great difficulty.  We must give priority to keeping production going in existing industry.  In looking at the difficulties of many firms at present, it has been noted that in many cases as a result of inflationary processes they are worried by the shortage of working capital.  There has been increasing competition in the home market and the export markets have not been quite as buoyant as they should have been and consequently it has been more difficult to maintain orders.</P>
    <P>However, we have taken concrete action.  Through the Central Bank, we find that the commercial banks have been asked to respond positively to the short-term liquidity requirements of business concerns.  In other words, in our anxiety to keep firms' doors open, clear directions have been given to the chief credit agencies to provide working capital to firms in difficulties.  We have also undertaken, in paragraph 96, to ensure that any additional funds which Fóir Teoranta may need at present would be made available, and there is no qualification, no reservation as to upper limits written into the White Paper as to the extent of those extra funds.</P>
    <P>As well, we have arranged for a remarkable increase in the amount of cash available to the IDA to enable the efforts of the authority to be intensified. The Exchequer provision for this in the capital budget for 1975 will be £42.5 million as compared with £19.5 million for the nine months <Col N="110" /> from April, 1974&mdash;equivalent to an annual £26 million&mdash;and it represents a concrete instance of the Government's concern to maintain employment in that period, to ensure that when international recovery comes about, as come about it will, this country will be in a position to reap the best benefit in the conditions prevailing when our main export markets again pick up.  The total investment in fixed assets involved will be about £150 million in 1975 as compared with about £90 million for the 12-month period from April, 1974.  These are no gimmicks.  They are solid reassurances to our population of the Government's confidence in our ability, in the ability of our industrialists and workers, to come intact through this period.</P>
    <P>Coming within my own area, there is the provision of trained workers, a very important element in the industrial programme.  Though we are encountering problems of unemployment, even at this period we suffer from a shortage of skilled workers. Some counsels might suggest that a period of high unemployment is not the occasion to expand a training programme. I assert the contrary, that this is indeed the very period in which to expand our training programme and capacity, to ensure that a shortage of skilled workers does not lose us the possibility of outside investment in Irish industry.</P>
    <P>Again unqualified, we have written into the White Paper that as part of their manpower policy the Government will make additional resources available to the training authority to enable the authority to expand their programmes of industrial training. The point is made in the White Paper &mdash;I have made it myself repeatedly &mdash;that a valuable industrial training programme can itself be a valuable instrument of manpower policy in times of rising unemployment.  More places will be made available in training centres for workers temporarily disemployed and for young workers experiencing difficulties in getting jobs.</P>
    <P>These actions are not those of an Administration that have lost their grip on events, have lost their confidence <Col N="111" /> in our capacity to control events.  I have every confidence it will be met by co-operation from all sections of the community.  I am confident that in our resumed series of talks with the employers, the unions and the farmers we will get the co-operation needed to ensure that our economy comes through this trying period intact.</P>
    <P>I have been concerned at the lack of information we have had up to the present on the labour market.  Our statistics have not been able to inform us as to the areas under stress, the industries in trouble.  I have now made arrangements for the setting up of an inter-departmental manpower committee which will initiate measures to improve the amount and value of present sources of manpower information, which will co-ordinate the manpower information available through the resources of the National Manpower Service attached to my Department, the Industrial Development Authority, the Training Authority and the Department of Finance.  By this means we wish to bring forward suggestions for short-term measures to alleviate unemployment from all of the different agencies involved in job creation and the resources available to the separate agencies, all of whom, in their separate fields, are working hard to provide new jobs.  I would hope by means of this inter-departmental working party to ensure that we have centrally available to us information on industries in trouble now, expected to be in the months ahead and, accordingly, to take measures inasmuch as such are within our power to ward off the worst effects.</P>
    <P>Deputies opposite have mentioned, legitimately, problems in the building industry.  Political points, naturally, have to be made in a debate of this kind.  Nobody denies that there is not material about on which one may make serious political points based on these problems but, for the record, it should be said that exceptional measures have been taken to ensure that the building industry is enabled to continue at as full a capacity as <Col N="112" /> is possible over the coming year.  For example, exceptional measures have been taken to improve the supply of mortgage finance for private housing. Last year the Minister for Local Government arranged a special interest subsidy for borrowing from building societies which cost about £2.4 million a year.  This, it must not be forgotten, is in addition to the relief from corporation profits tax enjoyed by the societies and the arrangements for the payment of income tax by the societies at a composite rate.  Taken together these measures are now costing the Exchequer approximately £9 million a year.  We have also negotiated through the associated banks stand-by credit facilities for the societies totalling £11 million to tide them over any temporary difficulties.</P>
    <P>Of course the major problem in the building industry, as in other areas, arises from the worldwide problem of inflation.  The rise in prices during the past 12 to 18 months has forced the public to reduce their savings in order to maintain constant living standards. On the other hand, increases in prices have wiped out a large part of the real value of the savings.  The effect of inflation has been particularly severe in the building industry and the drop in the purchasing power of the average deposit has been severe also. There has been a problem also on the production side of the industry where, earlier this year, there was an increase in stocks, when builders and builders' providers bought at very high prices. Now, with the falling off in demand, those stocks are themselves found to be tying up large amounts of cash with repercussions on the viability of many firms throughout the country.</P>
    <P>But this is not an administration which has been standing by idly or otherwise.  The Minister for Local Government has been active in ensuring that sufficient cash is poured into this industry.  But, as I have said, it is pouring money into an industry at a time of worldwide inflation, at a time also when in the neighbouring country the building industry is in sharp decline, especially in the private housing area.</P>
    <P>There are not any novel solutions to <Col N="113" /> the situation facing us.  The figures I quoted at the beginning of my intervention here&mdash;and I see I am nearly at the end of it&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>The figures I quoted at the start suggested that if we are not in a general world recession we are certainly in world conditions of slump.  It behoves all concerned with the future of this country and its economy to act responsibly, to make fair criticism and to wish well any Administration that is attempting, as are we, to work with all the groups in our country for a national path, a national partnership, as the White Paper puts it, out of the present world crisis.  I have every confidence that that we shall do.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>As well as speaking generally about the problems of unemployment, which we and the people are quite satisfied the Government are doing nothing to rectify, I want to speak in particular of the situation in my own city, Limerick.  In order to bring home to Deputies just how serious is the situation, the best I can do is to quote the actual official figures of redundancies that have arisen in the last few months which I obtained as recently as this afternoon from the official agency in the mid-western region, the Shannon Free Airport Development Company.  Those figures show that in the very recent past in Limerick and Shannon&mdash;it can be taken almost as one unit for the purposes of this argument because a high proportion of those who work at Shannon live in and close to Limerick &mdash;there have been 1,066 people let go from their employment.  The Shannon Free Airport Development Company says that at least another 100 can be expected to become redundant in the next couple of months, that is, even if only the firms which have indicated an intention of closing do so and there are no additions.  Therefore, that is a figure of 1,166 people in one small region of Limerick City and Shannon alone thrown out of employment.  That is not merely a statistic; that is a human tragedy, not alone for 1,166 people, <Col N="114" /> most of whom cannot get any kind of alternative employment, but for their families also.</P>
      <P>There are perhaps 5,000 people immediately affected by that sort of situation.  They find no consolation in Government White Papers, in the list of grants to the IDA and all that kind of thing we have heard from the Minister for Labour.  They are out of work.  They have no immediate prospects of re-employment.  They look, as they are entitled to look, to the Government to give them employment. Thank goodness, there has been reasonably good employment in the Limerick region for several years past.  The real pinch perhaps will not be felt by those people for some months because happily, due to the redundancy and pay related schemes introduced by Deputy J. Brennan when he was Minister for Labour and Social Welfare, financially these people will be reasonably well off for at least a few months after they lose their employment.  The real pinch will be felt in a couple of months' time.</P>
      <P>I attended a meeting last week called by the Mayor of Limerick at which various representatives of the area were present, including senior representatives from SFADCo.  It is quite clear that in the short-term there is no project in a position to employ those people.  I do not think the morale of the city of Limerick and of the mid-western region will stand this kind of mass unemployment suddenly thrust upon it.  It is very disturbing to go through the list of factories and of redundancies.  The most serious of all is in the clothing industry where 300 were let go from the Danus factory and 220 from the Aquascutum factory, 190 from Scripto and 15 from a furniture factory&mdash;more than 700 in four factories in Limerick.  In Shannon the total loss at the moment is 301 and another 100 are expected shortly by the Shannon Free Airport Development Company.  I can only trust that their optimism in expecting that only another 100 will lose their jobs in the next few months is well founded because from what one hears the position looks like getting much worse.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="115" /> We are told there are two major industries coming to the Shannon region&mdash;the Alcan factory at Foynes and the Burlington factory near Clonlara, County Clare.  However, I am informed by SFADCo that neither of the factories will be in a position to go into production before December, 1976&mdash;25 months away.  To hold out hopes of employment for people who are unemployed now by telling them that there will be two good factories in the region 25 months hence is not much consolation.</P>
    <P>Even if those factories were there tomorrow morning rather than in 25 months' time they are still of little value to many who have lost their employment. In Limerick city there has been a tremendous tradition in the clothing industry.  The Limerick clothing factory which was originally the main one and is now owned by Aquascutum of London has been continuously in production for 124 years and is one of the oldest clothing factories, if not the oldest, in the world.  There are men and women in that factory who have 30, 40 and 50 years' service and the chances of their being able to take up any other form of employment, even if it were available which it is not, are negligible. They have given a lifetime to that trade, they are trained fully for it and are incapable, through no fault of their own, of taking up alternative employment. In many cases they are not capable of being retrained, even if the facilities were available, which they are not.</P>
    <P>The situation with regard to Aquascutum is serious, not just in the fact that all these people have been thrown out of work with only a fortnight's notice, but also the way that situation developed.  Aquascutum took over the Limerick clothing factory some years ago with a great flourish about the prosperity they would bring to the area.  They have three factories in England that are on full-time working while the unfortunate employees in Limerick are let go.  The suggestion is made in Limerick&mdash;probably with justification&mdash;that the Irish employees are expendable, that if production has <Col N="116" /> to be cut back the Irish can go while the other workers are kept in full-time employment in Britain.</P>
    <P>About a month or six weeks ago I attended a meeting with the Minister for Industry and Commerce.  Incidentally, I am sorry he has not seen fit to be present at this debate today although he spoke on a previous occasion.  I attended a meeting as part of a deputation on behalf of another clothing factory&mdash;the Danus factory, where 300 jobs have been lost.  We were told at that meeting by a director of the Aquascutum factory who is also a member of the Oireachtas that there was no problem whatever in the factory and he could not understand why the Danus factory was closing. At least the Danus factory gave a couple of months' notice to their employees but Aquascutum of London sent a telex to their employees telling them they would be out of work in two weeks although some of them had served that firm for 50 years.</P>
    <P>The employees of this factory have been offered the absolute minimum in redundancy pay.  In fairness to the management of the Danus factory, they have offered over and above the statutory amount to their employees. The English directors of Aquascutum refused to come here to discuss the matter with the trade union concerned and the Irish director has said he does not know anything about the matter because the English directors do not tell him anything.  In the meantime a total of 520 clothing workers in Limerick city are out of work with no prospect, as things stand, of getting work.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Industry and Commerce was contacted last week several times on behalf of the workers of that factory but he said no useful purpose could be served by meeting representatives of the workers, public representatives or trade union officials.  It was pointed out to him that he was coming to a function at the Ferenka factory, which happily is going from strength to strength.  This is only a few miles outside Limerick city and it was suggested to the Minister that representatives of the workers could meet him there.  However, he declined to meet <Col N="117" /> them, he turned his car and went straight back to Dublin as soon as the function at Ferenka was over.  He had the gall to make a speech at Ferenka telling the people in Limerick how lucky they were because two big factories were due to come into production in December, 1976.  I do not know where these unfortunate people will be in the meantime and I do not know what will be done for them.  However, I know that whatever about Dáil Éireann deploring the failure of the Government to produce coherent policies to combat the problems of rapidly rising unemployment, the people, and particularly the workers of Limerick, deplore the failure of the Government to do this.</P>
    <P>Members of the House will recall that in 1969 or 1970 the town of Dundalk suddenly ran into serious problems in relation to employment when a number of engineering firms found themselves in difficulties.  At that time the Government were called on to take remedial action, to take special steps to restore employment as rapidly as possible in Dundalk.  That was done then.  The people of Limerick are now calling on the Government to do for their city what was done for Dundalk at that stage because the disaster that has hit Limerick is no less than the disaster that hit Dundalk at that time.  For the sake of Limerick, its workers and their families I can only hope that this Government will act as effectively as the Fianna Fáil Government acted in relation to Dundalk.  If they do not Limerick faces a very bleak future.  It is shocking that after achieving almost full employment in that city in the last two or three years we should be back now to the kind of situation that obtained 20 years ago in Limerick under the previous Coalition.  I am afraid that is what it amounts to.</P>
    <P>It is the opinion of the people of Limerick that the introduction of a new industry for workers who were trained in a particular type of work and who, in many cases, were too old to undergo successfully retraining, is no use.  The Government will have to step in to help in one way or another so as to ensure that factories <Col N="118" /> in the city which are now being closed will be re-opened and that the workers will be re-employed.  I do not know in what way that could or should be done.  I do not mind if it entails the Government buying the factories and running them themselves. That would be nationalisation. In any case, I have no problems of an ideological nature in regard to this question.  I am concerned only with helping in some way those people who are now out of the employment in which they have been engaged all their lives up to now.</P>
    <P>It has been suggested, and it is a good suggestion, that some form of a co-operative might be started in Limerick in relation to these factories and that this would have Government assistance to enable them to be re-opened and to sell their products. That has been done successfully on a small scale in other areas so I do not see why it could not be done in Limerick. Apart from the human tragedy involved in this case there is the great tragedy of the loss of skill and tradition. There are people working in those two factories now not only whose parents and grandparents but whose great grandparents worked also in the clothing trade.  Their skill was not acquired easily or quickly and has been in those families for more than 100 years.</P>
    <P>All that looks like being blown away because of the Government's refusal to produce any coherent policy to combat the problems that have afflicted these factories.  In regard to the Acquascutum factory, perhaps it will be more relevant to raise this matter on the Mergers and Monopolies Bill, but the Minister for Industry and Commerce has a duty to inquire into these kinds of take-overs by foreign combines if, at the first puff of cold wind, the Irish factory is the only one of the four in these islands to be closed while the other three are kept going at full production.  That kind of pattern, and it is a very sinister one, is what is happening in relation to Aquascutum in Limerick and it may well be repeated in relation to other factories in different parts of the country with <Col N="119" /> resulting increased unemployment in these other areas.</P>
    <P>I do not wish to continue for too long because I know that Deputy Moore is anxious to make his contribution and I am glad to be able to facilitate him in that regard.  I make one final appeal on behalf of the 1,166 redundant people and their families in Limerick and Shannon.  I appeal to the Government to come down and do something and not merely read out statistics and say that there are factories which will commence operations in two or three years' time.  Let the Government keep open the factories that are there by continuing to make available the only sort of employment that most of these people can turn their hands to.  If the Government fail in this regard.  Limerick could be in the same situation this year or next year as it was in 1956 and 1957.  None of us, hopefully not even the members of the Coalition, wish to experience that again.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Moore</NameTxt>
      <P>When the Minister for Labour was concluding he said that the Government should have the good wishes of all in so far as the unemployment problem is concerned.  We on this side of the House have no intention of using the misery caused by unemployment as a weapon with which to beat the Government.  If one wishes to attack this Government one does not have to make a weapon because events speak for themselves.  When the Government ask for the good wishes of others they must not try to avoid the criticism they deserve.  One thing for which they must be criticised is their complete failure, and the wantonness of their treatment, in regard to the construction industry.  It is hardly a mere coincidence that on the two previous occasions when Coalition Governments were in office, the mistake was made of not paying enough attention to the construction industry.</P>

    <P>After agriculture the construction industry is our most important industry. Apart from the social aspect of providing such a basic need as housing for our people, there are the many ancillary industries involved.  The Government are supposed to be rich in experience <Col N="120" /> and to have a wealth of economists but so far there have been no signs of the problems of the construction industry being tackled.  The misery attached to losing one's job need hardly be emphasised but there are difficulties for people in other ways in so far as housing is concerned.  Because of Government bungling young couples today are deprived of the opportunity of acquiring a dwelling of their own. The Minister for Local Government may state that there is no crisis in the industry but can he tell us, then, why so many building operatives have become unemployed or why the seven builders' providers in this city are working a 3-day week?  I heard the excuse put forward that the providers had overstocked but one does not overstock when there is a good demand for one's products because, in that case, one is selling all the time.</P>
    <P>Even at this late stage will the Government listen to those people who have been telling them that all is not well in the building industry?  Will they listen to the trade unions concerned? Will they tell the people why there is such a drop in the private sector of building?  Can they guarantee that they will reach their target of 25,000 dwellings next year as they did this year?  Last year when the Minister told us of the target he had in mind we wished him well and we did anything we could to speed up the housing drive.  However, the Government have bungled the situation. The purchasing power of the people is not being maintained.  Not enough money is being injected into the industry and young couples today are finding it increasingly difficult to save a deposit for their houses.  In any large urban area the maximum loan from local government for a house is £4,500 but most houses are selling at more than £6,000.  Therefore, a young couple must find at least £1,500 for a deposit.  Added to this are legal expenses and a house must be furnished. That is why I say it is being made impossible for a young couple to purchase a house.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanMoore" hpid="Mr. Moore Mr. Moore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moore</NameTxt>
      <P>I appreciate the point made by the Chair.  The sum total of unemployment is a reduction in the purchasing power of the people and as purchasing power decreases unemployment increases and, so, the vicious circle goes on.</P>
      <P>If the Government wish to curb unemployment and it is my belief that they do because I do not think anyone would wish for the creation of unemployment, they are going about it in the wrong way.  The construction industry is an example of where they have gone wrong.  That industry is being starved of funds and this is causing a great social problem.  The Government should drop their classic economists and bring in a few of those off the street who are looking for houses and ask them where are the difficulties.  They would say the difficulty is that they cannot bridge the gap between the Local Government loan and the selling price of the house.  The Government are going on with grandiose schemes, telling us what will happen next year and what they did last year.  It is a kind of Alice in Wonderland Government with jam yesterday and jam tomorrow but never jam today.  It is today the people want employment.</P>
      <P>Deputy O'Malley gave a very good illustration of the position in Limerick where there is large-scale redundancy and where there are promises of two major industries which will not become operational until 1976.  What will the unemployed do in the intervening period?  Wait in the hope that State funds will keep them from starvation? The vast majority of people do not want that kind of existence.  We have seen unemployment before but what we now feel a grievance about is that the Government when elected had great plans for full employment. Allowing for the fact that there is a world economic blizzard, we see no proper planning to reduce the effect of it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is a basic reason for that.  It is that the Coalition Government is composed of the Fine Gael Party which is generally conservative in outlook <Col N="122" /> and the Labour Party which is socialist in outlook.  Outside or even native investors do not know whether it is a Government of free enterprise or a Government of dogmatic socialism. The people who are suffering through this ideological battle between the two parties are those now losing their jobs by the thousand each week. It has been stated that by next year we may well have 90,000 unemployed. We should like to put the Government on notice that we on this side of the House have no intention of sitting back and seeing 90,000 unemployed. The Government must even at this late stage decide whether it is a Government of free enterprise or one of tough, dogmatic socialism.  They must first make up their minds on that and, secondly, they must agree to make every possible effort to save the construction industry because, if they do not, unemployment will not be reduced and they will breed that kind of despair in people's minds that will cause loss of confidence in any form of democratic Government.</P>

      <P>My point is that the Ministers should drop their extramural activities and confine themselves to the job they were appointed to do, to build the economy so that we can offer a full life at home to each of our citizens, to each family a proper housing standard and for each person willing to work and capable of working there should at least be a prospect of gainful employment. The Government have fallen down on this and if people had a chance of passing judgment on their efforts I know what the result would be.  I plead with Government through the Minister to make every possible effort to rejuvenate the construction industry.  If they do not, I can well believe we shall have 90,000 unemployed by January.</P>

      <P>I made this request today following a question by me to the Minister for Industry and Commerce last week regarding job creation and job opportunities for those becoming unemployed in the Cork area.  To say I was dissatisfied with the Minister's reply is to put it mildly.  It appears that the Minister for Industry and Commerce and the Government generally have lost interest in the employment situation.  As one leading article during the week put it, they are now a group of tired Ministers who had the will but no longer have the intention.  This seems to be the position.  I am sorry; it is no pleasure for me to contribute to a motion like this.  I should like to have an hour to discuss all the problems that exist but, because my time is so short, I shall refer only to the Cork situation.</P>
      <P>The Minister for Industry and Commerce talks about job promises for 1975 and 1976 but I ask him as a matter of urgency what is the position of those now losing their jobs.  In my own constituency is an area affected more than many others and that is Blarney.  Blarney has a tradition of a textile industry going back over hundreds of years.  We have had redundancy after redundancy and it is still not finished.  There is one new industry coming which is very welcome but it will only cater for a fraction of the people being laid off.  What is in store for those in the 45-55 age group who are laid off?  Is it permanent redundancy? What effort did the Minister and his party make to avert this?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am disappointed that the Ministers for Industry and Commerce and Labour are not listening to me.  The Minister for Posts and Telegraphs is present.  We have seen him interfere in other Departments but I have not yet heard him comment on the unemployment position.  I would ask him to convey to the Government the seriousness of the position that exists in Blarney. Despite the apparent lack of interest on the part of himself and the <Col N="124" /> Government, let them, for goodness sake, come to Blarney before Christmas and do something.</P>
    <P>I suggest two things&mdash;I am sorry I have not more time.  One is to set up a source of emergency finance for these companies that are in trouble and the second is to push and promote with the utmost vigour a Buy Irish campaign. It is the best form of patriotism and the one that should be, but is not preached by Government Ministers.  It is a sad state of affairs that in Cork city shops there are far more English and Scottish Christmas cards on sale for this Christmas than there are Irish. Shame on the Government and shame on the Labour Ministers within that Government for accepting the situation that now exists.</P>

      <P>The motion before the House is:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;That Dáil Éireann deplores the failure of the Government to produce coherent policies to combat the problem of rapidly rising unemployment.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>We had a geography lesson from the Minister for Labour who cited a variety of countries out of the White Paper, Canada, France, Italy, Germany and others.  It was a fairly selective presentation.  On the other hand, we had the Minister for Finance today at Question Time saying in reply to a colleague of mine who had inquired whether the Government had decided to publish a plan:</P>
      <P>We have not come to a decision not to publish one.  The exercise of revising expectations is continuing all the time and as soon as one can assume with reasonable certainty the pattern of likely performance in the world economic scene a plan will be published.</P>
      <P>So, in fact, the Government have no plan.  The Minister for Finance has indicated that they are not prepared to produce a plan.  Our motion is that the Government have no coherent plan to combat unemployment.  Every member of the Government must support this motion considering that one Minister has indicated that they have no plan.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister for Finance was questioned <Col N="125" /> today about the printing of labels for the Department of Posts and Telegraphs and again, shame on the Government, those labels were printed in Britain.  Irishmen are not good enough to produce this kind of work.  Our workers are as efficient and more so than people across the water.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dowling</NameTxt>
      <P>I would ask the Government to ensure that every commodity that can be produced here will be produced here in the future.  If we look at the ever extending queues outside the labour exchanges we will become aware of the situation.  No doubt the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs, the Minister for Finance or other Ministers are not aware of the situation.  They were never on dole queues.  They do not want to know about dole queues, they do not want to know about unemployment, and they have no policy, as was admitted today by the Minister for Finance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The figures published by the Central Statistics Office do not give a true picture of the situation but according to the Central Statistics Office on 11th October we had 71,500 people unemployed, on 18th October we had 72,499, on the 25th we had 73,477, on 1st November we had 74,850, on 8th November we had 76,282, on 15th November we had 78,474 and the figures for 22nd November are not yet available.  They must be fairly substantial when they have not yet been released.  We have an increasing number of people unemployed while items that could be produced at home are being produced abroad and the Government are standing by and allowing this to happen.  In addition to this the number of people on short time has increased since 11th October from 2,717 to 4,329.  This does not take into consideration the vast number <Col N="126" /> of people who do not pay social welfare contributions and do not draw social assistance.  There are a large number of self-employed and professional people who are now unemployed.  They do not appear on the live register.  The figure of 78,000 is a farce.  As I indicated on the last occasion, the figures fall far short of the actual situation.  If the age for receipt of old age pensions had not been reduced from 70 to 68, the figure would now be in the region of 110,000 unemployed.  The change in the age was a sensible one and possibly one that was long overdue but it means that another 25,000 or 30,000 people can be added to that figure.</P>
    <P>We now find the Minister for Finance telling us they have no plan and will not have a plan until such time as they can read the world situation. We had geography lessons from the Minister for Labour.  The people want to know the actual position. The outlook for 1975 gives some indication of what is to come.  It says that due mainly to causes not of Ireland's making the economic outlook for the economy for 1975 is not promising.  It says that present indications are that our major problems of sluggish growth, high unemployment, rapid price increases and a large balance of payments will continue.  That is what the workers have to look forward to.</P>
    <P>The problems that confront our major industries&mdash;the building industry, the textile industry, the boot and shoe industry have been indicated here.  I would say the Government have deliberately killed the building industry.  I believe there was a positive approach by the Government to kill the building industry because no effort has been made by any Minister to ensure that the building industry, which is a very important industry and one which would help to stimulate other industries, would not be allowed to run down.  It was allowed to run down to the same level as it did on the previous occasion when the Coalition Government were in power.  Who will be the victims but the wage earners?  People in cushioned positions like Ministers of State will not be affected by the upsurge in prices and by unemployment until the next <Col N="127" /> election.  Then they will probably find themselves out of this House and they may have second thoughts but it will be too late.</P>
    <P>I will not deal with price rises or promises, with the way the people were fooled prior to the last general election, the misleading statements that were made.</P>

The promise to reduce prices made during the last election campaign was a betrayal.  The people who now show no concern for the unemployed will <Col N="128" /> have quite a lot to answer for in the future.  A Minister of State has stated they have no policy.  We hope that when the vote comes the people who have read the motion will vote according to their consciences.</P>
      <P>I want to say again how appalled I was when it was indicated today that simple items that could be produced here are being produced outside the country and that Departments of State are aiding and abetting unemployment by purchasing from abroad.  Our workers are better than the workers of any country.  They are sought throughout the world.  I hope the policy of the Government will be revised at an early date.</P>

The question as to whether or not the High Court could supply a judge is not a matter appropriate to be dealt with here at all.

      <P>But this is a board.  It is not a court.  A judge appointed by the Government to do court work would have the option of refusing to be chairman of the board. He could put forward the very good and valid reason that he was not a qualified planner and, therefore, was not capable of being chairman of a planning board which this is.</P>
      <P>Since we are all agreed that the chairman of the planning board should be a judge, there is a lot to be said for the Minister suggesting to the Government, when the time comes, that a judge should be appointed specifically for the purpose of chairing the board.  He should be selected after the Government have made inquiries into his qualifications.  He will be a legal person which is a very necessary qualification for somebody who will study and adjudicate on planning appeal decisions.  As well as that, it is desirable that he should have some planning experience.</P>

In the selection of the judge who is to be chairman of the board, regard should be had to two things.  It is automatic that he will be a legal person, but regard should also be had to whether he has any planning qualifications.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cunningham</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad the Minister has clarified the position.  If for some reason or a number of reasons an existing judge cannot do the job or refuses to do the job, the Minister has agreed, and rightly so, that a special judge can be appointed to do the job.  Being specially appointed, he will have a full-time job. It is desirable that he should have the qualifications which I have suggested.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>We seem to be going from the sublime to the ridiculous. Apparently the Opposition are prepared to accept the appointment of a judge or an ex-judge.  It is then suggested that we should ask the existing judges now if any of them would be prepared&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>The Opposition cannot have it both ways.  They want to know if there have been consultations.  The suggestion is that a judge may not take the job.  Deputy Cunningham seems to be in some doubt about being able to get a judge with legal knowledge.</P>

      <P>He then suggested that he should have planning knowledge. Let us be reasonable.  We will not get a judge who will be an expert on planning.  A judge or an ex-judge who is asked to do the job will be considered suitable.  Although I greatly doubt it, it is possible that none of the judges will want to do it.  I would be amazed if any judge who was asked to do it refused.  If he does refuse, since it will then be in an Act of Parliament, the onus will be on the Government to appoint a judge who will do it.  Having reached that stage, for the life of me I cannot see what the argument is about.  We ask an existing judge or an ex-judge and, if an existing judge or ex-judge will not accept, it will be necessary to appoint somebody to do the job.  Where do we go?  What is the difficulty?</P>

    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think we <Col N="134" /> have got across to the Minister yet that this is a significantly and radically different type of job.  The only word I can use in this connection is that it is an executive type of job.  All the extra-curricular work judges have been asked to do was more or less an extension of their own judicial work.  They presided over some commission, or some board of inquiry, or something of that nature.  Here they will be dealing with commercial considerations. It is an executive type job. It will be the same executive type of job as the Parliamentary Secretary or the Minister was doing before.  It is totally different from the ordinary judicial functions which a judge carries out.</P>
      <P>It is perfectly legitimate for us on this side of the House to say we will not get a retired judge.  As I understand it, the Minister is in agreement with us that it would be infinitely preferable to get a serving judge and that this is not the sort of task which could be undertaken by a man who has retired.  There may be an exceptional situation from time to time in which we will have to go to the retired ranks to get somebody, but in the normal way we will be dealing with serving judges.</P>
      <P>All we are saying to the Minister is this: between now and the time this Bill leaves the Dáil or Seanad, would it not be wise to consult with the President of the High Court and say: &ldquo;This situation will arise very shortly.  Are you in a position to supply a judge who is not fully occupied and who will be able to carry out this task?  If you are not, we will have to appoint an additional judge.&rdquo;  If the President of the High Court says: &ldquo;I have no judge who can take on this task.  They are all fully occupied with the pressure of work in the courts at the moment.  I will not be able to make a judge available&rdquo;, the Minister can put down an amendment and provide in this Bill for the appointment of an additional judge if that is necessary.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We are not looking a gift horse in the mouth.  We appreciate that the Minister has met us with this amendment. We acknowledge that and we accept that he has been resonable in <Col N="135" /> agreeing to appoint a judge to this post.  We are pressing him to go a little further and to see a little ahead and to make provision for a situation in which a judge of the High Court will not be readily or immediately available for this new and onerous type of task which no judge has undertaken so far. I do not think it is unreasonable to ask the Minister to have these consultations either with the President of the High Court or with his colleague the Minister for Justice.  If it is apparent that there will be a need for an additional judge, let us know that and let us deal with it now.</P>

What we have at the moment meets the requirements of the Opposition and is what we think should be done.  I cannot see why there is all this talk about consultation.  Before the new planning board is set up, of course arrangements will have to be made to have somebody who will act as chairman.  Otherwise there would not be any point in passing the Bill through the House.  But that is a long way off and it would be a little ludicrous to go now to the President of <Col N="136" /> the High Court and say: &ldquo;We have a planning Bill which is at the start of Committee Stage and we want to know is there any judge who would be prepared to take on the job as chairman.&rdquo;  We have yet to define what he will be taking on. I suggest that the reasonable way is to accept.  Do not look a gift horse in the month. What has been put in can be accepted by everybody in the House with the exception of Deputy Callanan and one or two others.  Therefore, I suggest we go ahead.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes.  The effect of the amendment is to move the phrase <Col N="137" />&ldquo;in the opinion of the board&rdquo; to the first line of subsection (1).  This is primarily a drafting change to make clear that the board will have some discretion with regard to the extent to which it will be necessary for them to keep themselves informed of policy and objectives.  This may help to meet the view expressed by Deputy Molloy on Second Stage.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>This is reasonable and improves the drafting of the section.  The combined effect of amendments Nos. 4 and 6 is simply to take the words &ldquo;in the opinion of the Board&rdquo; from where they are at present and put them after &ldquo;may&rdquo; in the first line of section 4.  That makes the meaning much more precise.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 5.</P>
      <P>In subsection (1), page 3, line 37 and page 4, line 1, to delete &ldquo;and any other body which is a public authority&rdquo; and substitute &ldquo;or any public authority or any other body&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In my view this amendment has great significance.  I ask the Minister, therefore, to accept it.  It is crucial to the successful operation of the measure and to the view the public will take of the board in its deliberations in the future.  If our amendment is not accepted, under this section the board are bound to keep themselves informed of the policies and objectives for the time being of the Minister for Local Government, planning authorities and any other body which is a public authority whose functions in the opinion of the board may have a bearing on proper planning and development.  This provision, limited as it is to policies of the Minister, planning authorities or public authorities, is we feel weighted against such opinions as might properly be taken into account by the board such as the opinions of private individuals or groups who concern themselves with proper planning and development, either generally or in particular areas. It appears that the constant flow of <Col N="138" /> information with regard to policies and objectives of the Minister and public authorities will condition, of necessity, the minds of the board in their deliberations so that they might be over-influenced by what might be described as the official view.</P>
    <P>The amendment is to delete the words &ldquo;and any other body which is a public authority&rdquo; where these appear on page 3, line 37 and substitute &ldquo;or any public authority or any other body&rdquo;.  The board in its deliberations should not be confined soley to considering the official views.  There are many concerned citizens in the community who have in the past displayed a great willingness to make a contribution to the betterment of their local environment.  They were represented at appeals in the past to planning authorities on matters of importance, large and small.  If this board, which will be completely removed from the political field, is confined to the consideration of the views of those persons named in section 4, it will present a very stifled view of community thinking on planning and development.</P>
    <P>This danger did not exist under the 1963 Act where the Minister was responsible for making final decisions on appeals.  The Minister is a political figure involved with the community and is very much aware of the feelings of the people.  Up to now he had the power when deciding appeals to take all relevant factors into consideration. This board will not be in such a happy position.  They will not be in close touch with the feelings and views of the community.  They will be removed from the ordinary stream of life.  They should be allowed to take into consideration views other than the official view.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>This is one amendment which I could not accept.  I do not think Deputy Molloy has properly understood what he is suggesting.  The purpose of section 4 is to give a guidance to the board as to the context in which they should approach their task in deciding planning appeals.  We cannot have a situation where the board would be operating <Col N="139" /> generally in a manner which would frustrate the policies and objectives of public authorities.  Public authorities are charged with the responsibility for housing, roads, transport, tourism, harbours, airports, conservation and so on.  It is not the function of the board to make policy in these matters but to decide how far individual development proposals are compatible with, or prejudicial to, public policy and objectives.  Where there is no objective of this kind permission will normally be forthcoming provided the proposals conform to proper standards of design, layout, drainage and so forth.</P>
      <P>To introduce bodies other than public authorities is to confuse the issue.  The board are not concerned in the same way with the policies and objectives of other bodies.  It will be open to them, as it is at present, to put forward the views in relation to particular development proposals and these views will, of course, be considered by the board in the same way as they are considered by the Minister when he is making appeal decisions. Therefore, I believe the amendment should be withdrawn because if what Deputy Molloy is suggesting&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Molloy is suggesting that &ldquo;any other body&rdquo; the local football club, the local fishing club development association or Children of Mary, it does not matter who they are, be included.  Where does one draw the line?  Jehovah Witnesses would be another body also and they would be all entitled to make representations if Deputy Molloy's amendment is accepted.  We want to ensure that this will only apply to a public <Col N="140" /> authority, the only people entitled to do this.  The elected representatives are there to do this type of job and nobody else.  We would be as well to scrap the Bill as it is now because it would be completely unworkable if everybody was allowed to come in as Deputy Molloy suggests.</P>

      <P>Section 4 suggests that the board will keep themselves informed of ministerial policies and policies of statutory bodies such as county councils but it does not say that the board must carry out the wishes of the Minister.  I hope this board will be an independent body and not subject to the political wishes of the Minister, or the policies of a particular party in Government.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cunningham</NameTxt>
      <P>Everybody is out of step all along except the Minister. He is the possessor of all wisdom and knowledge.  Any board will take cognisance of governmental and ministerial policies, but I hope not of ministerial directions.  Local authorities can make their wishes known to such a board and make suggestions on planning matters.  The Minister is putting the board in a very isolated position.  Previous Ministers, and the present occupier of the office, have taken cognisance of advice on planning matters from An Taisce and the Department of Lands who have a special section dealing with conservation and preservation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In my view this section is very narrow.  Deputy Molloy's amendment is wide enough to take in the Department <Col N="141" /> of Lands who are interested in policies on planning.  The Department of Agriculture and Fisheries are also interested in planning.  I am supporting the amendment of Deputy Molloy because it is necessary and is good.  It takes away from the board the stigma which the Minister, in his section, is trying to attach to them. The Minister is trying to label the board as a body who must listen to him, the Government, or the local authorities.  This is wrong.  Section 4, as at present drafted, hamstrings the board from the start.</P>
    <P>The Minister should envisage a situation, as the amendment does, where responsible and recognised bodies such as the Department of Lands, An Taisce, the ICA and Bord Fáilte may wish to put forward suggestions on planning.  I know it is the Minister's habit, and method, to make anything that comes from this side of the House sound ridiculous.  To bring in the Children of Mary sounds good in the Minister's ears but I do not believe it cuts any ice from the logical point of view.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cunningham</NameTxt>
      <P>There are other bodies, apart from those to which the Minister is trying to confine this Bill, whose policies I would listen to.  I did listen to the policies of such bodies when I was dealing with planning and I was glad to receive their advice.  In some cases I accepted their advice. Deputy Molloy is trying to bring the board into the position which the Minister holds of deciding planning appeals in accordance with the policy.  Any Minister would be wise to go easy on dictation in this respect.  I accept that there are broad principles of Government policy with which such a board must familiarise themselves.  However, the Minister should not put the board in a different category to that which the Minister occupied up to now.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The House agrees that it is preferable that such a board should deal with planning appeals rather than the Minister for Local Government, but, having agreed to that, that situation is spoiled unless Deputy Molloy's amendment is <Col N="142" /> accepted.  The board the Minister proposes to establish should not be in an inferior position to the Minister or his predecessors.  This board should be able to avail of the advice of the bodies I have mentioned.  If Deputy Molloy's amendment is not accepted this board will be surrounded by red tape from the start.</P>

      <P>I must confess I am not happy with the section as it stands. Whether we accept Deputy Molloy's amendment or not.  We must make some improvement along the lines he suggests.  We are dealing in this section <Col N="143" /> with instructions to the board. The section will lay down and make it mandatory on the board that they should inform themselves on certain matters.  It is easy to be wise after the event, and I am looking at the section now and I am not so sure we were wise to accept the Minister's proposal to insert &ldquo;in the opinion of the board&rdquo; after &ldquo;may&rdquo; in the first line.  We were quite right to take those words out of where they occurred after &ldquo;function&rdquo;.  The section reads much better now with those words out of where they were originally interpolated.</P>
      <P>The section now reads much better when it reads: &ldquo;which is a public authority whose functions have or may have&rdquo;, not whether in the opinion of the board they have or may have.  It is a question of fact.  I do not think the opinion of the board enters into that matter and we were quite right in our treatment of that. However, I am not so sure, looking at the section as it now reads, that we were wise to put the words into the first line of section 1.  The section now reads:</P>
      <P>The board shall, so far as may in the opinion of the board be necessary for the performance of its functions...</P>
      <P>That leaves the situation very open and, as Deputy Cunningham was indicating, the interpolation of those words in the first line, after &ldquo;may&rdquo; takes from the strength of the word &ldquo;shall&rdquo;.  That is an aspect of the section to which I would direct the attention of the Minister because of the amendment we have just made to the section.  We are concerned here with making it obligatory on this new board to take into account certain policies and to keep themselves informed of the policies and objectives &mdash;I think the Minister was talking about proposals&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>Did I say proposals?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister did. All we are concerned with here is which are the bodies whose policies and objectives this new board must <Col N="144" /> inform themselves of.  We are concerned with what type of body we are to make it mandatory on the new planning body to inform themselves of their policies.  We are dealing with something of significance and substance. This Bill will involve the new board in a certain amount of reading, of research, keeping themselves up-to-date with a wide variety of documents and publications.  As the section stands, the board will be concerned with the Minister's policies and objectives, the policies and objectives of all the planning authorities in the country.  Therefore, at this stage we are only concerned with which other bodies, outside those, it will be mandatory on this new planning authority to concern themselves about.</P>
      <P>The Minister's approach to this problem is very simple.  He has said that in addition to the Minister for Local Government and the planning authorities the board will have to inform themselves of the policies and objectives of</P>
      <P>any Minister of State not being the Minister, the Commissioners of Public Works in Ireland, the Irish Land Commission, a harbour authority within the meaning of section 2 of the Harbours Act, 1946, and any other body established by or under statute which is for the time being declared, by regulation made by the Minister, to be a public authority for the purpose of this section.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That is the Minister's approach.  I think that can be restrictive.  The Minister can only declare a body established under statute to be a public body.  The Minister was inclined to talk in terms of elected bodies.  Under the section as it stands, he can declare any body established under statute to be a public authority. It does not have to be an elected body.  I do not think there is anything to be lost by adopting Deputy Molloy's argument and permitting himself to declare anybody, whether established under statute or not, to be a public body.  If he is prepared to make this new body to inform themselves of the policies and objectives of any body <Col N="145" /> which he by order declares to be a public authority, why restrict it to a body established under statute?  As the situation develops, he might think it would be very useful if he by order were to make it mandatory on the new board to inform themselves of the policies and objectives of some bodies not established under statute. Deputy Molloy comes at that in a different way and if the Minister is not prepared to accept Deputy Molloy's amendment&mdash;I think he should&mdash;then he should be prepared to delete the words &ldquo;by or under statute&rdquo;.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>Which kind of body is the Deputy thinking of?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not know if An Taisce have been established under statute.</P>

      <P>No.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>It might strike the Minister as being desirable some day to make the new planning authority inform themselves fully of the policies and objectives of An Taisce.  That is the sort of body I have in mind.  We are not talking of the Children of Mary, or bodies like that.  An Taisce are the sort of body Deputy Molloy and I have in mind.  We are prepared to limit it.  The Minister, in limiting it, is giving himself the right to ask, by order, bodies which are established under statute.  I think he could go that bit further and give himself authority to declare some important body, not necessarily established by statute.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not want to be taken as being derogatory about An Taisce or anything else but An Taisce are a private body set up under the Companies Act.  They can have their own rules.  The Department of Local Government some years ago said they were a body which could be consulted by the planning authorities and, as such, they have been offering an opinion.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Possibly what I should have done at the start&mdash;and which might have saved a lot of this discussion&mdash;is to read the section.  Some of the people <Col N="146" /> who have been talking here have not read section 4.  Section 4 (1) says:</P>
    <P>The Board shall, so far as may be necessary for the performance of its functions, keep itself informed of the policies and objectives for the time being of the Minister, planning authorities and any other body which is a public authority whose functions in the opinion of the Board have, or may have, a bearing on the proper planning and development (including the preservation and development of amenities) of cities, towns or other areas, whether urban or rural.</P>
    <P>Amendments to that were accepted.</P>
    <P>I want to refer now particularly to subsection (2) of section 4 which says:</P>
    <P>In this section &ldquo;public authority&rdquo; means any Minister of State not being the Minister, the Commissioners of Public Works in Ireland, the Irish Land Commission, a harbour authority within the meaning of section 2 of the Harbours Act, 1946, and any other body established by or under statute which is for the time being declared, by regulation made by the Minister, to be a public authority for the purpose of this section.</P>
    <P>Therefore, to suggest that the Land Commission or anybody associated with it or that the Department of Lands could not be included here, as Deputy Cunningham was suggesting&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>We withdrew that. We are not making that point.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad that that has been clarified.  What Deputy Haughey had been saying was that in addition to those, several other bodies which might be declared to be public bodies by the Minister might be included. But, as it stands&mdash;and, again, let me refer to my notes because, despite objections to them&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not mind them at all but I would prefer the Minister's own words.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>Subsection (1) requires that the board keep themselves informed <Col N="147" /> of the policies and objectives of the Minister, planning authorities and certain other bodies in so far as may be necessary for the performance of their functions.  Those other bodies are defined in subsection (2).  It will be for the board to decide how far and to what extent they will keep themselves generally informed to comply with this statutory requirement but will probably invite Departments and so on to provide a synopsis of present policies and objectives and to notify changes as they occur.  The bodies concerned will also be able to put forward views in relation to appeals and be represented at oral hearings, as has been done in the past.  In fact, I think everything that has been done is still open.  What I do not want to do, and I am sure Deputy Molloy did not intend it this way, I am sure he would agree, as would Deputy Haughey and Deputy Cunningham also, that it could be considered that if we simply said: &ldquo;any other bodies&rdquo;&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>That is not in the amendment.  The amendment before the House says &ldquo;any other body&rdquo;, which would mean that anybody, any group at all, would be entitled to be considered.  It could create a position which would make the new Act unworkable. It is as simple as that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Mr. Molloy Mr. Molloy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>There is one point which the Minister is missing.  I suggest that he read section 4 (1) again and place some emphasis on the words &ldquo;whose functions...have, or may have, a bearing on the proper planning and development...of cities, towns or other areas, whether urban or rural&rdquo;.  All I am suggesting is that if, in the opinion of the board there are bodies whose functions have, or may have, a bearing on the proper planning and development of towns, cities and other areas, this should be taken into account by the board.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Section 4 is quite an important section.  It gives direction to the board <Col N="148" /> about the authorities of whose policies they must inform themselves; the views with which they must acquaint themselves and it confines those views to public authorities.  There are views in this country other than those of public authorities, views which are very representative of the community. Often the thinking of public authorities is stifled and not always the most imaginative.  To deny the board the right to take those other views into consideration is wrong.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>We are not denying them the right.  They are entitled to take them into consideration but we are not saying that they must do so.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Mr. Molloy Mr. Molloy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>All that is written down here is that:</P>
      <P>The Board shall, so far as may be necessary for the performance of its functions, keep itself informed of the policies and objectives</P>
      <P>of those public authorities, provided the board feels that the functions of those authorities have a bearing on planning and development.  But it shall keep itself informed only of the official view.  All we are asking is that it be extended to include &ldquo;and any other body&rdquo; which, in the opinion of the board, has functions which have, or may have, a bearing on proper planning and development.</P>
      <P>What we are suggesting is not anything that will greatly upset the section because the ultimate decider as to whether or not their views should be taken into consideration will be the board.  But they cannot take those views into consideration, or are not obliged to as the section stands.  I cannot see why the Minister sees any great difficulty in accepting the amendment, in allowing those other bodies to have their views taken into account also by the board in their consideration of planning and development matters.  It is stifling and restritive to confine those views to the official view and to the bodies outlined here.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I feel acceptance of this amendment would be welcomed by the community as an indication that we are not having foisted upon us a board which will place themselves aloof and <Col N="149" /> remote from the community once they come into operation.  If they have in the Bill under which they are set up, provisions which require them to acquaint themselves with the views of bodies other than the official view, then the people will look upon this board in a more human light.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>Again, there must be a slight mistake here because I am sure Deputy Molloy will understand that there is no restriction.  What we say is that cognisance must be taken of statutory bodies.  Everybody else can but the onus will be on the planning authority to take cognisance of the statutory bodies whose job it is to look at these things.</P>
      <P>Deputy Molloy made a comment about cities and towns in dealing with planning.  In Deputy Haughey's area I found recently two bodies which would be concerned with planning in the local area.</P>

      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>Let us get back to the amendment in the name of Deputy Molloy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LiamCunningham" hpid="Mr. Cunningham Mr. Cunningham">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cunningham</NameTxt>
      <P>The bodies mentioned in the section are subject to directives from the Minister for Local Government, although, perhaps, the word &ldquo;directive&rdquo; is too strong.  What is the purpose of sending out circulars to a local authority telling them to <Col N="152" /> adopt a certain course?  Is such a circular from the Minister to a local authority a directive or is it not? The Minister is trying to impose limitations on the new board and it will hamstring them from the beginning.</P>
      <P>Deputy Molloy's amendment meets another point.  We talk about cross-Border development.  We have cross-Border planning co-operation.  I am referring to planning in the counties of Donegal, Tyrone, Monaghan, Louth and Fermanagh.  We must familiarise ourselves with the policies of the authority in the North and the board must do likewise.  Equally, the people north of the Border must familiarise themselves with planning objectives and developments on both sides of the Border.  We cannot work in two separate compartments especially with regard to planning.</P>
      <P>Deputy Molloy's amendment would cover that situation.  The Minister is being very childish if he suggests that we envisage a multitude of organisations that would have to be consulted, whose opinions and policies would need to be considered by the board. We have not that in mind.  If the Minister wants to eliminate a number of them, he can do that in an amendment on Report Stage.  We can be more specific in a further amendment by us on that Stage.</P>
      <P>I should not like to see this section pass as it stands.  I should like to see a situation existing where the board would have to consider and familiarise themselves with the policies on planning of the Assembly in the North so that there would be co-operation between both bodies and other organisations. I support fully the amendment put forward by Deputy Molloy.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RayBurke" hpid="Mr. R.P. Burke Mr. R.P. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R.P. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>As I read this section, I consider we are setting up a large bureaucratic body.  While the present situation where the Minister is the person responsible for deciding on planning appeals has many drawbacks, at least it has the advantage that there is some democratic control in that the Minister is elected by the people, is responsible to them and has to depend on them for re-election.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="153" /> If Deputy Molloy's amendment is not accepted, we will be moving away from democratic control.  We are setting up a body by an Act of the Oireachtas, one that will not hear anyone other than the Minister and the public authorities.  Surely there are many other voices entitled to be heard.  The Minister spoke about bodies that have statutory recognition. We have local government laws and one of them makes provision for recognised local councils.  They are recognised under statute.  Surely the members of a recognised local council, representing their own areas, who have an intimate knowledge of the affairs of their areas, are entitled to be heard?  Surely at least this one democratic proviso would save the board from becoming merely a bureaucratic machine, not subject to any control, because as the Bill stands we are setting up a board, appointing a judge to act as chairman and appointing other members but there is no way that we, as Members of this House, can debate the activities of that board?  Admittedly, a report may be laid before the Dáil once a year but this report will not be subject to debate in this Chamber.  There will be no democratic control of this board and the more one instructs any such board to listen only to public authorities or to the Minister the more they are being removed from the ordinary people&mdash;the people who are affected by planning decisions.  Surely, therefore, the Minister would agree with the amendment in the name of Deputy Molloy because what body are more entitled to be heard than those bodies of people who will be affected by the decisions made by this board?</P>
    <P>Surely the Minister would agree that the best way of ensuring that the board would at least have some democratic control would be to agree to this amendment, that is that the board shall hear the views of any public authority or any other body.  By that is meant recognised local authorities, authorities recognised under statute of this House or any such body as An Taisce.  Unless there is this type of control and this type of proviso <Col N="154" /> there will be set up a large steam-roller of a bureaucratic organisation the ear of which will be given only to the Minister and public authorities. This is a wrong trend.  Instead of going away from local democracy as we are doing here, we should be moving towards it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnCallanan" hpid="Mr. Callanan Mr. Callanan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Callanan</NameTxt>
      <P>Seemingly I am not the odd man out here because Deputy Burke appears to have reservations also.  I support the amendment but I do not think the section goes far enough on the question of the board keeping themselves informed.  I would like the Minister to take a serious look at this aspect of the proposal. Who is to inform them?  The local authority are a planning authority and matters of interpretation are carried out for them by officials.  In respect of a planning appeal a decision is made by the county manager, although section 4 may alter that.  Is it the county manager who is to be asked for details of policy?  Would the Minister not insert a provision in the Bill that the board keep themselves informed by means of the knowledge that is at the disposal of local authorities?  That is what I would like to see in the Bill.  Otherwise, it is not going far enough in so far as obtaining the views of the elected representatives of local authorities is concerned.  We, in local authorities, are supposed to be the planning authority but in practice that is not so.  What we do is to put forward our interpretation in regard to all cases of planning.  If this board are to deal with a planning appeal concerning, say, County Galway, must they go down to the county manager and ask for his views? Should not the people responsible for drawing up the plan, for instance, the chairman of the county council and another member, be asked for their views?  For Report Stage I hope there will be a clear spelling out of who is to keep the board informed about the views of the planning authorities. I support the amendment in the belief that the more people who are consulted in regard to planning, the better, but I am very strong on the point that the elected representatives <Col N="155" /> should be consulted rather than that the view of some official be taken.</P>

There seems to be some doubt in the minds of some people as to the difference between an elected representative, that is, a person elected under universal suffrage and a person elected by various other means to local bodies. So far as I am concerned the elected representative takes precedence over everybody else.  At a time of local elections everybody has a right to go forward as a candidate.</P>

      <P>Deputy Haughey suggested that perhaps we might be able to overcome this problem.  That would be my suggestion also, because the whole idea of discussing the Bill is to try to improve it.  For Report Stage I would be prepared to consider having a look at subsection (1), line 37 and, perhaps, after &ldquo;planning authorities&rdquo; to insert &ldquo;and any other person or body which is prescribed by regulations made by the Minister...&rdquo; This is something like what Deputy Haughey suggested earlier and might meet requirements. I am not trying to make it too narrow but neither am I making it a mile wide so that every crank in the country can create some little group and say, according to the Act, he is entitled with his association to have a say in the matter.  If that happened there would be no planning.  In an effort to meet the Opposition I suggest this change.  It will have to be dressed up, perhaps, for Report Stage. I shall repeat it slowly:</P>
      <P>In subsection (1), line 37, after &ldquo;planning authorities&rdquo; to insert &ldquo;and any other person or body which is prescribed (by regulations made by the Minister) for the purposes of this section&rdquo;.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Mr. Molloy Mr. Molloy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 7.</P>
      <P>To delete subsection (1) and substitute the following:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(1)  The Minister shall give to the planning authorities under the Principal Act general directives as to policy in relation to planning and development, and the Board shall have due regard to such directives.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>The amendment proposes a small change in section 5 as proposed by the Minister.  Subsection (1) states: &ldquo;The Minister may give to the Board general directives as to policy in relation to development&rdquo; and subsection (2) says: &ldquo;The Board shall, in performing its functions, have regard to any directives under this section&rdquo;. My amendment proposes that the Minister shall give general directives ...and that the board shall have due regard to such directives.  I think the Minister should be obliged to make such a directive available to the board. There are arguments against it.  Those who wish to take a cynical view of the Bill could say that although the Minister is creating a board, at the same time he is giving himself power in this section to issue directives to that board which will influence their decisions and in this way is exercising influence and eroding the independence of the board.  That being a fairly legitimate and somewhat cynical view I must conclude that taking all factors into consideration it should be obligatory on the Minister to inform this board by way of directive of the general policy which the Government and the Department wished to have implemented under the Planning and Development Act.  Otherwise the board would be operating in a vacuum&mdash;if such knowledge was not made available to them by the head of the Department of Local Government charged with responsibility for planning matters.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="160" /> I hope that the cynical view will not prove to be correct and that this section will be subsequently used to influence decisions of the board.  At present we can only take the view of the angels and assume that such would not be the case and that the directives would be of a general nature and could not influence any individual application.</P>
    <P>I was not happy about the Minister's choice of the word &ldquo;may&rdquo; in relation to these directives.  If we are putting in the section we should decide in a positive way either that he shall, or shall not do so.  I suggest that the Minister accept the amendment which is not much different from the amendment he proposed himself.</P>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">

      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to support what Deputy Molloy has been saying on this amendment which more or less telescopes subsections (1) and (2) together.  That is a sensible piece of drafting.  In doing so he incorporates both of my ideas, the idea that I had on section 8, namely, to substitute &ldquo;shall&rdquo; for &ldquo;may&rdquo;.  I strongly advocate that; I think it is very important that the Minister shall give general directives to the board.  The Minister will be our instrument in this regard.  He will be representing the elected representatives, representing the House in regard to this board.  We can get at the Minister; we can criticise or advise him and it is very important that the Minister to whom we can have access in this House should have a mandatory obligation to give directives to the board as to what principles they should follow.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="161" /> We are rather at a loss to understand why the section as drafted leaves out &ldquo;planning&rdquo;.  In the principal Act and elsewhere, planning and development always go together and again in his revised telescoped draft of subsections (1) and (2) Deputy Molloy has used the words &ldquo;planning and development&rdquo;.  On those particular aspects of Deputy Molloy's amendments I support him very strongly, the substitution of &ldquo;shall&rdquo; for &ldquo;may&rdquo; and the addition of &ldquo;planning&rdquo; to the word &ldquo;development&rdquo;.  I want to say something about subsection (3) later but for the moment I confine myself to saying that I think Deputy Molloy's idea of putting subsections (1) and (2) together into the one subsection and making these alterations is a distinct improvement on the Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>It appears that amendment No. 9 is acceptable.  It does not involve any change in substance and it would possibly be more consistent with the Long Title.  It may be as well to get that out of the way first.  Perhaps Deputy Molloy and Deputy Haughey would like to go outside for a few minutes and settle their argument. Deputy Molloy wants the Minister to give the planning authorities directives and Deputy Haughey wants the board to be given directives.  There is a very big difference.  If the planning authorities have to be given directives it means that not only will the chairman of the board have a full-time job but the Minister will have a full-time job too.</P>

    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>There appears to be a difference of opinion on the Opposition benches on this.  Deputy Molloy wants directives on everything to be given to the planning authorities. This would be a bad idea.  In fact, he argued against it himself on Second Stage when he said that the power of the Minister to give general directives was a watering down of the board's independence.  He now wants directives to be given to the planning authorities.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>Section 5 refers to the giving of directives to the board.  I would be satisfied with the Minister's amendment No. 11 under which he agrees to send a copy of the directives to the planning authorities.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>There is a very important point of principle involved here.  The Minister is the person responsible to this House in this area and this board will be established under his jurisdiction.  My colleague Deputy Burke, who is from the same area as I am, has pointed out that this board will not be subjected to scrutiny by this House.  I doubt if we will be able to put down parliamentary questions about their decisions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>I would imagine not.  I would like to give them as much autonomy as possible.  It would be a pity if we were able to drag them around the floor of the House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>We are faced with that dilemma.  We want to make this an autonomous board who will carry out their functions in an impartial and objective manner.  At the same time, we must realise that planning <Col N="163" /> is something which has strong social implications and is very important from the point of view of the community and so on.  We will not, as Deputies, have access to this board, be able to criticise them or ask parliamentary questions about their activities or decisions.  We will still have the Minister for Local Government here and we will be able to query him about planning in general. It is important in that context that the Minister should have an obligation placed on him to give general directives about planning and development to the board.  We could then question the Minister about the terms of those directives.  The section as it is framed specifically indicates that they must be general directives.  Subsection (3) spells out quite clearly that nothing in this section shall be construed as enabling the Minister to exercise any power or control in relation to any particular case.  All we are concerned with here are directives of a general nature, outlining the overall policy along which planning and development should take place.  It is quite legitimate for us to make it obligatory on the Minister in the performance of his duty to us in this House that he from time to time &ldquo;shall&rdquo; issue those directives.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>The onus is on the board to inform themselves of Government policy.  I would prefer to leave it that in the event of it appearing that they were not doing what was expected with regard to Government policy the Minister could then bring it to their notice.  It would be a pity if we made it too tight and that every general directive had to be spelled out to them.  It would mean almost day-to-day discussion between the Minister for Local Government and the planning board.  Perhaps the board I envisaged and the board which is envisaged by Deputy Haughey and Deputy Molloy are different things but the board I envisage is one which will, as far as possible, be autonomous and will not in any way feel they are subject to any type of political control which, in effect, is what directives from a Minister <Col N="164" /> for Local Government would be, even though specific cases are not being dealt with.  I am as anxious as Deputy Haughey that no loopholes be left but he will agree that it would be a pity if we were to spoil this by keeping too tight a rein.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>I cannot accept that there is any question of keeping too tight a rein particularly having regard to the fact that they are general directives and that they shall not be construed as giving the Minister control in relation to any particular case.  It seems to me that so far as parliamentary democratic control is concerned what I am at here is important because I would visualise Deputies, if some aspect of conservation or environment matters became important, asking the Minister in pursuance of his duty under this section whether he had issued directives. I would visualise general directives covering such things as nuclear stations.  This will become a very important issue in the future.  Are we to have nuclear stations or not?  That is the sort of area in which it should be obligatory on the Minister for Local Government to lay down national policy of a general nature. This board, after all are only there to decide individual planning appeals and to decide on individual matters.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Broad lines of policy would still be a matter for the Minister, and it would be the function of this new board to decide these individual appeals on their merits and having regard to overall national planning policy.  There will be major issues cropping up in this area.  There will be things like the control of mining, oil refineries, nuclear power stations, offshore oil drilling.  All these things will become matters of national importance. They will have importance outside the competence of any individual planning authority, matters on which the Minister, the Government and this House will have to take national policy decisions.  It is in that area I am thinking of these directives being issued.  I would like to see it obligatory on the Minister to issue directives from time to time to the board to give them guidance under the <Col N="165" /> umbrella of which they can take their individual decisions.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>The matters to which Deputy Haughey is referring are ones on which of necessity the Government would have to have a policy, and the onus would be on the planning board to make themselves aware of that policy.  He might say there is the danger that the planning board would plead they did not know what the policy was; if they did that they would not be carrying out the terms of this Bill.</P>
      <P>Both of us are arguing for the same thing.  The only difference is that I do not want to set up a planning board and afterwards find that somebody can say there is still a political control of that board, even in a general way. Deputy Haughey shakes his head, but even the decision whether or not a nuclear power station should be allowed&mdash;&mdash;</P>

If the word &ldquo;shall&rdquo; was included in the directives, would the Minister consider that it would be proper and reasonable that such communications from the Department of Local Government and from the various other Departments should be made in directives to the board, because these directives will be available to the Deputies and to the public, and in that way the public will also <Col N="168" /> be enlightened as to what the Government's policy is?</P>

The Minister's decision to have copies of the directives laid before each House, published in <i>Iris Oifigiúil</i> and sent to each planning authority more or less meets the point raised by Deputy Molloy in amendment No.  7.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cunningham</NameTxt>
      <P>A problem may arise here.  Take a case where a directive is given to the board and a copy is sent to each planning authority; does that mean that each planning authority will there and then have to alter their development plan which has been passed and agreed? The planning authority's development plan may be in contravention of the directive.  Must the local authority there and then set about amending their plan to comply with the terms of the directive?  Is this obligatory?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think so.  The Deputy is thinking of individual cases. Earlier on Deputy Haughey listed what he considered to be matters which should be sent by way of directive. If Deputy Cunningham is thinking of individual matters which would be affected by a directive he can set his mind at ease because that is not <Col N="171" /> likely to happen.  If, however, a general directive is sent setting out Government policy, that of course will refer to the planning authority as well.  This does not mean they must immediately alter their own plan; it simply means they will have to take cognisance of the directive when they are making future decisions.  That is only reasonable because it would otherwise mean that at national level one policy would be followed while at local level an entirely different policy could be followed.  This would naturally cause extra work.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Mr. Molloy Mr. Molloy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister can issue a directive to the board and a copy of that will be sent to the local authority. The contents can be interpreted locally and a situation might arise in which the local authority might find themselves contravening their own development plan.  What will happen in such a situation?  If Government policy is found to be in contravention of the local development plan are the local authority obliged to follow the directive?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>If they get a directive in contradiction of what is in their own development plan they are naturally expected to carry out the directive, but they can apply to the Minister for permission to contravene their plan until such time as their development plan is amended.  There is no need to rush out and start changing their plan because one portion of it is being contravened.  As Deputy Molloy knows, local authorities very often apply for permission to the Minister to contravene their own plans.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Mr. Molloy Mr. Molloy">

      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="LiamCunningham" hpid="Mr. Cunningham Mr. Cunningham">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cunningham</NameTxt>
      <P>That is all right so far as it goes, but there is no provision <Col N="172" /> in this Bill which compels a local authority to carry out the terms of any directive given to the board. The Minister is not providing for that in the Bill and there could be a situation in which a local authority might decide that, in the interests of their own county or town, it is not desirable their development should be altered to comply with the terms of a directive and they do not intend to apply to the Minister for permission to contravene their own plan&mdash;&mdash;</P>

No local authority would be so stupid as to say they would not carry out a directive issued to them by the Minister because this gives the authority to the Minister to tell them to do it and they will thereupon have to alter their plan.  The other way is that any body who was aggrieved would be entitled to apply to the planning board and since the directive was issued to the planning board they would deal with the matter by way of appeal. Quite frankly I do not think any local authority would do something like that.</P>

      <P>In subsection (2), page 4, line 30, after &ldquo;annually&rdquo; to insert &ldquo;not later than three months following the period to which they relate&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>What I am seeking here is fairly evident and I trust it will recommend itself to the Minister.  Section 7 deals with the accounts of this new board and the audit of those accounts and provides that the accounts &ldquo;shall, together with the report of the Comptroller and Auditor General thereon, be presented to the Minister who shall cause copies to be laid before each House of the Oireachtas.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>The proposals outlined in section are pretty standard.  In subsection (2) after the word &ldquo;annually&rdquo; I should like to insert the words &ldquo;not later than three months following the period to which they relate&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>If the Minister wants to say to me that this is an innovation and that there is no precedent for it, and if he wishes to point out to me the many Acts of Parliament which have similar types of provision, without this restriction, I will say to him: &ldquo;Quite so.&rdquo;  It is time we made a start in this area.  We have here a new board and I should like to see this new principle, if it is a new principle, applied to this new board.  Perhaps in due course we will be able to get the principle adopted generally.  We would all like to see, within a reasonable time after the ending of the financial year, the accounts of the board presented to us and the report of the Comptroller and Auditor General similarly presented.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is not entirely satisfactory that we should have a statutory obligation on these boards to have their accounts audited and presented to us if there is no time limit involved in that presentation. I am afraid that, in some cases, the audited accounts and the report on them are presented to us so late in the day that they have become <Col N="174" /> quite meaningless.  That is the type of situation which I should like to see rectified.</P>
    <P>I should like to see it made mandatory in this case as a start that, within three months&mdash;and I do not think that is too long a period&mdash;after the end of the financial year concerned we would have the accounts in the Library, available to use for inspection and scrutiny at a time when they would mean something to us.  It is a very futile and idle exercise to be looking at the accounts of some of these State bodies and organisations and institutions years after the relevant accounting period.</P>
    <P>I strongly urge the Minister to set a shining example in this case.  I would certainly be prepared to listen to him if he says to me: &ldquo;I accept in principle that the accounts must be presented within some reasonable period but three months is too short.&rdquo; If he would like to suggest a longer period I would certainly be disposed to listen to that.  It is important that there should be some prescribed period after the end of the financial year within which the audited accounts and the report thereon must be presented to us.</P>
    <P>We hear quite a lot of discussion on the question of making State bodies and State institutions subject to scrutiny in some way by the Oireachtas. The question has been on the mat for many years and from time to time we return to it and devote our attention to it, but we do not seem to be able to make any progress in regard to it.  Generally speaking, that discussion is concerned with trading bodies and commercial organisations of a semi-State nature.  In this area we could make a beginning in having a tighter scrutiny by the Oireachtas over these bodies by making sure that we get these accounts and the report of the Comptroller and Auditor General within a reasonable space of time.</P>
    <P>While that is important in regard to the accounts which are covered by amendment No. 13, it is a great deal more important in the case of the annual report on the activities and the proceedings of the board which are dealt with in section 8 and to <Col N="175" /> which my amendment No. 14 refers. The same principle is involved in the two different matters.  It is quite important that we should have the accounts within a reasonable period of time, but it is much more important that we should have the report envisaged in section 8 within the same reasonable period of time, that is, within a period of three months after the period to which it relates.</P>
    <P>Section 8 provides: &ldquo;The Board shall in each year make a report to the Minister of its proceedings during the preceding year and the Minister shall cause copies of the report to be laid before each House of the Oireachtas.&rdquo;  Subsection (2) provides: &ldquo;The Board shall supply the Minister with such information relating to its functions as he shall from time to time request.&rdquo; I adverted to this matter of the board and their activities being subject to scrutiny by Deputies in another context and I want to mention it again here.  It is important.</P>
    <P>Section 8 could perhaps be regarded as a very routine and general type of provision but I suggest it is an important one.  It is vitally important in regard to this report that the House gets it while it is still relevant.</P>
    <P>As section 8 stands there is no prescribed time within which the board must make this report.  That is a mistake.  Planning is a very important, critical matter and of fundamental importance.  It is important that the report of this board should be available to Members as quickly as possible. I would regard a period of three months after the end of the year as adequate time in which to prepare a report for the Oireachtas.</P>
    <P>I recommend both these amendments to the Minister.  They are simple in their implication.  We want to put a limit on the board.  Within a prescribed time they must make their financial report to us, and, in addition, but more important, we must prescribe the time within which they must make the report of their proceedings, activities, decisions and so on.</P>

      <P>If anyone but Deputy Haughey had made this proposal I would have thought he had not understood <Col N="176" /> it.  The Deputy is the one person here who should understand what the score is.  He must know that if the Comptroller and Auditor General must produce his report within three months of the end of the financial year&mdash;by the end of March&mdash;it must be assumed that every other report should also be due then.  There are other reports which are more important than this.</P>
      <P>Could Deputy Haughey envisage the Comptroller and Auditor General either working night and day for three months for the purpose of producing this and other reports or does he imagine it can be done?  He is the one person who should know that what he asks is impossible.  I am very anxious to have the question of accountancy regularised.  Nobody is more anxious than I to ensure that every penny voted here is spent as it should be.  Recently I was horrified to find that a body who are under my control to a certain extent had not completed an audited report for four years.  They are now up to date.  I am sure the Deputy is aware that there are a number of State bodies which did not produce their accounts when they should have.</P>
      <P>The Comptroller and Auditor General could not possibly do what Deputy Haughey is suggesting.  The amount of money involved in the running of this board will not be very large.  It will not be the most important amount of money to be accounted for.  There will be many other more important accounts which we will all be anxious to see accounted for.  To suggest that this should be given precedence and the report produced within the first three months of the new year is very unreasonable.  Deputy Haughey said he believes the report should be in as soon as may be.  This is what I would like to see&mdash;an early return of the report&mdash;but I do not believe we should put in an impossible condition.  Therefore, I would not be prepared to accept these two amendments. The suggestion that it can be done is not reasonable and I am sure the Deputy on reflection will agree.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>I am the last man in this House to be unreasonable.  I am <Col N="177" /> prepared to agree that perhaps three months might be pushing it a bit far. The fact is that this is a new board and there will not be any great complicated finances involved in its operations. This will involve a straightforward auditing and reporting so far as the accounts are concerned.  It was that fact which encouraged me to suggest that we make a start with this board.</P>
      <P>I was not aware of the situation he outlined.  I did not realise that he was anxious that bodies of this sort should have their accounts audited regularly and keep them up to date.  That makes me all the more keen in proposing my amendment.  If he has embarked on this reforming crusade in so far as bodies under his control are concerned, why not start with this new body by putting them on the right lines straightaway?  They should not be let slip into bad habits which prevail throughout the Public Service.</P>
      <P>As I said, these accounts will be comparatively straightforward affairs. There will not be any great volume of finance involved.  This will be an ideal opportunity to start off with a clean sheet and set a headline.  However, I will not push this too hard.  If the Minister considers three months is too short, or even six months, he should make it mandatory on the board and the Comptroller and Auditor General to produce the accounts and report at least within the following year.</P>
      <P>Different considerations should apply to the report of the board's proceedings. We do not need to have the Comptroller and Auditor General working through the night because he does not come into this at all.  This will come within the jurisdiction and the competence of the board themselves. This will be a report by the board to the Minister of their work. Here we are entitled to insist that we get this report within three months. Very important matters will be involved here.  Crucial decisions will be reached about which the public will want to know.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I will be reasonable about amendment No. 13 but I would press very strongly for something where amendment <Col N="178" /> No. 14 is concerned.  I should like to hear the Minister's view on this.  What time would he consider reasonable within which the board must make their report to him and, through him, to this House?</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>I am anxious that audited accounts should be produced as soon as possible.  If money is not accounted for relatively early, it is very difficult to account for it later and find out where it is.  Therefore, when the accounts are fresh in people's minds is the time accounting should be made.  It would be very unreasonable to expect that this could be done within three months.</P>
      <P>There are two other accounts which must be audited, the IDA and An Chomhairle Oiliúna.  In both cases the phrase used is &ldquo;at such time as the Minister, with the consent of the Minister for Finance shall direct&rdquo;. That means that the Minister may ask for the accounts in a relatively short time.  I propose to follow that line. With regard to the other matter, while Deputy Haughey has a point the worst thing we could have is a skimping&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>With regard to the other amendment, the board should be encouraged not to confine themselves to statistics of appeals received, decided and other routine matters.  When they have some experience they should be able to produce a report of general interest, something which will give information to the House and the public, and which can be printed and published.  While it may appear to be straightforward, difficulties may arise.  Deputy de Valera would know of the difficulties involved in having material printed.</P>

      <P>In subsection (2), page 4, line 40, before &ldquo;its functions&rdquo; to insert &ldquo;the performance of&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>This is a drafting amendment.  It seemed that there was an inaccuracy in the section as it is worded.  Subsection (2) of that section states:</P>
      <P>The Board shall supply the Minister with such information relating to its functions as he shall from time to time request.</P>
      <P>In my view that is bad wording because we all know the functions of the board.  Those functions will not change from year to year but what will change and what the Minister wants information about is the performance of the functions of the board.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>Again this is a question of crossed lines because the subsection requires the board to supply the Minister with such information relating to their functions as he shall from time to time request.  The amendment seems to imply that it is too wide and that there is something sinister in the provision.  The provision is related to the general responsibility of the Minister who must have proper information in relation to estimates, expenditure and staff.  The Minister also has specific functions under the Bill such as approval of appointments, approval of superannuation schemes, receipt of annual report, appointment and removal of board members.  He will also be concerned with the efficiency and effectiveness of the board and how it is <Col N="182" /> administered.  For this reason he will need regular returns from the board. The IDA are required under the Industrial Development Act, 1969, to supply the Minister for Industry and Commerce with such information regarding their activities as he may from time to time require.  Local authorities are required to furnish the Minister with any information in relation to their functions which he may consider desirable or necessary for the purpose of his powers and duties in relation to local authorities.</P>
      <P>The intention of the amendment is, apparently, to narrow the provision. I have no intention of probing into what the board are doing.  I have simply repeated what is done in relation to the other authorities I have referred to.</P>

      <P>Unfortunately it has been the practice that where public bodies are required by legislation to produce annual reports these have not always appeared in the 12-month period following the completion of the year for which the report was to be written.  It has often been the practice that these reports have not appeared for two, three or four years.  Deputy Haughey's amendment, which has been dealt with, attempted to place an obligation on the board to produce their reports within three months. That was not accepted by the Minister. I am asking the Minister to insert some provision other than &ldquo;as soon as may be&rdquo;.  That could be any time. There is no specified period of time indicated by these words.  They are often used by Ministers when they are not too sure when a thing may happen.  We are well used to them being used here at Question Time when Ministers do not know the answers.</P>
      <P>I would appeal to the Minister to ensure that this board, which will perform functions that will affect not only the lives of many people but the quality of life itself we are to enjoy, should publish a report as quickly as possible after the 12-month period for which the report is due.  We should in the Bill place an obligation on the board to produce that report within six months, if three months is considered to be too short.  I do not think three months is too short, but these deadlines will be met if they are put there.  We know from experience that if they are not put there the thing will be allowed to drag on and there will be no urgency.</P>

Deputy Molloy will remember asking some time ago why I was not producing housing statistics, why it took almost three months to produce them.  It was something I did not like to do, but I had to point out that when Deputy Molloy was there it was usual not to have these figures for much longer than three months, and they were only stencilled.

    <P>It is important at the outset to be clear on what we are talking about in this amendment.  There might be some <Col N="185" /> confusion in the public mind about its different applications.  The Minister has put forward proposals which have received quite a lot of attention in the press governing disclosures of interest by members of local authorities and we will be dealing with that aspect later on.  Here we are concerned with the situation of persons who will be members of the new board.  I want to make it clear that for the moment I am only discussing the activities and the disclosures of certain matters by persons who will be appointed to the new board.  I will read section 9:</P>
    <P>A person shall not vote or otherwise act as a member of the Board in relation to any matter with respect to which the person has a material financial or other beneficial interest.</P>
    <P>My amendment would add after &ldquo;interest,&rdquo;&ldquo;and when so interested shall inform the chairman of the Board in writing accordingly.&rdquo;  I hope this amendment will commend itself to the Minister and indeed to the general public.  What we are all after in the Bill is to try to bring the maximum amount of objectivity and impartiality to the deciding of planning matters, and in this respect it is important that there be the maximum amount not just of disclosure but a record of disclosure.  As it stands, the section could become quite ineffective as time goes on.  It simply provides that a member shall not act or vote as a member of the board in relation to any matter in regard to which he has a financial or beneficial interest.</P>
    <P>That is a bald prohibition on a member of the board who has such an interest voting or acting in certain circumstances.  I want to pursue that a little further.  I want to have a record available to the Minister or any other interested person of what the exact position is in regard to such a matter.  This would be very important from the point of view of the individual board member concerned and from the point of view of the status and integrity of the board.  There would be no question of it being said later: &ldquo;When the board were deciding that very important matter of <Col N="186" /> whether a nuclear power station should be situated in Laytown, County Meath&mdash;&mdash;</P>

This would be a valuable and useful protection and it would add to the status of the board and the quality of their decisions.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree this might be of help to the board but perhaps it would be better to insert &ldquo;shall inform the presiding chairman&rdquo;, because if the chairman were not present for one reason or another and somebody else was acting it might cause difficulty and the provision might be defeated. If that is acceptable to Deputy Haughey, then we can have it included.</P>

    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 17:</P>
      <P>To add to the section a new subsection as follows:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;() For the purposes of this section &lsquo;beneficial interest&rsquo; includes membership of voluntary bodies or institutions.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>This amendment, again, has been put down for broadly the same purpose, that is, of helping to enhance the status and standing of the board.  It seems to me that, as the section is worded, it is a little ineffective.  It says:</P>
      <P>A person shall not vote or otherwise act as a member of the Board in relation to any matter with respect to which the person has a material financial or other beneficial interest.</P>
      <P>I want to define &ldquo;beneficial interest&rdquo; not exclusively but make sure that it includes membership of voluntary bodies or institutions.  I want to look forward, perhaps, to a situation in which a member of the board, though he personally would not have any material financial interest, or anything that could be regarded personally to him as a beneficial interest, nevertheless, might be influenced unduly by the fact that he was a member of a voluntary body or an institution concerned.</P>
      <P>I would recommend this amendment to the Minister for those reasons and along that line of thinking.  Perhaps the Minister would let me know if the amendment commends itself to him.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>I am afraid that is a different kettle of fish although I have sympathy with the idea.  If the intention is to prevent a board member from acting in a case where, as a <Col N="188" /> member of some body, it might appear he would have a strong interest in the outcome of the case, the difficulty there is to know where to draw the line.  You see, should a judge not be able to act because he was a member of the legal profession?</P>

    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>It is quite possible that a member of this board, or of any board, could be more coloured and prejudiced in regard to a particular matter because of his membership of some body than he would be because of his personal interest.  The Minister knows that this is not an unusual circumstance.  People who are acting as members of a particular organisation to which they have given life long service may be quite blind and prejudiced in coming to a decision where the interests of that body are concerned, whereas they would be quite objective and honourable where their personal interest was concerned.  Therefore, I think my amendment has a lot of merit and principle in it.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>I am afraid Deputy Haughey is not following his own amendment.  He sees it only as referring to disclosure but, according to the section, it means that he cannot act or vote.  Therefore, one could reach a situation where in a case being considered, four, five, six or whatever number of members were on the board all of whom would have, for one reason or another, a connection if we make it too wide, would make a disclosure and would not be able to act or vote, which would make the whole thing ridiculous.  This is what I am trying to avoid.  If Deputy Haughey would think over it for a moment.  I think he would agree that such a situation can easily enough <Col N="190" /> occur.  I am prepared to agree where it appears reasonable, but this is one case where it does appear we are going just that little but too far.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>May I give the Minister an example of what I mean? I do not want people to be able to come along and say&mdash;that institution, that society, that golf club, that football club was allowed its appeal because Mr. X was a member of the board.  That is the sort of situation with which we are all familiar and which could arise from time to time, much more frequently, I would suggest, than the case where Mr. So-and-So's appeal got past the board because he was a member of the board.  I think that is very unlikely to arise.  That sort of situation deals with itself automatically.  It is equally important to deal with the case of a man who has a particular interest in a thing because of his membership of a club, organisation or institution.  I want no breath of suspicion to be wafted in the direction of this new board because of that sort of situation. I am sure the Minister could think of hundreds of cases where this sort of situation could arise.</P>

      <P>I am prepared to agree that it is very important to have the board above suspicion.

    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>But the Deputy is preventing them from voting.  I have just given examples of three different professions which if represented on the board&mdash;if any member of their profession is affected; they belong to the same institution&mdash;would mean that none of them would be entitled to vote?  Is that not so?</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Labour (Mr. M. O'Leary)</NameTxt>
      <P>The information available on these matters, which differs somewhat in detail from that asked for by the Deputy, is as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>In the year ended 31st August, 1974, the Redundancy Appeals Tribunal dealt with 1,190 appeals of which 266 related to the Minimum Notice Act. 328 of these appeals, including 67 under the Minimum Notice Act, were withdrawn either before or during hearings of the tribunal.</P>
      <P>During the period in question, my Department paid lump sums from the Redundancy Fund totalling £163,000 to 615 employees under the Redundancy Payments Acts, 1967-73.  104 firms or individual employers were involved. The tribunal was concerned in these payments to the following extent:&mdash;</P>
      <P>(i) Number of employees in respect of whom decisions had been given by the Redundancy Appeals Tribunal, 83; (ii) Number of firms involved in (i), 48; (iii) amount of lump sum, £16,953.53.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is not possible to say how many payments were directly attributable to liquidation.  There are other reasons <Col N="49" /> why payments have to be made from the fund&mdash;receivership, bankruptcy, death of an employer, employer's refusal or inability to pay.  The reason for payment from the fund may not be finally established until long after the payment has been made.  The Deputy will appreciate that, in order to avoid hardship on the employee, my Department makes the redundancy lump-sum payment from the Redundancy Fund as quickly as possible, consistent with my statutory responsibility as custodian of the fund.</P>
    <P>During the same period 16 complaints were received that compensation awarded by the tribunal following appeals by workers under the Minimum Notice and Terms of Employment Act, 1973, had not been paid. The total amount involved was <Col N="50" /> approximately £1,470.  The amounts due from individual employers were subsequently recovered in seven cases and in another six the Chief State Solicitor was instructed to take legal action.  The remaining three cases were under consideration on 31st August, 1974.</P>
