    <Speaker pid="GerardCollins" hpid="Mr. G. Collins Mr. G. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries the progress he has made with regard to the banning of imports of beef into the EEC from outside the Community.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Col N="1471" />
    <Speaker pid="MichaelPatMurphy" hpid="Mr. M.P. Murphy Mr. M.P. Murphy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M.P. Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>While agreement was not reached by the EEC Council of Ministers to ban imports of beef into the Community, considerable progress has been made on measures to discourage such imports. These include an increase in the levy on frozen beef imports, an arrangement under which imports of frozen beef must be matched by purchases of an equal quantity of beef from Community intervention agencies' stocks and also a reduction in the period of validity of Community licences for the import of third country beef.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardCollins" hpid="Mr. G. Collins Mr. G. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Parliamentary Secretary say whether or not the progress which he says has been made is sufficient to protect our beef trade?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelPatMurphy" hpid="Mr. M.P. Murphy Mr. M.P. Murphy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M.P. Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister is taking special cognisance of this question.  He has, through the EEC, got approval of measures to help and I think so far as the position is concerned at present he is doing quite a good job in this field.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardCollins" hpid="Mr. G. Collins Mr. G. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to repeat my question to the Parliamentary Secretary.  Is he telling this House that the progress he claims has been made by his Minister is sufficient to protect the beef trade of this country?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelPatMurphy" hpid="Mr. M.P. Murphy Mr. M.P. Murphy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M.P. Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>I can say that the Minister has made all the progress that could be made.  He has to contend with the other Ministers in the European Community Council. All the progress that could be made has been made so far as our Minister is concerned.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackieFahey" hpid="Mr. Fahey Mr. Fahey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fahey</NameTxt>
      <P>What further steps will be taken to protect this very important industry which is in danger of collapsing at the present time?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelPatMurphy" hpid="Mr. M.P. Murphy Mr. M.P. Murphy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M.P. Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>All the steps that can be taken are being taken by the Minister.  The proposals are a reduction from the 90 days normally available for imports into the Community to 45 days for frozen meat, 35 days for products other than frozen beef coming from nonEuropean third countries and ten <Col N="1472" /> days for products other than frozen beef coming from European third countries.  I am sure the Deputy understands all this and what it means.  Then, there is a review of the levy as well so that I think the position has been in very safe hands.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardCollins" hpid="Mr. G. Collins Mr. G. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Parliamentary Secretary aware that despite the alleged progress being made by his Minister the beef industry is in an extremely precarious position?  This being so, can the Parliamentary Secretary tell the House what further action the Minister and the Government propose to take to ensure the safety of this very valuable industry?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelPatMurphy" hpid="Mr. M.P. Murphy Mr. M.P. Murphy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M.P. Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister is well aware of the importance of the beef industry.  He is doing everything possible.  So far as the sale of beef is concerned everybody knows that the supply exceeds the demand and when such a position obtains big quantities of beef have to be brought into intervention.  I do not see what else can be done, given the present situation.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnCallanan" hpid="Mr. Callanan Mr. Callanan">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelPatMurphy" hpid="Mr. M.P. Murphy Mr. M.P. Murphy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M.P. Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>In common with some of the other Community Ministers, I have asked at meetings of the Council of Ministers for stringent action against imports of pigmeat into the Community from third countries including a temporary suspension of imports.  As a result of these representations, the EEC Commission have imposed supplementary levies as from 1st May on imports of pigmeat from third countries.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelPatMurphy" hpid="Mr. M.P. Murphy Mr. M.P. Murphy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M.P. Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>The position is that there are nine countries in the EEC, as I have no doubt the Deputy is aware.  Naturally, we and the Minister are quite anxious to have this ban enforced but he is subject to a decision on the part of the other agricultural ministers of the Community. He has succeeded, after a great deal of difficulty, in getting an additional levy of £27 per ton on third country imports to Britain, which is our main market, so there will be a supplementary levy now of £27 per ton.  I think that should be quite helpful.</P>

      <P>With the permission of the Ceann Comhairle, I propose to take Questions Nos. 7 and 8 together.</P>
      <P>As I indicated in reply to a supplementary question by Deputy Collins on 1st May, I did not advise farmers to discontinue pig production.</P>
      <P>I do not accept that the pig industry is about to collapse.  The industry both here and in the other EEC countries has been passing through a difficult period due to high feed prices, a recession in demand and a fall in prices on export markets.  The cycle in pig production is well known in the industry and I am satisfied that as has happened before the position of the producer must improve when the present difficulties have been overcome.  The situation for producers has, of course, been mitigated by the EEC subsidy which I was able to negotiate at the meeting of the Council of Ministers on 25th March; this amounted to about £3.50 per pig in the month of April.  For the immediate future I would hope that there will be beneficial effects on our pigmeat industry arising from (a) the reduction as from 1st May in the monetary compensatory charge on our exports of pigmeat to countries other than the UK and the corresponding fall in the monetary compensatory payment on Continental bacon imported into Britain (b) the special supplementary levies now payable on imports of pigmeat into the Community from third countries and (c) the additions to the list of pigmeat products on which EEC export refunds are payable.</P>
      <P>Present indications are that feed prices will fall later this year and that export market prices for pigmeat should show an improvement.</P>

I should like him to state whether he expects this House and the public to accept the statement he has just made, that his Minister did not give advice to members of a delegation from the IAOS, who met the Minister recently, that they should get out of pigs because statements attributed to the people who were present at that meeting have not been contradicted by those who were said to have made them or by the Minister himself.</P>

He gave all the information at his disposal regarding the pig industry at present and the kind of period this is so far as pig producers are concerned, not only here but in Northern Ireland, in England and other countries.  This is the cycle we are in at present.  We appreciate that beef prices have increased possibly much higher than we could have anticipated some months ago and as a result the profitability of pigs has declined. That does not say that the future may not be bright again.  We have to work in accordance with Community regulations.

That is not the fault of the Minister or the Government or anybody here.  Whoever would be here the position would be the same, as it is in the case of Northern Ireland and Britain.  We are at present producing more bacon and pigmeat than the amount for which there is a reasonable market.

In that reply I spelled out to the house the steps taken by me to meet the grievance of the organisation which represents the Agricultural Advisory Service regarding the provision of promotional opportunity between the recruitment grade and that of Deputy CAO.  The organisation did not accept the terms of the offer I made to provide over 70 new posts of senior instructor on the condition that the service would co-operate fully in the implementation of the farm modernisation scheme.  I subsequently asked them again to <Col N="1487" /> accept what was offered and get on with the job of providing farmers with a service to which they were entitled under that scheme.</P>
      <P>The chairman of the General Council of Committees of Agriculture convened a meeting on 3rd May of representatives of his council, of my Department and of the Irish Agricultural Advisers' Organisation in an effort to secure agreement on the matters at issue.  I understand that certain proposals were put forward at this meeting which the IAAO representatives undertook to put to their members.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>Before proceeding with the order of Business, may I raise a matter which I had occasion to advert to a number of times recently in this House, namely, the making available to Deputies of official publications? I complained on one occasion in connection with the publication of the monthly report by the National Prices Commission.  When the last report was published, it was at least one week later before Deputies received copies in their post. Since then the Minister for Industry and Commerce has conveyed his regret to our Chief Whip and said he would try to ensure that this delay would not happen again.  I am grateful to the Minister for that.</P>
      <P>However, we have the most recent incident of the publication of the report of the television review committee, details of which were announced in this morning's newspapers. Up to now the report has not been delivered to any Deputy, and as far as I know, it has not been sent to any Senator, other than two copies submitted to the Chief Whip of the Fianna Fáil Party by courtesy of the Government Information Services.</P>
      <P>On the Last occasion when I complained, I pointed to the embarrassment that is occasioned to Deputies by this practice.  While I appreciated that in the case of lengthy Government publications it was understandable and desirable that they be given to the news media somewhat in advance so that they might be digested by them for fair comment, the point I made then was that while accepting that practice the documents should be in the hands of Deputies simultaneously with publication in the newspapers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The situation has arisen again where an important document has been published&mdash;so far as I know there was no deadline&mdash;and any <Col N="1501" /> excuse to the effect that sufficient copies were not available to the Minister or to the Government Information Services will not hold water on this occasion.  I am not so much protesting on behalf of the Opposition who received two copies for a total membership of about 90 Members of the Oireachatas but on behalf of the rights and privileges of Deputies and of Members of the Oireachtas generally.</P>

There is mention of chewing gum and similar products which might not be regarded as food because they are not actually eaten.</P>
      <P>In addition to its ordinary meaning, &ldquo;sell&rdquo; means the following: (a) offer or expose for sale by wholesale or retail, (b) have in possession for sale by wholesale or retail, and (c) supply under contractual arrangements.  The last meaning is to cover food served in schools, hospitals and other institutions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1502" /> Any sale could be deemed to be a contractual arrangement.  The word &ldquo;other&rdquo; is intended to show we have something different in mind with regard to the supply of food to schools, hospitals, hotels, and similar institutions.  I am asking the House to agree to include the word &ldquo;other&rdquo; before the word &ldquo;contractual&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>Amendment agreed to.</P>

      <P>The definition of &ldquo;food&rdquo; is fairly comprehensive but it is not clear if drink, in its widest meaning, is included.  By that I do not mean only intoxicating liquor but drink in any form of liquid for human consumption.  If it is not included I think it should be because it is as vital to the purposes of this Bill as food in the sense of solid or dry matter.</P>

      <P>According to our definition, &ldquo;food&rdquo; would cover drink.  I am sure the Deputy has in mind drink such as milk which is a food also.  Possibly stout could be deemed a food as well as a drink but I do not know about other beverages such as spirits.  In any case that is our intention and the regulations can be drawn up to include drink.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 1a:</P>
      <P>In page 2, after line 32, to insert:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(e)  advertising of food, including health foods,&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>On the debate on Second Reading, a number of speakers, including the Minister for Industry and Commerce, Deputies Collins, Brennan and myself, made reference to the necessity to control the advertising of food and, in particular, the types of food that have become known in recent times as health foods.  In this Bill &ldquo;food&rdquo; includes items that would ordinarily be referred to as drink.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1503" /> A number of examples were given of outrageous claims for the efficacy, or alleged efficacy, of certain products, particularly in the quasi-health field.  It was agreed by all concerned, including the Minister for Industry and Commerce, that these claims were usually without foundation and that they misled people who did not have sufficient scientific knowledge of the value or otherwise of the commodities in question.</P>
    <P>Because they misled people they tended to create an artifical demand for certain products which would not be there if people were aware of the true nature of the substances in question, and if they were aware of the fact that they did not have all the merits which the advertising agents claim for them.</P>
    <P>This sort of thing strikes one most in relation to television advertisements. Unfortunately, those of us in what is called the single channel area have only one television station which, for our sins, we can watch.  We are bombarded every 12 or 14 minutes with the most appalling advertisements screamed out at us and repeated <i>ad nauseam</i> perhaps five or six times a night, if you are unfortunate enough to watch television for a whole night. The same stupid advertisement is bawled out at you.</P>
    <P>I have in mind in particular a certain beverage which is alleged to get you over the after effects of 'flu.  It is alleged not only to get the child who has the 'flu over its effects, but also to get the distraught mother who has to look after the child over the effects of having to look after the child.  I am told by those who know something about these matters that the claims made for that product are totally without foundation and that, if you were to drink a glass of water into which a spoon of glucose or even castor sugar had been mixed, you would get just as much benefit as you would get if you were to drink this fairly expensive product which is pushed at the unfortunate public so constantly.  The profits, of course, arising out of the sale of products such as this must be enormous.  Otherwise <Col N="1504" /> they could not afford to carry on the advertising they do.  Unless they got very substantial results from that advertising in the past, clearly they would not continue to carry it on to the same extent as they do at the moment.</P>
    <P>In addition to that example, there is another rather incongruous one of two young ladies depicted in one of these advertisement films on television, one of whom is lying on the floor and partaking in the most strenuous exercises, panting, groaning, and obviously in great distress.  Her companion is lolling back on a sofa or bed munching some form of biscuit.  The biscuit muncher inquires during an interval in the activities of the young lady on the floor how much she has lost in the last week and she gasps out that she has lost 7½lbs.  The biscuit muncher replies rather cockily that that is half a pound more than she lost by lying on her bed munching biscuits for the week which, of course, no doubt conveys a message to the public at large that munching this type of biscuit is of the same benefit to you as carrying out strenuous exercises on the floor for a week.</P>
    <P>I do not know a great deal about the value of the ingredients of these biscuits but I think it is a most foolish advertisement.  One would think that the reaction of most people would be to pooh-pooh the whole thing and say that nobody would be taken in by that sort of nonsense.  The fact of the matter is that these are expensive advertisements. I think they cost up to a couple of hundred pounds a time to show, apart from the several thousand pounds it costs to make them.</P>
    <P>These expensive advertisements would not appear continuously on national television unless they were codding somebody.  Therefore, they must be codding somebody.  The people who spend all this money would not spend it unless they were getting returns on it and unless they were making profits by selling these biscuits, or whatever they are, to guillible young ladies who think they benefit by losing weight.  Apparently the more of them you eat the more weight you lose, <Col N="1505" /> which would strike me as contradictory but may not strike those at whom the advertisements are aimed as being contradictory.</P>
    <P>While there is a great need to control all the various aspects of food and the consumption of food as set out at length in section 2(1), one of the areas in which the need is most obvious and most crying is the control of the advertising of food and in particular, the control of the advertising of what are now called health foods in this country and, I think, in other countries. The description may not be an accurate one but health food is the generic name by which they are generally known.  Whether, in fact, they contribute to one's health is very much another question.</P>
    <P>I have given only two examples of a large number of instances in which dishonest claims are made for some product which is of no great value in itself.  Because an attitude is built up in the public mind by this continuous barrage of advertising, the sales of products which are of no special merit or value are enhanced, and the profits to the people who make them are considerably enhanced.  I have no objection to their making profits provided they are not doing so at the expense of the public in the way which appears to be the case here.  If the public ate or drank ordinary natural food, the benefit to their health would be likely to be greater than the benefit from these artificial synthetics which are thought up by people for the purpose of making profits for themselves.</P>
    <P>A number of those who spoke on the last occasion, including the Minister for Industry and Commerce, think it is vitally necessary to have some control over the advertising of food generally and, in particular, the types of food I have been talking about.  For that reason I would ask the Parliamentary Secretary to accept this addition to the already long list of aspects of food control and food standards proposed to be covered by subsection (1) The need for the control of advertising is at least as great as the need for the control of the other various things mentioned.</P>

      <P>Deputy O'Malley's comments were factual. This sort of advertising exists and everybody knows that.  As he pointed out, unless the advertisers were benefiting, they would not continue to pay for costly advertisements.  I see nothing wrong with the amendment, but I am asking the Deputy to withdraw it for this very good reason.  The question of advertising is being taken up by the Department of Industry and Commerce and there is a proposal to introduce a consumers Protection Bill very shortly, certainly this year, to deal with advertising amongst other things.  It would be more efficient and more effective to deal with advertising in that Bill rather than partly in this Bill and partly in the next one.  I can guarantee that the point made by Deputy O'Malley will-be covered in that Bill.</P>
      <P>I agree generally with the views he has expressed.  I hold the same point of view as the Deputy on this question of advertising.  We must protect some people from exaggeration on the part of advertisers.  All sides of the House agree that this Bill is necessary and essential to give responsible Ministers power to make regulations to safeguard our food standards.  In asking the Deputy to withdraw his amendment, I am giving him an assurance that it will be covered in the Consumers Protection Bill and it would be more effective to have comprehensive coverage of advertising in one Bill rather than incorporate his amendment in this Bill and have to repeal it in the proposed Consumers Protection Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardCollins" hpid="Mr. G. Collins Mr. G. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>It is nice to hear from the Parliamentary Secretary that he accepts in principle the amendment in Deputy O'Malley's name.  I fully understand and appreciate what he has said with regard to <Col N="1507" /> legislation being introduced into this House at some stage or other by the Minister for Industry and Commerce to protect the consumer from unscrupulous manufacturers.  I accept the Parliamentary Secretary's assurance that it might not be too long before this legislation is introduced by the Minister for Industry and Commerce. But I would put it to him that he could accept Deputy O'Malley's amendment, incorporate it in this Bill and then repeal it at the stage when the Minister for Industry and Commerce finally gets his legislation through the House.</P>
      <P>With all due respect, I think it fair to say that the record of the present Government with regard to living up to their promises of getting through as much legislation in the shortest time possible has not been an extremely satisfactory one.  I do not say that in the hope of scoring any political point whatsoever off the Parliamentary Secretary.  I am saying it because I believe that his colleague in the Labour Party, the Minister for Industry and Commerce, might not be in a position to bring in this legislation for a very long time to come.</P>
      <P>We all know that the food industry is a large and complex one.  We have to be very careful to ensure that the housewife and consumer are protected at all times.  I believe it should be an offence to mislead the consumer about the dietary character and vitamin content of any food or drink. Indeed, I also think it should be an offence to mislead, by illustration, even if the wording used on the label is accurate.  This is something we have observed in recent years and on which we should take immediate steps to protect those whom we represent.  For example, one can decorate a tin by an attractive picture of, say, a dainty dairymaid engaged in her occupation so as to suggest that the product contains milk when in actual fact it does not.  Possible misrepresentation of the contents of food or drink can be conveyed not alone by the wording but by illustration and we should guard against that specifically.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I accept what the Parliamentary <Col N="1508" /> Secretary has said about his colleague on legislation but I put it to him that he might accept this amendment, which is in no way contentious but which would be there as a safeguard for the next 12 months, 18 months, two years or whatever length of time it takes to have the measures proposed by the Minister for Industry and Commerce enacted by Oireachtas Éireann.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelPatMurphy" hpid="Mr. M.P. Murphy Mr. M.P. Murphy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M.P. Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>As I said, section 2 gives three Ministers wide powers in so far as the making of regulations is concerned.  Therefore, I do not see the reason for adding Deputy O'Malley's amendment in view of the fact that the Government feel strongly on this question of protecting the consumer, so much so that a special Bill will be introduced in the Dáil which will be entitled the Consumers Protection Bill.  Therefore, I would request Deputy O'Malley to withdraw his amendment and I can assure him that advertising will be dealt with in one part of that future Bill.  I am sure everybody in the House feels that special attention must be given to advertising and I have given an assurance that it will be in that Bill.  I shall not take issue with Deputy G. Collins on his little remark about promises and assurances because his party's history was not so good but ours is excellent in that respect.</P>
      <P>Seeing that this Bill is more or less acceptable to all sides of the House, I would ask Deputies to allow it go through without the amendment proposed. As I have said, I accept it in principle and it will be covered in the future Consumers Protection Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BenBriscoe" hpid="Mr. Briscoe Mr. Briscoe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Briscoe</NameTxt>
      <P>I merely want to ask the Parliamentary Secretary if it is accepted in principle but is not being included, how can he claim that it is being accepted?  The advertising of food, including health foods, has been subjected to very many exaggerated claims.  I am quite sure the Parliamentary Secretary will agree that the control which is supposed to be exercised by RTE over advertising keeping it within certain limits is not being exercised effectively.  I <Col N="1509" /> think this is one of the reasons why this amendment should be included. I fully agree with the points made by Deputy O'Malley.  Exaggerated claims are dishonest.  I do not think it right that the people who make the type of exaggerated claims about which we have been speaking&mdash;and there are many other examples we could give&mdash;should be allowed to deceive. In my view, it is the same type of deception as that of reducing the amount of a product contained in a packet from week to week, unless forced to show the amount on the packet, which manufacturers will be forced to do under this Bill.</P>
      <P>I know it has taken a long time to bring this measure before the House but I welcome this Bill.  One of the reasons for this delay has been our entry into the EEC and our conforming with what other countries are doing.  But, as Deputy G. Collins has said, we do have an opportunity to include the amendment put down by Deputy O'Malley and it would be a simple thing to have that repealed immediately the other Bill comes into operation.  We have no indication of when the other Bill will be forthcoming. The Parliamentary Secretary is in favour of the amendment.  Yet he does not feel that it should be included in this Bill.  I can see no drafting or implementation difficulty whatsoever if this amendment is accepted.  It is a very straightforward and simple one.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>While on my feet, I should say that I notice the country of origin is not required to be stated under the Bill. I wonder could the Parliamentary Secretary tell us if there is any particular reason why the country of origin cannot be shown on all packages, which is the law in most other countries.  Most packages imported here bear the name of the country of origin because they have to conform with the laws in other countries but I do not think that law applies here.  Perhaps the Parliamentary Secretary would investigate this matter and let me know if he has any information as to what is the position in that regard.  What is the difficulty <Col N="1510" /> of including this amendment on the control of advertising in the Bill?</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelPatMurphy" hpid="Mr. M.P. Murphy Mr. M.P. Murphy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M.P. Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>As I indicated &mdash;and the Deputy mentioned also the EEC&mdash;this Bill is to raise our standards to the levels obtaining in other countries with regard to our food.  I can see no justification&mdash;as the Deputy is asserting here&mdash;that one should include an amendment to a section of a Bill and then, in three or four months' time, delete that amendment.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BenBriscoe" hpid="Mr. Briscoe Mr. Briscoe">

      <NameTxt>Mr. M.P. Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>I have given the House an assurance that there will be a Consumers Protection Bill brought before the House this year.  It will deal rather comprehensively with advertising.  It is much better to allow this Bill to go through as it is.  The regulations that can be made are exceptionally wide.  Section 2 will give a sufficiency of powers to the Ministers concerned to allay the Deputy's fears. In my view the question of origin will be covered as well under this section. The inclusion of the country of origin on packages will be fully covered and we need not worry on that score.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BenBriscoe" hpid="Mr. Briscoe Mr. Briscoe">

      <NameTxt>Mr. M.P. Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sure the Deputy has read the section.  It is covered under this section.  It is mandatory to set down the name of the country of origin on the label or package.  This Bill is to enable the appropriate Ministers to make regulations and it will be lawful to make regulations under section 2 covering the point made by the Deputy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>I was glad to hear the Parliamentary Secretary say that he accepted the amendment in principle and that he agreed with the sentiments I expressed.  He said he did not want to accept the amendment, not because he disagreed with it, but because this, together with a lot of other things, would be covered in a subsequent Bill.  If I could be assured that such a Bill was about to be published and would be passed in the near future <Col N="1511" /> I would be happy to withdraw the amendment, but as Deputy Collins has said our experience has been that we have to wait an inordinate length of time for vitally important Bills.  I can give the Parliamentary Secretary one example.  At the beginning of January, 1973, there was circulated by the Minister for Health in the last Government a Misuse of Drugs Bill.  It was arranged that that Bill would get its Second Reading in the first week of February, 1973.  The general election intervened and, of course, the Bill fell with that Dáil.</P>
      <P>The Bill was introduced and got its First Reading immediately after the coming together of the new Dáil.  At that time we were promised it would be circulated to Deputies and be brought forward for Second Reading within a very short time, as we might indeed have reasonably expected, the Bill having already been drafted and published.  Notwithstanding the passage of 14 months since that Bill was given a First Reading we still have not seen it.  That is a vitally important matter, perhaps even more important than the Bill now before us.  Many people would say it is a great deal more important because human life is at risk and human health and happiness are affected every day that passes without any sign of that Bill appearing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is generally accepted that with the exception of the Finance Act of last year and of the gerrymander and other associated electoral Bills which we have seen in the House since, no other Bill that this House has dealt with up to very recently, in the term of office of this Government, has been one other than one prepared by the previous Government.  For that reason I must join with Deputy Collins in doubting whether or not we will see a comprehensive Consumer Protection Bill within a reasonable time.  The Parliamentary Secretary said he expects it will be introduced in the House before the end of this year.  Of course, the end of this year is 7½ months away.  He said it would be introduced in the House during that period.  It can be introduced at any <Col N="1512" /> time by simply bringing in the long and short titles, giving it a nominal First Reading.  It may well turn out, even if it is introduced during the next 7½ months, as the Parliamentary Secretary expects, to be like the Misuse of Drugs Bill, that we will still be waiting for it 14 months after its First Reading.</P>
    <P>While I do not want to doubt the good intentions of the Parliamentary Secretary and the Government in relation to this I know that consumer protection is an enormous field.  It is a very complicated one and one in which there are many difficulties in regard to legislating for it because it is very easy to fall into a large number of potential traps.  The drafting of any Consumer Protection Bill must of necessity be a long and tedious matter.  It will need redrafting, I would imagine, on several occasions and without any fault on the part of any particular individual or group it might well be a very long time before this House is in a position to debate and pass such a Bill.</P>
    <P>I accept, of course, that such a Bill will cover the matters I have been talking about and that I referred to in my amendment.  I suggest to the Parliamentary Secretary and to the House that of all the aspects of consumer protection which are most urgently in need of legislation the matter of advertising food and quasi-medicinal products is where the need is greatest.  For that reason, because we cannot with any certainty expect to have a Consumer Protection Bill enacted within 18 months or two years, I see no reason at all why the very necessary protection for the public that would be given by this amendment, which I am glad to say the Parliamentary Secretary agrees with, could not be given now and if necessary the provision here repealed by the comprehensive Bill afterwards. It would at least give 18 months' or two years' protection to people in this very vital field which they would otherwise not have.</P>
    <P>I do not think, since protecting people consists of such a simple thing as accepting this very short and concise amendment, that it is valid to ask <Col N="1513" /> that it be withdrawn simply because a comprehensive Bill is promised for some time in the future.  For those reasons I would ask the Parliamentary Secretary to accept the amendment now and by all means repeal it if desired in the comprehensive Consumer Protection Bill afterwards.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJLalor" hpid="Mr. Lalor Mr. Lalor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lalor</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to support Deputy O'Malley on this amendment. I was intrigued to hear the Parliamentary Secretary agreeing with Deputy O'Malley on this issue. Deputy O'Malley gave varying examples of the manner in which producers of those alleged health foods or drinks are misusing the public through advertising.  There is a great need for remedial action in this matter. There is a simple amendment here which in no way alters the actual content of the Bill in so far as the Government want to go.  This section covers the powers of three Ministers. This is a joint power which can be exercised by the Minister for Industry and Commerce, the Minister for Health and the Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries.  There is no doubt that the Minister for Health is interested in this matter.  This Bill is sponsored by the Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries, whose Parliamentary Secretary is here discussing it on Committee Stage.  The Minister for Industry and Commerce contributed to it on the Second Stage.  Here we have an amendment which is known to the Government.  They are aware that it has been tabled, aware that it specifically refers to health and I had hoped that the Minister would come in on this debate to give us the benefit of his views in regard to it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Parliamentary Secretary said a while ago that the record of this Government in regard to putting legislation through was good and he criticised Deputy O'Malley and the former Administration for not having looked after these matters before now.  The Parliamentary Secretary conveyed a further promise from the Minister for Industry and Commerce about a Consumers Protection Bill but I am tired listening to that kind of promise.  While I was Minister for Industry and Commerce quite an <Col N="1514" /> amount of progress had been made in compiling the various sections of this Bill but on many occasions in the past 15 months I have heard the Minister for Industry and Commerce promising that various pieces of legislation would be introduced.  If we went through the records, I believe we would find that the Minister for Industry and Commerce promised the Consumer Protection Bill before the end of 1973.  He certainly promised a Monopolies and Mergers Bill; he promised action on motor insurance. But the situation now is, as I see it, that we cannot have a Consumers Protection Bill no matter what advice the Parliamentary Secretary has received from Industry and Commerce or from his own Department until a report is made by an advisory committee which the Minister set up. The experience, as regards activity in the Department of Industry and Commerce in the past 15 months has been shattering and the Minister has covered up his inefficiency and inactivity by creating a succession of consultative or advisory bodies.</P>
    <P>This consumer protection legislation should cover a very wide field but I can see no justification for the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries saying on the one hand that he fully agrees with the sentiments Deputy O'Malley expressed in support of this amendment and, on the other hand, saying: &ldquo;Wait for it.  The Minister for Industry and Commerce is looking after that and will cover it in his legislation.&rdquo;  The opportunity is presented in this Food Standards Bill, 1974 for the inclusion of a provision as suggested in the amendment, to give the Minister power in this regard.  I heard the Parliamentary Secretary replying to Deputy Briscoe and he seemed to be able to generate power in the section because Deputy Briscoe asked him where the power was set out covering the question he raised and he was given the sort of answer that the power was there and he could take the Parliamentary Secretary's word for it.  If instead of putting down this amendment Deputy O'Malley had asked if the section <Col N="1515" /> covered the type of situation he outlined he would probably have been told, yes, it was a very wide ranging section and that under it the three Ministers had tremendous powers.</P>
    <P>When we have an opportunity under section 2 of putting in this amendment I see no reason why it should not be included seeing that the Parliamentary Secretary fully agrees with the sentiments of this side of the House in regard to it.  If it were found necessary, the Consumers Protection Bill at a later stage could include a section removing that temporary provision.  I recollect appeals to the various advertising groups by successive Ministers through the years asking them not to associate themselves with what I would describe, having listened to Deputy O'Malley, as illegal advertising claiming for a product something the product had not got so as to fool a gullible public.  Deputy O'Malley has presented the opportunity of including in this section a provision which the Parliamentary Secretary welcomes but for some reason does not want to include. I see no reason for this attitude and I would ask the Parliamentary Secretary to accept the amendment since he fully agrees with it.</P>

      <P>I think the Deputy can read and it is the Food Standards Bill, 1974 that we are dealing with.  The Deputy raised a question of what advertising may claim for a product.  I agreed in principle with what he said but this is not the appropriate type of Bill in which to insert that kind of amendment.  Going back to the Deputy's own case, the ladies who advertised the biscuit that is supposed to have such a slimming effect, if that biscuit is up to standard, irrespective of whether it takes off seven and a half pounds by eating it for a week or <Col N="1516" /> adds seven and a half pounds, if its quality is correct, under this Bill it is in order to sell it.  What Deputy O'Malley is talking about is a matter that can only be covered by the Consumers' Protection Bill.</P>
      <P>This Bill, even though the provisions are wide ranging, would not preclude the sale of that particular type of biscuit if its quality were completely in order.  What we are doing here is to give power to Ministers to make regulations so that food standards can be raised and put on a par with the standards applicable in other countries. A provision in relation to the advertising of food which is up to standard in so far as food requirements are concerned but which does not do something which it is supposed to do cannot be included in this measure.  That is a very big question and for that reason the Government intend introducing a special Bill to deal with that kind of advertising.  It is a separate matter altogether.</P>
      <P>Section 2 of this Bill is wide ranging and it covers items such as those mentioned during the debate.  The Ministers can make regulations to cover such things as the country of origin and the contents of a package but advertising is a different matter altogether.  Advertising requires special legislation and special consideration which it will get in the Consumers' Protection Bill.  For that reason I do not propose to accept the amendment because it is not appropriate to this Bill.</P>

      <P>I am at a loss to understand the argument being put forward by the Parliamentary Secretary. He mentioned that he was given to understand that this Bill would go through but does he imply that Deputy O'Malley put down this amendment lightly with no intention of pursuing it?  If the Bill was agreed, as he suggests, then there would not have been any necessity for Deputy O'Malley's amendment because it would have been included.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In my view the Bill is very important because it covers three Ministries, Agriculture and Fisheries, Industry and Commerce and Health.  Despite <Col N="1517" /> the fact that it covers these three Ministries, the Government have seen fit to send in a Parliamentary Secretary to meet us on this amendment. The advertising of food, including health foods, as mentioned in the amendment is very basic and fundamental to this Bill.  The arguments put forward by the Parliamentary Secretary do not carry any weight. The amendment is very important because the description of food implies what it is.  A claim as to what such foods can do is very important and for this reason I cannot understand the Parliamentary Secretary saying that he finds himself in a difficulty about including it in the Bill.</P>
    <P>If the description on the package is important it is equally important that what the contents of the package is supposed to do for a person should be covered in this Bill.  It is important that the message is got across to the people accurately and correctly because an advertisement can be as inaccurate as an inaccurate label.</P>

      <P>I should like to ask the Parliamentary Secretary to be reasonable about this matter.  He appears to have changed his ground completely because when he was replying to what I had to say originally he agreed with me and said that the only reason he was not accepting what I said was that it was intended to cover these matters in another Bill at a future date.  The Parliamentary Secretary now tells me that this amendment is not appropriate to the Bill at all, quite a different matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Parliamentary Secretary has complained that we are not allowing the Bill to go through without examination and has accused the previous Government of not having brought in such a Bill during their term of office. Those sort of untrue statements are not very conducive to the smooth passage of this or any other Bill in this House.  Everybody agrees that my amendment would improve the position. I have given a number of examples of things that are being foisted on the public every day.  We all agree that they are misleading and are deliberately done.  I would like to <Col N="1518" /> put a stop to this sort of carry on and it is in the public interest that we should do so.</P>

      <P>In fairness to the Minister, the suggestions put forward by other Deputies and myself on Second Stage, they number about seven in all, are nearly all incorporated in the Government amendments. One suggestion which was not incorporated, however, is that which is contained in my amendment.  The Minister for Industry and Commerce devoted most of his speech to the topic which is relevant to my amendment. He was anxious to have this abuse of the sale of food and quasi-medicinal products cleared up. People are being encouraged and brainwashed into buying things that are of little or no value to them. Numerous examples were given on the last day by the Minister for Industry and Commerce and I.</P>
      <P>The Parliamentary Secretary, because he is a Parliamentary Secretary, may feel that he cannot accept an amendment but I hope he will get over that stage as he gets more experience. No harm would be done to him if he accepted this amendment which is concise, clear and of vital importance. If my amendment is accepted, the complaints which I have made can be remedied in a matter of weeks when the Bill becomes law instead of having to wait two or maybe three years for the promised Bill on consumer protection. This particular Bill can be repealed when the more comprehensive Bill which has been promised is passed.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Crowley</NameTxt>
      <P>I know the Parliamentary Secretary to be a reasonable man and I am sure he sees validity in the argument put forward in relation to this amendment.  Not so long ago a thorough investigation was carried out by the Insight team of <i>The Sunday Times</i> into advertising and nutritional value claims made by advertisers in relation to foods, particularly health foods.  They found that practically 100 per cent of the foods they investigated bore no relation whatever to the claims made by the advertisers.</P>
      <P>We are in a very susceptible position in relation to health foods because people are becoming more and more conscious of diet and the necessity for keeping down weight&mdash; some of us may not take as much notice of it as we should&mdash;and there is a whole new awareness by the public of the availability of health foods and of the claims made by advertisers that they can help people to reduce weight and, while doing so, actually become healthier.  The foods are alleged to contain all the protein and nourishment necessary to sustain people and those of us who occasionally watch TV know very well how exaggerated many of these claims are.</P>
      <P>I think the Parliamentary Secretary is unreasonable in failing to see the validity of this amendment and failing to recognise that he has a duty to protect people from false advertising. In some cases those to whom advertisers are beaming their advertisements are very guillible people who certainly need to be protected. This is a simple amendment.  It would tighten up the Bill considerably.  The Parliamentary Secretary must be aware that not alone is this market flourishing by making false claims but it has resulted in some cases in people deteriorating physically and mentally as a result of diet based on these alleged health foods and the claims made by their manufacturers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Parliamentary Secretary would be acting very responsibly and conscientiously if he were to accept this amendment.  He may say no cases <Col N="1520" /> have come to light but, with a little bit of research, he will find that the report published by <i>The Sunday Times</i> caused a tremendous amount of disquiet.  We now have an opportunity of putting a situation right and ensuring that people are not manipulated and used for gain by companies which have absolutely no scruples by ensuring that they do not get away with anything.  Why will the Parliamentary Secretary not accept this very simple amendment? There is nothing political in it.  By accepting it he will be doing a very good service to the people.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M.P. Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>I have already given the reasons for not accepting this amendment at least three times. I said I agreed generally with the sentiments expressed by Deputy O'Malley and I explained it was the intention of the Government to bring in a comprehensive measure to be known as the Consumers Protection Bill to cover not alone food but certain other commodities as well; there are such things as soap powders which may or may not do what they are alleged to do.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FlorenceCrowley" hpid="Mr. Crowley Mr. Crowley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Crowley</NameTxt>
      <P>But food is the most important.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelPatMurphy" hpid="Mr. M.P. Murphy Mr. M.P. Murphy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M.P. Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>That is so, but there is no need to worry.  This measure is wide ranging and under section 2 (b) the Minister will be entitled to draft regulations and through the medium of those regulations appropriate action can be taken. The consumer has to be protected where food is concerned, in the first instance, and, secondly, and perhaps more importantly, where other items are concerned, items such as washing powders and so on.  If Opposition Deputies were reasonable they would agree that a comprehensive measure is needed to cover everything.  As I say, I agree with the sentiments expressed by Deputy O'Malley.  It may be possible to cover advertising under section 2 but because of the Bill it is intended to introduce it is not necessary to do that in this measure.  I do not take issue with the sentiments he and <Col N="1521" /> Deputy Crowley expressed.  We all realise that some manufacturers overstate the qualities of their products. Legislation is essential to deal with that kind of advertising and we propose to do just that.  I am asking Deputies to leave that matter over for the moment. Their views are acceptable.  Protective measures are necessary and these will be dealt with on a comprehensive basis.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickJLalor" hpid="Mr. Lalor Mr. Lalor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lalor</NameTxt>
      <P>I have an idea quite frankly that the Parliamentary Secretary has come in here under the mistaken impression that this Bill will be rubber stamped in about five minutes. I agree that all abuses where false advertising is concerned cannot be covered in this Bill.  The Parliamentary Secretary mentioned soap powders in relation to which certain claims are made which can or cannot be substantiated. He said that under section 2 (3) the Minister may be able by order to deal with a wide range of goods. He also said that consumer protection from the point of view of food is a separate issue and we should not complicate it.  Section 2 (3) reads:</P>
      <P>Regulations under this section may provide that a person shall not&mdash;</P>
      <P>(a)  manufacture food intended for sale for human consumption,</P>
      <P>(b)  prepare food intended for sale for human consumption,</P>
      <P>(c)  import food intended for sale for human consumption,</P>
      <P>(d)  transport food intended for sale for human consumption,</P>
      <P>(e)  store food intended for sale for human consumption, or</P>
      <P>(f)  sell food intended for human consumption,</P>
      <P>if the food does not comply with the regulations.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I can see this being a problem.  I do not know how a person will get rid of food if he cannot transport it to a dump or somewhere else.  If this amendment is not accepted what the Bill will say is that one cannot import food, cannot prepare food, cannot manufacture food, cannot transport <Col N="1522" /> food, cannot sell food but can make any claim one likes for it.</P>

      <P>We are all for that but the point is that it will defeat the object of the exercise if a Minister for Industry and Commerce or Agriculture and Fisheries or Health makes regulations that a particular food must measure up to a particular quality but there is nothing wrong with putting and advertisement in the newspaper to say that that food contains twice as much of some given thing as is in the food.  That will be legal.  I am now beginning to see why the Parliamentary Secretary is opposed to this.  The Government Information Services claim about twice as much for the Government as they are doing and cover up for what they are not doing.  Our legislation is to be prepared on the same lines.</P>

What I am saying is that I agree that the Consumer Protection Bill will cover a far wider field but why not go ahead and cover what we can cover in this Bill, what we can cover now that a set of standards is being created whereby a manufacturer or importer must have a particular quality in his product?  Let us take the example of the slimming bread mentioned by Deputy O'Malley.  The bread must have a certain percentage of this, that and the other but while the baker must see to it that this is so there is nothing in this Bill to prevent him putting an advertisement for his yellow crust loaf in the paper and claiming that this loaf contains a, b and c which has the effect of reducing one's weight by 7 lbs, even the Parliamentary Secretary's.</P>

      <P>The Parliamentary Secretary should not get hot under the collar and he should not allow himself to become upset because it is a small thing but it is an important thing.  On a Bill on which we practically have agreement there is no reason for him to become upset.  It would not be necessary at all if the Parliamentary Secretary was not being so awkward and stubborn.  He knows, if he does accept the amendment, that when the legislation which he has told us will come from his Labour colleague, Deputy Keating, the Minister for Industry and Commerce, materialises it will be very easy to repeal this particular part of this Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1525" /> On Second Stage there were suggestions put forward by all who contributed. We had two contributors from the Government side and the remainder of the speakers were from the Fianna Fáil benches.  Many good suggestions were made and I am glad to see that they were accepted.  The Minister said quite graciously that he would give them due consideration and he did.  If I were sitting in the Parliamentary Secretary's place I would have no objection to accepting an amendment with which I agreed in principle and anything that would protect the consumer, the housewife and the small percentage of the general public that might be open to exploitation by unscrupulous manufacturers or advertisers.  I appeal to the Parliamentary Secretary to accept it, incorporate it in the Bill and have it as legislation for the next year or two or three until something else comes along from the Minister for Industry and Commerce.  He has agreed that it would help the Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FlorenceCrowley" hpid="Mr. Crowley Mr. Crowley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Crowley</NameTxt>
      <P>I am disappointed the Parliamentary Secretary did not grant our request and incorporate the amendment in the Bill.  I should like to refer to the food which means drink and especially the advertising of alcoholic drink and the claims being made for alcoholic beverages.  It is a situation we must view with a certain amount of disquiet when we reckon that 15 per cent of people in psychiatric institutions are there because of the effects of alcohol.  Here we have an opportunity to have some form of control over the advertising and sale of alcoholic beverages but we are passing up that opportunity because the Parliamentary Secretary had said there is a Bill in the pipeline that will cover that matter.</P>
      <P>I am particularly concerned about the fact that supermarkets are selling alcohol, that young people are purchasing quantities of cider from them and starting on the road to alcoholism. In the regulations governing the selling of food for human consumption, we should view with serious concern the easy availability to young people of alcohol in supermarkets.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Parliamentary Secretary must <Col N="1526" /> be as conscious as I am about the dangers in this situation.  We must start at the source of this demand, namely, the advertising in the Press, on radio and television, and we must consider also the claims made regarding the effect of consuming certain alcoholic beverages.  We cannot be complacent or smug in this House while people outside are being driven to psychiatric institutions because our legislation is so loose that we are opening the floodgates even wider to all kinds of abuses.</P>
    <P>While the amendment might not go the whole way to prevent these abuses, at the same time it would be a brake or a restriction on the advertising of food and drink products.  The Parliamentary Secretary is in the same constituency as myself; he is an active politician and is as aware as I am of the feelings of the people in this matter. As he is the person charged with responsibility in this instance, he has an obligation to ensure that he does all in his power to alleviate the terrible suffering incurred because of the claims made for alcohol and the manner in which it is glamourised in national advertising.</P>
    <P>If the Parliamentary Secretary were the parent of a child who bought alcohol in the supermarket and started on the road to Skid Row because of this advertising, would he not be annoyed and irate at the legislators who did not take the necessary action?</P>
    <P>The Parliamentary Secretary may be in a predicament in that he may not have the power to accept the amendment.  If he were to tell us he is prepared to accept it provided the Minister agrees, that would be reasonable. We cannot leave this legislation as it is and not use it to the utmost benefit of the community we represent. The amendment would go a long way towards ensuring that the kind of abuses I have referred to do not continue.</P>

      <P>I am constrained to go back a little regarding the reason for this Bill.  The Codex Commission was established in 1962 under the auspices of the United Nations.  It is unnecessary for me to <Col N="1527" /> outline the functions of the commission because they were set out clearly in the Minister's statement on the Second Stage of the Bill.</P>
      <P>A surprisingly large number of countries&mdash;more than 100&mdash;joined the commission in 1962 with a view to improving food standards.  Seven years later the Government of the day appointed a national commission.  At column 79 of the Official Report dated 24th April, 1974, the Minister stated:</P>
      <P>With this in view a national codex committee was established in 1969 to advise the Government on all matters relating to food standards drawn up by the commission.  The committee includes representatives of Government Departments, the State Laboratory, the Institute for Industrial Research and Standards, An Foras Talúntais, consumer interests and the various sectors of the food industry, under the chairmanship of an officer of my Department.</P>
      <P>That was in 1969 and the Government were in office until 14th March, 1973. Four years passed but nothing was done.  We came into office on 14th March, 1973&mdash;&mdash;</P>

I have been worrying about the nature of some of the advertisements on television, in the Press, and so on and I think some action should be taken.  Knowing that a rather comprehensive measure is to be brought forward, I thought there was no need to add any amendment to section 2 because everything is covered from (a) to (j) in section 2 (1).</P>
      <P>I have indicated my reasons for asking the House to leave the section as it is.  I certainly hope that a wider ranging Bill dealing with advertising, not only of foods but appliances of every kind, will not be too long delayed. I ask the House to agree to the section.  We feel it is sufficiently comprehensive at this stage.  If we have waited from 1962, when the commission was established, to 1974, surely we can wait two or three months longer to get what the Opposition feel is a necessary addition. To my mind, a person misrepresenting a product can be brought to heel under a regulation made under section 2.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Briscoe made the point that it would be very helpful if the regulations made under this section included a regulation to the effect that the country of origin of any foreign food or product were shown.  We have not an amendment down to that effect but I give notice that Deputy Briscoe or I will <Col N="1531" /> put one down on Report Stage. Perhaps the Parliamentary Secretary would indicate if he favours such a proposal because it is important that people should be clearly aware of the origin of the product.  Nowadays, with the elaborate sort of packaging we have, it is often impossible to know the country of origin of particular food products.  I cannot see anywhere in section 2 that it is obligatory to show this or that the Minister has power to make it obligatory to show it.  In subsection (4) there is reference to regulations about not permitting export to certain countries.  The question of imports, and the countries from which they come, is more important.</P>

      <P>The Minister has power to make regulations to do as as Deputy Briscoe and Deputy O'Malley suggest under subsection (1) (i) of this section which refers to packaging, labelling and presentation of food.  The Minister has power to make a regulation which provides for the labelling of goods and he can make it mandatory to have the country of origin displayed on the package.  There is no need for an amendment to cover this.  All the authority necessary is given here.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Moore</NameTxt>
      <P>While the number of regulations mentioned here, if they were properly enforced, might well give us a good code for the control and sale of food and such things as ence gained already, where alcoholic drink can be included as food, we know of the grave concern in the country about the way the Government have failed to produce any sensible control on the sale of food, such as alcohol, in supermarkets. What do the Government intend to do on this point?  Even though I am a teetotaler I do not speak because of that.  The first complaint I got was from a supermarket owner who pointed out that because of the design of supermarkets and because drink was displayed in such an appetising way it caused impulsive buying among young people.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have been told that if a supermarket is situated near a football <Col N="1532" /> ground and the young people are playing football and have their friends to cheer them on it is very difficult for the supermarket owner to stop those young boys from buying drink or getting it in some other way.  The drink consumed is cider, which is alcoholic. We see evidence everyday in this country of the problem of alcoholism but I do not think we are doing very much to ensure that our youth are given protection in their most formative years.</P>
    <P>I want to pay tribute to the vintners' association who do a lot of work in trying to curb the abuse of drink.  Unless the Government, by legislation, set a very high example this nonaction will breed cynicism among the people.  They may well ask why the Government should pass their well-sounding legislation when in fact it is not effective and our young boys and girls start off on the path of alcoholism because the Oireachtas have not taken the proper steps to ensure that the sale of this type of food is controlled in the places I have mentioned.</P>

The Bill is mainly concerned with the quality of the food, that it is up to international standards and that it complies with the standards laid down by the Codex Alimentarius Commission. That is the main purpose of the Bill and that is why section 2 is so broadly ranging to cover almost any eventuality and possibly it will cover some of the points made.  It could cover the point made by Deputy Moore.  The Deputy wants drink in a supermarket to be in a separate department.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Crowley</NameTxt>
      <P>On the section generally, lest the Parliamentary Secretary be under any other impression, we welcome this Bill very much, especially section 2.  Deputy Moore and I have taken an interest in the matter of the sale of alcohol to younger people and we would be much happier if the Parliamentary Secretary would agree to consider our proposals in this regard.  It is a matter of grave concern to all of us to find that 15 per cent of those admitted to psychiatric hospitals are going in because of the consumption of alcohol.  We have an obligation here to use all means at our disposal to try to protect the younger people especially.  The situation is very bad now but I think it is deteriorating and no matter how small a contribution we could make it would be something. Even if it would save only one or two people from going on this disastrous road to alcoholism, it would be worth while.</P>
      <P>The Parliamentary Secretary is as much aware as we are that teenagers aged 14, 15 or 16, especially in Dublin and the other cities, when going to matches go into supermarkets and get cider.  Some of them then go underneath the stands in the football pitches and take something else with the cider and this is of even greater concern to us.  Therefore, the Parliamentary Secretary should use any powers he has in this Bill and if he has not sufficient power he should, if necessary, extend those powers to control rigidly the sale of alcohol in supermarkets.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Moore and I might not agree on exactly how that should be done.  I think alcohol should only be sold through a licensed vinter.  Deputy Moore is of opinion that a supermarket should be allowed to sell it if they had a special compartment or department but with the tremendous volume of business in supermarkets at certain periods it is a very onerous task for the check-out girls to ensure that everything going out is going to the proper people and has been purchased by a member of the proper age group.  That is why I think a licensed <Col N="1535" /> vinter is the only person capable of controlling this.  They have been very much maligned.  RTE, being conscious of the power and influence of advertising, has introduced a code of advertising in regard to alcohol but this code does not apply elsewhere.  For instance, in cinemas where a considerable number of teenagers go, alcohol is openly advertised.  The encouragement to consume or experiment with drinks is tremendous as a result of advertising because those who prepare these advertisements are highly skilled and highly paid.  They create the demand and the urge in people to try their products.  We have a very good opportunity in this Bill of taking some steps towards controlling the abuse of alcohol and I appeal to the Parliamentary Secretary, even if he cannot make a decision at this stage, that on the next Stage he should bring in some amendment which would help towards eliminating these abuses.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelPatMurphy" hpid="Mr. M.P. Murphy Mr. M.P. Murphy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M.P. Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>The proposal made by the Deputy does not arise. We are moving into a very different field, advertising and selling alcoholic drinks in shops and supermarkets and places other than public houses.  As the Deputy knows, there is separate legislation governing the granting of licences for the sale of alcohol and if there is need of an amendment for the reasons suggested by the Deputy it is surely the Act governing the conditions of licences and the sale of alcohol that should be amended.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FlorenceCrowley" hpid="Mr. Crowley Mr. Crowley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Crowley</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="FlorenceCrowley" hpid="Mr. Crowley Mr. Crowley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Crowley</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Parliamentary Secretary suggesting that the Ministers have no power to make a regulation even about where alcohol is sold under this Bill?</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelPatMurphy" hpid="Mr. M.P. Murphy Mr. M.P. Murphy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M.P. Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think that the Ministers specified in this Bill could make a regulation precluding the sale of drinks in a place where a <Col N="1536" /> licence has been granted for their sale unless the standards were in conflict with the terms of the Bill.  They certainly could not preclude the sale of drinks if the standards were in order.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardCollins" hpid="Mr. G. Collins Mr. G. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>There might not be any problem if the legislation which covers the sale of alcohol in premises such as supermarkets were enforced.  I am not satisfied that under this Bill the Ministers could make any regulations governing the sale of alcohol.  I know the Ministers could make regulations governing the quality of it and, perhaps, the advertising of it.  It might go a long way towards meeting the wishes of Deputy Crowley and Deputy Moore if large advertising hoardings were not displayed in the supermarkets to attract people to that particular section. Perhaps the Ministers involved in the Food Standards Bill would have some say there.  I cannot say but I am reasonably sure that the Ministers would have the power to make regulations governing the amount and type of advertising of alcohol where it is easily accessible to youngsters and where the control is not anything as strict as on the same product when it is sold in a public house.</P>

    <P>Not less than two months before making any regulations under <Col N="1537" /> section 2 of this Act, the Minister of State proposing to make them shall cause a notice to be published in a daily morning newspaper published in the State stating that he intends to make the regulations and indicating generally their subject matter and scope.</P>
    <P>The only criticism I have of this section is that I am of the belief that the period of time, two months, may not be sufficient.  If this period is not sufficient, would the Parliamentary Secretary say if the Minister involved has the power under the Bill to extend that period from two months upwards, if necessary?</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelPatMurphy" hpid="Mr. M.P. Murphy Mr. M.P. Murphy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M.P. Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>The section provides that not less than two months notice be given and there is no upward ceiling.  The industrial representatives on the Codex Climentarius Commission were satisfied with the two months notice.  If some special case arose, it could be extended because the section merely states that it cannot be less than two months but there is no upward ceiling.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>On the Second Stage, I pointed out that the number of potential prosecutors under section 5 (1) (a) was enormous.  It could be 10,000 or more; it could be any officer attached to three Ministers, to a board of health, to a local authority, or a customs and excise officer.  I do not know what the total number would be but I am sure it would run into thousands.  This is a very wide category to which to give power of prosecution.  I suggested on the Second Stage that there should be some provision under which the consent of some responsible senior officer would have to be obtained in order to bring a prosecution.  There are many precedents for obtaining the consent of the Attorney General, for example, to a prosecution.  In this case it need not necessarily be the consent of the Attorney General but it should at least be the consent of some senior official, such as the secretary or assistant secretary of a Department, a revenue commissioner or someone of that ilk.  It could be the CEO of a health board or the manager of a local authority.  Otherwise, there could be malicious prosecutions, particularly in rural areas where there might be some sort of personal spleen between an officer and an individual running a restaurant or shop.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMoore" hpid="Mr. Moore Mr. Moore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moore</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy O'Malley has made a very valid point in regard to the multiplicity of potential prosecutors. In order to make it more businesslike there should be just one <Col N="1541" /> channel of prosecution.  It would be ridiculous to have officials in three different Departments bringing the same prosecution, to say nothing of the local authority and the health board.  If Deputy O'Malley's suggestion is accepted there would be no multiplication of prosecutions against some unfortunate individual.  We do not want a situation in which we would have myriads of inspectors prosecuting an alleged wrongdoer backed by the authority of three Government Ministers.  Deputy O'Malley's suggestion would ensure that justice would be done and it would also make this legislation tighter and therefore more effective.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelPatMurphy" hpid="Mr. M.P. Murphy Mr. M.P. Murphy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M.P. Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>I can allay the fears of Deputies opposite so far as this section is concerned.  The position will be far from a potential 10,000 prosecutors.  It is intended that the regulations will be enforced primarily by health inspectors, of whom there will be about 150.  There may be certain exceptions in the case of premises dealt with by customs and excise officers and veterinary inspectors and so on.  The main point is that these officers will have to be specifically authorised to enforce the regulations and they will have to carry with them that certificate of authorisation.  The official visiting a premises must produce his authorisation and, if he does not do so, he need not be admitted.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On the question of prosecution, it is felt that the man who detects the alleged offence is really in the best position to decide whether or not a prosecution should follow.  A garda issues a summons if he discovers an offence is being committed or someone is doing something in conflict with the law.  If reports have to be made to some senior official to discover whether or not a prosecution should lie a great deal of time and effort would be wasted.  Those exercising this particular function will be of such qualifications and calibre as to render most unlikely any danger of malicious prosecutions.  I cannot see that happening and if it did and if it was found to be malicious or vexatious or treated with contempt by the appropriate court or district justice, I am <Col N="1542" /> sure that officer would not be in business for too long.</P>
    <P>What we visualise is in or around 150 health inspectors, all of whom may do this job, plus people drawn from the other classification of persons set down here but each one must carry with him an authorisation irrespective of what rank he holds in a local authority.</P>

      <P>for the purposes of Part II of the Local Government Act, 1941,...</P>
      <P>You must study that now.  I think this is completely in order.  It is taken from the Local Government Act of 1941, Part II; section 8 (2) reads:</P>
      <P>Where, in the opinion of the Minister, the duties of a particular office or of offices of a particular class or description relate wholly or mainly to the functions of another Minister of State, the Minister may, with the consent of such other Minister, by order provide that such other Minister shall for the purposes of this Part of the Act be the appropriate Minister in relation to such office or offices and holders thereof and thereupon such other Ministers shall for the said purposes be the appropriate Minister in relation to such office or offices and holders thereof.</P>

      <P>I have explained it.  It is simple enough.  I thought the Deputy was wiser than he is.  If the Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries were to say that a clerical officer in a local authority or a health board was to carry out these duties, to implement the regulations laid down by him, he would have to get the consent of the appropriate Minister&mdash;the Minister for Health in the case of the health board and so on&mdash;and having got that consent the officer then would be working as if he were directly under the control of the Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries.</P>

      <P>If that is so, I fail to see any ground whatever for the Parliamentary Secretary to say to me that I was allowing my imagination to run away with me.  What I said then and I repeat now is that if the Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries decides that he wants officers of a local authority to enforce this Bill for him he will go to his colleague <Col N="1545" /> the Minister for Local Government and get his permission to enlist employees of local authorities to operate the Food Standards Bill, 1974.

      <P>Good man.  And sit down again.  We are back to where we started.  We are all quite capable of reading what is in the Bill and reading it as well, possibly, as the Parliamentary Secretary.  We are all quite capable of reading the Local Government Act, 1941, but we are still not getting to the crunch point. Are we right in thinking that this section means that the Minister for Local Government having been asked by one of the three Ministers involved, will give power to the staff of a local authority to become involved in the enforcement of this scheme? May I have a simple answer, yes or no?  We do not want to listen to the Parliamentary Secretary reading verbatim from documents in front of him; perhaps he would tell us what is meant, in his own way.</P>

      <P>An officer of a county council is under the control of Local Government and the appropriate Minister would be the Minister for Local Government.  In my view it is quite easy to interpret this section. The Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries may be the appropriate Minister so far as the particular duty is concerned, but the officer is an official of a local authority and the three Ministers specifically mentioned do not include the Minister for Local Government.  If he is appointed to do the job at the request of one of the three Ministers mentioned he becomes responsible to that Minister for that work.</P>

      <P>In page 6, subsection (3) (b), line 26, before &ldquo;order&rdquo; to insert &ldquo;order, if it thinks it appropriate to do so, the restoration of the food to the person from whom it was seized and&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>This subsection provides that an officer who has seized food may have it destroyed and made unfit for human consumption if he gets either the written consent of the owner or a District Court order.  This provision is unlikely to be used frequently because in most cases involving minor infringements of the regulations the need for seizure will not arise and prosecutions will suffice.  In other cases where the food is clearly unfit for human consumption action may more appropriately be taken by the Food Hygiene Regulations administered by the Department of Health.</P>
      <P>Amendment No. 3 provides that a District Court may make the order sought, or if it decides the food has been wrongly seized and that the owner is at a loss as a result it may award appropriate compensation to him.  Both sides have a right to appeal to the Circuit Court.  Deputy O'Malley raised certain points on this question during the Second Stage debate.

      <P>On Second Stage I remarked there was not the power to return the actual food but I also said that was not surprising because normally the food would not be in a returnable condition if one had to go to the District Court to have the matter decided, and possibly go to the Circuit Court afterwards on appeal. What may not be realised is that outside the cities of Dublin and Cork <Col N="1549" /> there are not daily sittings of the District Court.  In fact, in many rural areas there are sittings only every two or three months.  The Parliamentary Secretary may not be aware that the waiting period for appeals to the Circuit Court in Dublin is almost nine months, although it is somewhat less elsewhere.  Unless the food is of a particularly imperishable character it is unlikely anyone would want it back, but it is no harm to have the power.</P>
      <P>It appears to me from the wording of amendment No. 3 that the court might have the power to order the payment by the appropriate Minister of compensation only if it also made an order for the return of the food.  I think that danger does not arise on amendment No. 4 because the words &ldquo;and may&rdquo; are added at the end while, for some reason, they are not added at the end of amendment No. 3.</P>
      <P>In most cases, even if the food were improperly seized in the first instance, by the time the matter was decided the food would certainly be unfit for human consumption.  There is nothing in this section about the nature of the appeals, what period of notice would have to be given, or anything like that.  I do not think that the District Court rules provide, or could provide as yet, for appeals under this Act.  I should like to ask the Parliamentary Secretary if it is the intention of the District Court Rules Committee and the Circuit Court Rules Committee to make rules to cover appeals under this section.</P>

      <P>The section is set out at some length.  Two amendments were accepted to meet representations made during the debate on Second Stage.  There is an opportunity to appeal to the court.  The timing of the hearing is a matter that cannot be dealt with precisely here.  In some areas the District Court sits every day and in other areas it may sit once a week.  The Circuit Court sits less frequently.  I assume that the matter will be dealt with at the first available court in the district.  I do not think it is proposed to have special sittings of any court to deal with this type of <Col N="1550" /> offence such as there would be in the case of fishery offences.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 4a:</P>
      <P>To delete subsections (1), (2) and (3).</P>
      <P>The purpose of the first three subsections of the section, as, indeed, is the purpose of most of the remaining subsections, is to put the onus of proof in various prosecutions on the defendant. It goes beyond just putting the onus of proof on him.  If it said that and said no more, it would not be too bad but, unfortunately, it goes somewhat beyond that and says that certain matters shall be presumed until the contrary is proved, which puts a heavier onus on him than the normal transfer of onus on to the defendant. From the way it is drafted it would seem that the degree of proof which the defendant would be called on to satisfy the court with is beyond reasonable doubt.  The most that should be asked of any defendant, even in these unusual circumstances, should be to create sufficient doubt about the matter to enable the court to give him the benefit of that doubt.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I know there are many instances in our law of the onus of proof being transferred to the defendant in certain cases.  It strikes me that in these three instances, whatever about the later ones in the light of the proposed amendments to them, it is far too wide. A presumption is made which the defendant has to disprove in each case. It is unnecessarily wide or wider than any prosecution would reasonably require.  I submit to the House that, if <Col N="1551" /> the prosecution has to have all these presumptions in its favour, in a particular case it would not really have sufficient evidence to warrant the taking of a prosecution on any equitable basis.</P>
    <P>If you combine all these presumptions against the defendant and the transfer of the onus to him, and the transfer to him of the necessity to prove his innocence in each of a long series of things related to the one prosecution, you could have a situation where it is not necessary to do much more than just prove that a particular defendant was in possession of food. If you prove that, there is the presumption that it was intended for sale for human consumption.  If you prove it was sold, there is the presumption that it was sold for human consumption, irrespective of the purpose for which the purchaser may have bought it.</P>
    <P>Subsection (3) is, in many ways, the most dangerous of all, because it provides that, where anything is found on premises used for the manufacture or preparation of food, if that thing is capable of use in such manufacture or preparation, it will be presumed that it was used in the manufacture or preparation of food intended for sale for human consumption.  On Second Stage I gave an example of a possible abuse of that provision.  If animal food of some kind was lawfully on a premises for consumption by animals belonging to the owner of that premises&mdash;the example I gave was dog food or cat food&mdash;because it was capable of being put into food which was being prepared for manufacture, there would be a presumption, until the defendant proved otherwise, that non-human food was put in food for human consumption. It would not be up to the prosecution to prove that the defendant used it, but it would be up to the defendant to prove that he did not use it.</P>
    <P>Anybody looking fairly at this will agree that that sort of thing is really going too far.  To my mind while, perhaps, one of the first or second of these presumptions might justifiably be allowed to stand in certain circumstances, the combination of the three <Col N="1552" /> of them together, and subsection (4) even as amended, gives rise to a situation which cumulatively is very unfair to a defendant or a potential defendant. As long as it is proved that he had food on a certain premises, or that he sold food, everything else will be presumed against him until he can start to disprove each one.</P>
    <P>Because my amendment refers only to the first three subsections I will not refer to the curious provision in subsection (4) about which I have an amendment down and I am happy to see that the Minister has as well. While I am glad to see that he proposes to remove at least the most obnoxious part of the subsection, I think the same should be done with regard to the first three subsections, or at least some combination of any two of them.  While the first two on their own might not be that serious, the cumulative effect of the three together is very serious.  I do not think, therefore, that the three together should be allowed to stand.</P>
    <P>I would be quite prepared to amend this amendment, if that would be of any help to the Parliamentary Secretary, to include only subsection (3), if he felt he could not agree to the deletion of all three.  Subsection (3) is the most serious, and cumulatively the three together are very serious.</P>

      <P>But the State, as the prosecutor, would be in great difficulties.  I will take a simple case from the point of view of the ordinary man-in-the-street.  Let us say a man buys a loaf of bread in a shop.  He could say that the loaf of bread was not for human consumption at all.  It was for the dog at home.  That kind of situation could occur.</P>

      <P>Where it is proved in any prosecution for an offence under this Act that a person manufactured, prepared, imported...</P>
      <P>The seller would not be caught because he would not be selling it for human consumption.  Subsection (2) says:</P>
      <P>...it shall be presumed, until the contrary is proved, that the food was sold for human consumption.</P>
      <P>Now, he has the food and it is intended to sell it for human consumption. Let us say, in the case of the loaf of bread, the State would find it difficult to say that the purchaser or his family ate the bread.</P>

      <P>It is a point, as I see it, if the seller were to say that it was not for sale for human consumption.  That throws an obligation, to some extent, on the defendant to prove his innocence.  To my mind, many prosecutions brought justifiably may fail on technical grounds.  Any one of the subsections, or a combination of the three, will not ensure that an innocent man is convicted.  They will give his prosecutor a better chance of presenting his case and will throw some obligation on the defendant to give evidence in court.  I am of the opinion that this type of legislation requires subsections such as the three referred to in the Deputy's amendment and which he proposes to delete.  I would ask him to let those three subsections stand.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>The most obnoxious of the three subsections is clearly subsection (3).  That was not dealt with at all by the Parliamentary Secretary in his reply.  I will give an example which I gave the last day on Second Stage when the Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries told <Col N="1554" /> me it was too far-fetched and could not happen.  I have thought about it since and, unfortunately, it can happen.  There is no doubt that it can happen.  It can act very unfairly. What the Parliamentary Secretary should bear in mind is that offences under this measure, by virtue of section 9, are all summary and because they are all summary can be heard in the absence of the defendant. Some of them probably will be. It may be through no fault of the defendant that he is not present.  A defendant may well never get the opportunity of giving the elaborate explanations required of him under these subsections and, in particular, under subsection (3).</P>
      <P>The need to safeguard a defendant would be less if the case were indictable when he would have to be present at the trial and when he would have far more opportunity to deal with matters of this kind.  But the Parliamentary Secretary will have to realise that a case like this could be over in two minutes because all it is necessary to prove under subsection (3) is that the premises on which the particular article was found were used either in the manufacture or preparation of food and that the article in question&mdash;which is referred to as &ldquo;the thing&rdquo; which is a good omnibus word and covers a lot more objects in modern legislation than articles of human or non-human consumption&mdash;would simply have to be shown to be capable of use in or for the purpose of such manufacture or preparation.  There is immediately the presumption until the defendant proves to the contrary that it was used.  The example I gave was valid. That is probably why the subsection was inserted.  I think it was unfair to put it in because, unless the prosecution have some evidence at least against a man that he did something wrong, they should not prosecute him.  It is no good for the Parliamentary Secretary to say they will not.  The trouble is that they can and, therefore, one cannot be certain that it will not happen.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not think that the example I gave the last day and earlier today has been controverted.  You could have on <Col N="1555" /> premises animal feedingstuff intended for consumption by animals only but which would be capable, because of its nature, of going into human food.  And there will be a presumption that it was used in human food until the defendant proves that he did not use it.  It may be much more difficult for the defendant to prove that he did not use it than it would be for the prosecution to prove that he did.  And, unless the prosecution had some grounds for believing or showing that the animal food was, in fact, used in that way, I do not think there should be a prosecution. But, under this Bill, there can be because all that has to be proved is that the non-human food was found on certain premises.  After that, the case is complete and they get a conviction unless the defendant can prove he did not use it.  That can be very hard to do and it is unfair that such a heavy onus be placed on a defendant.  In my view, there would have to be at least some evidence of its actual use in human food before such a prosecution could be brought.  There would have to be a genuine <i>prima facie</i> case.</P>
    <P>It is enlightening to hear the Parliamentary Secretary say it was necessary to put teeth into the Bill and to do that it was necessary to have those three subsections transferring the onus of proof.  I can remember being here for days and nights on sections of certain Bills which proposed far less drastic reversals of the normal onus of proof than are proposed in these three subsections.  I remember being kept here days and nights on end, being lectured at by Members of, amongst other parties, the liberal Labour Party about how wrong, in principle, was any such attempt in any circumstances. But we have it here on a very broad scale, indeed, in three subsections one after the other.  What worries me in particular is the cumulative effect of all three because it is feasible for all three to be used cumulatively against a defendant.  In other words, the onus of proof is on him on three separate points in the one prosecution.  Perfectly innocent men may well find it impossible in those circumstances to <Col N="1556" /> discharge that onus.  For that reason I am concerned about this but I am prepared to be reasonable with the Parliamentary Secretary in that I feel the third one is far and away the most unreasonable.  I would be happy to see that deleted and let the other two stand if the Parliamentary Secretary cannot see his way to agree to the deletion of all three.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelPatMurphy" hpid="Mr. M.P. Murphy Mr. M.P. Murphy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M.P. Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>I think Deputy O'Malley is stretching imagination a little too far.  It is not the KGB or the Gestapo who will be implementing those regulations.  So far as I am concerned I feel that any qualified inspector, who finds on inspection that food in a premises may not be fit for human consumption, will discuss the matter with the proprietor and I am sure in most cases the matter will be resolved.  I do not see any difficulty and I say that as a person who could be inspected under this particular regulation.  If the appropriate inspector calls at my premises and he has doubt about some particular item I have for sale, whether it is for human consumption or otherwise, or, to use the terms in section 3, that anything was found on the premises used for the manufacture or preparation of food which was not up to standard, this in most cases would be resolved there and then.</P>
      <P>In a case where the inspector is not fully satisfied and he prosecutes as Deputy O'Malley knows very well as a legal man prosecution does not presume guilt.  Innocent people have been prosecuted occasionally.  Prosecution in this case would be tantamount to saying that the inspector reasonably believes that this person is guilty of an offence but it will be the inspector's task to convince the appropriate justice that the person is guilty.</P>

      <P>There is not a mandatory obligation in a summary offence.  However, when a person is charged with an offence there is an obligation on him to attend the court unless he is precluded, through some circumstances, from doing so.  This Bill is different from Bills referred to by Deputy O'Malley.  This is a Bill by agreement.  We are disagreeing here, as far as I can see, about the best ways and means of implementing proper food standards in this country.  Some of us feel that by taking a more roundabout way we would do it better.  This is not a controversial Bill.  Our common objective is to ensure that we have proper food standards.  We cannot attain that objective without a provision for the prosecution of offenders.</P>

      <P>It is the wish of the sponsoring Minister that this Bill brings about a position whereby people comply with the regulations laid down.  Most of them are complying with them at the present time but this Bill will ensure that those whose standards do not comply with the regulations do so in the future.  They will have to change their methods to comply with the regulations.</P>
      <P>We have agreed to appoint inspectors and we must give them some reasonable authority and protection so far as proving offences where they think they are committed.  I do not believe that the three sections, whether they are taken singly or together, will be responsible for convicting an innocent person and having him punished by the courts.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>I am afraid what the Parliamentary Secretary said does not reply to the points I made.  I do not think he realises what is involved. It is not a question of helping the <Col N="1558" /> inspector to prove the offence.  If it were I would have very much less objection to it.  It is a completely different thing.  It is setting out that if the inspector proves some basic facts, then various other things will immediately be presumed against the defendant unless he can prove otherwise.</P>
      <P>The danger here is that these are summary offences and the district justice is under no obligation to see that the defendant is present or is represented. The defendant has no obligation to be present.  I can assure the Parliamentary Secretary that in a great many summary cases the defendant is never present.  District Courts would take twice as long if they were. In a great many cases they never bothered to attend and they cannot be criticised for not attending so far as summary cases are concerned because they are not obliged to do so.</P>
      <P>It is not a question of giving additional powers or something of that nature, as the Parliamentary Secretary stated, to an inspector.  It is a question that when he proves certain basic, fairly obvious things that are quite easily proved a series of presumptions against the defendant come into effect.  The onus is then thrown on him to prove his innocence.  It would appear to me beyond reasonable doubt that this is not so, that it is not correct.  Subsection (3) in particular is unfair because it goes beyond what most of these sort of presumptions usually extend to.  The cumulative effect of the three of them together is quite serious.  I am aware, for example, that it was in food and drugs legislation that this concept of transferring the onus of proof probably first arose because of the difficulty in relation to certain food and drug offences of proving a number of matters beyond reasonable doubt on the part of the prosecution.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The problems are a good deal less here because they are not as technical. The need to have this transfer of onus of proof is not at all as great. I make the offer to the Parliamentary Secretary that if he feels that he cannot accept all of this amendment that I amend it, with your permission, to <Col N="1559" /> apply to subsection (3) only.  I feel then the most unfair part of the subsections will have been removed if that particular one is removed if not think it will put any inspector or anyone else at a great disadvantage to have subsection (3) removed.</P>

      <P>I cannot agree with the suggestion of Deputy O'Malley.  This matter has been explained at reasonable length.  The need for the subsection exists.  I cannot visualise a situation whereby a business man is prosecuted for a breach of the Food Standards Act and he refrains from attending court. It is all right to say that people prosecuted for offences like having no lights, unlicensed dogs and so on may find it cheaper and easier to remain away and let the justice determine the case in their absence and impose the appropriate penalty. Any businessman will take a prosecution under this Bill as a serious matter not because of the fine imposed, whether it is little or great, but because the fact that he is brought before the court under this Bill could have repercussions on his business.  It is not a matter that would be taken lightly.  I am reasonably satisfied that nobody will be brought to court by any of our inspectors unless there is at least a reasonable doubt.</P>

I see nothing unfair in these subsections particularly in a Bill of this type and I am sure that if somebody is brought to court who is innocent it will emerge clearly that this is so.

      <P>&ldquo;(a) that he received the food as being in compliance with the regulations under the said section 2 and with a written warranty to that effect and that he notified the prosecutor of the warranty and its contents not less than one week before the hearing of the prosecution,&rdquo;.</P>

      <P>I am in full agreement with amendment No. 6 in the Minister's name because it has precisely the same effect as amendment 6a in my own name except that it is a rather more roundabout way of saying it.  Amendment 6a would stand on its own and the value of amendment No. 6 is greatly diluted, if not removed, by amendment No. 5 because amendment No. 5 re-introduces this concept of having to give notice to the prosecutor.  In the section as it stands due notice has to be given of a proposal to rely on the subsection. That, I suppose, means a day or two, depending on circumstances.  Now, there is an obligation to notify the prosecution not less than one week before the hearing of the prosecution. If that is not done it is not just a question that the defendant would get off but would be liable to pay costs; without it he would not be discharged because he has failed to comply with (a), (b) and (c), as amended, in subsection 4.</P>

    <P>Although the intention may have been good the net effect of this is to make the situation worse than it was already.  Amendment No. 5 should not be moved.  It negatives the value of amendment No. 6 or amendment No. 6a.  If anything it makes the position worse from the point of view of the defendant because the defendant under amendment No. 5, as now proposed, will have to give not less than one week's notice of the warranty and its contents to the prosecution.  Does the Parliamentary Secretary realise that &ldquo;not less than one week&rdquo; is seven clear days but that a summons can be served&mdash;and these are all summary offences&mdash;eight days normally before a court?  If that is so the defendant is in the position that he has one day, presumably the day on which he receives the summons, to convey this <Col N="1562" /> information about the warranty and the contents of it to the prosecution. It may well be impossible for him to do that.  I think the defendant is worse off as a result of amendment No. 5 than he was under the original section. I think the Parliamentary Secretary has negatived the value of amendments Nos. 6 and 6a.  When I first saw amendment No. 6 after I had put down my own amendment and noted that it was to the same effect, I said: &ldquo;That is grand.&rdquo;  It was only afterwards I realised that amendment No. 5 reintroduces the elements at the end of that subsection which amendments 6 and 6a would remove in a way that is more detrimental to the defendant than it was before any amendment was proposed to this subsection. He can be in a very difficult position if the summons is served on him eight days before the court when he must give at least a clear week's notice of his intention to rely on this particular provision of warranty and the contents of the warranty.</P>
    <P>Such a person may find himself squeezed for time.  If the summons is served on him 12 days before the date of the court it would be difficult for him to decide how this information should be communicated because the defendant may be living a great distance away from where the offence took place and the court in which the prosecution is taking place.  It has not helped the situation, notwithstanding amendments Nos. 6 and 6a, to insert No. 5.  If one reads the subsection as amended one will see that it ends with the word &ldquo;prosecution&rdquo; and the obligation is on the defendant to prove each of the three (a), (b) and (c).  A defendant will have to prove that he received the food as being in compliance with the regulations under section 2 and with a written warranty to that effect and that he notified the prosecutor of the warranty and its contents not less than one week before the hearing of the prosecution.  He will also have to prove that he had no reason to believe at the time when he disposed of the food that it did not comply with the said regulations, and that the food, when disposed of by him, was in the same state as when he received it.</P>
    <P>If a defendant proves those three <Col N="1563" /> things he will then be discharged from the prosecution but if he fails to prove one of them, and the one he is most likely to fail to prove is the first one, he must be convicted even though the court could be perfectly satisfied that he is not guilty.  That is why I think this amendment is an unhappy one.  It is only if (a) (b) and (c) are complied with that the defendant shall be discharged from the prosecution. If the three of them are not complied with&mdash;they are cumulative and not alternative&mdash;then, on a reading of this subsection as proposed the defendant could not be discharged from the prosecution even though the court is satisfied he is not guilty.</P>
    <P>This is the kind of incongruous situation one gets in this type of legislation where everything is loaded against the defendant.  A defendant who could demonstrate his own innocence but who is not able to prove one of the elements that he has to prove seven days before the court has to be found guilty even though he is clearly innocent.  There may be many instances in a prosecution of this nature where a defendant cannot lay his hands on the warranty until later than the seven days before the court.  Therefore, such a defendant could not prove to the prosecutor more than seven days before the court that he had this warranty but even if he produces to the court this warranty, under this subsection, as proposed to be amended, the court would have to convict him because he did not prove it more than seven days before the court.</P>
    <P>Obviously this change was made to meet the criticism I made of the ridiculous situation that existed under the subsection as it originally stood where a man could prove his innocence and still have costs awarded against him unless he gave his evidence to the prosecutor, independently, before the court.  The Minister quite properly decided to change that but I have demonstrated that in changing it he has made it worse from the point of view of the defendant.  The way to rectify it is to leave 7 (4) (a) as it is and to accept amendment No. 6 <Col N="1564" /> or No. 6a.  If the Parliamentary Secretary wishes to move No. 5 he would be better to move none of them and leave it as it was because we would have the ludicrous situation in which a man could prove his innocence but the court would be forced to find him guilty.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelPatMurphy" hpid="Mr. M.P. Murphy Mr. M.P. Murphy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M.P. Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>My interpretation is quite the opposite from that of the Deputy.  In my view it is a safeguarding subsection.  A food importer or a food merchant brought before the court, whether innocent or guilty suffers to some extent.  Because of the fact that he is brought before the court at all and that the case is recorded against him in the Press some of his customers may say that there was no smoke without a fire and that he would not have been brought before the court but for the fact that there was something wrong with his food and it was not up to requirements.</P>
      <P>People have been prosecuted under the existing legislation for having something in their possession which did not measure up to standards even though they had nothing whatever to do with the goods concerned which they received from a wholesaler or exporter.  By virtue of the fact that the goods were found on their premises they were brought before the court.  What we propose to do in this section is that if goods are found to be substandard and the merchant has a warranty indicating that the goods were up to our requirements he will not be prosecuted on production of that warrant.  The offender in that case would be the person who sold the goods to the man in whose possession they were found.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It would be very unfair to prosecute a person who has such a warranty either set down on the goods or expressed in an invoice.  This section enables him to produce the invoice as a warranty to the prosecution Deputy O'Malley asserts what would happen if such a person did not have the invoice in time to produce it seven days before the court.  However, the subsection is quite clear in this regard.  It states that it should be produced not less than one week <Col N="1565" /> before the hearing of the prosecution. If a person was expecting an invoice to arrive all he would have to do in such an eventuality would be to apply for an adjournment of the case.  All reasonable requests for adjournments are granted.</P>
    <P>This obligation is put on the defendant to save him the embarrassment of having to go to court at all. Once he produces the warranty he is guilty of no offence and there will be no question of a court case.  Bringing a person to court, as I said, under this Bill when it becomes law would be bound to be detrimental to his prospects; it certainly would not help his business.  We want to avoid bringing a man to court in circumstances in which he thought that what he was selling was up to standard but, on inspection subsequently, proved to be otherwise.  I believe this amendment is a worthwhile amendment.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>Look at subsection (4).</P>
      <P>If the defendant in any prosecution&mdash;</P>
      <P>that is, therefore, where a prosecution has been taken&mdash;</P>
      <P>for an offence under section 2 of this Act in relation to food proves&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>and &ldquo;proves&rdquo; means there to the satisfaction of the court; it does not mean to the satisfaction of the inspector. <Col N="1566" /> The defendant is called on to prove to the satisfaction of the court and we go from that then to amendment No. 5:</P>
    <P>....that he received the food as being in compliance with the regulations under the said section 2 and with a written warranty to that effect and that he notified the prosecutor of the warranty and its contents not less than one week before the hearing of the prosecution.</P>
    <P>And we go on then to paragraph (b) of the Bill.  If he proves also:</P>
    <P>that he had no reason to believe at the time when he disposed of the food that it did not comply with the said regulations, and</P>
    <P>(c) that the food, when disposed of by him, was in the same state as when he received it,</P>
    <P>then, if he proves to the satisfaction of the court, after he has been prosecuted, each of these three things &ldquo;the defendant shall be discharged from the prosecution....&rdquo;</P>
    <P>With great respect to the Parliamentary Secretary, he is quite in error in the statement he made that all a defendant has to do is come along and show the warranty to the prosecuting inspector and the prosecution is struck out.  That is not so.  It is also not correct to say that if the defendant lays his hand for the first time on the warranty, say, four days before the returnable date of the summons, the date on which the prosecution is to be held, all he has to do is ask for an adjournment and, if he is granted that, he will have shown the thing more than seven days beforehand to the prosecutor and, provided he can prove the various other things he has to prove, he will be discharged.  That, in my submission, is a ridiculous situation.</P>
    <P>If what the Parliamentary Secretary says is right&mdash;happily it is not, but let us assume for the sake of argument that it is right&mdash;one would have the situation that a man who got his case adjourned would get an acquittal, but a man who could not get his case adjourned would be convicted, even though all the facts and circumstances <Col N="1567" /> were exactly the same in the two cases. That is an arbitrary administration of justice of the worst kind because it may be quite simple in some areas to get virtually any case adjourned and it may be very difficult in other areas, as I know myself, to get any case at all adjourned except for the most compelling of reasons.  I am afraid the situation is much more serious than the Parliamentary Secretary believes it to be.  His explanation is a facile one because it is quite clear it is not just enough to waive a warranty in front of the prosecutor and that is an end of it. One has to prove three things under this subsection and may well have to prove three things under the first subsection as well.  He has to prove that he had a written warranty and that he gave it to the prosecutor seven clear days at least before the prosecution. He has also to prove to the satisfaction of the court that the food when disposed of by him was in the same state as when he received it.  These are facts. I have read them out from the section as proposed to be amended.  If the Parliamentary Secretary looks at them, he will realise that the defendant is actually in a worse position than he would be under the section as originally drafted when I took exception to it on Second Stage.  I believe that the Minister had the good intention of amending it but, in so doing, he has made it worse.  All the trouble will be avoided if the Parliamentary Secretary takes my word for it and drops No. 5 and No. 6 and 6a.  They are useless.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelPatMurphy" hpid="Mr. M.P. Murphy Mr. M.P. Murphy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M.P. Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>In most cases the warranty will be available on the date of inspection.  If the owner of the goods can show that he acted in good faith on this warranty, there will be no prosecution so far as he is concerned. If the warranty is not available but becomes available subsequently the prosecution will be withdrawn. There is no trial at all.  Such cases are not usually reported and, therefore, the man would not suffer.  The only person who will suffer is the person who originally sold the goods to him.  Where the warranty may not be available and the inspector is so informed, but is told that it will be produced <Col N="1568" /> subsequently, I have not the slightest doubt but that the inspector will wait to give the owner of the goods an opportunity of producing the warranty. The situation with regard to driving licences is analogous.  If you do not have your driving licence with you, you get ten days in which to produce it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJLalor" hpid="Mr. Lalor Mr. Lalor">

      <P>No prosecution will arise here until after that. If the inspector is told that the waranty will be available later, then the inspector, I have no doubt, will wait until it is available.  No matter from what angle you view it there is no cause for complaint.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DavidAndrews" hpid="Mr. Andrews Mr. Andrews">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Andrews</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree entirely with what Deputy O'Malley said.  The Parliamentary Secretary appears to be confused in relation to what is before the House at the moment and I think he is introducing an element of grave and unfair hardship on the shopowner in this case.  He must realise that a prosecutor does not come into a case until the person is actually prosecuted and that the dealing between the shopowner and the inspector is a dealing in the first instance.  If the inspector then decides that the goods are substandard in the particular shop premises, then the inspector institutes proceedings against that shopowner. The dealings in the first instance is between the inspector on behalf of the Minister and the shopowner.  If the inspector then finds that the goods are substandard he institutes a prosecution. No matter what the Parliamentary Secretary says about the warranty if the warranty is received from the supplier and the shop owner, despite the warranty, finds that the goods are substandard, it seems most unfair that the shop owner should be prosecuted.</P>

      <P>He must be brought before the court, innocent or guilty, and people do not like going to court. It is one of our traits in this country that we try to avoid court proceedings as much as possible.  It seems most unfair that a shopkeeper who, having received substandard goods from a supplier on the foot of a warranty, should be then brought to the court for an offence in which he has to prove his innocence.  That is what the Parliamentary Secretary has said.</P>
      <P>I think Deputy O'Malley has outlined very clearly where the unfairness and hardship comes in for the shopowner.  I would ask the Parliamentary Secretary to have a serious look at the provisions before us. Although I have studied the legislation I have come in to hear the various arguments between Deputy O'Malley and the Parliamentary Secretary. I have no doubt that the Parliamentary Secretary believes his arguments but having heard the two, and I say this without prejudice, I think that Deputy O'Malley's arguments are more reasoned.  The Parliamentary Secretary, being the type of man he is, will accept that it is unfair that the shop owner should be prosecuted, brought before the court despite his innocence, have to prove his innocence on the foot of a prosecution which should never have been brought at all.  That is the unfairness in this legislation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJLalor" hpid="Mr. Lalor Mr. Lalor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lalor</NameTxt>
      <P>I appeal to the Parliamentary Secretary from a peculiar point of view.  I came in to hear him make his reply to Deputy O'Malley. He pointed out that in the event of the defendant notifying the prosecutor of the existence of the warranty not less than a week before the hearing the reasonable inspector can withdraw the proceedings.  That sounded reasonable to me until I read the section.  I am mindful of the fact that both Deputy O'Malley and Deputy Andrews can see this from the legal point of view.  I should like to address myself to the Parliamentary Secretary from the hob law point of view of which both of us have some experience.  Deputy O'Malley also spoke about amendment No. 6 in <Col N="1570" /> relation to amendment No. 5 because one ties in with the other but it strikes me that the operative two lines in the full section are</P>
      <P>If the defendant in any prosecution for an offence under section 2 of this Act in relation to food proves&mdash;</P>
      <P>This is the usual built-in thing in a Bill.  It is establishing what is legitimate defence.  I am speaking without any legal experience but with some little experience of legislation and the preparation of it.  The point Deputy O'Malley was making was that you have to have a prosecution before this can arise.  When one studies the original section that is being deleted, compares it with the substitution and couples that with the three lines that consequently go out, it is quite obvious that when the Minister introduced the Bill he was making the point that the production of the warranty establishing that the food was received in good order was sufficient and that the defendant should be discharged from the prosecution but would have to pay the costs involved if he did not give notice beforehand that this was going to be his defence.  In fact, the Parliamentary Secretary's amendment is to marry the two things together.  There is no question of the inspector who in the first place found the improper foods, as he saw them, having the opportunity of withdrawing it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When we reach subsection (4) the stage is reached where the prosecution has been brought by the Attorney General, maybe through the State Solicitor, and the defendant has actually been charged.  It is legitimate defence for him to offer provided he offers it a week before the case comes up but it would have to be determined in the court.  There was a stage when I would have been under the same misconception as the Parliamentary Secretary.  Here is a very handy job. We have Joe Murphy summoned for having food that does not measure up to standard on his premises and offering it for sale.  When Joe Murphy subsequently having been prosecuted, having been notified that he is to appear in the District Court in Thurles <Col N="1571" /> on a certain date sends in the warranty, his solicitor can go to court at that stage and say: &ldquo;We have complied with all the business.  Our food was quite in order.  We have a warranty to establish it.&rdquo;  At that stage the court has to decide.  This section is here for guidance to the court and I do not think it is a question that the inspector at that stage can withdraw.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelPatMurphy" hpid="Mr. M.P. Murphy Mr. M.P. Murphy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M.P. Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>I am afraid the Deputies on the other side must be living in cloud-cuckoo land.  I will repeat the provisions of the section. Where a person has goods in his premises and has a covering warranty in accordance with regulations, if the goods are found to be substandard the inspector will not prosecute him. Court proceedings will not arise in this case.  I assume that in most cases the warranty would be readily available. Subsection (6) states:</P>
      <P>Where it appears to a person enforcing a particular provision of this Act that an offence has been committed in respect of which proceedings might be taken against some person but that that person could establish a defence under subsection (4) of this section by proving that the offence complained of was due to an act or default of some other person, the person enforcing the said provision may take proceedings against that other person without taking proceedings against the first-mentioned person.</P>
      <P>The &ldquo;first-mentioned person&rdquo; is the person in whose premises the goods are found.  If the goods are substandard and if he has a warranty he is free.  It is the person who sold him the substandard goods under warranty who can be prosecuted.  Once the inspector is satisfied that it was due to a default by some other person, that person can be prosecuted in accordance with the law but no proceedings can be taken against the first person by virtue of having the warranty.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is no question of prosecuting a man who buys goods in good faith, which are subsequently found to be substandard, and who is covered by a warranty.  In this case the inspector has <Col N="1572" /> no power to prosecute.  The regulations will be set out clearly for the enforcing officers.  The inspector will inquire who was the seller of the substandard goods and any prosecution likely to arise will be against the seller of the goods, not the buyer.</P>

      <P>We are here to debate the matter.  As Deputy O'Malley has pointed out, the innocent man has to go to court to prove his innocence. If the first-mentioned person is found to be innocent, I assume the inspector prosecutes the supplier.  That seems to be a very involved process of law, a most unreasonable and unfair process.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Andrews</NameTxt>
      <P>That is so, but we are also discussing subsection (6) of section 7.  The Parliamentary Secretary has not replied to Deputy O'Malley's reasonable comments, and neither has he answered the point I have raised. There is no answer to it unless an amendment is brought in or the subsection is deleted.  If that is not done we could be sitting here for a long time.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M.P. Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>I have made the position clear as far as my side of the argument is concerned.  We are not trying to prosecute people by way of this legislation.  We are trying to make the legislation known to the public.  In any case, I am sure that 95 per cent of the people comply with the standards already and we are dealing with a relatively small section.  However, in order to measure up to international requirements and to let the buyers of our food know we have high standards obtaining here we must have this legislation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If a person is covered by a warranty there is no question of his being prosecuted <Col N="1573" /> just because substandard goods are found on his premises.  The same kind of situation arises for law-enforcing officers every day where they think an offence has been committed.  If a valid and justifiable excuse is given, irrespective of the nature of the offence, that settles the matter.  The same thing will happen here.  I do not visualise many cases being brought to court because I am satisfied business people will meet all the requirements.  The Deputies opposite have been living in fantasy land, telling us what will happen when this Bill is passed.  I do not think anything out of place will happen.</P>

I would point out we are dealing with amendments Nos. 5, 6 and 6a, all of which arise out of subsection (4).  This subsection deals with prosecutions that have been initiated and with situations arising therefrom.  All this ráiméis we got from the Parliamentary Secretary about how inspectors will not prosecute people if they show indemnity is totally irrelevant.  What we are talking about are situations where a prosecution has been taken, not cases where a prosecution has not been taken.</P>

If a prosecution has been initiated there is only one way, so far as production of a warranty is concerned, whereby the defendant can get it dismissed.  He has to prove the three things set out in this subsection as proposed to be amended.  One of the things he has to prove is that he produced the warranty more than seven days before the date of the court.</P>

It may frequently happen&mdash;and I think the Parliamentary Secretary admitted this&mdash;that the man may not get the warranty until after that time if he is waiting, for example, for invoices and warranties from abroad.  This is what I think is reprehensible and the Parliamentary Secretary's plámás cannot get around it.  We could then have a situation in which the warranty is produced which clears the man but, because it is not produced seven clear days before the court hearing, the court has to convict him even though the court knows he is innocent.

      <P>I do not think the Parliamentary Secretary is taking this matter seriously enough.  He is suggesting that we introduce legislation into this House for a bit of &ldquo;gas&rdquo; and that it will not actually be implemented. If a man is convicted under this subsection he has to prove three things.  The Parliamentary Secretary's attitude is: &ldquo;Well, it will not be enforced.  It is there but it will not be enforced.&rdquo;</P>

      <P>I always seem to be in difficulty when I stand up in this House.  I do not wish to be contentious. We are trying to argue this on a reasoned basis.  Deputy O'Malley has argued it very reasonably and the Parliamentary Secretary has accused him of being in happy-happy land, or in a fantasy land, or some such expression.  That is a very unfair comment having regard to the articulate manner in which Deputy O'Malley put forward his proper point of view. The strength of Deputy O'Malley's case is quite clearly borne out by the section.  If the person fails to produce the warranty seven days before the actual court hearing, as the Parliamentary Secretary said&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>The district justice then has to interpret this piece of very bad law.  It is a dangerous piece of legislation.  The Parliamentary Secretary has said: &ldquo;Well, of course it will not happen that way.&rdquo;  It must happen that way.  If it does not happen that way we should not be discussing it here.  It should not be in the section.  It should be withdrawn from the section.  I would seriously urge the Parliamentary Secretary to take that view.  We are here as Dáil Deputies legislating, not for our own joy and benefit, but for the people who put us here as public representatives. We are responsible to them as their legislators for the type of legislation which passes through the House.</P>
      <P>The Parliamentary Secretary's attitude to the arguments put forward by Deputy O'Malley, Deputy Lalor and myself has been most unreasonable. It is a piece of dangerous unreason, if I may put it that way, for the Parliamentary Secretary to say we are in cloud-cuckooland.  We are protecting the people against bad legislation and against the type of thinking which led to this type of legislation being introduced. I seriously urge the Parliamentary Secretary to reflect on the arguments made by the Opposition in the interests of good legislation.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>Before the amendment is put, could I just sum up the situation as we find it now?  We have endeavoured to explain the situation to the Parliamentary Secretary.  It should, of course, be the other way round, but it happens that this is what we have to do.  It is a pity that that is so.  We have endeavoured to explain <Col N="1577" /> the position.  We have explained it coherently so that anybody who was prepared to listen would understand it and see that the situation is as we have stated it to be.  It is bad; it is foolish; it is dangerous.</P>
      <P>The combination of amendments here is bringing about a situation which, I should imagine, does far more than those who thought of the amendments originally intended to do. They will have a ridiculous effect and a very unfair effect.  They will produce a section or a subsection which will be ludicrous.  If any court is asked to enforce it, it will immediately provoke the comment: &ldquo;What in the Name of God were the Oireachtas doing when they passed this law?&rdquo;</P>
      <P>We cannot put it any more clearly than we have.  We have convinced everybody, with the possible exception of the Parliamentary Secretary, that what we say is correct and that this will have a disastrous effect.  We cannot put it beyond that.  We can only divide the House on that matter, not because we want to divide the House, but because we have a duty to do all that is legal within our power to try to stop something which is patently wrong and patently bad.  There are no politics in this.  It is technical.  It is not worth twopence except that it is wrong in principle that this House should consciously and deliberately pass something which it knows is wrong.  All I can do is draw to the attention of the House the fact that it is wrong, that there is no doubt that it is wrong and, if the House wants to put this on the statute books by people walking through the division lobbies like automatons, at least we will have done our duty and that is all we can do.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickJLalor" hpid="Mr. Lalor Mr. Lalor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lalor</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to reverse the argument which the Parliamentary Secretary used a few moments ago. He quoted subsection (6) as being an example of a situation in which a given shopkeeper does not necessarily have to be prosecuted for having food which does not measure up to the <Col N="1578" /> standard on his premises but that the person who supplied him may be prosecuted. The subsection provides &ldquo;...that an offence has been committed in respect of which proceedings might be taken against some person...&rdquo; He used that as the safety valve in relation to subsection (4) (a) which we are discussing.  There is no question in subsection (4) (a) and the amendment that proceedings might be taken.  It is a question of where proceedings are taken.</P>
      <P>In addition to that, I find a blatant mistake in the arrangements which the Parliamentary Secretary feels he is making under this in so far as if a shopkeeper has the warranty there is no advantage to be gained by him in presenting it to the inspector in the first instance.  Very often one will have a shopkeeper who is at war with the Department and the Department inspector. In this instance, if food is found to be of wrong standard and he has the warranty in his desk, he need not produce it.  If the Parliamentary Secretary is right in his assessment of what is in the section, the shopkeeper who has food which turns out to be wrong but for which he has a warranty can hold that warranty until such time as the State goes through the full rigours, prosecutes him and notifies him that he is to be represented or he is charged to appear at, say, Thurles Court on such and such a date.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>According to the Parliamentary Secretary, a week before that date&mdash; when the State has gone to considerable expense and carried out quite an amount of investigation&mdash;he presents his warranty saying that everything was in order when he received it.  I do not think that sort of thing should be encouraged.  That is the manner in which the Parliamentary Secretary presents his case.  He gets off scot-free provided he is able to produce this warranty within a week of court proceedings.  I do not think that is the intention.  The original presentation of the Bill and what the amendment seems to be aiming at is to try to get in that defence before the actual court hearing takes place in order, I suppose, to relieve the State of the possibility of having to <Col N="1579" /> send in witnesses.  That is the only thing it could do because the case must come up.</P>
    <P>I would agree with Deputy O'Malley that it does appear useless for us to endeavour to point out that there is something very wrong here. I think the fault lies with the parliamentary draftsmen who presented the Parliamentary Secretary and his Minister <Col N="1580" /> with this legislation which is out of order.</P>

      <P>There may be different circumstances governing the transport of particular foods.

      <P>I am surprised that the Deputy has so much difficulty in following this.  If a person has a contract of service to remove <Col N="1583" /> food from point A to point B and if the food is deemed to be substandard when inspected by an enforcement officer, it is a good defence for him to say that his side of the business was confined to the haulage and that he hauled the food in accordance with the standards laid down and that he is in no way responsible for the fact that the food is deemed to be substandard on inspection.</P>

    <Speaker pid="VivionDeValera" hpid="Major de Valera Major de Valera">
      <NameTxt>Major de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>Presumably at some stage this will be queried and a prosecution issued in which this alleged offence could be set out.  This defence can only relate to the transport or storage of that food and if I start to set up a defence, immediately I do, whatever my defence might be, say, in transport the container was damaged and water got in or something like that&mdash;it does not matter what it is&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Major de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>I think that is the kind of defence I should try to set up, that it was not my fault, but then I am faced with the words of the section that I have to show that that defence does not relate to either the conditions or the circumstances in which it was transported or stored and straight away I cannot raise that defence.  This does not make sense. This is not a question of trying to get words.  It is a question of common sense.  The Parliamentary Secretary should give a concrete case and let us see how this defence can be set up. It seems to me that whatever defence is put up the fact that it does not relate to the actual conditions under which or the circumstances in which the food is transported and stored, nothing else can be brought in if all that is excluded.  In my view the Parliamentary Secretary has something to answer there.</P>

      <P>If, by virtue of his contract, he is obliged to transport the goods in a certain way, for instance in a refrigerated van, and he does not do so and he is found by the enforcement officer not to have carried out the transport under the <Col N="1584" /> terms of his contract he is guilty of an offence.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="VivionDeValera" hpid="Major de Valera Major de Valera">
      <NameTxt>Major de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>He has to show that the transport or storage was effected under a contract for service between him and the defendant.  The contract of service could not protect him unless it was explicit.  It is hard to know what the Parliamentary Secretary is getting at in this section. He is trying to give some kind of defence on the basis that there is some kind of a contract there.  It appears that what the Parliamentary Secretary wants to say is that if the defendant is transporting under a contract and is observing the terms of the contract he could not know that there was something wrong with the food, for instance food conveyed in a sealed container, and he would have a defence.  Assuming that there is something like that there how can it be when you state that it must not relate either to the conditions or the circumstances under which it is transported and stored when the whole essence of the thing is either a condition or circumstances of storage? That makes this amendment a contradiction in its own terms and it seems to be nearly a factious piece of legislation, not alone one that is not understandable.</P>
      <P>If the Parliamentary Secretary is aiming to do something positive will he tell us what it is and, perhaps, between us we will be able to do something positive and find some formula that will be an improvement on the draft before us?</P>

If a person hires a transport man to take food under certain conditions and if this man fails to observe such conditions, for instance the conveyance of such food in a refrigerated van, that man is guilty of an offence.

      <P>While a lot of time has been spent on these amendments, one must put on record that the section, as amended, is probably worse than the section was before it was amended.  I hope that in the calmer atmosphere of the Department of Agriculture and Fisheries this section <Col N="1586" /> will be looked at again.  In particular, subsection (4) (a) of section 7 as it now stands is seriously wrong and there is no question about that.  I hope that when the amended section is printed something might be done in respect of it.  Subsection (3) is very unsatisfactory because of the fact that it, with three other subsections, transfers the serious onus of proof on to the defendant to such an extent that the accumulative effect of the whole four are that in many instances it may be very difficult for an innocent man to avoid being convicted.  It is only right, however, that we should put on record that we are far from happy with this section.  I do not know that there is much to be gained from trying to pursue the matter any further.</P>

      <P>In page 2, between lines 17 and 18, to insert the following: &ldquo;place' includes a city, town or locality.&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>On Second Stage there was some discussion on the word &ldquo;place&rdquo;.  It was suggested that &ldquo;place&rdquo; was a little too restricted.  After further discussion with the draftsman I decided that &ldquo;place&rdquo; implied in effect a reference to a city, town or locality and that this should be written into the Bill to ensure there would be no doubt about the matter.  That is the purpose of this amendment.  It is designed to remove any doubt regarding the definition of &ldquo;place&rdquo; and clearly indicate the full scope of the provision.  The amendment is designed to prevent any attempt by an employer to re-assign his workers to different establishments within a particular city, town or locality and thus avoid his obligation to give them equal pay.  That was a possibility in the definition as originally framed.  By this amendment that possibility is eliminated.  The intention is that entitlement to equal pay will arise in respect of all employment by the same employer in a particular city, town or locality.  It does not, of course, refer to regional pay factors.</P>

      <P>The difference between the Minister's amendment and the amendment in my name is that in my amendment &ldquo;place&rdquo; means any city, town or other geographical area. In the Minister's amendment &ldquo;place&rdquo; means a city, town or locality.  Is the Minister satisfied &ldquo;locality&rdquo; is the proper term to use?  Is it broad enough to cover the definition of &ldquo;place&rdquo;? I believe it is a little too narrow.  The Minister might consider the wider term &ldquo;geographical area&rdquo;.

I think the Deputy is trying to achieve the same thing and the advice available to me would suggest that it is more clearly defined in the amendment here and that the term &ldquo;geographical area&rdquo; would give rise to difficulties of interpretation.</P>

It was suggested the last day that in the original Bill &ldquo;by the same employer&rdquo; was unduly restrictive and we were anxious to see that it would not be so restrictive.

    <P>Roughly, that is the intent of section 3 (c) and it is in keeping with the corresponding recommendation of the commission.  Representations were made that equal value should be included in the subsection and that is why the amendment was proposed.  It was our intention in the wording of the Bill and it has been represented to me that it would strengthen the intention in the original wording to spell it out here.

      <P>A certain type of work can create a demand on one person while the same work can create a greater demand on another.  If everyone claims he is working as hard as the next person, an unskilled labourer could be entitled to the same pay as a tradesman or another person on the grounds of the demands made on both people.

The equal value definition must be supplemented by a further clarification, as is done here.  This follows the lines of the report of the Commission on the Status of Women and section 3 (c) is <Col N="1595" /> in the direction of the demands they made.  Section 3 (c) is for the purpose of widening the scope of the Bill to include as many as possible.  The demand is not restrictive; it is the reverse, in that it extends it.  One must not forget that there will be job valuation officers who will adjudicate in the area of demand.  It would weaken the legislation if section 3 (c) were dropped.</P>

      <P>5.  (1) Where after the commencement of this Act an agreement to which this section applies contains a provision in which differences in rates of remuneration are based on or related to the sex of employees, such a provision shall be null and void.</P>
      <P>(2) This section applies to&mdash;</P>
      <P>(a)  a collective agreement made after the commencement of this Act,</P>
      <P>(b)  an employment regulation order within the meaning of Part IV of the Industrial Relations Act, 1946, made after the commencement of this Act.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>(c)  a registered employment agreement within the meaning of Part III of the Industrial Relations Act, 1946, registered in the Register of Employment Agreements after the commencement of this Act, and <Col N="1596" /> (d)  an order made by the Agricultural Wages Board under section 17 of the Agricultural Wages Act, 1936, after the commencement of this Act.</P>
    <P>This provides that with regard to collective agreements, registered agreements, employment regulation orders and any orders made, for instance, by the Agricultural Wages Board, after the commencement of this legislation if rates of pay are mentioned in the registered agreements, based on differences of sex, they could not be included in such regulations or orders.  It has been represented to me that it would be physically impossible for the unions and the employers to amend all collective agreements to delete all references to payments based on sex differences, by 31st December, 1975, as there are many thousands of collective agreements up and down the country.  The negotiation of agreements often involves long discussions. There would be the whole question of reclassification based on the terms of this legislation dealing with work of equal value.  This section makes illegal any payments in such collective agreements based on sex differences after December, 1975.  That is the intent of this section.</P>

      <P>We accept the amendment.  The Minister indicated that trade unions would have difficulty if this section were not in the Bill.  I agree with that point of view. Where there is pressure from trade unionists to debar women from taking certain jobs, certain types of employment, can the Minister say will this section cover that aspect?  In the bar trade women are not allowed behind the counter.  Is this section strong enough to cover discrimination against women apart from the question of pay?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>The question raised by the Deputy is important but it does not arise on the section. This section will outlaw any wage assessment based on the grounds of sex alone.  The definition in the Bill will apply with full force.  Any payments made in such agreements must <Col N="1597" /> be based on the definition of work of equal value, together with supplementary provisions in the legislation, equal demands, and so on.  We are setting up a job evaluation service. The matter raised by the Deputy will have to be settled.  I have already intimated that legislation will follow in the general area of discrimination to open up jobs to women which were traditional male preserves.  This is an essential element in uplifting the position of women in industry.  This outlaws any payments based on sex.  It does not debar any woman from a particular job.  Later legislation, and the whole question of training facilities for women, will change the situation where women are not in certain key jobs in Irish industry.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JosephDowling" hpid="Mr. Dowling Mr. Dowling">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dowling</NameTxt>
      <P>While the Bill covers equal pay for females, surely if there is no section to permit females to take up employment which will increase their income, they are still being discriminated against.  It is desirable that that should be covered in the Bill. With the implementation of equal pay there will be reshuffles throughout the industrial sector and the office sector. In those reshuffles I hope there will be no downgrading of females.  They should be permitted to upgrade themselves if that is possible.  Up to now certain skilled trades and others have been reluctant to allow females to enter trades or sectors where they could improve their income.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If the Bill deprives a female of the opportunity to advance herself and does not protect her against objections which may be made by male workers, it is fairly defective.  The Minister should consider inserting protection for her.  There will be a reshuffle. Efforts will be made to downgrade females.  Efforts will be made by females to upgrade themselves.  If the Minister can give us an assurance that the trade unions will not impede women who wish to advance themselves and thereby increase their remuneration, we can move on.  There is the serious defect at the moment that females are prevented from advancing themselves on the basis that <Col N="1598" /> skilled male labour feel that it would erode their position.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy has raised a very serious problem.  With his co-operation I propose later this year&mdash;certainly before this Bill comes into effect in December, 1975&mdash;to introduce legislation dealing with unfair dismissals and to prevent discrimination in employment.  It will legislate for the recruitment, promotion and training of women in industry.  This legislation deals purely with equal pay which is only a limited area of the discrimination practised against women in Irish industry.  The other matters must be rectified before women can be said to have a fair deal in their work places.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JosephDowling" hpid="Mr. Dowling Mr. Dowling">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dowling</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister consider covering this loophole in this Bill?  Surely this should be a fairly comprehensive Bill.  Experience abroad has been that, when equal pay legislation was introduced, there was a tendency to down-grade females and divert them into dead-end jobs, or jobs which did not pay rates suitable to their talents.  In some continental countries the workers were responsible.  When we are legislating for equal pay, we should have the necessary provisions to meet that situation in the knowledge that it has happened before and that protection is desirable and necessary.  Before the Bill goes through the House perhaps the Minister will see if this aspect could be covered.  It is quite possible that some situation may develop throughout the year which would prevent the other legislation going through the House.  Therefore, it is desirable that, in this Bill, females should have this form of protection which the Minister and I feel is necessary.  I think this is the Bill in which to do it.  If it is anti-discriminatory, then it must be anti-discriminatory even against workers who will tend to deprive them of advancement.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No.11:</P>
      <P>To delete subsection (4) (a) (i), line 36, and substitute &ldquo;(i) enter premises having given reasonable notice of his intention to do so&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>The Bill as it stands says: &ldquo;(i) at all reasonable times enter premises,&rdquo;. What might be reasonable in the view of an equal pay officer may not necessarily be reasonable in the view of employers.  It could be a week-end.  It is unlike the entering of a premises for the purpose of ascertaining whether or not a person was being unfairly treated.  It is unlike factory inspectors entering a premises to see a situation as it develops under working conditions.  Here it is a question of examining books and entries to ensure that the claims may satisfy the equal pay officer.  I think it reasonable that one be given reasonable notice of an equal pay officer's intention to visit because it would be necessary to have available records and documents and, in some cases, it might be futile for him to enter a premises if those records and documents were not available.  If one gave an employer reasonable notice, I do not think one would lose anything.  It might be more reasonable and to the advantage of the equal pay officer to give that notice.  I do not think at that stage books or records could be altered to make any difference to the situation.</P>
      <P>It is very different if one wants to examine working conditions as, say, in the case of a factory inspector.  I feel it would add to the Bill and be of assistance to the equal pay officer if some notice were given to the employer to have such documentation available when he arrives.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOLeary" hpid="Mr. M. O'Leary Mr. M. O'Leary">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>The intent of this section is to guard against the very thing about which the Deputy was worried in the previous section, that is, that women's positions might be endangered or that further unfair things might be done to the conditions <Col N="1600" /> of women in industry.  The Deputy will well understand that if reasonable notice was given in the case of an employer&mdash;an employer who may in fact have been dealing in an unfair way with the pay and conditions of women&mdash;then that would reduce the effectiveness of the equal pay officer's visit.  Those are the powers sought here for the equal pay officer.  They are broadly similar to those given to inspectors under the Industrial Relations Act, those inspectors who are there to carry out employment regulation orders.</P>
      <P>I think the amendment proposed by the Deputy would reduce the effectiveness of the equal pay officers investigations if they were required to give notice of their visits to an erring employer.  The amendment would not be helpful to the effectiveness of those officers or to the women whose claims they would be out to protect.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JosephDowling" hpid="Mr. Dowling Mr. Dowling">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dowling</NameTxt>
      <P>Surely it is a question of having documentation available. Probably the equal pay officer would be confronted with the trade union officials, shop stewards and the worker.  I do not think anything would be lost.  In fact it might be to the advantage of the equal pay officer, the persons concerned, and their union representative, that they would have all the necessary documentation available rather than go to a premises where there was none available and where they had to listen to a verbal coverage of the situation.  I think it more desirable that one would have even this slight delaying factor. It is not intended in any way to diminish the authority of the equal pay officer but rather to ensure that, when the employer is confronted by the equal pay officer, the necessary documentation will be available.  If it is a case in relation to equal pay, it will be the documentation of the type of work in which a person has participated over a period that would be in question rather than investigating what was the situation at that given moment because, at that given moment, it would be likely that the person who brought the complaint might well be doing a different job from that which she had been doing <Col N="1601" /> in the previous year or two years or whatever may be the period in question.  For that reason, it is desirable to ensure that everything be available from the point of view of the worker, the trade union and the equal pay officer.  It would be in everybody's interests to ensure that all necessary documentation be available in order that they might have a full confrontation and discussion on the matter rather than conduct the case on a verbal basis, as might arise if the present subsection were carried.</P>

      <P>The Deputy may rest assured this is not some dangerous precedent; the right enshrined here of calling on such missions is provided in previous industrial relations legislation.  This will not be a threat to good employers.  Obviously, there will be ample reason for the visit of such an equal pay officer.  Visits will be mainly to people whom the equal pay officer has reason to believe are not fulfilling their obligations under this legislation.  Therefore, this discretion of the equal pay officer would be essential to his effectiveness.  We must also ensure that no employer may, with equanimity, break the law in this area.  Providing that equal pay officers in general would give forward notice of such visits would obviously undermine the effectiveness of their whole role and their function as an important element in the effectiveness of this legislation.  They are there as the executive representatives, to see that the law is carried out in this area.  They are there also to be the advocates of the person who seeks the equal pay enshrined in this legislation. It would certainly cut out their effectiveness had they to forewarn erring employers.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JosephDowling" hpid="Mr. Dowling Mr. Dowling">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dowling</NameTxt>
      <P>I take it, then, that an equal pay officer will just arrive at a premises.  He will not be concerned with documentation or in requiring an employer to furnish all the documentation necessary to prove that a person has been employed in a particular job over a period.  Rather, he will go into a premises and be satisfied with a verbal explanation by the employer.</P>

      <P>As stated in subsection (4) (a) (ii) he may ask the person in charge of the premises to produce to him any records, books, or documents.  Of course, generally he would not ask for such things unless he had reasonable grounds for so doing; if he was not already in possession of certain facts or had had an appeal about a certain area.  These equal pay officers will not be going to people at midnight and will not be unreasonable.  The reason it is built into the enactment here is to have sufficient safeguard against any abuse of the right conferred on the equal pay officer of this kind of entry.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 12:</P>
      <P>In subsection (4) (a) (ii), lines 37 and 38, to delete &ldquo;any person who appears to him to be in charge of the premises&rdquo; and substitute &ldquo;an employer or his nominee&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>This rather peculiar section requires:</P>
      <P>...any person who appears to him to be in charge of the premises to produce to him any records, books or documents in the person's power or control and which the officer has reasonable grounds for believing to contain information of the kind so required and to give him such information as he may reasonably require in regard to any entries in any such records, books or documents,</P>
      <P>The equal pay officer requires &ldquo;any person who appears to him to be in charge of the premises&rdquo;.  This is a very dangerous situation.  Any person who appears to him to be in charge of the premises could be the night watchman, the charwoman or anybody else.  If they appear to him to be in charge of the premises, they will have to produce the documentation he re-requires.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I feel this needs amendment.  I think the amendment suggested here whoever the nominee is, whether it be <Col N="1603" /> the manager or the personnel officer, is the person who should be regarded as being in charge.  The section is very vague.  The first person who appears to the pay officer entering the premises to be the person in charge could be asked to produce the books and documents.  It may well be that person could be a very junior person.  Surely it is reasonable that the person the equal pay officer would require the documentation from would be a responsible person.  Such a person would be responsible for the entries and for the bookkeeping arrangement in that premises rather than the person who just appeared to be in charge whether it is the charwoman, the doorkeeper or even the night watchman.  The Minister should have another look at this particular subsection.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOLeary" hpid="Mr. M. O'Leary Mr. M. O'Leary">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>The provision in the Bill in this area is more or less similar to the legislation I referred to in the case of the right of the officer to enter at reasonable times without forewarning.  The provision here is similar to the legislation I quoted and in defence of that right there is in section 52 of the Industrial Relations Act, 1946 a similar provision as that instanced here.  It is, for the Deputy's information, often difficult in the case of employers who are not living up to their obligations to ensure that they leave somebody on the premises with authority to act for them.  Inspectors in my Department have gone out to ensure that people were being paid wages according to law under various employment regulation orders&mdash;I will not mention the industry&mdash;in several parts of the country and they have been fobbed off again and again by the employers not being at home.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is possible for an employer not to be at home for many months or even for years with the officer having to call again and again.  This provision is necessary to ensure that nobody can make a mockery of the law in this vital area of a person's right.  I agree with what the Deputy says that we know of instances where the officer has, in fact, mistaken the night watchman for the employer.  In most cases his recognition is very acute. This provision ensures that he meets <Col N="1604" /> the genuine employer after a few visits, whereas without it the possibility would exist that he could be calling at the same place for a number of years.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JosephDowling" hpid="Mr. Dowling Mr. Dowling">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dowling</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister compared this Bill with other legislation but it must stand on its own.  We could compare it with the Banks Bill, where the banker could not be jailed but the doorkeeper, the night watchman or the charwoman could be jailed if they impeded the person entering the premises.  If this is the phraseology used in other legislation it is bad.  It should be more clearly defined so that one can identify the person who is in charge.  The best dressed man in the concern could be the night watchman.  If it appears to the person entering the premises that the best dressed man there is the person in charge there is confusion. You have to spell out that it must be an official of the particular concern who will produce the documentation. I do not know how one would interpret &ldquo;appears to be&rdquo;.  If one person comes into the concern in a car and the other person comes in a bus, does it mean that the person who comes in the car is the person he asks for the books?  This needs some clarification.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOLeary" hpid="Mr. M. O'Leary Mr. M. O'Leary">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>It contains the proviso that he merely asks that particular person to produce those documents in that person's power.  It is not likely that the night watchman or the porter will be able to go to the director's office and take from it something appertaining to the control of that particular place of employment. He could not do that unless he was a very well-placed porter.  The only reason I mentioned previous legislation was to disabuse the Deputy that anything new is being sought here in this legislation.  This requirement is in simply because out of the experience of the Department's officers in this area it is necessary.  I can assure the Deputy that we have not any evidence, under any legislation where this power is given to officers, either in payment regulation orders or anywhere else, that this particular <Col N="1605" /> power is abused or instances where this matter has been questioned.</P>

We must give discretion to the officer involved here.  This discretion is amply given in legislation of this kind going back over many years.  The need has been confirmed by the experience of this kind of legislation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJLalor" hpid="Mr. Lalor Mr. Lalor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lalor</NameTxt>
      <P>I fully support Deputy Dowling in this matter.  When the Minister introduced this Bill he described it as a revolutionary type of legislation.  He had to give it a special name to distinguish it from any other legislation that went through this House previously.  He said he needed to remove any comparison it may have had with Fianna Fáil promoted legislation.  We now find there is a vagueness about this.</P>
      <P>It seems to me that the most convenient person that the equal pay officer could decide appeared to him to be in charge of a premises where he wanted to carry out the investigation would be the clerk typist.  The Minister earlier said that equal pay officers were likely to be reasonable people and would not visit premises at 12 o'clock at night with the result that the night watchman was the most unlikely person he would meet, apart from his disinclination to meet the security dog.  The most convenient way for the equal pay officer to get his work done would be to decide that the person who appeared to him to be in charge of the premises was the clerk typist who would appear to him to have control over the records, books and documents he was looking for.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Dowling's amendment gives the equal pay officer the right to require <Col N="1606" /> the employer or his nominee to produce the documents required. It is very legitimate for the equal pay officer to arrive at a business premises and to ask who is in charge. I presume, even under existing legislation, he probably has to do this. Anybody purporting to say that he is in charge is acting on behalf of the employer.  There is no reason why this question should arise of the man who suggests he is in charge against the word of the equal pay officer who, perhaps, decides a certain man is not in charge and selects a different man, perhaps the best-dressed one.  In many good progressive businesses I know, the employer or the man in charge is not the best dressed person on the premises.  Deputy Dowling's amendment seems extremely logical. Leaving it to the equal pay officer's discretion as to who is the man in charge is a little too much.  I accept that, perhaps, so far everything has worked out conveniently.  That happened in regard to the Adoption Act until this week.  It may not be the best practice to copy from previous legislation which may not be as extensively used as I presume the Minister hopes this will be.  There may well be an escape clause which Deputy Dowling's amendment endeavours to cover.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOLeary" hpid="Mr. M. O'Leary Mr. M. O'Leary">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>There is no danger of the kind of situation that the Deputy has mentioned arising.  It is possible for any legislation to be questioned in court at any time but the person who would have to answer the queries of the officer involved in these inquiries would have to be in a position to produce any records, books or documents in the person's power or control.  That is a specific limitation in relation to the person with no authority in the firm. Instead of this, Deputy Dowling in his amendment, wants to substitute &ldquo;an employer or his nominee&rdquo;.  This would give a let-out to an employer who did not want to co-operate because he would have to designate somebody specifically and if he were not anxious to meet an equal pay officer and did not specifically nominate <Col N="1607" /> somebody to act in his place this section of the Bill would be nugatory.  That is why it is important that the section should remain as it is.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JosephDowling" hpid="Mr. Dowling Mr. Dowling">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dowling</NameTxt>
      <P>If the phrasing of the amendment is not suitable, surely it is reasonable to ask the Minister to consider rephrasing the subsection later.  I think that the wording &ldquo;who appears to him to be in charge of the premises to produce to him any records, books or documents in the person's power or control....&rdquo; could mean any person as Deputy Lalor said, such as a clerk typist, any person who would have the right to enter the premises.  Such a person would have everything under his control, including equipment.  The section is vague and needs some clarification.  Otherwise, an unfair onus is placed on the equal pay officer as well as on the person he directly confronts and asks to produce documents.  It could cause embarrassment and possibly the dismissal of a person who was not in charge and who released documents which he was not entitled to release. The question of authority is a big consideration.  I would not favour letting the employer off the hook in any way or weakening the Bill in any way.  It must be strengthened and clear and concise wording is the best way to achieve this.  If the wording of my amendment is not adequate, I shall agree with the Minister if he undertakes to examine the subsection again with a view to eliminating &ldquo;who appears to him to be in charge&rdquo; and introduces something more definite.  I think that the equal pay officers themselves would like more precise guidance.  This vagueness should not be found in this or any other legislation.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>To delete subsection (4) (b), lines <Col N="1608" /> 48 to 54, and substitute the following:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;(b) Any person who obstructs or impedes an equal pay officer in the exercise of his powers under this subsection or does not comply with a requirement of an equal pay officer under this subsection or any person who orders, directs, instructs or urges such obstruction, impeding or non-compliance, shall be guilty of an offence under this section and shall be liable on summary conviction to a fine not exceeding £100 or on conviction on indictment to a fine not exceeding £1,000.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I do not think the Minister's subsection is strong enough.  Very often it is not the person directly involved who is really responsible.  He may be urged on by somebody up the line.  The original subsection is weak in that regard.  If a person is urged or directed to do something, it is unfair that the person giving the direction to impede the work of an equal pay officer should get away scot-free while the person carrying out the instructions of the employer would be held to be guilty.  I believe the section requires to be strengthened so as to ensure that those who act behind the scenes and who are just as culpable as the person carrying out the instructions will not escape.  The person who urges or directs, if this can be proved, is the person who should be convicted, not the person who carries out the instruction.</P>

      <P>I have discussed and examined the amendment and I have come to the conclusion that the section as drafted is adequate because any person who orders, directs, instructs or urges obstruction is, in fact, obstructing, impeding and failing to comply.  I have taken advice on the matter and the amendment appears to be unnecessary.  As it stands, the section encompasses the sort of action sought by the Deputy.</P>

That person who is directing him or instructing him would be guilty to a greater extent and he is not referred to.  In my view the section is not broad enough to deal with this particular aspect.  As the Minister is aware, many people are urged and directed to do certain things by others behind the scenes in relation to officers who may be attending at the business whether they are factory inspectors or equal pay officers.</P>
      <P>In my view they are the guilty people and not the person who is carrying out their instructions.  I should like to draw the attention of the Minister to other legislation passed in the House where the person at the top is immune while the person one the bottom rung is the victim if he carries out the instructions of his employer.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 14:</P>
      <P>In page 4, to delete line 32 and substitute the following:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(c) (i) A hearing under this subsection shall be held in private, but the Court shall, if requested to do so by a party to the dispute, hold the hearing in public.</P>
      <P>(ii) Where a hearing under this subsection is being held in public the Court may, if it is satisfied that any part of the hearing concerns a matter that should, in the interests of any party to the dispute, be treated as confidential, hold that part of the hearing in private.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>This amendment provides that an appeal to the Labour Court under this section shall be in private with provision for public hearings at the request of one or both of the parties as provided under the Industrial Relations Act, 1969.  In the course of the debate on Second Stage the question of public hearings was raised by a number of Deputies, including Deputy Dowling, and Deputy Dowling has an amendment, No. 15, to this effect.  I indicated then that I would be prepared to give the matter further consideration and I have brought forward my amendment to meet the observation of Deputy Dowling.</P>

    <P>It was brought to my notice that under the Bill as drafted originally a problem could arise where an employer fails to comply within a period of two months with an order of the Labour Court directing him to give a woman employee equal pay; he will be guilty of an offence.  Section 7 (3), provides that a party to a dispute determined by the court may appeal to the High Court on a point of law. A situation could arise in which the hearing of such an appeal could take longer than two months and the employer could, in theory, in those circumstances, had he not obeyed the Labour Court order, be deemed to have committed an offence even though the matter was under appeal to another court.  The purpose of this amendment is to avoid the possibility of an injustice being done to the employer in such circumstances.  Where an appeal to the High Court takes longer than two months he will not be guilty of an offence until the appeal has been decided.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 17:</P>
      <P>In page 5, after line 13, to insert the following new paragraph:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;(c) (i) Where on a conviction for an offence under this section the court is satisfied that a person (in this paragraph referred to as the plaintiff) would be entitled to recover in a civil action arrears of remuneration, the court may, if it thinks fit and the plaintiff present or represented consents, impose on the convicted person in addition to any other punishment, a fine not exceeding the amount which in the opinion of the court the plaintiff would be entitled to recover against <Col N="1614" /> the convicted person in respect of such arrears of remuneration.</P>
    <P>(ii) The amount of a fine imposed under subparagraph (i) shall be paid to the plaintiff.</P>
    <P>(iii) The payment by a convicted person of a fine imposed under subparagraph (i) shall be a good defence to any civil action brought by the plaintiff in respect of the arrears of remuneration referred to in that subparagraph.</P>
    <P>(iv) Without prejudice to any right of appeal by any other person, the plaintiff shall have a right of appeal limited to the amount of the fine, either (as the case may be) to the High Court or to the judge of the Circuit Court in whose circuit the district (or any part thereof) of the Justice of the District Court by whom the fine was imposed is situated, and the decision on such an appeal shall be final.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>This amendment covers an employer who refuses to obey a Labour Court order to give equal pay to a woman employee; he will be guilty of an offence and be punished accordingly. In the original draft a woman, in order to recover arrears of remuneration, would have to take a civil action in the courts.  There would be duality of action and this amendment is designed to avoid that situation by providing that in a prosecution for an offence under the section the court may award to the woman concerned the arrears of remuneration she would have received had she instituted civil proceedings.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>Where a woman is dismissed because she sought equal pay she can, under the provisions of this Bill, have recourse to the Labour Court or the ordinary civil courts.  The purpose of the amendment is to provide that a woman so dismissed can only go to the Labour Court where she has not already instituted proceedings in the civil court.  Again, this is to ensure there will not be duplication of action. Where she goes to the Labour Court in the first instance she can then go to the civil court.  This is to speed formal investigation where a person can secure rapid redress and provide <Col N="1616" /> against the possibility of a conflict arising from a decision of the civil courts under section 8 and a subsequent Labour Court determination.</P>

      <P>We extended it in case there was delay.  I imagine this would happen only where there was undue delay after proceedings had been instituted.  It is to ensure the person concerned will not be at a loss.  The section provides that the Labour Court may direct an employer to pay to a woman dismissed because she sought equal pay a sum equal to the remuneration she would have received to the date of the court order.  The original period was six months and the purpose of the amendment is to extend that period to 104 weeks.  It is designed to permit her to recover arrears of remuneration.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>I have been advised that such a provision would be open to objection on constitutional grounds.  In general, the idea is to prevent or discourage dismissals by making it an offence to dismiss a woman employee who sought equal pay by providing penalties in respect of such an offence and, of course, by providing compensation where such an offence is committed.  We are satisfied this approach is in line with the proposed EEC directive on the application of equal pay which provides in Article 5 that member states shall take the necessary measures to prevent any such injustice.  However, my main reason for not being able to meet the Deputy is because of a possible constitutional infringement.  I do not have the relevant Article of the Constitution it is thought to infringe.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JosephDowling" hpid="Mr. Dowling Mr. Dowling">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dowling</NameTxt>
      <P>Surely the more important aspect from the workers' point of view is reinstatement.  The question of remuneration might not be of so much consequence.  Remuneration might be all right in the big city but, when one is employed in an area in which employment is scarce, it could be a very serious matter.  It would be more serious than being deprived of equal pay during the period.  It could well be that this would constitute a major problem for the person concerned.</P>

      <P>A claim to unemployment benefit made on 29th October, 1973, by the person in question was disallowed by a deciding officer on the ground of deficiency of contributions.  A statutory condition for title to unemployment benefit requires that at least twentysix employment contributions be paid or credited in respect of the claimant in the governing contribution year, in this instance 1972.  The claimant had only nine contributions for that year during the remainder of which he was self-employed as a lorry owner-driver. He did not lodge an appeal against the decision of the deciding officer on the benefit claim.</P>
      <P>The person also made, early in November, 1973, an application for a qualification certificate for unemployment assistance.  The application was refused by a deciding officer on the ground that the applicant's means, as calculated for the purposes of the Unemployment Assistance Acts, exceeded the statutory limit applicable to his case.  An appeal was made against the decision of the deciding officer, but the decision was upheld by an appeals officer.  The person was notified accordingly and given details of the means assessment made in his case.  In the absence of new facts or fresh evidence the appeals officer's decision is final.</P>
