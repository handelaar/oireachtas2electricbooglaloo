      <P>In view of the fact that article 87, sub-article 4, was not abided by in a recent co-option to Portlaoise Town Commissioners would the Minister not take specific action because the man was co-opted without having given his prior consent in writing to the local authority before the co-option took place?</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not so aware. Approval by my Department of prefabricated system built housing is not <Col N="514" /> conditional on the submission of certificates from the Institute for Industrial Research and Standards, but is based on documentation which applicants are asked to submit, including drawings, specifications and relevant calculations.  In exceptional cases applicants are requested to obtain a report from the institute on particular aspects of their proposals.</P>

      <P>A certain firm informed me that they had been asked by the Department of Local Government to submit details of their prefabricated houses to the Institute for Industrial Research and Standards and that as they felt they were a small company and could not afford the expense involved in this work they did not do that.  Therefore, the person I was interested in who had purchased the house was denied the concessions by way of rates remission and local government grant because the Department would not approve the house for grant purposes.</P>

      <P>Did Deputy Molloy say &ldquo;details of the house&rdquo;?  Certain details of the house may have been asked to be submitted to the Institute for Industrial Research and Standards, but not the whole house.

      <P>asked the Minister for Local Government the schemes in the guaranteed order project in which structural defects are alleged to have occurred; and in respect of each scheme if he will give (a) particulars of the defects, (b) the date on which the final account was settled and (c) whether the defects were remedied before settlement of the final account.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Local Government if he will give particulars of directions to the effect that cheap materials or inferior standards of construction were to be used in the building of any local authority dwellings.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>With the permission of the Ceann Comhairle, I propose to take Questions Nos. 10 and 11 together and to circulate with the Official Report, a tabular statement setting out the defects in schemes carried out under the former low-cost &mdash;guaranteed order project&mdash;housing project about which complaints have been received by the National Building Agency and which are deemed to have structural implications, now or in the future.  The Deputy will be aware that there are few defects in a house which do not have some structural significance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Also included in the list are details of the position regarding final accounts for each scheme and the rectification of the defects which can be dealt with under the contracts for each scheme.  There are however many general defects in these schemes about which complaints have been made, including cramped superstructures, narrow entrance halls and stairways, the general skimping of woodwork, fencing, painting and exterior plastering down to minimum <Col N="516" /> permissible standards, a high incidence of consdensation through lack of flexible heating and ventilation arrangements, the use on a large scale of relatively untried forms of outside cladding, and higher than normal maintenance costs associated with the form of construction, leading possibly to a rate of depreciation higher than in the case of traditional building methods.</P>
    <P>These defects are directly attributable to the emphasis placed by the previous Government on getting the maximum number of housing units from the minimum amount of capital. The policy line enunciated by my predecessor, in consultation with the then Minister for Finance, called for a review of the construction programe to get the maximum number of houses out of available money.  The view was taken that houses were being built which could last for 100 years, that thinking should be revised and that it would do if houses were built which could last 25 to 30 years if this meant that more houses could be got more quickly.  This policy was developed into the former low-cost housing project, which was later called the guaranteed order project. Firms were invited by public advertisement in August, 1970, to offer significant economies in the cost of dwelling units in return for obtaining orders on an organised basis over a number of years.  As the firms were to be short-listed for later package deals of a substantial order on the basis of costs quoted for superstructures, it was inevitable that designs would be based on the minimum standards. There is ample evidence in the list of defects which is being circulated with the Official Report of the ultimate effects of this cost-cutting exercise. The general attitude to standards developed as I have indicated; no specific directions were given about the use of any particular cheap materials, or any specific inferior standards of construction.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>With the permission of the Ceann Comhairle I propose to take Questions Nos. 12 and 13 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the public capital programme for the current year the Government provided a record amount of finance in order to maintain a high level of activity in the house building industry. This record provision has been supplemented by further measures designed specifically to assist the private sector of the industry.  An additional £9 million has been provided for local authority house purchase loans and negotiations were completed with the associated banks whereby standby credits totalling £11 million have been made available to the member societies of the Irish Building Societies' Association to enable them to expand their new loan approvals.  Furthermore, to stimulate the flow of investment funds for housing to building <Col N="522" /> societies, it has been decided to continue in operation until 31st December, 1974, the special temporary interest subsidy on the societies' shares and deposits.</P>
    <P>Since the special borrowing facility for the societies has enabled them to achieve a reasonable level of loan approvals, their loan limits have been revised upwards and the quantitative restriction on the total value of loans for second-hand houses has been removed.  These measures are indicative of the Government's continuing support and concern for the private house building programme.</P>
    <P>The available indicators do not support the view that there is a crisis in the private sector of the building industry.  The level of approvals to new house purchase loans and grants is substantially up on 1973.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Mr. Molloy Mr. Molloy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware that there have been large numbers of men made redundant in the building industry, particularly those employed in the private housebuilding sector?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>I am aware that two firms, according to the newspaper reports yesterday, laid off substantial numbers of men.  One firm is entirely affected by the failure of the parent company in Britain and the other firm admits that two of the factors causing the lay-off are (1) the adverse effect of the three-day week and everything else that applied to it in Britain; and (2) the large amount of land which they had bought up and on which they were paying interest.  I do not think the responsibility for paying the interest on that type of land lies on the Government.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Mr. Molloy Mr. Molloy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware that among the reasons given in respect of the companies which he has mentioned, particularly the one dealing with housebuilding, was that there existed at present a mortgage famine in this country?  Does the Minister consider that his statement today will help in any way to alleviate the financial difficulties of persons seeking to purchase homes?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think my statement will help to alleviate it any more than Deputy Molloy's statements over <Col N="523" /> the past few months have adversely affected it.  The fact is that twice as much money was available as was available two years ago when Deputy Molloy was Minister.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="Mr. J. Lynch Mr. J. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware, or does he keep his eyes open, that there is a serious crisis in the building industry and in the ancillary industries&mdash;builders providers, carpet manufacturers and a host of others, all caused because of the difficulty young people experience in getting new homes?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>I should hate to be considered as being rude to Deputy Lynch but if he went to as much trouble checking these things as I have he would realise that the statement he has made is just not correct.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="Mr. J. Lynch Mr. J. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>Only two days ago I was talking to a friend of mine&mdash; admittedly a friend of mine and a Fianna Fáil supporter&mdash;who is manager of a builders' providers premises. He told me he had to lay off one-third of his workers a week ago, another third will go next week and he said he does not know where he will go from there.  He said he cannot shift a yard of timber out of his place.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to point out that early this year the builders' providers had their yards empty. They then found it difficult to supply needs and they bought in and sold to the building contractors, bought in again, sold again to the building contractors and a third time filled their yards.  Now they complain to me and to Deputy Lynch because they cannot sell the timber which they got on the off-chance that there would be an upsurge not to 25,000 houses but to 35,000 or 40,000.  They did not realise they had overstepped their limits.  The blame is neither on us nor the builders.  The providers bought in too much material and it is not our job to cushion them now against what was, perhaps, their own fault.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="Mr. J. Lynch Mr. J. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Lynch</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>I am aware that a number of men were laid off.  I met the men and their management and made arrangements to try to do something to assist them.  The reason they have been laid off is that in the main the luxury type houses which the bricks were being used in are no longer being built, and I do not think that is a bad thing.  Perhaps Deputy Wilson does.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Mr. Molloy Mr. Molloy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>In view of the large number of reports of unemployment in the building industry in the past two months and in some cases longer than that, now reaching alarming proportions, has the Minister available to him a committee in the Department set up to monitor progress and project output in the building industry? Have this committee recently reported to him warnings of a serious reduction in output in the building industry?  If he has had that report, does he propose any steps to avoid this drastic increase in unemployment?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">

    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>Does Deputy Molloy want a reply?  There are more men employed in the building industry now than there were when I took over office 19 months ago.  That is a fact. There were not large layoffs in the building industry and the people Deputy Molloy has been quoting in this House as having laid off big numbers of men had to admit to me when I asked them that, in fact, they did not lay off men but that they had heard of other firms who did.  Recently, according to the newspapers, two firms have laid off men and the firms gave the reasons Deputy Molloy has given.  I am not aware of any large scale layoffs in the building industry.  For goodness sake will people who are making these statements try to check them before giving them out as gospel?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Mr. Molloy Mr. Molloy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware that in the city of Galway practically <Col N="526" /> every house building site has been brought to a standstill except one small local authority scheme?

    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>As Deputy Molloy said before the summer recess.  I do not believe everything I read in the newspapers. With regard to Galway city, Galway Corporation had £200,000 for local authority building this year but so far they have expended only £40,000 of it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Lynch</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>Was the exceptional sum paid in June and July, 1973, indicative of the efforts of housing inspectors to list houses as having been completed which in actual fact had been completed and lived in, sometimes months and years before that? Did this not arise out of an effort to increase the number of completions for the year through special bonuses being given to inspectors to tour the country seeking homes in respect of which £10 to £15 had been withheld from the final payments awaiting some minor jobs to be done, although the houses had been lived in for two or three years?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>With the permission of the Ceann Comhairle, I propose to take Questions Nos. 18 and 19 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am aware that investigations carried out in England following the collapse of roof beams containing high alumina cement in a swimming <Col N="530" /> pool revealed that concrete containing high alumina cement may be vulnerable to loss of strength.  It has been ascertained that high alumina cement has been used on a very limited scale here and represents only 0.25 per cent of the total cement used in construction work.</P>
    <P>I would refer the Deputies to my Press statement of 23rd August last, in which I stated that local authorities had been asked by me to identify buildings in their functional areas in which this cement had been used and to advise those responsible for maintaining the structural fabric of such buildings to have the need for remedial action investigated.</P>
    <P>They were also asked when considering applications for building bye-law approval to ensure as far as practicable that the material was not used for structural work.  I further indicated that the Institute for Industrial Research and Standards would undertake technical investigations where required and that the use of the material would be specially considered in connection with the preparation of the building regulations now under way in my Department.</P>
    <P>I do not propose to make a further statement on the matter at the present time.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Mr. Molloy Mr. Molloy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>Could I take it there will be a report from the local authorities on any of the buildings in their areas where this type of cement was used?  Would the Minister let us know the outcome of that report later on?</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">

      <P>Is the Minister aware that examination of all the buildings &mdash;it is a very extensive job&mdash;has been carried out in England and the engineer in charge of this investigation is finding that in up to 70 per cent of the cases where this cement was used the buildings are unsatisfactory and will need at least extra supports if they are not to be reconstructed?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">

    <Speaker pid="PatrickPower" hpid="Mr. Power Mr. Power">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Power</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Local Government if he is satisfied that the system of selecting builders by the NBA for the provision of local authority houses at Athy and Kilberry, County Kildare, conforms to the system of competitive tendering which his Department normally requires; and whether the agreed price in both these schemes is too high.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>I am satisfied that the contracts for these schemes were awarded in accordance with well-established and generally accepted tendering practice.  These schemes are being carried out at the request of the housing authority by the National Building Agency under the Government's emergency supplementary housing programme.  Because of the emergency nature of the programme and because it was intended to supplement the resources normally available to local authorities for the building of houses, the procedure adopted in this programme was a selective tendering procedure which complies fully with current EEC Directives on the award of public works contracts.  The agency advertised the programme extensively in May, 1973, and on a Community wide basis, for contractors willing to take part in it.  A short list was then prepared of contractors who were accepted to carry out work under the programme.  This list has been used by the agency for the selection of three contractors to submit tenders for each scheme, in consultation with the housing authority. The contracts for the Athy and Kilberry schemes were awarded on this basis to the tenderer who submitted the lowest quotation.</P>
      <P>I am advised that the prices in the accepted tenders were fully competitive, and generally in line with the costs of comparable local authority houses in the area.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickPower" hpid="Mr. Power Mr. Power">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Power</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister not agree that selective rather than competitive tendering was sought in the building of these houses and that genuinely good builders within the county who had done work for the <Col N="532" /> local authority were never asked or allowed to tender and that this system has now developed into a closed shop?  If I tell the Minister I am confident that the houses were £500 dearer per house and that other builders were building, and would be prepared to build, these houses in Kildare, does he not think it is time he should institute an investigation into this matter?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanTreacy" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Seán Treacy">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>That is a long question, Deputy.  I am anxious to help the Deputy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickPower" hpid="Mr. Power Mr. Power">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Power</NameTxt>
      <P>There is a lot of money involved when you consider that there is £16,000 involved in this scheme in Kilberry alone.  Does the Minister not feel it is time to put a stop to this practice?  Should he not institute an investigation immediately?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to make it very clear that, while I am aware Deputy Power is genuinely interested, there is no question of anything being wrong with what happened.  In fact, the Kildare county manager asked the NBA to take on the schemes because at the time local contractors were overloaded with work and he particularly asked the NBA not to poach his contractors.  Previously contractors were asked to have their names listed on the list which was being prepared.  This was publicised widely so that contractors could be given the opportunity of participating in this type of selective tendering.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Far from what Deputy Power says about the price being wrong, the most recent comparative ordinary price for housing in Kildare is £6.58 per sq. ft. while the two tenders talked about are £6.54 and £6.14 for Kilberry. While, on the face of it, it might appear to those who did not know as if something peculiar had happened, in fact it was quite above board.  What happened was in the best interest of the people waiting for the houses, of Kildare County Council and of the ratepayers.  Another scheme is coming up now and it is being put up for general contract, because the people involved in these schemes at local <Col N="533" /> level are no longer so involved.  There is nothing peculiar about it.  I think a good job was done.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickPower" hpid="Mr. Power Mr. Power">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Power</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to impress on the Minister, if I can, that the present price per house in the contract for Kilberry is £500 dearer than the house could and should be built for?</P>

This is intended to reduce personal hardship on householders and, it is hoped, to lower dependence on fuel oils.  This grant has always been available in cases to which the 15-year limiting period did not apply.</P>
      <P>At my request, the question of the insulation of houses against heat loss is being investigated by An Foras Forbartha in conjunction with the Institute for Industrial Research and Standards.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>With the permission of the Ceann Comhairle, I propose to take Questions Nos. 42 and 43 together.</P>
      <P>While funds are not specifically assigned for grants for such work it is open to a county council to undertake them under the allocation made to them under the local improvements scheme, where the works are on bog roads or drains serving groups of landholders. Each council has full discretion in determining the priorities in the selection of eligible works to be carried out under the scheme.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="HughGibbons" hpid="Dr. Gibbons Dr. Gibbons">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Gibbons</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister not agree that the local improvements scheme is not a suitable agency for developing bogs in view of the fact that the people who own the bogs may not be using them, that the people who are using them may not own them, and that it is very difficult to get the contribution under the local improvements scheme?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>As Deputy Gibbons will know, bogs are becoming very valuable again.  People are using a bog either because they own it or because they have rented it from somebody else.  In either case, the person who wants the bog to be used should be prepared to pay whatever is required for the purpose of having the road done.  There is not at present and, as far as I am aware, there has never been any other way of having it done <Col N="543" /> except under the local improvements scheme.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sure Deputy Callanan is not suggesting that, if there were only one or two people using a long bog road, there should be some way of having that road repaired for them by the State.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnCallanan" hpid="Mr. Callanan Mr. Callanan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Callanan</NameTxt>
      <P>No. I am asking the Minister is he aware that, because of the condition of bog roads, they require a higher estimate allocation than an ordinary road?  Is he further aware that the maximum grant per person in that case is now 10 per cent of the estimate of the cost of the bog road, apart from the valuation?  I welcome that change made.  But, at the same time, is the Minister aware that there is a maximum grant per person, per farm, and we find, with regard to bog roads, that this maximum grant is exceeded in nearly all cases?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>I am aware of the bad condition of bog roads.  Indeed, this is no credit to those who have been using them.  For their own comfort, they should keep the bog roads in some kind of order.  But I am quite sure an effort will be made to try to improve them.  However, it will not all be done in one year.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>I think the Deputy will agree that if there are a lot of people, as he says, using bog roads now for the purpose of transporting turf, it should be a relatively easy thing to have the roads done properly.  The biggest trouble would arise in cases where, as Deputy Callanan has said, there are only a few people using a particular road and where it might be difficult to get the necessary money together.  But I think it will have to be done in that way, unless the local authorities can assist them in some other way.  They may possibly use what is known as the McQuillan Act, where roads are subject to general use by the public.  It was used quite considerably in County Meath for another reason.  They could, in fact, do the roads if they consider it that important to have them done. In the first place the local authorities should be the people to be consulted.</P>

      <P>That is the point I wish to make.  Would the Taoiseach not regard it as unsatisfactory that, in the absence of very good reasons, there should be a number of items, particularly different Estimates, going on at the same time in the House? This was characteristic of the last session when sometimes three or four Estimates, and perhaps, other items also, were being taken and adjourned. Would it not be more satisfactory to complete the business on hand?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LiamCosgrave" hpid="The Taoiseach Liam Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>Certainly, I shall consider what the Deputy has said but <Col N="564" /> I do not think there is anything unusual in more than one item going through at the same time.  It has been the practice often to take Estimates jointly.  On occasions they are not taken consecutively so as to suit the convenience of both Ministers and Deputies.

      <P>As happens not infrequently, the Leader of the Opposition is raising an issue while concealing what lies behind that issue, hoping that he will take listeners in.  As Deputy Lynch knows, the reality so far as Estimates are concerned is that once they conclude a Standing Order provides that if they are not agreed a Vote must be taken at a particular time on that or the following day.  One does not have to read too deeply between the lines to realise the imperative requirement that that places on a Government in ordering business on certain political occasions.

Since the Parliamentary Secretary has had the propensity to quote records, might I point out that on 4th March, 1970, there was a by-election in Dublin South-West, that on 2nd December, 1970, a by-election was held in Dublin South-Central and that on the 8th December, 1970, there <Col N="566" /> was a by-election in Donegal-Leitrim, and that the Dáil met on each of these occasions.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Lands (Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick,</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>Cavan</i>): I move:</P>
      <P>That a sum not exceeding £5,357,000 be granted to defray the charge which will come in course of payment during the period commencing on the 1st day of April, 1974, and ending on the 31st day of December, 1974, for the salaries and expenses of the Offices of the Minister for Lands and of the Irish Land Commission, including a grant-in-aid.</P>
      <P>I propose to follow the usual procedure and to take the Votes for Lands and Forestry together.  Accordingly, in my opening remarks I shall refer to Votes 35 and 36 and at the conclusion of the debate the motion in respect of Vote 35 will be put to the House.  Vote 36 will then be formally put.</P>
      <P>Regarding the Lands Vote it has been the custom each year to make special comment on those items in the Vote which reflect a significant change from the previous year's provision. The fact that the present Estimate relates to a nine-month period renders direct comparison with the previous year's figures difficult but in those subheads where, allowing for the shorter period, an appreciable change is evident, I shall explain the reasons for the increase or decrease as the case may be.  I will then review the activities of the Land Commission during the year ended 31st March last and go on to deal more fully with a number of recent developments in the sphere of land settlement.</P>
      <P>Subhead A, which provides for salaries, wages and allowances, would seem to call for no special comment, the amount provided for being roughly proportionate to last year's provision.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I might perhaps mention that I have recently arranged for a strengthening of the staffing position both on the outdoor, that is the inspectorate side, and on the indoor side in the critical acquisition and resale sections.  Deputies from rural constituencies will be aware of the persistent <Col N="568" /> and ever-increasing pressure on the Land Commission to have lands acquired and speedily disposed of and, indeed, quite a few Deputies have raised in the House the matter of staffing of local offices.  I am glad, therefore, to be able to say that steps have been taken to have the position improved.  Fourteen additional inspectors have already been appointed in fact, and recruitment is continuing.</P>
    <P>Deputies may be wondering as to the reason for the pronounced drop in the provision under subhead B2, which relates to charges by the Department of Posts and Telegraphs for postal services and for the handling of stores.  The decrease here is due to adjustments being made for overestimation of charges in previous years.</P>
    <P>The figure estimated for subhead C is proportionately greater than that for 1973-74.  It reflects the increase in the number of cases that are being contested in the Land Commission at acquisition stage and before the Appeal Tribunal on the question of price.  On the other hand, costs of recovering unpaid instalments of land purchase annuity are down due to the continuing satisfactory position in regard to collection of annuities and the revised procedures for recovery being implemented by the Land Commission.</P>
    <P>The moneys required under subhead D are in the nature of statutory commitments. In the main they represent the taxpayers' contribution towards the service of land purchase debt accumulated since 1923 on both tenanted and untenanted land.  Of the total subhead provision, some £701,580 will be utilised to make good deficiencies in the land bond fund arising from the statutory halving of annuities under the Land Act, 1933. As Deputies will be aware, all allottees in congested areas, together with migrants and displaced employees getting holdings in non-congested areas, get the benefit of the halving of annuities.  It is clear then that the amount required under this subhead is affected annually in accordance with the progress being made in land settlement.  The purchase instalments <Col N="569" /> of all new allottees in the categories which I have mentioned are, as I said, halved with consequent additional deficiencies in the land bond fund, which have to be made good out of this subhead.  In an ordinary year the bulk of the amount in this subhead is paid to the land bond fund in two instalments but in the nine-month period only one such instalment will fall due.  It is appropriate for me to refer here to the order which I made in October, 1973, extending the scheduled congested areas to include the three counties of Cavan, Monaghan and Longford.  This order had the effect of restoring to the counties mentioned the benefit of revision of annuity.  It also entitled eligible smallholders in those three counties to participate in the self-migration loans scheme which is administered by the Land Commission. I shall have more to say about this particular scheme later on.</P>
    <P>Subhead F is to provide for any deficit between the income realised on the letting of lands on the hands of the Land Commission and the amount required to pay rates, herds, caretakers and so on and to service the land bonds issued for the purchase of such lands.  For some years it had been anticipated that income from lands on hands would not be sufficient to cover the outgoings mentioned but this has not happened and the fact that only a token sum is estimated for the period to December next reflects to some extent the buoyancy of income resulting from the present high level of letting rents.</P>
    <P>I am happy to be able to say that a record sum of £2¼ million is available in the current nine-months period for the purchase of land for cash.  This is a manifest index of the Government's desire to provide adequate resources so that the work of land structural improvement can be not just maintained but liberally extended.  The sum provided covers ordinary cash purchases by the Land Commission in the open market and also purchases under the new retirement scheme&mdash;all of which must, of course, be in cash. The greater the use of cash as a <Col N="570" /> means of payment for lands acquired by voluntary process, the less will be the need for compulsory acquisition and the use of land bonds.</P>
    <P>Purchases for cash are, of course, now treated as a capital item and the provision is being made by way of grant-in-aid under a separate subhead (G1), a procedure which will enable any part of the moneys issued but unexpended to be used in the following year.  This will facilitate forward planning and the orderly regulation of transactions.</P>
    <P>Subhead G2 is a new subhead.  It provides the funds for the life annuities which will be set up and the premiums which will fall for payment in the period ending 31st December, 1974, under the new retirement scheme introduced recently in compliance with EEC Directive 160.</P>
    <P>Subhead G3 contains the items covered by subhead G2 in the 1973-74 Estimates.  It provides for the payment of existing annuities under the old retirement scheme, advances under the self-migration loans scheme, the payment in cash of compensation for tenancy interests resumed on the small outstanding residue of CDB estates and for the payment by the Land Commission of auctioneers' commission on relevant purchases of land for cash and land bonds.  I would like to refer briefly here to the self-migration loans scheme, which was introduced under section 5 of the Land Act, 1965, for the benefit of smallholders in the scheduled congested areas.  As Deputies will be aware, this scheme has not been a success and is now virtually moribund. Clearly its provisions are no longer realistic having regard to the prevailing high land prices.  It did not &ldquo;take on&rdquo; and one must doubt whether it has any merit or appeal in the current situation.</P>
    <P>Deputies will expect me to comment on subhead I, under which provision is made for the money required to erect houses and out-offices and to construct the fences, roads, drains and so on found necessary in the course of estate improvement work.  Over the past few years many improvements <Col N="571" /> have been made in Land Commission buildings and these have been the subject of favourable comment both in this House and elsewhere.  Modern farming methods demand the adoption of up-to-date out-office designs and it is only proper therefore that new holdings created by the Land Commission should be provided with farm buildings of a high standard.  I can say that the standard already achieved will be maintained; indeed Land Commission house and out-office plans are constantly being reviewed to ensure that they incorporate the latest developments in regard to design, layout and construction.</P>
    <P>The scheme under which advances are made to farmers to supplement grants from the Department of Local Government for the erection of new houses and for reconstruction work on existing houses is also financed under subhead 1 and loans amounting to £41,486 were authorised during the year.</P>
    <P>I have now concluded the usual commentary on the principal subheads of the Lands Vote and I propose to continue by reviewing the main activities of the Land Commission in the past year.</P>
    <P>On the acquisition side, the aggregate area inspected during the year was 36,267 acres, while the total intake of land amounted to about 20,400 acres.  The total area in the acquisition machine at 31st March, 1974, amounted to some 79,500 acres.</P>
    <P>As regards land settlement for the year, the total area allotted among 1,946 allottees was about 35,600 acres.  The acreage distributed included the provision of 49 fully-equipped holdings comprising 3,493 acres for migrants and the rearrangement of 473 fragmented holdings.  In all, 52 new dwellinghouses and 61 new out-offices were provided for tenants and allottees during the year.</P>
    <P>In the course of land settlement work £5,790 was provided by way of grants for nine displaced employees who were not considered suitable for allotments.</P>
    <P>The rate of vesting of holdings and allotments continues to increase progressively <Col N="572" /> and last year about 3,840 holdings, parcels and rights of turbary were dealt with.  The number of tenanted holdings&mdash;including those on CDB estates&mdash;outstanding for vesting had, at 31st March, 1974, been reduced to about 2,000.  These residual holdings, situated for the most part in western congested counties, now represent the remaining hard core of difficult tenanted land cases and their release for final vesting is at present getting special attention.</P>
    <P>As I have already said, the position as regards collection of land annuities continues satisfactory.  Out of a collectible total of £2,978,812 for the year, the amount actually collected by 31st March, 1974, was £2,863,903, over 96 per cent.</P>
    <P>In passing, I might mention that 1973 marked the commencement of the amortisation, that is final repayment, of the first advances made under the Land Act, 1903, and which were repayable by annuities over a period of 69 years from the date of advance.  An increasing number of these advances will amortise each year for some time to come.</P>
    <P>The control of the purchase of land by &ldquo;non-qualified persons&rdquo;&mdash;principally non-nationals&mdash;continues to be an important part of the work of the Land Commission.  During the past year&mdash;apart from what might be called unobjectionable transactions, for example, those (a) arising solely from mortgage interests, (b) involving areas not exceeding five acres and (c) representing transfers between one non-citizen (individual or company) and another&mdash;the total acreage in respect of which the consent of the Land Commission, pursuant to section 45 of the 1965 Land Act, was given to the vesting of interests in land in non-qualified persons was 4,707 acres.  A substantial proportion of the acreage involved consisted of the types of property which could hold no attraction for the ordinary Irish purchaser.</P>
    <P>I need scarcely say that the future operation of the Land Commission will be governed to a large extent by the success or otherwise of the EEC retirement scheme.  Deputies, especially <Col N="573" /> those from rural constituencies, will be aware that on 1st May last I announced that I had made regulations introducing the new farmers' retirement scheme for the implementation of EEC Directive 160 on encouragement to leave farming.  The objective of the scheme is to enable farmers, particularly those in the elderly age group&mdash; over 55&mdash;who for one reason or another are not happily or profitably engaged in agriculture and who wish to give up farming, to retire in dignity and financial security.  It is a fact that in modern society most workers can retire at a certain age and enjoy a pension which will keep them in reasonable comfort for the rest of their lives.  For a variety of reasons this privilege has not been enjoyed by the farming community and there must be many farmers who by reason of age, infirmity or unprofitable holdings would like to call it a day but hitherto could not do so because they did not have the necessary financial security to enable them to enjoy what should be the bonus years of a man's life.  I am glad to have had the privilege of introducing a scheme which, I hope, will remedy this situation.  For the first time in our history a farmer who wishes to retire can do so with a guaranteed income for the rest of his life provided he satisfies the necessary conditions.  In this way land will be made available to neighbouring farmers determined to advance their agricultural operations under the modernisation scheme being implemented by the Department of Agriculture and Fisheries.</P>
    <P>The details of the retirement scheme have been widely publicised in a comprehensive informational publicity campaign designed to bring it to the attention of the farming community throughout the country.  Prominent advertisements were placed in the daily and provincial newspapers; copies of an attractively produced informational booklet were distributed widely to farming organisations, rural groups and opinion leaders, including Members of the Oireachtas.</P>
    <P>Posters are in display in post offices, Garda stations and other public places.  I myself have spoken about it on radio and television and <Col N="574" /> officials of my Department have attended meetings arranged by farming organisations to explain the detailed provisions of the scheme.  It was the theme of a special Land Commission exhibit at the Spring Show and attracted a considerable amount of interest.  The exhibit was later presented at a number of agricultural shows in different parts of the country.</P>
    <P>There should, therefore, be no doubt or confusion in the public mind about the salient features of the scheme.  Nevertheless, as this is the first debate on the Lands Estimate since the scheme was introduced and as many Deputies will wish to have a full discussion of the scheme I will outline, for the record, the main features, after which I will deal with certain aspects which call for special comment.  Briefly, any farmer is eligible for the benefits of the scheme provided his main occupation is farming and provided his holding does not exceed 45 adjusted acres, that is 45 acres of good agricultural land or its equivalent in land of mixed quality. A person is deemed to have farming as his main occupation if he has owned or, where the land is not worked by the owner, occupied the holding continuously for the five years prior to the application and during this period has devoted at least 50 per cent of his time to and derived at least 50 per cent of his earned income from agricultural work on the holding.  The upper limit of 45 adjusted acres can be exceeded&mdash;</P>
    <P>(1)  where in the opinion of the Land Commission the holding is required for farmers in the same locality whose approved development plans provide for additional land and there are no other suitable holdings under 45 adjusted acres available for this purpose, or</P>
    <P>(2)  where the applicant can prove to the satisfaction of the Land Commission that his earned income from the holding is significantly lower than the earned income derivable from a farm of 45 adjusted acres under normal methods of husbandry and management.</P>
    <P>There is no upper limit for a disabled <Col N="575" /> farmer whose main occupation is farming&mdash;or for a widow who becomes the owner of a holding following the death of her husband and for whom farming is her main occupation, provided she has&mdash;or she and her late husband between them have&mdash; worked in agriculture on the holding for at least five years prior to her application.</P>
    <P>In order to benefit under the scheme an applicant must sell the holding or lease it for a minimum of 12 years, to a farmer whose approved development plan under the farm modernisation scheme provides for additional land or he can sell direct to the Land Commission.  He must also undertake to discontinue commercial farming and not to hold or take any agricultural holding or employ anyone in agricultural activity. If the farmer is married, his wife must give a similar undertaking.  The benefits available to a successful applicant are as follows:</P>
    <P>Under 55 years&mdash;A premium of 10 per cent of the purchase price subject to a maximum of £1,500 or twice the annual lease rent subject to a maximum of £3,000.</P>
    <P>55 years and over&mdash;Premium as already stated plus a life annuity of £600 for a married person or £400 for a single person, widow or widower.</P>
    <P>These benefits, of course, are in addition to the purchase price or lease rent of the lands.</P>
    <P>Apart from the main financial provisions there are many additional benefits&mdash;</P>
    <P>All lands bought under the scheme by the Land Commission will be paid for in cash.  The annuity may be increased from time to time to take account of increases in the cost of living.</P>
    <P>A grant of up to £100 may be paid to defray the cost of settling title.</P>
    <P>Where the holding is sold to the Land Commission the vendor's costs and expenses, when agreed, will be paid by the Land Commission.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="576" /> Where a married applicant in receipt of an annuity dies the spouse will be entitled to a life annuity of £400.</P>
    <P>Applicants of 55 years of age or over who sell their lands to the Land Commission can if they wish convert the sale price and premium into an actuarial annuity&mdash;in addition to the life annuity of £600 or £400 already mentioned.</P>
    <P>If the retiring farmer wishes, he can keep the dwellinghouse he has lived in and up to two acres around it: this is an important consideration for the status and emotional well-being of the farmer concerned as it means that he has not to break with the friends and neighbours with whom he has lived all his life.</P>
    <P>There is one other additional benefit of considerable significance.  A retiring farmer can continue to work in agriculture either permanently or casually provided, of course, that he does not engage in commercial farming in his own right.  The directive lays down that a farmer who avails of the benefits of the scheme should cease all agricultural activity.  For myself I regarded this as an unreasonable provision; it would mean that a retired farmer could not even help a neighbouring farmer in times of seasonal pressure.  Such a restriction would be bad both for the psychological well-being of the person in question and for the agricultural economy in general where there is often a death of labour.  I arranged that this point be presented strongly to the Commission in Brussels and I am glad to report that they accepted our case.</P>
    <P>I would now like to deal with certain aspects of the scheme which have given rise to misunderstandings.  One of these is the question of priority access to land made available under the scheme.  The position here is that, as required by the EEC Directive 160, farmers with development plans approved under the Department of Agriculture and Fisheries modernisation scheme will have priority on lands made available by the retirement scheme where their plans confirm that extra land is needed.  The retirement <Col N="577" /> scheme and the farm modernisation scheme are very closely interlinked and arrangements have been made both at local and at headquarter levels to ensure the closest liaison in the administration of the two schemes.</P>
    <P>A certain amount of anxiety has been expressed throughout the country about the position of a class of farmers now designated as transitional farmers. These are farmers whose income is below the current comparable income but who are not yet in a position to undertake a development plan and do not want to retire.  It has been alleged that this class of farmer will not qualify for land released under the retirement scheme: farmers who fall into this category are not precluded from becoming development farmers either after a period of expansion of their existing resources or through acquiring additional land.</P>
    <P>It will be usually the smaller farmer who can put up a development plan to show that he needs extra land to get the comparable income that will be considered for priority allocation of land released under the retirement scheme.  Perhaps it is the use of EEC terms that has led to the fog and confusion around this point.  It should be borne in mind that, as far as development farmers are concerned, it is only the man whose approved plan confirms that extra land is needed to achieve the comparable income who will be eligible for consideration for priority access to land released under the retirement scheme.  Where a development farmer is capable of attaining comparable income on his existing lands, the question of providing extra land will not, of course, arise.</P>
    <P>There will inevitably be small farmers who, even with the aids available under the modernisation scheme, will not for one reason or another move on to development status.  They have the choice of remaining in farming or retiring under my scheme.  If they wish to remain on, they will continue to have access to extra land under the traditional land settlement programme of the Land Commission provided they are adjudged worthy and deserving applicants.  In regard to land released under the retirement scheme, however, <Col N="578" /> their claims will have to take second place to those of modernising farmers needing extra land&mdash;but, if there is land left over after the requirements of modernising farmers are met, or if there are no modernising farmers in the locality, then the ordinary small holder can be considered.</P>
    <P>In these instances, however, subvention of retirement annuities from EEC funds will not be forthcoming. Another matter on which there is some misunderstanding is that of family settlements.  The benefits of the scheme are not available to farmers merely to facilitate family settlements or to ease succession difficulties.  The only instances where a transaction involving a family transfer of lands would come under the Scheme is where the transferee is already the holder of land in respect of which he has an approved development plan providing for the acquisition of additional land and the holding being transferred to him is suitable for this purpose.</P>
    <P>The retirement scheme is, of course, entirely voluntary and I must emphasise that there is no question of trying to pressgang anyone into accepting it.  Farmers are free to take part in it or not as they choose.  This is no sinister effort to attempt to propose a doctrinaire or unrealistic solution for our rural problems.  The principle behind the scheme is purely and simply to enable the farmer to do what every other worker can do in his later years, and that is, to retire with dignity and security.  I do not think anybody can deny that this is a worthy and decent objective.  But the choice is his and his alone.</P>
    <P>Fully conscious of the failure of the previous pension scheme under the 1965 Act, I was particularly concerned in formulating this scheme to ensure that the financial incentives would be pitched at a really compelling level&mdash;hence the generous annuities for life of £600, married, and £400, single.  These incentives are considerably in excess of the EEC guideline amounts of £420 and £280 respectively and will, I hope, be regarded as a clear indication of concern for the social well-being of <Col N="579" /> farmers and my Government's firm support for a truly dynamic structural reform programme in this country in the years ahead.</P>
    <P>Indeed, relative to our national resources the incentives are up to the highest level on offer in any member state of the Community both as to the amount and duration of the annuities. The EEC directive only required that annuities be payable between the ages of 55 and 65, and some member states have confined their annuities to this period.  In the Irish scheme the annuities will continue for the lifetime of the recipient.  To point up the monetary worth arising under the scheme I take the instance of a married farmer over age 55 leasing for 12 years 40 acres at £40 per acre; in the first year he will receive £5,200 being £3,000 premium, £1,600 rent, £600 pension; for the next 11 years £2,200 per year, being £1,600 rent, £600 pension and thereafter, £600 per year for life plus disposal right of the lands.  It is confidently expected that subvention of the pension annuities from EEC funds will be at a 65 per cent rate but only up to age of 65 and the subvention will be limited to 65 per cent of the EEC guideline amounts of £420 and £280.  After that the full cost of the annuity must be borne by the State.  In the case of the premium, which is also pitched at a very generous level, there will be no EEC contribution at all and the full cost must be met from our own Exchequer.</P>
    <P>The annuities will be paid in what I would like to describe as real money because, as I have already said, there is provision for increasing them periodically to take account of cost of living increases: in other words, the scheme contains an inflation buffer.  The married farmer can be reassured in the knowledge that in the event of his death his widow will continue to get an annuity for her lifetime.</P>
    <P>I hope I have dealt with the scheme in sufficient depth to enable Deputies to appreciate the vital role which its operation will play in the future land settlement policy of this country.  I am <Col N="580" /> satisfied that the scheme is a highly attractive one and I am confident that its generous terms will make it acceptable throughout the country.  In the interests of structural reform in agriculture it is imperative that the scheme evoke a substantial response. Already the indications are that it is being well received: the number of applications received in the half year since promulgation of the scheme is close to 1,000 and already 74 applicants have been adjudged eligible. Most of these&mdash;65 in all&mdash;want to sell to the Land Commission and in these cases purchase proceedings are in progress. To date, 61 applications have been refused because they did not fulfil some of the basic conditions of the scheme.  The remaining applications are at various stages of the examination process.</P>
    <P>Before concluding it would be remiss of me not to acknowledge again the very real help and assistance given to me by the farming organisations while the scheme was being formulated.  I, with my advisers, have had lengthy discussions with these organisations and I have gladly accepted and incorporated in the final product many useful suggestions put forward by them.  I will be relying on these organisations to publicise the attractions of the scheme throughout the rural community and to foster and encourage applications from suitably qualified farmers.</P>
    <P>Rural Deputies, too, can make their contribution by supporting and advocating the scheme energetically throughout their constituencies and I will be relying on their support to make the scheme a winner.  I am only too well aware of the psychological barriers which will have to be breached if the scheme is to be a real success&mdash; the strong bond that ties the farmer to his land, a mixture of tradition, status and prestige.  That is why the incentives have been pitched at such a liberal and compelling level.  What we must do is to appeal to any farmer who is not happy with his present position to study the terms of the scheme very carefully and assess in relation to his own circumstances what it has to offer for him.  It is my <Col N="581" /> sincere hope that the retirement scheme, in conjunction with its partnering farm modernisation scheme, will be truly effective in this new and voluntary campaign towards securing an abiding and lasting improvement in agricultural land structure in this country.</P>
    <P>Turning to the Forestry Vote the provision here, as in the case of the Lands Vote, is for the nine months April to December, 1974, and the net provision for this period is £6,010,000. This nine-month Estimate is not comparable with last year's 12-month Estimate of £7,812,000 but an Estimate for the 12 months April, 1974 to March, 1975, prepared on the same basis as the nine-month Estimate under discussion, shows that the net provision would have been £8,108,000, an increase of £296,000 compared with last year's Estimate.  This increase which, of course, is reflected in the Estimate under debate is mainly due to the 15th-round increases in salaries and wages and to price increases for oils, fertilisers and other materials amounting to £1,070,000, partly offset by increased provision under Appropriations-in-Aid&mdash;subhead J&mdash; of £614,000, and a reduction in the provision for Subhead CI, Acquisition of Land, of £160,000.</P>
    <P>In the course of what follows I do not intend to examine in detail the following subheads of the Vote which provide for about the same level of activity as in the full year's Estimate for 1973-74.  They are:</P>
    <P>Subhead A, Salaries, Wages and Allowances at £1,790,000; Subhead B2, Post Office Services at £46,000; Subhead C3, Sawmilling at £57,000; Subhead E, Forestry Education at £45,000; Subhead F, John F. Kennedy Park at £34,000 and Subhead I, Agency Advisory and Special Services at £45,000.</P>
    <P>Subhead BI, Travelling and Incidental Expenses at £438,000, shows a higher level of average expenditure than the 1973-74 provision.  The increase reflected in the nine-month Estimate is mainly due to increased travelling allowances but includes also increased subsistence costs and some increase in the level of travelling <Col N="582" /> arising from the extension of the State forest area.</P>
    <P>Subhead CI is the grant-in-aid for acquisition of land.  The balance remaining in the fund at 1st April, 1974 was £834,431 and, in view of the size of this balance, I am providing in this estimate a sum of £250,000 only, giving a total sum available for land acquisition for the nine months ending 31st December, 1974, of £1,084,431.</P>
    <P>The gross areas acquired in the years 1972-73 and 1973-74, 12-monthly periods ending 31st March, were 14,629 hectares, 36,148 acres, and 9,816 hectares, 24,256 acres, respectively.</P>
    <P>The difficulty in reaching price agreement for the purchase of land for State forestry and the trend towards a slower rate of closing of sales referred to by me in my speech on the Estimate for last year have become even more acute.  These adverse trends are due mainly to unsettled conditions in the general market for land as well as to a hesitancy on the part of owners in offering lands at all for forestry; owners are obviously reluctant to sell until a clearer picture emerges of the effects of the various EEC Directives in the area of agriculture.</P>
    <P>In these conditions it is very difficult to predict future acquisition prospects.  Deputies may rest assured, however, that no effort is being spared in our endeavour to attain our acquisition targets.</P>
    <P>So far as availability of money is concerned I should state that the total of £1,084,431 available for land acquisition in the nine months ending 31st December, 1974 is the highest figure made available for any similar period so that purchase of land has not in any way been inhibited by lack of funds.</P>
    <P>I should say that even if a temporary setback in the level of land acquisition, arising from the factors outlined above, should occur, the existing reserve of lands on hand would enable my Department to maintain the present level of planting for at least the next few years.</P>
    <P>Subhead C2, Forest Development <Col N="583" /> and Management, at £4,830,000 is the main expenditure subhead in this Vote.  The major provisions in the subhead relate to the raising of nursery stock in the State forest nurseries, the establishment costs of all new plantations including ground preparation and fencing, road and bridge construction, the development of facilities for public recreation in our forests, the purchase and maintenance of forest machinery and the hire of suitable machinery from outside sources, the general cost of maintaining and protecting all our existing forest plantations, and, finally, the cost of such timber felling and conversion as we undertake by direct labour in the forests.  The total provision for the current year at £4,830,000 is the equivalent of a sum of £6,332,000 for a full year which would represent an increase of £805,000 on the provision of £5,527,000 for 1973-74.</P>
    <P>The provisions for State Forest Nurseries, subhead C2 (1), at £280,000; New Roads and Buildings, subhead C2 (3), at £390,000 and Timber Conversion, subhead C2 (7), at £290,000 cover much the same level of activity as obtained in these operations in recent years but reflect also increases in wages and prices.</P>
    <P>Subhead C2 (2), at £1,390,000 is in respect of the Establishment of Plantations. The target of planting 10,000 hectares was achieved in 1973-74. Provision is being made under this head for preliminary work in connection with a full planting programme of 10,000 hectares though much of the actual planting will be undertaken in the period January to March, 1975, which does not come within the scope of this Estimate. Apart from the ever-increasing labour costs there is a further heavy increase, equivalent to £132,000 in a full year, in the cost of manures which have more than doubled in price due to external factors.  Inevitably in State forestry we are dealing with less fertile areas and the use of manures&mdash; particularly ground mineral phosphate &mdash;is a feature of afforestation in Ireland.  In view of the increasing cost <Col N="584" /> of artifical manures a special examination has been made with a view to securing the utmost economy in their use but a heavy increase in overall cost is inevitable.</P>
    <P>Subhead C2 (4), Amenity Development in the State Forests, at £170,000 represents an increase of £55,000 for a full year on the provision for 1973-74.  Here, again, the increase is largely a reflection of rising costs, but the amount sought will cope also with a continuing improvement in visitor facilities and provide in part for a major amenity development at Killykeen, County Cavan, where work has already commenced on a forest park project.  This project, which I expect will be completed by mid-1976, will provide full visitor facilities, including a restaurant and shop, in one of the most picturesque spots on Lough Oughter which forms part of the Erne system.  The overall cost of the project, estimated at over £100,000 will be spread over a three-year period.</P>
    <P>On amenity generally, Deputies will be interested to know that, at a conservative estimate, more than a million people visited the State forests in the year ended 31st March last. The forest parks, of course, claimed the major share of this attendance, but in all parts of the country tourists and our own people have shown their appreciation of the &ldquo;open forest&rdquo; policy by visiting even the most out-of-the-way of the 300 areas that are now open to public access.</P>
    <P>Under Subhead C2 (5), the provision of £750,000 for Mechanical Equipment for Forest Development and Management covers the purchase, hire and maintenance of machinery. Again, the increase in the level of spending as compared with 1973-74 is mainly due to labour costs but a further impost is the increased cost of fuel.  Subhead C2 (6), General Forest Management, at £1,560,000 is the most labour-intensive item of the C.2 subhead, accounting for almost 40 per cent of the total labour provision, and thus the increased labour costs are most in evidence here.  The ever-increasing forest estate which at 31st March, 1974, stood at 320,000 hectares, 790,000 acres, inevitably involves <Col N="585" /> some increase in maintenance costs also.  Apart from labour costs, this subhead provides for protection of forests, building and road repairs and other miscellaneous matters necessary to the day-to-day upkeep of the forests.</P>
    <P>With regard to protection, the incidence of forest fires continues to give cause for concern.  In 1973 fire destroyed 293 hectares valued at £27,500, while in 1974 in the months of April and May alone a further 530 hectares of forest valued at £52,000 were destroyed by fire.  Even though this is not the danger season, I would again appeal for the utmost care in the lighting of fires in the vicinity of forests and also in the discarding of cigarettes and matches.  Let me repeat also the assurance which I gave last year to the hill farmer who wishes to burn to improve grazing that if he notifies the Garda and the local forester in writing and co-operates with the local forestry staff in agreeing a date for the burning there will be no question of a prosecution should his moor burning get out of hand and cause damage to a State forest.</P>
    <P>The State forests are, after all, the people's own investment, providing wealth for the future as well as produce for industry and pleasure in their recreational facilities in the present.  It is in everybody's interest that they are not damaged through lack of care.</P>
    <P>Subhead D, Grants for Afforestation purposes, at £30,000, is in line with the increased level of planting grant provided for the first time in 1972-73. Frankly, the response, in terms of new planting, to the increased level of grant, has been disappointing.  A total of only 246 hectares, 608 acres, was approved for planting grant in 1973-74 against 300 hectares the previous year.  The present reluctance to plant may reflect the general caution of landowners in undertaking planting on their lands pending clarification of their ultimate position under EEC directives as I mentioned earlier.  The position is being kept under review.</P>
    <P>Subhead G, £60,000 relates to Game Development and Management.  The main expenditure under the subhead is on grants to regional game councils to <Col N="586" /> assist game development schemes throughout the country.  These schemes, which are formulated and operated in consultation with the Department's advisory staff, relate principally to restocking programmes, habitat development and control of predators.  Some financial provision for tourist projects, that is, the provision of game shooting facilities for visiting sportsmen under projects sponsored jointly by my Department and Bord Fáilte, is also made available under this subhead.  The final elements in the subhead relate to game development in a number of State forests and other minor expenses affecting the game development programme.</P>
    <P>I am glad to say that the marked improvement in dealing with game council's schemes in consultation with the National Association of Regional Game Councils has been maintained and I am confident that the harmonious relations established with that organisation will help significantly towards improving and accelerating game development throughout the country.</P>
    <P>As I have already mentioned, my Department and Bord Fáilte are jointly engaged in stimulating the development of shooting facilities for visiting sportsmen.  A scheme is in operation whereby grants are made available to assist projects catering for out of State &ldquo;guns&rdquo;, subject, of course, to the maintenance of high standards of sportsmanship.  However, I should like to repeat that there can be no welcome for visitors&mdash;and particularly large groups&mdash;who arrive here for game shooting without first having made <i>bona fide</i> arrangements for their shooting holiday; and any hotel or agency which gives the impression to outsiders that there is an abundance of &ldquo;free&rdquo; game-shooting in this country is doing a major disservice to the tourist industry.</P>
    <P>The need for strict control over people who come here to shoot&mdash;not only in relation to the numbers coming and the shooting pressure which they would exert but also as regards their general attitude to shooting in Ireland&mdash;is clearly recognised <Col N="587" /> both by my Department and by Bord Fáilte.</P>
    <P>Repeated criticism is heard&mdash;and some of it is probably well founded&mdash; of uncontrolled game shooting by visitors.  This is an aspect on which the National Association of Regional Game Councils has been pressing for some remedial action and, following prolonged discussions with that organisation, I can now announce that special arrangements are being made with the Department of Justice regarding the issue of certain firearm certificates to visitors coming to this country.</P>
    <P>Under the new system, visiting sportsmen will have to apply to my Department rather than to the Department of Justice for firearm certificates for shotguns and they will be required to furnish advance details of the arrangements made by them for their shooting holiday.  The certificates will be issued by my Department, as agent of the Minister for Justice, only after the most careful assessment.</P>
    <P>Moreover, as part of the revised arrangements, the existing facility whereby visitors on arrival could obtain shotgun certificates at customs posts on payment of the appropriate excise duty will be discontinued. These new arrangements will come into effect on 1st April, 1975 and will be well publicised both at home and abroad in advance of the operative date.  The system will, I believe, go a long way towards eliminating the distrust which the native sportsman sometimes feels towards the visiting gun and will also hopefully enable more attractive shooting holidays to be made available to <i>bona fide</i> visitors.</P>
    <P>Each year a game birds protection order is made setting out the open seasons for the various game species and also defining &ldquo;no shooting&rdquo; areas or sanctuaries.  Following the 1974 order made by me on 5th July last, the number of such sanctuaries stands at 41.  These are widely dispersed throughout the country and constitute an important element in the national wildlife conservation programme.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="588" /> Subhead H is a Conservation Grant-in-Aid to meet the cost of projects approved of or undertaken by my Department or any other Department. There is as yet a substantial balance in the grant-in-aid account and while conservation projects currently being undertaken by my Department will involve a heavy financial commitment from these funds, it is not considered necessary, for the nine month period ending on 31st December next, to seek funds for this subhead on the same level as in recent years.  Accordingly, a sum of £35,000 is proposed.</P>
    <P>In addition to the increased number of sanctuaries&mdash;to which I have already referred&mdash;the Forest and Wildlife Service is engaged in a varied programme of wildlife conservation projects, including several major activities. In February last I had the pleasure of formally opening the first National Wildfowl Reserve on the North Slob in Wexford in the presence of a distinguished and representative international gathering.  This reserve, which is internationally significant as the principal wintering ground of the Greenland whitefronted goose, is already attracting considerable attention from visitors; indeed, already this year some 10,000 people, including many from overseas, have visited the reserve.  Development of Portumna Forest as a wildlife park, where people can appreciate at first hand and in natural surroundings the animals, especially deer, bird life and flora of the forest park, is progressing satisfactorily. The barnacle goose is the subject of a less ambitious project at Lissadell in County Sligo.</P>
    <P>The research and educational aspects of wild life conservation are not being neglected.  A survey has been carried out by Forest and Wildlife Service personnel of the conservation prospects of native woodlands, mainly oak, and practical measures aimed at promoting the natural regeneration of several oak woodlands are being introduced.</P>
    <P>Other wildlife species which are subject to research by the Forest and Wildlife Service include deer and pine marten, and it is hoped to extend <Col N="589" /> research to other species such as the otter and badger in the near future. Research on other species such as grouse, mallard, woodcock, peragrine falcon, squirrel and so on, is being undertaken by outside agencies for the Forest and Wildlife Service on a commission basis.  The overall aim of these projects is to assemble maximum information on behaviour, food habits, population and distribution of these species with a view to ensuring their conservation in Ireland.</P>
    <P>Financial assistance has again been given to conservation organisations in connection with their observation, survey and census work on certain species of wild birds.  On the educational side, the annual series of weekend residential conservation courses for youth leaders at Avondale is being maintained with growing interest and new lecture aids have been provided. Information leaflets and booklets are being provided to meet the steady demand from teachers, school children and so forth for suitable literature.</P>
    <P>New legislation to support the work already being done by my Department in the sphere of wildlife conservation and the envisaged expanded future programme, is a priority item. On 16th July last the first stage of the Wildlife Bill, 1974 was taken on long and short titles.  I had hoped to circulate the Bill during the summer recess but drafting of this lengthy measure has proved more time-consuming than was expected.  However, I am glad to say that this work has just now been completed and I expect to be in a position to circulate the text shortly with a view to having the Second Stage taken.</P>
    <P>Subhead J, Appropriations-in-Aid, at a figure of £1,650,000 is the equivalent of a sum of £2,100,000 for a full year representing an increase of £572,000 over the 1973-74 Estimate for timber sales.  At this stage we can be sure of reaching our target of receipts for the period but it is clear that the earlier buoyancy of the market for timber has disappeared and thus conditions are likely to be much more difficult during 1975.</P>
    <P>I have already mentioned EEC <Col N="590" /> directives in the area of agriculture and their possible impact on land acquisition and on private forestry.  Deputies may be interested to know that, at present, a proposal for a Council directive concerning forestry measures is under consideration.  In its present form the proposal offers little overall benefit in Irish conditions because of the emphasis which it places on subvention of private rather than State afforestation.  This and various other aspects of the proposal are at present under examination by a working group of the Council at which our views on the extension of the proposal to cover State afforestation are being pressed.  I would prefer not to outline in detail all the implications of the proposal at this stage when it is still under examination and open to substantial alterations or, indeed, rejection.</P>
    <P>Finally, let me emphasise the importance of our forests not only to the present but to our future economy.  In assessing Ireland's situation in the field of forestry we should realise that notwithstanding the heavy afforestation programme undertaken in recent years we are still the most lightly afforested country in the EEC and indeed in Europe.  Bearing in mind that the entire EEC is heavily dependent on the importation of timber and timber products and will continue to be a net importer for the foreseeable future, the long term importance of our afforestation programme can be more readily appreciated.</P>
    <P>In a world which has made heavy, if not prodigal use of its basic raw materials, timber is almost unique in being the renewable asset.  Its availability in each generation depends on the foresight of their predecessors and on the willingness of successive generations to invest in the future.</P>
    <P>Our Irish forests through direct and indirect impact already provide employment for 7,000 men.  This is at a time when our ultimate State programme of afforestation is far from complete and when only about 20 per cent of our forests are producing material for industry.  The potential of forestry to <Col N="591" /> provide employment in ancillary fields in the context of a ready European market makes it essential that, whatever the temporary difficulties that beset us, we bend our efforts to maintaining the planting programme at present levels.  You may be assured that, in so far as that is achievable, it will be my intention to do so.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cunningham</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister devoted 11 of his 20 pages on the Lands section of the Estimate to the retirement pension scheme.  That was correct because it is a good scheme, but more pages should have been devoted to other aspects of the Department.  The pension scheme was the only really new achievement noted in the Lands section of the Minister's speech.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the section of the Minister's speech dealing with forestry there is reference to the regulations concerning the bringing in of guns by those coming on a game holiday to Ireland. I want to compliment the Minister on this and also on changing the procedure, which operated heretofore, whereby certificates could be issued at the various frontier posts along the land frontier.  This has been advocated <Col N="592" /> by game councils, especially in the Northern counties, and I am sure the Minister has had many representations in this regard.</P>
    <P>The Minister in his opening statement on this Estimate last year stated that seldom if ever has a Minister for Lands entered on his term of office at a more challenging time. These were the sentiments of a new Minister for Lands shortly after taking over the Department.  Judging by the document put before us and the Minister's speech to the House today the major project is the retirement scheme, which I will deal with at some length later.</P>
    <P>I should like to refer to a few urgent matters which the Minister mentioned last year but about which this year he has not indicated he is doing anything. I refer particularly to the question of payment through land bonds for land acquired.  The Minister said that the number of cash payments is increasing year by year.  This is only natural, because the retirement scheme accounts for a great part of the estimated £2½ million the Minister mentioned.  It was the policy of the previous Ministers to have a bigger percentage of cash payments.  Various methods have been, and are being, adopted to bring about this.</P>
    <P>This leaves us with the problem of land bonds.  The Minister should give an indication that at an early stage he will deal with severe hardship cases brought about because of payments in land bonds.  I know the Minister's answer, like that of previous Ministers. will be that it would be difficult to find sufficient capital to deal with this problem in one go.  But I suggest that those who have land bonds which are not yielding any interest, those which stand at a very low price, should be dealt with.  The previous owners have passed on and the present owners are now the wives or families of the people from whom the Land Commission acquired the land.  The Minister should try to satisfy these people gradually by making cash payments or giving them an opportunity to transfer their land bond investments to current national loans.  This would be an indication <Col N="593" /> of goodwill by the Department and would be appreciated by people who may in the future be thinking of selling their land.  In each national loan there should be a certain allocation which could be taken up by the exchange of land bonds.  That would be of great benefit to the people all over the country.  Those who know the problem are angry that something is not being done about it.</P>
    <P>Another matter, which the Minister mentioned last year but omitted this year, is the commonage problem.  It is a major problem in the west because it is keeping out of the pool of productive land, land which should be giving of its best.  This would not always be in tillage because the major part of it is grazing land held in common.</P>
    <P>I was about to say at the prices at present being obtained for livestock, all the land could be occupied, but it does not really matter about prices because bad prices will disappear and in the future this commonage should be fully utilised in production for the nation and for export.  Many holders or shareholders in commonage, having had their own section mapped out, would be prepared to fence it, rough plough it, reseed it and do the various things which could bring it back into reasonable production but they are hampered by disagreements among some shareholders.  Some shareholders may be absent and cannot be found and others who live locally are not willing to share in any scheme.</P>
    <P>There are schemes under the Minister's Department which are very good where people are encouraged to do a re-allocation job, designating the exact territory of each holder.  Some people have combined and done this. I know one area in particular where instead of asking for a division of commonage the people fenced the commonage together and got the county council to put up Australian gates on roadways through it with the result that they had a co-operative unit which is now productive and where cattle and sheep do not raid local farmers' crops.  Examples like this are too few and I suggest that the <Col N="594" /> Minister should introduce legislation where there is neither a co-operative effort with regard to commonage nor where the commonage shareholders do not agree to come together and have their own portions delineated under existing legislation.</P>
    <P>I urged this last year.  The Minister mentioned this as a problem then.  He said he went to the western counties and saw the problem for himself.  I appreciate this and congratulate him on it but my talking about it and his seeing the problem are no good unless something is done about it and the Minister is the person who can do something about it.  I ask him to do it.</P>
    <P>I now come to the farm retirement scheme which is a very good scheme for those wishing to avail of it, for people who have reached retirement age or who have reached the stage of having no income from their holdings. As the Minister said, it is better than the EEC scheme but there are a few questions I should like to ask.  In general, I know how it works.  The Minister says that at the age of 65 this is a scheme subsidised to the tune of 65 per cent.  I suppose that figure can only be an estimate.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJFitzpatrick" hpid="Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick (Cavan) Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick (Cavan)">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Cavan):</i> The actual subsidisation figure has not yet been finally agreed with Brussels but, having regard to the guidelines and the criteria necessary, I am satisfied that we are almost certain to qualify for a 65 per cent subsidy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LiamCunningham" hpid="Mr. Cunningham Mr. Cunningham">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cunningham</NameTxt>
      <P>One cannot be certain, there are so many factors involved.  The cost to the Exchequer here will vary from year to year.  The percentage is variable because it will depend on the ages of those taking part and it will depend on the dropouts at 65.  Am I right in saying that the Minister gives the impression that this retirement scheme will be subsidised by the EEC until the recipient reaches the age of 65, the State is then fully financially committed to the cost thereafter?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJFitzpatrick" hpid="Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick (Cavan) Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick (Cavan)">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Col N="595" />
    <Speaker pid="LiamCunningham" hpid="Mr. Cunningham Mr. Cunningham">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cunningham</NameTxt>
      <P>Surely a large proportion of the persons concerned will be people who would normally be entitled to old age pensions and old age pensions in a couple of years time will be paid at 65?  Will not those aged 65 normally be entitled as owners of small farms to old age pensions? This is the first question: Will these retired farmers receive the old age pension as well as the pension mentioned here?  There are two types of old age pension, contributory and non-contributory and there is a means test for the non-contributory pension. When I mention old age pensions I want to include the other social welfare benefits because they are available from age 55 upwards.</P>
      <P>There is a retirement pension at 55. I want to mention all social welfare benefits.  Could we have a situation&mdash;it would be as well for the Minister to clarify it and, if he cannot, through the Department of Social Welfare&mdash; where a non-contributory person, whether it be for unemployment benefit, old age pension or retirement pension, could be debarred from a pension on the grounds of means? There can be a situation in which small farmers who have outside part-time employment may have social welfare contributions.  In that case, irrespective of a means test, they would be entitled to social welfare benefits, of unemployment at age 55, continuing up to retirement pension&mdash; that is social welfare&mdash;at 65 and then old age pension, as of now, at age 68. Can you have that anomaly, that the farmer who is not a contributor to the social welfare code will suffer and the part-time farmer who is the contributor&mdash;say a farmer with a 60 per cent occupation of the land and 40 per cent occupation in outside employment&mdash; will have a distinct advantage over the other?  Perhaps the Minister would clarify that, not alone in respect of old age pensions but in regard to the other social welfare benefits as well.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I hate to mention the question of income tax.  I suppose the Minister for Finance will tax these incomes as well as all others.  There is another question I want to ask which arises from a statement made in the course of the Minister's brief and, indeed, in <Col N="596" /> the very excellent brochures which have been issued that the Department would be responsible for normal expenses by the vendor of the holding. Does this include auction fees?  There is the person who offers the holding direct to the Department of Lands and the other who is approached by an auctioneer who, in turn, demands auctioneers' fees.  I should like to have the position here clarified by the Minister.  Here, again, I want to take a little further the suggestion of the Minister with which I completely agree.  Indeed, I think the same point was raised by Macra na Feirme or by some of the farming organisations, that is, the particular emphasis laid on the voluntary aspect of the farm retirement scheme.  I think this is right.  It could not be over-stressed. The impression should not go abroad that this is a back door way of implementing a Mansholt or any other scheme, that it is not a method devised to get rid of small farmers.  At various meetings I have made this clear to people in small farming areas&mdash;it is a good scheme but they should not in any way be influenced by anybody if they are not ready for retirement.</P>
    <P>Unfortunately, and perhaps unknown to the Minister&mdash;at least, I hope unknown to the Minister&mdash; reports have come from a number of counties that auctioneers are going around&mdash;indeed in two of the reports I received it was alleged that some officials of the Land Commission accompanied them&mdash;saying to the small farmer: you had better go for this scheme now because it may not be there very long, or the terms of the scheme may not be available very long.  I deplore that practice.  In two cases of which I have knowledge the Land Commission official was present when such a statement was made by the auctioneer.  The Department of Lands should not be associated in any way with this practice and, if any auctioneer is doing this, he should be severely reprimanded.  Dangling a carrot to get small farmers to give up their holdings through fear is not a practice that should be encouraged. I know it is not a practice in which the Minister for Lands wants to engage but it is being done.  I have had <Col N="597" /> definite reports from a number of counties with two data-supported reports from two counties.  Perhaps the Minister would say, when replying, how such auctioneers are appointed.  Have they been appointed specifically for the scheme or have they been taken from the list of auctioneers compiled in the Department of Lands over the years?</P>
    <P>I do regard as important the farming community, the average small farmer, the medium-sized farmer.  In the past they have done a good job for the country.  They have and can keep up production.  It is Fianna Fáil policy to encourage small farmers to produce as much as possible&mdash;and they have done so in the past&mdash;and that off-farm employment should be made available to these people.  It is when they feel they are at the end of the day only, that they are unable, for a number of reasons, to continue farming that they should retire.</P>
    <P>The next point I want to make&mdash; again dealing with small farmers&mdash;is the title to holdings.  Under the 1965 and previous Land Acts there was provision for the acquisition of titles by smallholders.  The situation in this country, especially in the west where land values and prices were small, when the father, grandfather, or great grandfather died, nobody made an effort to properly acquire the title. Indeed, the title held by the deceased may not have been that perfect.</P>
    <P>There is much unsatisfactory holding of land in the west especially in view of the emigration level for that part of the country.  As Deputies from the west we find time and again that because of this the people concerned are at a disadvantage and are harassed in regard to such matters as SDA loans, specific instance houses and many other such problems because they cannot obtain title to their holdings quickly and, above all, cheaply. I urge that a change be made in the 1965 Act to rectify this situation.</P>
    <P>I would suggest that the 12 year period which, prior to the 1965 Act, was known as the squatters' title period be reduced to six months.  Up to 1965 this situation was dealt with by a person requesting a local excise officer to do the needful but the 1965 <Col N="598" /> Act transferred the matter to the county registrar.  There is need for further improvement in so far as this matter is concerned and for the whole thing to be simplified further because at present the procedure is not simple. One must go to a county registrar in the first instance, an officer who usually has plenty of work to do, and who will advise going to a solicitor and the person is then faced with the problem for which the relevant section of the 1965 Act was devised.</P>
    <P>I turn now to the question of land acquisition.  In reply to a question tabled earlier and to which I received a written reply yesterday I am aware that the area of land acquired in this financial year, up to the 30th September, was 76,000 acres.  I presume that this includes land acquired both compulsorily and in cases where the effort was voluntary.  This figure seems rather small for a six month period.  It would allow for holdings of 76 acres to be given to each of 100 people in the half-year.  At that rate of progress we could hardly be able to deal ever with the problems of the division of derelict estates or estates which are not operating at optimum production and at the same time make available to the progressive farmers the land which they need badly.</P>
    <P>There is much talk of speculation in land and of the purchase of land by foreigners.  If the figure I have quoted is a true indication of the rate of purchase by the Land Commission, we might as well stop talking about the purchase of land by non-nationals be cause if the Land Commission prevent, as they should prevent in many instances, the purchase of land by non-nationals or by speculators, be these speculators national or otherwise, they must be prepared to purchase the land that they have prevented being sold.</P>
    <P>I have personal knowledge of holdings in my constituency where in relation to acquisition the Land Commission have gone so far but have not acquired the land involved, when the people concerned and the public representatives in the area thought that acquisition would be effected.  For very good reasons I recommended withdrawal <Col N="599" /> by the Land Commission in one or two of the cases concerned.  However, it is not something that I would recommend by and large.</P>
    <P>The purpose of land acquisition should be twofold: first, to take up land which may otherwise be purchased by foreigners or speculators and secondly, to make available more land for the small or medium sized farmer who is a good farmer and who can get the optimum production from the limited amount of land he has and where it can be shown that the acquisition of further land will enable him to provide for his family and to produce food not only for his family but for the nation and for the export trade.</P>
    <P>Down through the years there has been the question of the landless man's entitlement to land that is acquired by the Land Commission.  I have been a strong advocate of the conacre farmer, the landless man who lives in an area where land husbandry is of the best.  I am talking of the man who can take land by the conacre system in competition with farmers whose holdings are bigger than his, the man who can make a profit in this way, who has the equipment to work the land, who has cattle and who has the expertise to make him a good farmer. The fact that such a man does not own land should not militate against him when the question arises of the distribution of holdings in his area.  In most cases these people are natives of the area in which the land is being distributed.  Perhaps, they would be capable of doing a better job than is done by some migrants.  The retirement scheme is linked with the acquisition of land and we must have regard to the type of person who acquires land that has become available as a result of farmers retiring.  The first priority is the development farmer, the man who has agreed with the Department of Agriculture and Fisheries on a development scheme to make his farm viable.</P>
    <P>The conacre farmer does not sign for unemployment assistance, neither does he draw unemployment benefit. He earns his own income but he has <Col N="600" /> no land.  I am not suggesting he should get a pension scheme if he retires from conacre farming but he should be given land.  The Minister stated that the development farmer had first priority and that the transitional farmer would come next if any land was left when the holding of the retired person was divided.</P>
    <P>This may give rise to problems because there may be areas where development farmers having 45 acres or more are thin on the ground.  If neighbouring farmers within a mile of the farm, those who are not development farmers, are passed over in favour of a development farmer who may be living a distance of more than one mile away, there will be trouble.  I should like the Minister to clarify the situation where there are no development farmers in the immediate vicinity of the farm of the retired person.  I have genuine fears about this aspect and it may be a problem militating against the retirement scheme.</P>
    <P>I tabled a question in connection with the retirement scheme and the information appears to be different from that contained in the Minister's statement.  We have been told that negotiations on price have been successfully concluded in 25 cases.  I did not ask for the number of applications under the EEC scheme and I do not know if the Minister has given any figures of the numbers.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cunningham</NameTxt>
      <P>I will accept that.  It is not surprising that only 25 cases have been finalised considering the scheme has been in operation since 1st May.  I do not know if it was necessary or wise for the Minister to issue the names of the first two applicants who succeeded in getting their pensions under the scheme.  I doubt the wisdom of it.  This is a confidential matter and if a person wants to offer his land and get a pension it is a matter between himself and the Land Commission.  He may go to his Deputy but I do not suppose he will want to broadcast the fact around the country.  Any Deputy worth his salt <Col N="601" /> will not broadcast private discussions between himself and a constituent. My first thought was to question whether some of the people whom I had assisted in completing forms would be happy if their applications were publicised in the same way as the two persons referred to.  The names of the people concerned are public enough but I will not mention them in this House.  I am sure the Minister had their premission to name them but if they got a good price for their land they might not have been prepared to refuse the Minister's request.  In the cases concerned they got a good price; I do not know whether the extra price was tit-for-tat for a bit of advertising of the scheme.</P>
      <P>I should like to deal with the question of bogs administered by the Department of Lands.  During the war an excellent effort was made by the Land Commission on the construction of roads to bogs in order to enable people to beat the fuel crisis of the emergency days by providing their own hand-won turf.  Last year I advocated that the Department of Lands should activate themselves on the same lines in what is now a fuel emergency crisis. I also suggested that the Minister for Transport and Power and the Minister for Local Government should do something about the matter.  The Government should use a home resource to supplement our supplies in this period of fuel crisis.  Last year we advocated that existing bog roads be repaired, that new roads be made so that those who wanted to look after their fuel needs could do so.  We suggested that if people were unemployed or were not in full-time employment they could help to make fuel available for others who were unable to work in the bogs.</P>
      <P>It may seem old-fashioned to advocate using our turf resources.  It is not; it is a very serious matter and I will keep advocating this course until the Government do something about it, whether it is the Minister for Lands, the Minister for Industry and Commerce through Bord na Móna or the Minister for Local Government.  I will continue to advocate that the opportunity should be given to those who wish to do so, and they are many.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="602" /> The number in the bogs in the western counties last spring was an all-time record.  I believe the number was even greater than at any time during the war years.  I believe the Minister should give a lead, make new roads into bogs, lay out the bogs and allocate them to people who desire turf banks and who will utilise the banks if they are allocated to them.</P>

      <P>I move:</P>
      <P>That Dáil Éireann calls on the Government to introduce a comprehensive scheme of free legal aid in civil and criminal matters.</P>
      <P>I recommend this motion to the House with as much sincerity as I can command. In putting down this motion calling on the Government to introduce a comprehensive scheme of free legal aid in civil and criminal matters I would be hoping, to some extent, to be pushing an open door.  I believe that there exists to-day a favourable climate in this regard because various statements which have emanated from Government sources would indicate that the Government are favourably disposed towards something along the lines I am advocating.  In particular, I should like to recommend this motion to the Minister for Justice as something he might undertake with enthusiasm because I believe it provides him with an opportunity of making a valuable contribution, as Minister for Justice, towards the improvement of the general situation for which he has responsibility.  If I were he I should certainly be very anxious to go down in parliamentary history as the Minister who introduced a comprehensive and enlightened scheme along the lines envisaged in this motion.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Despite the terms of the motion, which would seem to indicate that it is primarily a legal matter with which we are concerned, in fact this concept of mine is much more concerned with the social side of things rather than the purely legal side.  It relates to the situation of the individual <Col N="603" /> in society and I propose it to the Minister as something in the nature of an improvement in our social welfare rather than a mere academic rounding off or perfecting of our legal structures.  In proposing a comprehensive scheme of free legal aid we should be concerned with helping the individual and the family in society to cope with the problems of the modern, complex, complicated society in which we live.  In order to consider the motion fully and fairly I would like Deputies to ponder on the legal problems with which the individual and the family have to contend in their everyday lives.  In our discussion of this motion I should like Members to try to get away from any idea that we are here concerned with legal battles or dramatic procedures in courts or that this relates to isolated incidents in the life of the individual and the family.</P>
    <P>I want to get across to the House that we are in this area concerned very much with the everyday affairs of ordinary everyday men and women and, in deciding on the motion, that is the context in which we should come to a decision.  In so far as financial obligations are involved, I would hope that Members would consider the motion in the light of the expenditure involved as an expenditure designed to improve the social environment of ordinary men and women in their everyday lives rather than something that is strictly a matter for lawyers in court.</P>
    <P>I do not think I need emphasise to Deputies what is involved because I believe every Deputy is fully aware of the distress, hardship and unhappiness that can arise from legal problems in the life of the individual and the family.  I want to try to keep in the forefront of our minds in this discussion the fact that we are here dealing with human problems, human distress and human unhappiness and, indeed, in many cases human hardship and, just as our social policies are designed to improve the living standards of ordinary men and women and to make life more bearable for them and improve the quality <Col N="604" /> of their lives, so must our legal system and our policy in regard to that system be so designed.</P>
    <P>Since I put down this motion some time ago there have been a number of developments which have an important bearing on this whole matter. The most important of these was undoubtedly the publication of a report by the Committee on Court Practice and Procedure; it is, I think, the 19th report dealing with desertion and maintenance.  There have also been reports issued by the free legal advice centres, and a report by the Free Legal Advisory Bureau in Cork.  These reports have aroused a considerable amount of public interest and have given rise to a considerable amount of discussion on the situation which they have outlined for us.  The Minister is fully aware of the existence of the AIM group.  They have done a great deal of work and said quite an amount about the situation which exists in the area with which my motion is concerned.</P>
    <P>We have, of course, already a system of free legal aid in criminal cases.  I hope the House will bear with me if I remind them that it was I who introduced this scheme many years ago when I was Minister for Justice. The reason I mention that is that I want to emphasise that, when that scheme was introduced, it was introduced very much on an experimental basis.  It was brought in at that time very much as a start.  It was never intended that it would be the last word.</P>
    <P>I have a very clear recollection of the inauguration of that scheme.  In the financial circumstances of that time, it was very difficult to get it through the administrative machine, to get it through the Government and, in particular, to get it through the Minister for Finance and the Department of Finance of that day.  There was a fairly understandable worry on the part of the Department of Finance and the Minister and, indeed, others about the financial implications of the introduction of that scheme.  As a result, it was hedged around with all sorts of limitations and qualifications, all of which were designed to <Col N="605" /> ensure that it would not become a very serious financial burden and that it would not become, as many new schemes of that sort become, a major drain on the Exchequer.  It was introduced very timorously and tentatively.</P>
    <P>I must confess to very considerable disappointment that it is still in the rather embryonic state in which it was introduced, with all those limitations and qualifications which were built into it at the beginning as a precaution, because it was being brought in very much on a trial and error basis.  Whatever else it has become as a scheme, it certainly has not become a major financial problem for the Department of Justice or the Department of Finance.  I am subject to correction here but I think the money allocated for it is still in the region of £40,000 or £50,000 and that even this meagre sum&mdash;meagre in Exchequer terms&mdash;is not fully availed of in every year.</P>
    <P>I want to underline to the House that, in considering this matter, we must have regard to the scheme which exists and we must not for one moment assume that it is a satisfactory scheme.  In fact, quite the reverse.  I do not think that as a scheme it is working very well.  The fees payable under it are much too low and do not succeed in attracting into the scheme everyone at the Bar. I do not wish to criticise those members of the legal profession who participate in the scheme but the Irish Bar is a very competitive place and, by and large, at the Bar the client pays for what he gets.  If you want first rank people the fees are payable accordingly.</P>
    <P>I should like to see an examination made of this scheme and its operation, to see it updated and to see it extended in its scope and particularly in regard to the fees payable, so that it would succeed in attracting into its machinery every barrister at the Irish Bar and that we would not have the situation which obtains at present whereby the fees payable make it quite unattractive for some members of the Bar to participate in it at all. There will be members of the Bar who will take part in it no matter what <Col N="606" /> the level of the fees is but, if we want it to be a fully effective scheme which will ensure that nobody will be denied top legal advice and top legal service, we must bring the fees up to a realistic level.</P>
    <P>At present there is also a system&mdash; and again I want to claim that I sanctioned this when I was Minister for Finance&mdash;whereby in the Supreme Court and the higher courts the cost of <i>habeas corpus</i> applications is borne by the State.  My understanding is that that scheme is closely supervised by the courts and that it works quite well and quite satisfactorily.  These are two schemes which are in operation at the moment.  In considering the introduction of a more comprehensive scheme we must, of course, have regard to these two existing schemes and fit them in to a new overall comprehensive system.</P>
    <P>All the reports to which I have referred underline very clearly the need for giving assistance to the ordinary citizen in the legal sphere.  A high proportion of members of the community regard the law as something with which they cannot cope and they are very reluctant, and, indeed, afraid, to have any recourse to it.</P>
    <P>I should like to read for the House some excerpts from these reports.  The Nineteenth Interim Report of the Committee on Court Practice and Procedure, dealing with Desertion and Maintenance, at paragraph 43, states:</P>
    <P>We are satisfied that there is a real need for a radical change in the legal provisions relating to the provision of maintenance for deserted spouses and families.  We are also of opinion that failure to maintain, instead of desertion, should be the basis of the new jurisdiction.</P>
    <P>That report goes on to state, under the heading, Legal Aid Provisions:</P>
    <P>The number of cases of desertion in the Dublin Metropolitan Area is sufficient to justify the whole-time attention of an official solicitor.  It is recommended that such solicitor be attached to the Office of the General Solicitor for Minors and Wards of Court, Public Record Office, Dublin, <Col N="607" /> and devote all his time to preparing and pursuing only default cases in both the District Court and the High Court.  His services should be made available to all litigants qualifying under a free legal aid scheme and all social welfare and social services advice centres should refer such cases to him in the first instance.</P>
    <P>In all area outside the Dublin Metropolitan Area, a similar service should be provided by the local State solicitor.</P>
    <P>I am certain that the Minister, and the House, would accept that report of the Committee on Court Practice and Procedure and accept that in that area, apart from any others, there is a very definite and real need for the appointment which the committee recommends.</P>
    <P>The report of the Free Legal Advice Centres, at page 23, states:</P>
    <P>In coming to our conclusions on desirable changes in substantive law we have utilised our experiences in FLAK where we have seen the tragedy of the parent inimical to the family unit, the tragedy of the young spouse left to support a young family in a situation of complete loneliness and without ever the hope of a new marriage.  We feel two major reforms in the substantative law are necessary, (1) the introduction of a simplified and inexpensive separation action with legal aid available to those in need of it.</P>
    <P>The report of the Free Legal Advisory Bureau of Cork, in a summary of its proposals recommends:</P>
    <P>(1)  The existing criminal legal aid system should be revised and extended to ensure representation for all those in need of it.</P>
    <P>(2)  A comprehensive legal aid system for civil matters should be introduced.</P>
    <P>(3)  The legal aid system for both civil and criminal cases should extend to legal advice on non-litigious matters.</P>
    <P>(4)  To ensure that the schemes keep abreast with current demands, <Col N="608" /> a body should be set up which would review the working and effectiveness of the scheme.</P>
    <P>In the case of all those who have studied this matter, and have reported on it, there is unanimous agreement that free legal aid is necessary and essential.  The House will agree with me if I divert for a moment to pay tribute to young lawyers who gave their time free to operate those advice centres and the advisory bureau in Cork.  They have done a great public service in the assistance they have given to people in need of assistance but, more important, in the fact that they have directed public attention to this area and to what is needed in it.</P>
    <P>These reports make it clear, and there is fairly unanimous agreement, that a large area in which free legal aid is needed is in the matrimonial and domestic areas.  In my view it is quite clear that there is a very real social problem existing in this regard and that whatever solution we are bringing forward, whatever proposals emerge, an integral part of any attack on the unhappiness, distress and hardship which desertion and maintenance involve legal advice and legal aid free to those who need it is essential.</P>
    <P>The matrimonial and domestic problems have been fairly well highlighted in recent years and I do not think there will be any great argument about the fact that they do cause this widespread distress, worry, unhappiness and, indeed, hardship, but there are other areas to which public attention is not being focussed so much.  These areas are also a source of very widespread distress.  I refer, firstly, to commercial arrangements of a minor domestic nature.  These, so far as the legal system is concerned, would be very minor and trivial but to the individual or family concerned they can be of fundamental importance.  I am talking about hire purchase transactions, rent cases, matters concerning tenancies, contracts for building and for repairs, and money lending.  I do not wish to open up again that great area of controversy which we had in this House some years ago but there is no doubt that illegal money lending exists <Col N="609" /> throughout the community and it does give rise to problems.</P>
    <P>In these areas, which I have called minor domestic areas for the want of a better description, the individual does not feel that there is anything he can do about them.  He feels wronged and unfairly treated but he does not know anything about the law or how to go about seeking redress.  More often than not he gives way to despair and frustration and if he does not he will frequently approach his local public representative, his Dáil Deputy or county councillor.  That public representative will find himself in a dilemma because he cannot purport to give legal advice and there is no instituation or organisation to which he can refer the constituent.  In this area there is quite an active social problem. What is needed is advice because very often litigation is not necessary.  All the particular individual needs is advice as to whether or not he has any rights of redress or whether there is anything he can do under the law and, if so, what course of action he should take.</P>
    <P>There is another area, the area of probate.  Again, this is something which has widespread implications throughout the community.  Frequently there is need for the individual citizen to find out what his rights are, how he can establish them, what he should do in his own best interest and so on. There is a system whereby the Probate Office, in the case of certain estates, provides free service to the individual, but I do not think that is known widely enough.  That is also an area which should be considered in the establishment of a comprehensive free legal aid system.</P>
    <P>In mentioning these matters I come to the central point I want to make on this motion, that is, that the main argument against the introduction of a comprehensive scheme of free legal aid is that we could not afford it, that it would be enormously expensive.  I would like to see the emphasis in any such scheme on advice rather than on assistance or the supply of professional services in court.  I would like to see a scheme operating to the greatest possible extent outside of the courts. <Col N="610" /> I would regard as the most important part of a comprehensive free legal aid scheme the establishment of advice centres, places to which a citizen could go to find out what the situation is as far as he is concerned, to give him advice as to whether he has any rights, whether he has any case, whether there is any action he can or should take.  I would regard the court end of things as of minimal importance.  If we had a proper scheme in operation based on advice centres, then the number of court actions that would be involved would be quite small.</P>
    <P>If the introduction of such a scheme is approached in the right way, then the financial implications need not be all that terrifying.  I would visualise, for instance, in Dublin city six such centres, three on the north side and three on the south side.  I just mentioned six for Dublin to give an idea of what I think would be involved, and then that projection of six being needed for Dublin could be extended proportionately throughout the country. If you had such centres in operation, together with the free service, up to a certain limit, in the Probate Office, together with the special solicitor attached to the general solicitor's office, as recommended by the Committee on Court Practice and Procedure, and the existing system of free legal aid in criminal cases suitably amended and extended, then you would have the structure of a satisfactory system.</P>
    <P>I understand there is a committee in existence under Judge Pringle which is examining this matter.  I would not at all attempt to be critical of that committee, but it took a long time to get the committee established, first of all, and I do not see any results emanating from it.  It is time to get some action in this field.  It is not good enough to be putting matters on the long finger.  There is plenty of good intention around.  There is a fair appreciation of what needs to be done. The Minister should give the Pringle Committee a time limit within which to report, and even pending its final report there are things that can be done straight away to come to grips with the problem.</P>
    <P>There is in Britain a system based <Col N="611" /> on local regional committees to which the applicant goes, which looks into his financial affairs and decides whether or not he is entitled to free legal aid in civil matters.  Many people on this side of the Irish Sea are inclined to judge this matter by the experience in Britain and to say that the system is enormously expensive and that we could not possibly contemplate the introduction of anything of the same sort here.  I do not think we need contemplate introducing anything of the same sort.  We can devise our own scheme, which would be comprehensive and would meet all the social needs without being as expensive as the British system, particularly if emphasis in our system is on advice.</P>
    <P>I would mention also in that regard that I understand that one of the contributing factors to the enormous cost of the system in Britain is the number of divorce actions.  While matrimonial matters and maintenance and desertion would, I hope, be adequately catered for under our scheme, we would not have the enormous expense which is generated in Britain by divorce cases.</P>
    <P>As I said at the outset, I am not putting anything to the Minister to which he is completely averse, but what I want to do is to urge him to get some action.  This Government are rather prone to expressing good intentions and to making announcements as to what they are going to do.  I want to suggest to the Minister that this is an area where we should get on with it immediately and stop nibbling at the edges of the problem.</P>
    <P>Comprehensive free legal aid in criminal and civil cases is not a luxury.  I should like to get that across.  It is as necessary to the welfare of a lot of people as social welfare, medical cards, or any of these things are.  In the case of many people, if we want to get rid of distress, unhappiness and hardship, we must have as soon as possible an effective comprehensive scheme somewhere along the lines I have been speaking about.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnGrattanEsmonde" hpid="Mr. Esmonde Mr. Esmonde">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Esmonde</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the <Col N="612" /> motion.  It involves a very large problem and it is not one that can be dealt with easily.  We have a fundamental principle in Article 40 of the Constitution which begins:</P>
      <P>All citizens shall, as human persons, be held equal before the law.</P>
      <P>As a person who has been practising as a lawyer inside and outside of court, I could possibly say, and give rise to a lot of argument, that that Article has been observed more in its breach than in its observance.  It is a fact that were it not for the free and voluntary work done by members of the solicitors' profession and members of the Bar, that statement in the Constitution could be regarded almost as fraudulent.</P>
      <P>Every day in a solicitor's office people walk in and have advice.  When people walk in for advice to a solicitor's office the solicitor does not say: &ldquo;Show us the colour of your money&rdquo;. He takes a person as he comes, listens to his story and his queries and probably gives what I would call ongoing or carrying advice.  But a large part of the average solicitor's worry is: &ldquo;Where do we start, where do we finish.  What is the price that will have to be paid if you, Mr. X, my client, go to litigation?&rdquo;</P>
      <P>What I am trying to describe is the sanction of costs that are visited on a would-be litigant if he fails in his action.  The figure for costs in the smallest High Court action is something that runs into four figures, plus, these days.  Deputy Haughey was quite right when he said one must look at the familial-sociological point of view.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>However, I should like to enter a caveat, or maybe a few caveats at this stage.  First of all, it is not sufficient to advocate a comprehensive legal aid system.  Frankly, I do not think it would be on in Irish circumstances. The bill would be far too large.  But I go along with Deputy Haughey when he says there can be advice at a certain level.  That is necessary and I think it is a social requirement.  However, before the advice is given one has to face up to it and say there must be a means test of some sort.  I understand <Col N="613" /> that is the way the English system works.</P>
    <P>If one is to provide a legal aid system at the familial-sociological level, it is not sufficient to say you will stop at advice, particularly in cases involving family trauma in the matter of child custody.  Very often we come across a case of one parent stealing a child and possibly removing it out of jurisdication.  There must be some system to meet such an emergency situation.  I do not think it is practicable to provide free legal aid in every case that comes in, but frequently it can be a matter of an hour or two, just that time, to protect a child's or a parent's rights.  In such circumstances the Minister for Finance and the Revenue Commissioners must be implicated&mdash;there must be no charge for stamp duties or court fees.  If a document has to be produced, filed and brought before a judge it should be free, without any embargo or load of State taxes.</P>
    <P>Perhaps I sound a bit bitty in the way I have gone about this but there are so many things that impinge on one's mind as a lawyer when one talks about free legal aid that it is very difficult to get the matter in order in a simple way.  We must face up to the fact that it is basically a question of cost The real problem is how to get over this problem and to provide some basic legal service both in the criminal and civil codes.</P>
    <P>Deputy Haughey said he would like Deputies to ponder on the legal problems people have to deal with in their everyday lives.  I consider that to be a disastrous statement to make with me listening to him because it got my mind very confused&mdash;so many problems came into my mind straightaway when he suggested that way of thinking. Deputy Haughey is fortunate that he has not been a practising lawyer.  When I started to follow his train of thought&mdash;having been trained as a lawyer I must confess I have a slightly negative approach because the lawyer sees all the difficulties before he sees the pluses&mdash;it brought me back to my original thesis, namely, the sanction of costs, where are you likely to put your client when the day <Col N="614" /> is over, when the whole story is unfolded, when the case has gone to the trial and possibly an appeal and maybe a retrial.</P>
    <P>I must frankly admit as a practising lawyer that on many occasions, far too many for me to have a comfortable mind about, cases have had to be settled because of the individual economic pressures that arose out of the legal proceedings and court action.  I am quite certain that when the Minister comes to close the debate he will bear me out on that. We all know that when a workman is injured at work the average solicitor and barrister accept the case on the basis of &ldquo;no foal, no fee&rdquo;.  If they did not do so there would be no means whereby the injured workman could get his case into court because people in that walk of life must by necessity live fairly near the breadline in the sense that they do not have the reserves of the better-off members of society.  This means that these people rely on the legal profession.  It has to be freely conceded, although I am a member of one branch of the profession, that to date the legal profession have provided that service.  Deputy Haughey made a good point when he said that a portion of the free criminal legal aid fund has never been taken up.  It has never come to my knowledge or that of any other lawyer that I know of that a man has been refused, because of finance, in a criminal trial.  This goes to show that there is a long-standing tradition, both in the solicitors' profession and the Irish Bar, that no man will be without somebody to speak for him if he is on trial.</P>
    <P>We do not clap ourselves on the back because we do that.  We regard it as part of our code of conduct and I suppose we take a little bit of pride in the fact that we supply that service. There might be a misconception as a result of what Deputy Haughey said about competitiveness at the Irish Bar.  He went on to say that he would like to see every member of the Bar listed in the legal aid panel. That might give rise to unfair criticism and a misconception of where the Bar stands in the matter of legal <Col N="615" /> aid.  If one takes a complete cross-section of the Irish Bar one will find that there are many practitioners who hardly ever handle criminal briefs. There is a certain specialised atmosphere in criminal work just as there are many barristers who would never dream of vetting or drafting a deed of conveyance.  I suppose, outside those two categories and that of taxation law, there are very few other specialities that can be allowed for in the Irish Bar.  This is due to economics and the circumstances of our population. We have not got the population to justify specialisation to any great extent.</P>
    <P>I know that free legal aid is under consideration in the Department of Justice as well as many other matters particularly in relation to family law. I ask Deputies and the public who are interested in this subject to bear in mind that we have a rather difficult legal system.  We are based fundamentally on the common law, which is an inductive process, as against the continental system, which is a deductive process.  Anybody who has read the statements of lawyers will see there is a completely different approach to legal problems.  There is a different thought discipline.  One could describe our legal system as one that has been built up from particular cases that ultimately made the code, such as it is.  That includes both common law, case law, the old Chancery principles and then the modern invention, the statute.  On the continent you started with a code and you worked from there.  Admittedly, we have had codification of things like the Sale of Goods Act, conveyancing statutes and such matters but, basically, there is a great difference.  Therefore, it is not very easy to pick up all the bits and pieces of legal principles and try to impose a free legal aid system in criminal and civil law so far as a comprehensive service is concerned.</P>
    <P>I am in agreement with Deputy Haughey in regard to the principles he is trying to get across here but I can see terrible difficulties.  Therefore, when he says that the Minister should give the Pringle Committee a time <Col N="616" /> limit I do not think that is on because great harm might result from any step in that direction.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DavidAndrews" hpid="Mr. Andrews Mr. Andrews">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Andrews</NameTxt>
      <P>We know the answers to the problem and it is a matter of rubber stamping.  I do not mean that with any disrespect.  The time for talking has more or less come to an end and it is action we want.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnGrattanEsmonde" hpid="Mr. Esmonde Mr. Esmonde">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Esmonde</NameTxt>
      <P>There has been a great deal of modern thinking on what I would call the social welfare application of government and this has brought in a rather new dimension.  It is a question of how far you can go, how far you can take a slice of the national cake to provide your system. Deputy Haughey put this up as being part of the social welfare code.  I do not think we should be impatient on a thing like this.</P>
      <P>Let us take one of the cases he mentioned.  We only have hire purchase for a few years.  If you asked the average barrister seven or eight years ago about hire purchase he would have told you to go and see So and So that he did not want to get stuck in that kind of case.  Only about six barristers had a clue about the hire purchase code because it was a new and difficult type of law which had very serious sociological implications.  Many of us had to represent the public without knowing a lot about it.  We had to fight their cases and give them an opportunity of being heard in a court of law. Many of us had no hope in those circumstances of getting a penny out of the cases.  We went on the basis of &ldquo;no foal no fee&rdquo;.  This is quite a common thing in what I call the running down actions.  The difficulty arises in property actions.  They are very expensive and they can take up a great deal of the time of the lawyer involved.  Compared to the position at the begining of the century, the present number of property actions as a proportion of the total represents a complete reversal of the legal position.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Haughey referred to paragraph 43 of the 19th interim report and he mentioned that it advocated that failure to maintain rather than desertion should be the test in family cases.  That is not really a matter that <Col N="617" /> is concerned with free legal aid.  It would mean a fundamental legal reform, a complete change of the law as it now stands.  Deputy Andrews will probably take the line that we are holding back a little, that we could get a move on, that we know all the answers.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DavidAndrews" hpid="Mr. Andrews Mr. Andrews">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Andrews</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think I said that.  We know basically what many of the answers are.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnGrattanEsmonde" hpid="Mr. Esmonde Mr. Esmonde">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Esmonde</NameTxt>
      <P>Probably Deputy Andrews has read some of the reports about the family home cases in England and the difficulties which have arisen over certain specific performance actions and building society mortgagee cases.  This has given rise to such difficulties in England that I am sure there are a couple of dozen cases already.  This does not really resolve the problem. England is much more familiar with this type of difficulty due to the fact that they have had divorce laws for some time; they are more seasoned possibly in family dispute problems than we are.  It is just an instance of where possibly more advanced thinking in these fields have run into serious problems.  I am thinking of the &ldquo;Nat-West&rdquo; case or the Provincial Bank case, which dealt with the family home, and the cases that followed from it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I hope I have made quite clear why the legal aid system does not attract all members of the Bar.  We are human beings and I am quite certain that possibly some members of the Bar would feel that too much of their time would be taken up with legal aid rather than in doing more lucrative work.  That is probably what Deputy Haughey was getting at, but that is natural enough.  If a man is in a good lucrative commercial practice he does not want to put his name on a legal aid panel and find himself working for far smaller fees defending cases when he has the knowhow and ability and the name to do well-paid commercial cases.  I should like a rethinking, possibly, on the matter.  I think I was a member of some committee that was considering before I came into the House the amount of the fees in legal aid.  A very clear distinction should be made when reviewing <Col N="618" /> this matter between the case that is tried down the country and the case tried here in Dublin.  Most barristers by virtue of their profession have to live in Dublin attached to the Law Library.  It is where they work, their office, other than their home and, to travel to somewhere like Clonmel, some 105 miles, means there is a hotel bill to be paid.  A man defending a case in those circumstances should get more than a man who has to go to Green Street or Chancery Place, when all he needs is a few pence for the bus and he does not have to pay a hotel bill and he can work from his home. This is a matter, possibly, for further thought.  I know that the Bar Council have already been somewhat active on the matter.</P>
    <P>If I could bring Deputy Haughey back to the time when he was Minister for Justice, I had a rather traumatic experience.  I do not think it would have been his fault but it did give rise to difficulty.  He mentioned that he introduced legal aid in criminal matters as a start.  I think he was also Minister at the time when our new superior court rules were introduced.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Esmonde</NameTxt>
      <P>Prior to the enactment of the new court and new superior court rules we had the 1905 Superior Court Rules and those rules provided for a form of litigation for somebody who had no money and was known as suing in <i>forma pauperis,</i> two simple little words.  But they were forgotten when the new superior court rules came in and no <i>forma pauperis</i> was allowed for.  Therefore, the very poor person, the pensioner, was denied the right to sue in <i>forma pauperis,</i> or the injured workman with a large family and no money saved.  In fact there is a little record in the Supreme Court on this matter.  When I drew it to the attention of the ex-Chief Justice Cearbhall Ó Dálaigh we found we then had to consider, possibly, a constitutional action to allow a person without money to issue a plenary summons to gain access to the High Court to claim damages against an allegedly negligent employer.  That was an instance or forgetting small details.</P>
      <P>If anybody wants to sue now he must do so on the basis of a declaration under the Constitution before he can proceed.  These little things can give rise to much difficulty.  There is also a little trouble concerning one of these Acts in regard to revisionary leases which has given rise to a considerable amount of litigation.  It may have put money in lawyers' pockets but it has caused a lot of frustration to the public.  Basically, we are a rather litigious nation and I should like any scheme of legal aid to be considered in the light of there being no abuse of the right to free access, fees paid and free litigation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I come back to my original thesis that all citizens shall as human persons be held equal before the law. That is stated in Article 41 of the Constitution.  In the desire of many Deputies to introduce free legal aid there might be a case of putting the cart before the horse.  What is really wanted at present&mdash;because the legal profession are providing free legal aid&mdash;is a curtailment of much of the <Col N="620" /> fuddy-duddy procedure associated with every court.  Give it simplicity.  For example, a minor child comes into property which has to be sold.  It requires four or five documents to be filed in the Circuit Court even if it involves only £50.  Is it not time that end of legal procedure was dealt with before we can implement a healthy legal aid system?</P>
    <Speaker pid="DavidAndrews" hpid="Mr. Andrews Mr. Andrews">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Andrews</NameTxt>
      <P>One of the most important functions of Deputy Haughey's motion is that it will give the very serious content of that motion an airing and will also flush out the Minister for Justice.  I do not mean that in any derogatory or derisory sense.  It will afford him an opportunity to inform the House how far he has gone in quite a number of promises he made in the recent past in the context of the whole area of free legal aid in civil and criminal matters.  As the Minister knows, there are a great number of voluntary organisations which give free legal aid.  I mention organisations like FLAC, AIM and CARE.  The Minister and I were at a very interesting seminar over the weekend, which he attended in the morning and I in the afternoon.  This was the Cherish organisation. These are very worthy organisations which I believe require other things in addition to legal aid on civil matters.  The FLAC group particularly, have been giving free legal advice over the years and they have not received that much assistance from the Government of the day.  It worries me that nothing is being done in relation to the provision of free legal aid in civil and criminal matters.</P>
      <P>I have a Parliamentary Question down to the Minister asking him:</P>
      <P>The number of occasions on which the Committee on Legal Aid and Advice on Civil Matters has met; when it is intended that the committee will report finally to the Minister; and the names of the persons appointed to the committee.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would hope this is not another Government committee set up to stall the implementation of this very badly needed service and the provision of the matters called for in Deputy Haughey's motion.  I do not agree with <Col N="621" /> Deputy Esmonde when he says that the Minister should not put a time limit on the committee.  In the main, such a committee is serviced by the Administration of the day.  The people on the committee are very worthy indeed, although the problem at present is that the Government seem to be making it some type of refuge for party political followers.  I do not think that is a particularly good thing. I believe that when a committee sits it should be asked to report on an interim basis, in the first instance, and then, having done so, should come up with a final report.  There should be a time limit placed on those two reports; in other words, that one would have an interim report within, say, six months and a final one within, say, six months to one-and-a-half years.  That is not beyond the bounds of possibility. I accept that most or many of the people on these committees are well meaning; generally they are doing it on a voluntary and, most certainly, on a patriotic basis.  I do not want to underrate the contributions made by these people to these committees and commissions over the years, but it is well-known that a number of them sat for years and came up with conclusions so out-of-date that they were meaningless. That is another reason why I believe the Committee on Legal Aid and Advice on Civil Matters&mdash;with great respect to its learned chairman, Judge Pringle&mdash;should be asked to consider the possibility, at any rate, of a time limit on its deliberations.</P>
    <P>We have been talking now for a number of years about the possibility of introducing a free legal aid scheme in civil and criminal matters.  There is what I would describe as a rather derisory criminal legal aid scheme in operation at present.  There was an interesting article in <i>The Irish Independent</i> some months ago entitled, I think, &ldquo;The Scales of Justice&rdquo;.  If, as Deputy Esmonde says, we are all equal before the law, not only are litigants equal before the law and entitled to representations, to legal advice as citizens, but those who offer the advice, who act on behalf of the litigants are equally entitled to protection.  I have had personal experience of the situation <Col N="622" /> as it obtains at present.  I am not complaining because I have personal experience&mdash;one goes into a position or a profession and deals with situations as they arise and one does not complain about them&mdash;but, take, for instance, a murder case where a prosecuting counsel, as I understand it&mdash;and I am subject to correction&mdash;receives fees three times in excess of those given to the defending counsel and solicitor. This is an absolute disgrace.  Surely it should be the other way round as it used be.  Having gone to Mountjoy Jail on six or seven occasions to see one's clients who are up on a murder charge, having consulted with them, done all the preparatory paper work and having engaged in court work for two days on their behalf, one is given a cheque for somewhere in the region of £27 to £30. I know the general public will say: they are damn well paid for two days work at £27.  That is not the point.  My point is that prosecuting counsel receive fees two-and-a-half or three times more than that, if I am correct.  I did not have the doubtful pleasure of representing the State in criminal matters on any occasion so I do not know what the fees received were or whether they had been changed since I returned to the Bar.</P>

      <P>The Minister will have to help me in this matter.  It is a fair point and I am sure the Minister will recognise that there is a tremendous disparity between defending and prosecuting counsel and solicitors' fees.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMarkCooney" hpid="Mr. Cooney Mr. Cooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cooney</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="DavidAndrews" hpid="Mr. Andrews Mr. Andrews">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Andrews</NameTxt>
      <P>It was not a reckless statement at all; it was from my own experience and I assumed that the fee one received was the final one.  I assume now the position will be that there will be another small amount of money forthcoming to make up the balance between the £27 and the £42.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMarkCooney" hpid="Mr. Cooney Mr. Cooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cooney</NameTxt>
      <P>If the Deputy would like to write me details of the case involved, I shall have it investigated, if it was a murder case.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidAndrews" hpid="Mr. Andrews Mr. Andrews">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Andrews</NameTxt>
      <P>I certainly shall.  I will be very pleased indeed to do that. I did not want to engage in special pleading, quite the contrary, but I gave it as an ascertainable example, which makes it even worse.  There may be other fees forthcoming in the instance of which I am speaking, in which case, the matter would end there.  But the Minister has admitted that the difference between prosecuting fees and free legal aid fees paid to legal advisers is derisory.  That is a very important admission.  It is a welcome and a fair and honest admission on the part of the Minister.</P>
      <P>The question of legal aid in civil matters is one that is of much concern to us.  Again, I must refer to the Minister's record in respect of the whole question of reform legislation promised by him since his appointment. I would remind the House of the number of occasions on which the Minister stated that he would be bringing legislation of one kind or another before the House but we are still waiting for that legislation.  Therefore, it can be seen that the Minister's actions do not measure up to his words.  We all hope that during the course of this session we shall have concrete reform legislation in the many areas in which we have been calling for it and some of which he has promised us without his being prompted by the Opposition.  We look forward to assisting the Minister in every way possible if and when he introduces the legislation for which we have been calling.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In addition to the motion which Deputy Haughey has tabled, there is a motion on the Order Paper in my name which I hope will be dealt with <Col N="624" /> by way of Private Members Business. This motion is:</P>

    <Speaker pid="DavidAndrews" hpid="Mr. Andrews Mr. Andrews">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Andrews</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to give the reasons why I consider free legal aid to be important and in this context I consider the motion standing in my name to be tied in with the motion in the name of Deputy Haughey.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DenisJones" hpid="An Leas-Cheann Comhairle Denis Francis Jones">
      <NameTxt>An Leas-Cheann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy knows well that we cannot anticipate a debate on another motion.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidAndrews" hpid="Mr. Andrews Mr. Andrews">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Andrews</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Haughey's very worthy motion could be dwelt on for hours.  The Leas-Cheann Comhairle will admit that free legal aid must be made available for, for instance, the woman whose husband has deserted her and who is left with a family to rear but who is not in a <Col N="625" /> position to pursue her husband because of lack of finance.  Law and money should not necessarily be equated.  In other words, if an individual has a good case, he should not be prevented from pursuing that case because of lack of money.  That is what we are speaking of in the context of free legal aid and advice in civil matters.</P>
      <P>There was reference earlier in the debate to the FLAC organisation.  The Government have an urgent obligation to take over the basic structure of that organisation and to extend it throughout the cities and urban areas of the country.  The free legal advice centres established by FLAC might be said to be in an embryonic state. They are being serviced by young people who are earnest and sincere but who may not have the experience necessary for such work.  If the Government were to assume responsibility for these centres, the people who would avail of them would have the benefit of experienced officers who would be paid out of the funds of the Administration of the day.  On the basis of the advice tendered at these centres, a person could decide whether to go ahead with litigation and that is a very important element.</P>
      <P>I do not think that, despite what Deputy Esmonde said, the people would abuse such a facility.  The Deputy, in saying that, is underrating the intelligence of the Irish people: I would submit, respectfully, that he is doing so rather patronisingly. Like Deputy Haughey, I believe that this whole question of free legal aid in civil and criminal matters should be integrated into the social welfare structure.  The people should not be deprived of access to our legal system because of lack of finance any more than they should be deprived of the various allowances to which they are entitled.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I take this opportunity to pay tribute to the much maligned legal profession who, to the best of my knowledge, have never refused an impecunious litigant, have never refused advice because of lack of money.  That is one of the great traditions of the Irish Bar <Col N="626" /> and I do not think they have received sufficient credit for that service.</P>
    <P>Of course, there are many other groups and organisations who give their services also on a voluntary basis and they, too, are to be praised for that.  I would hope to be dealing with an adjunct to Deputy Haughey's motion.  The motion in the Deputy's name is No. 16 on today's Order Paper while that in my name is No. 19 on the Order Paper and reads that:</P>
    <P>That Dáil Éireann is of opinion that provision should now be made to protect the interests of deserted wives, unmarried mothers....</P>

    <Speaker pid="LiamCunningham" hpid="Mr. Cunningham Mr. Cunningham">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cunningham</NameTxt>
      <P>When I moved the adjournment I was dealing with the situation of the small farmer and the farm retirement scheme.  I realise Directive 161 which refers to aid for farmers in the less-favoured farm areas is not a matter for the Minister for Lands.  However, there must be co-operation between the Department of Lands and the Department of Agriculture and Fisheries in the operation of Directive 160.  When a farmer retires the question of the allocation of his land is a matter for the Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries and <Col N="628" /> the Minister for Lands in that the former will be the adviser of the Minister for Lands regarding the kind of person who will get the land vacated by the retiring farmer.  The farm retirement scheme as set out in Directive 160, and Directive 161 which deals with aid to the mountain and the less-favoured farm areas, are closely linked.</P>
      <P>The Minister is putting the cart before the horse.  It would be desirable to implement the provisions of Directive 160 first, whatever the provisions may be.  The Minister may blame the EEC for the situation that exists and perhaps he is right.  It is important that the small farmers know the benefits they may expect to get in the implementation of the EEC directive and its subesequent implementation by member countries; perhaps it may be improved or changed when it emerges from Brussels.  Farmers would then be in a better position to decide if they wished to retire from farming.</P>
      <P>With the aid to the less-favoured farm areas, I would couple the regional development fund which has not yet been implemented.  I realise I am going outside the scope of the debate but it must be pointed out that somebody is putting the cart before the horse.  If the regional fund which is meant to foster industry and other employment activity in underdeveloped areas is implemented and if Directive 161 is implemented the farmers could weigh the effects and the benefits under the regional fund allocation and the directive.  They could decide whether they wish to retire from farming.  It is a pity this has not happened but I am not blaming the Minister.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>However, the Minister might tell us what proposals the Government have put forward in regard to these two funds.  He could tell us that the Government do not know if the proposals will be accepted but at least we should know what they are.  They have never brought the House into their confidence or sought its advice in the formulation of any of the directives, whether it was Directive 159, 160 or 161.  Without giving away any inside governmental information, it would <Col N="629" /> be desirable to debate here what proposals the House would like to have considered in Brussels in the formulation of policy.  I would ask the Minister for Lands or the Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries to tell us what stage Directive 161 has reached and when we may expect some action. It is important that we know the situation.</P>
    <P>With regard to the Bill dealing with planning, will the Minister inform us if there have been consultations between his Department, which in the main deals with the environment, conservation and many facets of planning and development, and the Department of Local Government?  Have the Department of Lands made any suggestions in connection with this matter?  Section 4 (1) refers to the board to be set up by the Minister for Local Government to decide and determine planning appeals.  The section is as follows:</P>
    <P>(1)  The board shall, so far as may be necessary for the performance of its functions, keep itself informed of the policies and objectives for the time being of the Minister, planning authorities and any other body which is a public authority whose functions in the opinion of the board have, or may have,...</P>
    <P>Section 4 (2) states:</P>
    <P>(2)  In this section &ldquo;public authority&rdquo; means any Minister of State not being the Minister, the Commissioners of Public Works in Ireland, the Irish Land Commission, a harbour authority within the meaning of section 2 of the Harbours Act 1946,...</P>
    <P>This section is not clear.  Does it mean the Land Commission or the Minister for Lands will be represented on the board set up by the Minister or does it mean the exact opposite, that they will be debarred from representation on the board?  It is important that the Department of Lands are represented on it and I would ask him to explain the section.</P>

      <P>I thank the Minister for the benefit of his interpretation. I tabled a question on land acquisition for forestry purposes for the period from 1st April up to the present and the reply was that from 1st April to 30th September, a period of six months, 7,267 acres were acquired for forestry purposes.  That means that for a full year only 14,514 acres will be acquired for forestry purposes. Over a long number of years the policy of successive governments has been to aim at a target of 25,000 acres planted every year.  In 1971-72 &mdash;I speak subject to correction here&mdash;there were 29,000 acres; in 1972-73 it had dropped to 24,000 and in 1973-74 the intake of land so far is down to 14,000 acres.  Possibly more will be acquired in the second half of the year.  Possibly less will be acquired. If the aim is 25,000 acres of planting surely it is logical to keep up a 25,000 acre purchase scheme as well.</P>
      <P>I suggest the Forestry Division should consider the erection of foresters' houses.  We have a number of very fine plantations and I congratulate the Forestry Division on the excellent job done in the development of our forests as an amenity and a tourist attraction.  Where there is a demand for them I suggest a small number of foresters' houses should be built.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister said last year that there was a challenge to a new Minister because of our entry into the European Economic Community.  The only thing worthy of note in his introductory statement today was the farm retirement scheme; the Minister is in the position of having honour cast upon him rather than his having earned it.  I freely admit that the scheme envisaged by the EEC, under which grants are available from the EEC, is not as good a scheme as the one the Minister has introduced.  The only other matter of note was his acquiescence in the demand for the stopping of the wholesale importation of guns here through licences issued at the frontier posts.  I am glad that <Col N="631" /> this will cease and that his Department will in future issue licences.</P>
    <P>I would urge the Minister to introduce legislation to deal with land tenure and the perfecting of title in the western areas.  In view of the fact that his Department will be interested in the Planning Bill, why is the Planning Bill being held up?  Why do we not have it?</P>

      <P>I shall certainly not speak for an hour.  For most Deputies representing western constituencies Land Commission problems form the bulk of their work. They take up a great deal of their time.  I should like to take this opportunity now of thanking the Land Commission officials in both Galway and Athlone, to whom I must be an appelling nuisance, for their kindness, their courtesy and their efficiency.  I would not have their job for a million pounds a year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is impossible in rural Ireland to please everyone.  It is impossible to allocate small parcels of land without offending a great number of people. Yet, the officials get on with the job to the best of their ability and, no matter how busy they are, they receive one with the greatest courtesy and consideration. One is certainly not put off.  I admire them for that.  I believe they are greatly overworked.  We are inclined to blame the civil servants for not doing this, that and the other but, in the Land Commission, they do an excellent job.  As I say, they are greatly overworked.  Indeed, I believe one of the difficulties in recruiting staff to the Land Commission is the fear <Col N="633" /> of transfer to Castlebar by those civil servants who have houses here in Dublin and who are determined not to go into service in the Land Commission in case they might be shifted to Castlebar.  I do not agree with Deputy Cunningham&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mrs. Hogan O'Higgins Mrs. Hogan O'Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Hogan O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>Land bonds are the old vexed question.  The Department would have much more land available if they were prepared to pay for land in cash or even half in cash and half in land bonds.  Offering land bonds to farmers is not on.  They are terrified out of their wits that they will have to take land bonds.  This holds up the acquisition of every farm. They dither and go to court.  If the Government could see their way to paying in cash the Land Commission would have little or no difficulty in acquiring land.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I also find fault with the Land Commission for, having acquired land, holding it for so long.  I have to say it but I am almost 18 years in this House. There is one estate in my constituency which, I think, has been held by the Land Commission for that length of time.  I know one estate outside Loughrea which has been held by the Land Commission for almost ten years.  One of the reasons given is that every so often 12 acres, or 15 acres, or 30 acres in the adjoining locality come on the market and the Land Commission try to acquire them to have a bigger pool for division.  This would make the whole process more economic for them and, I suppose, in the long run it <Col N="634" /> would make more land available for farmers.</P>
    <P>The local farmers do not see it that way.  They see this estate being held by the Land Commission for years, the land being rented on the 11 months system to farmers who are better off than they are, the house going to rack and ruin, and the land not being very well cared for by the man who takes it in conacre.  He will not break his neck mending fences or cutting thistles, or putting down manure or fertilisers.</P>
    <P>I understand the delay in many cases, but the farmers do not.  It is not always the fault of the Land Commission. In a number of cases the titles to the estates are not correct: country solicitors are not too prompt in their attendance to their clients and the Land Commission are held up.  When the Land Commission acquire an estate with a house on it, the house should be let or sold immediately.  If a house is left unoccupied for even a year it deteriorates very much.  I have seen houses which used to be beautiful houses and which are now the property of the Land Commission with cattle walking in and out through the doors.  This is a terrible tragedy and it should not happen.</P>
    <P>Another problem which seems to be causing a fair amount of trouble in the Woodford area in my constituency is the division of commonages.  Nobody seems to know who has a right to this type of land.  In many cases people emigrated to the States two generations ago and nobody is quite clear as to who owns the title now.  The Land Commission should take a hard look at commonages and get the local farmers together and see if they can hammer out a scheme under which they could be divided up and properly used.</P>
    <P>I do not know whether it is in order for me to talk about the land courts. I know that constituents of mine who have the experience of going through the land courts feel that they do not get justice.  One man described them to me last week as kangaroo courts where you are tried, convicted and hanged before you go in.  I do not think this is fair.  Members of the land <Col N="635" /> courts are men of integrity, but the farmers feel that they have not got the same rights as they would have in an ordinary civil court.  They feel that justice is not seen to be done.  There is no appeal except on a technicality.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanTreacy" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Seán Treacy">

      <NameTxt>Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Cavan):</i> On a point of order, it is hardly in order to discuss the courts because in doing so we are discussing people who have not got an opportunity to defend themselves.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mrs. Hogan O'Higgins Mrs. Hogan O'Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Hogan O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree, but, farmers feel that they are badly done by in the land courts and we are here to look after their rights as well as the rights of everybody else.</P>
      <P>Like Deputy Cunningham, I think the retirement pension scheme is an excellent scheme.  It is very urgent that the people in rural Ireland should realise its importance and what it contains for them.  In an area like mine there are a number of elderly farmers with no direct heirs who, perhaps, would be better off if they retired, but they do not know how to apply for forms, or what they should do, or what rights they have, or what they could gain from the scheme.  As Deputies, we should advise them as best we can. I do this a good deal in my constituency.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>People who are not terribly interested in farming or who have not got direct heirs would be better off if they retired and offered their land for lease or for sale to the Land Commission. Cash payments will be a big attraction.  The Minister will have a difficult time trying to make a success of this scheme because there is something in all of us in rural Ireland which makes us want to hold on to whatever little patch of land we have. Perhaps this goes back over the years to the way in which land was grabbed from us, or to the way the Land League operated, but it is very hard to get a man or a woman to part with his or her few acres.  Deputies on <Col N="636" /> every side of the House have a duty to advise constituents of the advantages there are in availing of the retirement pension, and of the advantage it will be when they surrender their land to farmers in an adjoining area.  This should also be pointed out.</P>
    <P>Like Deputy Cunningham, I sympathise with the landless man.  In my area there is not enough land even for the small farmer never mind for the landless man.  I detect&mdash;I do not like it; I think it is a bad trend&mdash;a trend in Clare-South Galway for small farmers not to accept land from the Land Commission because it might bring them over the valuation at which they can receive social welfare assistance.  Any scheme that is a disincentive is a bad one.  Here, again, we will have to have a hard look at our social welfare scheme <i>vis-á-vis</i> the farmer.  I know all farmers are having a difficult time and what they are getting in the form of social welfare payments is more welcome this year than in previous years but, in the long terms, he would be better off to take land.</P>
    <P>I have always felt we have fallen well behind other countries in regard to forestry.  One of the reasons more land is not available to the Forestry Division is the ridiculous price that is offered to landowners.  About ten years ago an official asked if I would be willing to sell about ten acres for forestry and he offered me £80.  I asked this official if he meant £80 per acre but he replied that his offer was for the entire 10 acres.  The money being offered for such land is completely unrealistic.</P>
    <P>While I understand and recognise the desire of the Forestry Division to plant commercial timber, it is a pity they do not go in for planting more hardwood such as oak and beech.  To my knowledge this is not done.  Such plantations are attractive and must inevitably increase in value.  I can see the economic sense of planting the lighter trees which can be harvested in 20 years but it is a pity that farmers and landowners are not encouraged to plant oak and beech.</P>
    <P>I am filled with admiration for the wildlife centre in Portumna and  <Col N="637" /> recommend Deputies to visit it.  It is an absolutely beautiful centre.  It is a pity that there are not more centres of this type dotted around the country.  A complaint I have received from locals is that the deer there are capable of doing considerable damage to crops around.  While they are attractive for the tourists the farmers in the immediate area are inclined to grumble that the fences surrounding the centre are not high enough.  They feel more care should be taken to keep down the numbers.  I know a farmer in Stoneyisland who is alarmed at the increase in the deer population and at the amount of damage they have been causing to his crop.  In my view he has a legitimate complaint.  I have seen deer on his corn and it is not funny to have deer damaging corn.</P>
    <P>Bird sanctuaries, in theory, should preserve wildlife in an area but, in fact, they attact the game into the sanctuary off the land.  For example, in Loughrea where there is a bird sanctuary on the lake all the mallard now go into the lake to feed and, because it is preserved, they stay there.  In a way the aim of establishing these sanctuaries is being defeated <i>vis-á-vis</i> the gun clubs.</P>
    <P>I welcome the provision in the measure which comes into operation next year in relation to the importation of shortguns.  This was long overdue. Game councils, in conjunction with Bord Fáilte, give grants to gun clubs to breed game but I do not understand the legality of gun clubs. The <i>Connacht Tribune</i> carries notices weekly to the effect that certain lands are preserved by gun clubs and landowners notice that their own land is listed as being preserved despite the fact that nobody asked permission to preserve it for shooting by members of that gun club.  These people are receiving grants to breed birds.  They are released on my lands but nobody approaches me for permission to shoot on the lands.  A notice at the entrance to a bog of mine stated that the bog was preserved by a particular gun club but nobody asked me if he could do this.  I wonder if gun clubs have the legal right to do this.</P>
    <P>During the last fortnight I was <Col N="638" /> shown 4,000 pheasants in cages in an area outside my constituency.  These birds were in beautiful condition and I understand they were reared with the assistance of Bord Fáilte grants. These birds had never been released from these cages and were being preserved for the tourists.  That is not sportsmanship.  Birds that are fed like broiler chickens cannot be let go on 1st November to be blasted out of the sky.  In fact, these birds might not even get off the ground.  There should be some provision whereby the birds are reared in time, let return to their native surroundings and given the opportunity of flying around before the shooting season opens.  To rear 4,000 birds in a cage and then let a tourist blast them out of the sky is just savage.  These birds do not have a chance.  It is said that this is done in the name of tourism but in my view it is sadistic.  A man with a shotgun might as well as be shooting broiler chickens because these pheasants would not be able to get off the ground.  Incidentally, the pheasants I saw were for foreign guns.</P>
    <P>In my view this Department is doing a very good job.  The Minister has a very difficult task and I feel he has not enough power in his own Department.  The commissioners have too much power while the Minister has not enough.  That is not a popular thing to say but I believe the Minister should have the right to veto.  It seems to me that every Minister for Lands is greatly subject to the Secretary of the Department and the commissioners. I have only found this in the Department of Lands and this is a pity.  If a man of ability and integrity is given a high position, he should be allowed use his discretion.  It is our duty to give the Minister a hand in his difficult task and in my constituency I will do all I can to sell the pension scheme to farmers.  Not that I would urge the indiscriminate selling of land by anyone who has children, grandchildren or even nieces and nephews.  Land is hard-earned and those of us who have heirs should consider them.  I was brought up in a tradition in which we were taught that land you held was yours only for your lifetime.  You were supposed to <Col N="639" /> care for it and pass it on in better condition than you got it.  This is what I hope to instil into some of my children when they come of age, and this is what we should try to instil into all our constituents.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnGeoghegan" hpid="Mr. Geoghegan Mr. Geoghegan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Geoghegan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister has produced 31 pages on the working of his Department over the past 12 months, and I would like to compliment the Minister and his officials on this very comprehensive statement. There are one or two points that I raised last year and the year before, and I intend to raise them again this year hoping against hope that, if we are here next year or if the Deputies on the Government benches are over here, something will be done about them.  Last year I raised the question of the destruction caused by foxes in forestry throughout the country, having regard to wildlife and especially the killing of lambs.  I told the Minister then that the gun club in Cong on the borders of Mayo were quite willing to co-operate every day of the week or every Sunday in destroying the foxes. It is a sad state of affairs that a farmer who keeps sheep and hopes to raise lambs in order to earn a few pounds to pay his rent and rates or to buy food or even to buy manure for his land, finds that the lambs are no sooner weaned than they are killed by the foxes.  The foxes are getting more plentiful day by day.  When they become too numerous they develop a disease called the mange.  Practically all of them die and you will not see them again for about a year and a half. However, no housewife in rural Ireland where there is a plantation fairly near can have a hen, a chicken or a duck that is not taken away by the foxes.  I hope the Minister will take a serious look at this problem.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Down through the years, I would say up to about five or six years ago, the Department of Lands were building roads and developing turbary.  They are doing a certain amount of it still.  However the point I want to make is that the Department of Lands built some roads into turbary rights ten or 20 years ago, but all the turbary on each side of <Col N="640" /> these roads has been cut away.  There is no more turbary there but there are hundreds of acres deeper into the mountains.  Why can the Land Commission not carry out a survey with a view to extending those bog roads deeper into the turbary, so that people can get fuel at least for their home fires?  Everyone knows that oil is out because of the price it has reached, but even if they got it for nothing in the country areas they would still prefer the turf fire at which to sit and talk or play a game of cards.  The Department of Lands should realise the importance of turf in these areas.</P>
    <P>The Minister mentioned migration. Perhaps he means the redistribution of lands locally.  As far as I know, nobody has been migrated, as they have been in the past, say, from the west of Ireland to the midlands.  That leads me to the point that, where somebody is living, say, 14 or 15 miles from some of his land&mdash;say, half or quarter of a farm which has been left to him by an aunt or an uncle&mdash;and he does not utilise it to the extent to which it should be utilised, the Land Commission should subdivide it among the local men or women in the area so as to make their small parcels of land more viable.  There are a few such cases in the west and I would be grateful if the Department of Lands would investigate them.</P>
    <P>Before I left last week I tabled a question to the Minister for Justice and I see from the Order Paper this week that it has been transferred from the Minister for Justice to the Minister for Lands.  I still think it is a matter for the Minister for Justice.  I was asked by one of the officials in the office why I addressed it to Justice. I gave him my reason and he said he thought it was very sound, but the question is still addressed to Lands:</P>
    <P>To ask the Minister for Lands when he expects the lands at Rossaveele and Ballinahown, Connemara, County Galway, will be vested in the tenants who were allotted them.</P>
    <P>Some of these lands have been allotted five or six years.  This was a rearrangement scheme.  Some tenants had been <Col N="641" /> taken away years ago from Ballinahown, some were taken from Rossaveele some years ago but it was not until last year&mdash;part of the rearrangement has not been sanctioned yet&mdash; that the rest was arranged.  After rearrangement it takes two years before the lands are vested in the tenants.  I suppose this is a matter for Chancery Street and the Minister for Justice, but I should be obliged if the Minister for Lands would take a note of it.</P>

      <P>There is another matter I should like to put to the Minister.  There are cases of turbary and land which might not be turbary &mdash;some of it might be arable&mdash;offered to the Forestry Division.  My complaint is about the length of time it takes to inspect such lands and to take them over.  In one case of which I am aware it took seven years before the Forestry Division made up their minds.  A few minutes ago Deputy Hogan O'Higgins complained that the prices offered were very low.  I know of a case, I will not say where, in which more than 3,000 acres were taken over at between £2,100 and £2,200.  At least 200 acres of that land were arable.  Admittedly some of the rest had become rough but there was good soil in the remainder of the arable portion.  However, it took the Forestry Division between six and <Col N="642" /> seven years to take it over.  There are trees there now, and they are doing well.</P>
      <P>On the problem of forest fires, particularly in the west, health and sedge decay and they form what we call tuláin.  This is highly inflammable and if a match is set to it in late summer or in spring it rolls up like a football and sets fire to everything.  The fire can even cross a narrow river and set alight trees on the other side.  The point I am making is that the Department might do something, by way of spray or by eradication of undergrowth, to stop this danger to young trees.  It is unfortunate that because of this lack of precaution hundreds of acres of young trees have been destroyed by fire.</P>
      <P>Another matter I should like to put forcibly to the Minister, still concerned with forest fires, is the treatment of burnt-out areas.  Perhaps up to 200 acres of young trees might be burned.  The stumps are left there and the entire forest is rendered unsightly by the existence of these burnt-out stumps.  I suggest that when a fire occurs the Land Commission should move in immediately and lift the stumps before new trees are planted. I recall particularly a fire not in my constituency but in the Derrybrien-Loughrea area.  A very unsightly patch was left.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Cunningham mentioned commonages.  I appreciate that it is very hard to deal with them, particularly when we are members of the Common Market and when we are told that every perch of land should be utilised to the fullest.  In the west there are townlands in which up to 3,000 acres may be divided among seven or eight people, depending on the cash they have or the number of sheep they can afford.  Could there be some system whereby the Land Commission could come in and mark out these places for the people concerned, letting those concerned arrange the thing beforehand?  I know grants are available from the Department of Agriculture and Fisheries for fencing. I know of one case where those concerned employed a local engineer and the Land Commission came in to OK <Col N="643" /> the arrangement.  It is a credit to the four people concerned.  They have fertilised the entire area and it is now as green as any field in Ireland.</P>
    <P>We have seen the advertisement &ldquo;Protect life on the roads&rdquo;.  There is always danger when on one side of a mountain you have a stretch of open commonage and on the other some arrangement whereby loose cattle, horses and sheep can be stopped from wandering on public roads.  Unfortunately loose animals have been the cause of many deaths on the road.  I know a case of tenants who fenced along two miles of roadway. It cost each of them approximately £225, which they could ill afford but they did an excellent job. If you are not able to fence the whole square the Department of Agriculture and Fisheries will not give you a grant.  We talk about saving lives on the road and therefore something should be worked out between the Land Commission and the Department of Agriculture and Fisheries in relation to this fencing.  If those people were only given one-third of the cost it would be an incentive to them.</P>
    <P>The Land Commission very often have land on their hands for a number of years.  They may decide that as an old couple have 50 or 100 acres they will wait until that couple die so that they can take over the extra land to add more to the pool for redistribution. I can see their point of view but the land is so long on their hands that everybody seems to take a bite out of it.  Nobody manures it or does anything to improve it.  All such land should be divided quickly.</P>
    <P>I often make representations to the Minister about questions of land division and turbary.  I get a reply saying that he has referred the matter to the Land Commission or the Wild Life Division.  If he sends the letter to any section of his Department any Deputy should be entitled to a final reply on the matter.  I know it takes quite a long time before you can get a final reply. If somebody makes representations to a Deputy he writes to the Minister and the letter is then sent on to the <Col N="644" /> particular division in the Department of Lands to which it refers.  The person who originally made representations expects to get a final reply at some stage.  If you meet him six months after he originally made representations to you and he has not received a final reply he will not be long telling you that you sat down on the job.  We should be able to get a letter from the Minister saying that the section of his Department expect to be able to do the job in relation to land in six months or 12 months.  That reply would be all right.</P>
    <P>I made representations to the Minister in relation to one case on the border of my own constituency and a west Mayo constituency.  I received a reply that he had sent the matter to the Wild Life Division.  That was about six months ago.  When I did not get a reply I wrote again to the Minister, about a month ago, stating that I did not think it was good enough that I had not get a reply.  If the Minister considers I was hurtful I will apologise. I meant him to make sure that a final reply would be sent out.  I got a letter the following day from the Minister's office stating that the section was asked to reply direct to me.  I do not expect a reply from them for another couple of weeks.  At least we expect to get a reply when a matter is sorted out.  I wish the Minister every luck in his campaign, especially in trying to get old people to hand over their land.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>This is a very important Estimate particularly for Deputies and their constituents who live in areas where there is congestion.  The Minister has done quite a lot since <Col N="645" /> he took charge of the Department of Lands.  In the best traditions of that Ministry we have always had understanding Ministers and the present Minister is carrying on that tradition. We always feel we have a man we can approach when we have difficulties. The question of land is always synonymous with difficulties.</P>
      <P>The Minister has increased his inspectorate staff.  This makes for quicker resettlement in the division of holdings.  This is very necessary because we have often to listen to complaints about the Land Commission being in possession of land for many years.  Usually the people who make such complaints are not conversant with problems such as the question of title, selecting applicants and many other problems which arise in regard to resettlement.</P>
      <P>It was brought to my notice recently that where land has been divided and where the right of the way is used jointly by several farmers, in many cases through an existing holding, greater protection should be given to the fencing leading to the divisions of the land.  It has been claimed that due to inadequate protection some stock grazed on allocated and divided land got TB and brucellosis.  This has been caused by the mixing of stock due to inadequate fencing.  I would like the Minister and his officials to investigate cases where there is inadequate fencing.  My experience is that the Land Commission do not divide the land until proper fencing has been undertaken.</P>
      <P>There has been a very welcome departure, in the case of lands purchased, from the old system of paying for them by land bonds.  The Minister has stated that the present allocation is £2½ million for the purchase of land for cash.  In fact it means there will be less pressure to acquire land compulsorily in future, because undoubtedly where there is a tendency to dispose of land the attraction is much greater when one receives cash. We welcome the higher allocation of money for this purpose.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As regards the retirement scheme which the Minister had the privilege of introducing under EEC Directive <Col N="646" /> 160 a similar scheme in the past did not succeed as we would have wished but we hope that now, when additional land is necessary to ensure a proper modernisation scheme and where adjoining farmers wish to avail of land, there will be a better response to the pension which the Minister is allocating to people over 50 or 55 years of age and that they will make this land available.  It is a tradition that we cling on to our holdings, whether large or small, but when one comes to an age when he is no longer able to work the land so as to produce adequate profit or to meet the production needs of the country this scheme gives every encouragement to lease or sell the holding.  A very worthwhile sum is being paid in the case of people who have, so to speak, reached the end of their day and have no near relatives to carry on the work.  I think the time has come when people will realise that in cases where land for some reason has not been worked as well as it should the holders should be given every encouragement to avail of the retirement scheme.</P>
    <P>There is a higher allocation of funds for improvement works and improvement of new buildings erected by the Land Commission where they resettled farmers on other holdings.  The standard has gone very high at present. From personal experience I can see proper, modern houses erected.  I have even seen the Land Commission change plans in the case where a farmer wishes to change from the traditional method of haymaking to the newer method of conserving fodder for the winter by constructing silage pits.  It gives an idea of the thinking behind the Department and the Commission when they try to accommodate a man who is progressive and wishes to employ new methods.  I have seen this happen and it is generally appreciated.</P>
    <P>The Minister has responsibility for forestry and, personally, I should like to see a greater understanding of one facet of the forestry section: the sale of timber, whether it is felled or otherwise, to the chipboard industry, which is a very important one.  At present, some difficulties are arising in our chipboard factories, which have been giving <Col N="647" /> very substantial employment, in some cases to small farmers living nearby. In some cases 400 or 500 are employed. That employment depends to some extent on a supply of native timber being made available to those factories.  I appreciate that the Department are in business for the sale of timber and have made very good profit&mdash;the price of timber has gone up in recent years &mdash;but perhaps the price has gone up so much that our chipboard factories are not able to compete with buyers of smaller lots and perhaps this has adversly affected the ability of the factories to compete.  I am not clear on that.</P>
    <P>I should like to thank the Minister in connection with one case in which I referred to this difficulty and he immediately visited the factory, had discussions with the management and did what he could to give the information needed and every assistance that would help that factory.  That factory is in a healthy position; it has good sales and good orders, but the little difficulty is there.  It seems that in the long-term the chipboard factories are dependent on native supplies and therefore this is an area to which the Minister and the Department should give some thought.</P>
    <P>That would mean the purchase of additional suitable land where additional planting could now be considered. I suppose it would first mean giving thought to providing more State forestry nurseries to supply the young stock which would be planted.  I should like to see an even greater drive towards having a much greater pool of native timber available in the future which could be utilised to ensure that this type of factory would have good prospects and that the employees could be sure of continuity of employment.  This is much more necessary in congested areas where small farmers must have part-time employment apart from their holdings if they are to have a reasonable living.  I ask the Minister, if possible, to step up inspection of suitable land on which we could have an increased acreage of State forests in the future.</P>
    <P>There is marginal land in every <Col N="648" /> county.  It is a question merely of acquiring that land and I am sure the owners of it would be fairly easily dealt with.  I am not suggesting at all that we should interfere with people who live near good land, which should be used for agricultural purposes and where small holdings should benefit from its allocation.  I am referring to marginal land.  Some counties seem to have got away with it over the years and seem to have every available acre of land suitable for forestry planted.  I have noticed that other counties still seem to retain a lot of marginal land which is not used for forestry.</P>
    <P>In the past it was a function of the Irish Land Commission to develop roads leading to turbary.  They did quite a lot of work in this regard but that seems to have ceased now.  That responsibility for road making has been passed on to local authorities through the local improvements schemes.  The Land Commission did quite a lot of work in areas where there was no proper access and where virgin bogs were not developed.  I would have preferred that that responsibility had remained with the Land Commission because they worked their way through quite a lot of miles of bogland making it accessible to people who developed plots for their own use.</P>
    <P>Generally speaking, the functions of the Land Commission are fully appreciated by the people.  But there is a tendency on the part of some people to criticise when holdings are being allocated.  In the future, it must be understood clearly that even people with larger acreages of land will now qualify for division more so than in the past.  When one considers the acreage now required to meet the standards demanded by the EEC, it must be fully appreciated that a man can now qualify for a division of land who would not have been considered heretofore.  This poses the question: where does the small man of 15, 16 or 20 acres now stand?  I have seen it happen that he is not considered to be eligible or, if he is eligible, he has not been allowed a division.  I should hate to see this type of smallholder <Col N="649" /> at this stage of his life&mdash;and who has hung on firmly to the old sod&mdash;deprived of getting an additional acreage when it is probably his last opportunity of strengthening his weak holding.  It is a problem.  As one Land Commission inspector said to me if you had 600 acres to divide instead of 60, you could do a job like this. That is some indication of the problems Land Commission inspectors have to try to solve and too few people appreciate the thoroughness with which they do their job.  My experience has been that in the local offices in every county there are competent men who give deep consideration to the problems of applicants.  I have never yet known of a case where a major mistake was made in land allocation.  The Minister is fortunate in having men of that calibre in his Department</P>
    <P>The Land Commission decided recently that during the winter months, in some areas, they would discontinue the renting of land, or perhaps I should have said they have decided to shorten the period in which land is available to a person who has rented it and who is awaiting a division. This may continue for some years in some cases.  Land will have been rented to the person who was the highest bidder.  In this year of particular difficulty it is wellknown and, indeed, has been highlighted in this House and elsewhere that we are overstocked.  If the Land Commission were helpful and allowed people who have a letting from them to continue grazing for a further period rather than having them remove stock during a winter period necessary to allow land rest and ensure it would not be poached, it would be a relief to some people at least.  It is merely a thought. But it would take more than the Land Commission to solve the overstocking problem.  I am merely suggesting to the Minister that he might ensure, through his different offices, the granting of a grazing extension period in order to allow stock be held over because it will be a problem to hold on to it until prices improve.</P>
    <P>I appreciate the courtesy shown by the Minister since he came to office. <Col N="650" /> I want to pay him a compliment he well deserves.  I would think he has a very loyal staff in County Clare.  I wish him many fruitful years in office in implementing the policies he considers most helpful to the farmers and particularly the small farmers.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanCrinion" hpid="Mr. Crinion Mr. Crinion">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Crinion</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the news that the Minister has allocated £2,500,000 in cash for the purchase of land during the coming year.  It has always been my opinion that the purchasing of land by way of land bonds left a great deal to be desired. In effect it entailed handing a person a piece of paper in exchange for his land.  It was not as if these bonds could be realised in the same way as one could realise a national loan, for instance.  Granted the bonds were always quoted on the Stock Exchange but it was very difficult to sell them. One found oneself in a queue in so far as their realisation was concerned.  I am surprised that there was not more reaction from the people concerned especially since people found that the land which had been acquired by the Land Commission, compulsorily or otherwise, had, perhaps, doubled in value by the time it was being divided while the value of the bonds depreciated and were being quoted at say, £70.  The draw that was associated with the bonds may have been an attraction but only a small percentage of people would be lucky and even those might have held the bonds for a long time before luck came their way.</P>
      <P>Indeed, I would not be surprised if payment by way of land bonds was unconstitutional.  It would be interesting to see that case being challenged in the courts.  Perhaps such an effort might be more worthwhile than that spent in respect of some aspects of our Constitution nowadays.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The change to payment by way of cash should result in the Land Commission being able to acquire land in a much shorter period than has been the experience up to now.  On the question of the price paid for land, the Land Commission are not paying what I would regard as market value. In my own constituency land is particularly <Col N="651" /> dear and, consequently, the Land Commission must have regard to the price they will have to pay for any land they might acquire but if they do not offer a fair price, they will have difficulty in acquiring land. When poor prices are offered, people are forced to take their case to the land courts.  This cumbersome arrangement absorbs quite an amount of time and could be eliminated by a reasonable price being negotiated.</P>
    <P>In March this year I asked the Minister the amount of land that had been acquired in County Meath during the previous 12 months.  I was informed that only two farms had been acquired in that time, one of 105 acers and another of 34 acers.  In a county the size of Meath that was rather a small amount of land to have acquired during an 11-month period. Since then two other farms have been acquired.  However, one of these is not yet in the hands of the Land Commission, the Ben Dunne estate, one that should have been taken over long ago because Mr. Dunne was not a farmer and, perhaps, should not have been allowed to buy the land in the first instance.  I know that a fair price has been paid by the Land Commission for that farm.  The acquisition of land in the Coolronan area is justified because of the number of small farmers in that locality.  These acquisitions will make a worthwhile contribution to that area which consists of heavy bogland and moorlands.</P>
    <P>In some of the underdeveloped counties, including Cavan and Monaghan, there is a system of the halving of rent.  However, in areas where land is so much cheaper, there was not such great necessity for that action but, rather, the concession should have been applied in Counties Meath, Kildare and Louth where land prices are extremely high and will always be high.  It may be said that the land is much better in these counties than in those counties on the Western seaboard but in an area where rents are paid of up to £80 per statute acre, a very strong case could be made for a system of halving the annuity.</P>
    <P>It may surprise people in the west <Col N="652" /> to learn that in Meath there are as many uneconomic holdings as there are in any other county.  Unfortunately, most of those holdings were created by the Land Commission because from 1922 until the 1965 Act, the holdings allotted consisted of no more than 22 statute acres.  Since 1965 that figure has been increased to 45 acres.  What is frustrating in so far as the holders of the smaller farms are concerned is that they have very little hope of acquiring more land from the Land Commission because in most cases they would be outside the mile or the mile-and-a-half limit unless they can succeed in acquiring on another road a farm which borders the original one.</P>
    <P>When, for instance, only two or three farms in an area such as Meath are acquired each year, the problem there will never be solved.  I assure the Minister that this problem is very serious.  As the Minister has had part of Meath in his constituency for the last four years I am sure he is aware of the problem.  Possibly there are not so many Land Commission farms because it is mostly small farmers who are in that portion, people who have been in Meath for many years.  The problem was created further north in the county.</P>
    <P>The only chance of getting land in Meath is to halve the annuities, to have local migration, to take people from those areas and move them to a Land Commission farm of 60 acres. This has been tried on two farms near Trim and it has proved successful and I understand there is a possibility of another person being moved in the same area to another 50 or 60 acres. In most cases the people have been left with their own houses and stabling but they have been able to sell them on the open market and, with the money so obtained, they have been able to build houses for themselves. This has saved the Land Commission the job of providing accommodation for them and has proved agreeable to all parties.  If this course were followed to a great extent it would help to solve the problem in Meath.</P>
    <P>The retirement scheme is a welcome innovation.  The last such scheme in 1965 was a complete failure.  There <Col N="653" /> were a few reasons: first, people did not wish to give up the land and, secondly, the amount they were offered was quite small.  It was a period of rapidly rising land prices at a time when the pension offered would remain static and would be worthless in a few years.  The present scheme is better and more realistic.  I understand that 67 cases have been completed.</P>
    <P>Inflation has increased tremendously in the past 12 months&mdash;I understand it may be up to 20 per cent next month.  This means there has been an inflation rate of 10 per cent since the Government introduced the scheme. The Government should have a fixed date, perhaps 1st January or 1st April each year when pension schemes would be reviewed in the light of the cost of living.  It would help greatly if the Minister could inform us that this will happen each year.  It would show that the Minister intends to implement his promise, that the amount of pension will be based on the cost of living.  We are inclined to put things on the long finger.</P>
    <P>The scheme is worthwhile and I hope that it will be accepted by the farmers.  I have seen in the past where land ownership was a burden on a person of 70 years or less or someone who is infirm with rheumatism or arthritis.  It would be much better if such a person had a secure livelihood for himself and his wife while being able to keep their family house and a few acres.</P>
    <P>Deputy Cunningham referred to a disturbing matter which came to my notice also.  I have been told that auctioneers have been going around encouraging farmers to avail of the retirement scheme.  I have no objection to auctioneers doing that because any help given in implementing the scheme is desirable.  However, I was horrified to hear that an official of the Land Commission accompanied the auctioneers.  I was told that the farmers were given the impression that the scheme could be changed to their disadvantage.  A Government official or a Government Department should not do that.  We have always had straight dealings from our civil servants; we have always been told the <Col N="654" /> facts and we have been allowed to make up our minds.  I have always had this experience in my dealings with the Land Commission.  I hope the Minister will make a statement on this matter.</P>
    <P>When the Land Commission hold some land it should be offered to farmers in the vicinity at a reasonable rent.  I put down a parliamentary question about this matter and the Minister said the would review it but, seemingly, it was not practicable. When I say a reasonable rent I mean reasonable market value.  It is frustrating for locals to see people coming in from outside, paying high prices even though they have sufficient land of their own, and shoving up the price on those who are not able to meet the requirements.  Some of the trouble and agitation in the past few years stemmed from this sort of thing.  If at all possible those in the immediate vicinity should be offered the land first at a reasonable rate and, if they are not prepared to take it, it can then be put on the open market. What I suggest would ensure that people would have a chance of getting land at a reasonable price and it would put a stop to this practice of a man taking land because he thinks it will give him a good chance of getting the land ultimately from the Land Commission.  He feels he has got his foot in the door, so to speak, and he will give any price to get the land.  He will ignore completely the economics of the situation.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnGrattanEsmonde" hpid="Mr. Esmonde Mr. Esmonde">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Esmonde</NameTxt>
      <P>I raised that on the Estimate last year and the Minister then advised people not to put themselves in that position because it meant nothing.  Does the Deputy agree that is the situation?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanCrinion" hpid="Mr. Crinion Mr. Crinion">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Crinion</NameTxt>
      <P>I fully agree that is the position.  The Minister gave the same advice in reply to a parliamentary question since then, but I believe this should be mentioned on every opportunity that offers because it does happen.  I know of two cases in my own constituency.  I do not know whether or not the Minister was paid, but in one case the land went as high as £185 an Irish acre.  The particular <Col N="655" /> individual was determined to get it at all costs.  In another case&mdash;the Minister was paid in this case&mdash;the land went to £125 an Irish acre.  I know the particular individual was definitely staking a claim in the first case.  In the second case it was a case of necessity because the man had extra stock and he had to get the land beside him to feed the stock. The man who was prepared to pay the £185 per Irish acre had refused land a few years previously; he was asked if he was interested and he said he was not.  Subsequently he wanted to show that he was interested in extra land and he went to the extreme of offering this price without any regard to economic considerations.  Everything possible should be done to counteract this sort of thing and to keep the land at a reasonable price so that really deserving people can get some benefit. If the cash was there, possibly there would not be so many cases going to the Land Courts.  Adjudication is a lengthy process.  I know that in Meath and Kildare it takes the best part of two years to acquire land by the time the negotiations are completed. The matter then goes to the Land Court and a decision is given. Possibly there is a stay of execution to enable whoever has the land to get rid of cattle.  All that takes time.</P>
      <P>With regard to the farm modernisation scheme, the Minister said that only certain people will be considered. This might be very unfair to numbers of smallholders with 22, 26 and 30 acres of land.  These are uneconomic holdings and their owners must work elsewhere than on the land.  Meath and Kildare are close to Dublin and these smallholders can find employment in the factories.  They probably have quite a reasonable income from this work, a higher income than they could get from their small holdings. I believe they will not qualify for farm modernisation scheme grants and they would not be in a position to get additional land.</P>

      <P>There is one section of the Minister's Department which operates somewhat slowly.  It is the subdivision section. The delay occurs where land is not vested.  A family has grown up and a building site is required.  The only way the problem can be solved is for the farmer owner signing for the farm minus the building site.  This is a very lengthy process.</P>
      <P>I put down a question to the Minister for written reply this week and he said there were some printing holdups in the Land Registry and that was the cause of the delay in some cases. Subdivision should be started within a reasonable time, such as two months. If a housing site is involved, payment of the loan can be held up.  Sometimes people will not get a bridging loan from the banks until they can show they have got the site in their own names, even though the loan has been sanctioned.</P>

It is getting everybody to sign on the dotted line.  It then has to go back to the inspector to be reviewed and two months would be a bit short for that.  People do not come into the office in time.  This is part of the trouble.  I know this is a fact.  I quite appreciate what the Deputy is saying.</P>

      <P>That could be.  We are thankful that it is now cleared up. I am glad the Minister appreciates that the EEC directive that the retiring farmer should go completely out of farming is wrong.  If a man has been working hard he cannot be suddenly left with nothing to do.  That would be bad for him.  If he wants to he can help a neighbouring farmer at busy times.  The Minister is to be complimented on recognising that.  It is stated that a retiring farmer should not engage in any other farming activity.  On his two acres, to occupy himself he or his wife could have a farmyard enterprise such as poultry or pigs.  He should not be debarred from occupying himself usefully and under the directive he would be debarred from engaging in a farmyard enterprise.  I suppose if his wife was keeping only a dozen hens a blind eye would be turned to that, but if she were keeping more than that it would be different.</P>

    <P>I dealt with the fact that the <Col N="658" /> scheme is entirely voluntary.  If an inspector goes out with an auctioneer I would not call that voluntary, but I am sure the Minister will reassure me on that when he is replying. Another aspect of the retirement scheme is that if a man has married late in life he can lease the farm for 12 years.  It is good to see that his family can take over the land again.</P>
    <P>I presume that if the farmer who retires was in receipt of or can qualify for social welfare benefit, such as an old age contributory pension or disability benefit, he will still get it as well as his retirement pension under the retirement scheme.  The Minister will probably get a fair influx of applications during this autumn and winter since we have had such a bad season for cattle.  Some people will feel that they would like to have a more secure income with cattle prices as they are.</P>
    <P>The Land Commission have had land on hand in County Meath for a long time.  Only a few of those farms have been divided since the spring.  It is the Minister's intention to press on as quickly as possible to clear up the backlog.  It is frustrating to see big acreages of land in the hands of the Land Commission for five, six or seven years, or even ten years.  A worthwhile effort could be made to clear the backlog and not have quite so much land in the hands of the Land Commission.  The people in the area would welcome getting the land in a reasonable time after the Land Commission have taken it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JosephMcLoughlin" hpid="Mr. McLaughlin Mr. McLaughlin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McLaughlin</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to thank the Minister for having provided us with such a useful document.  We do not seem to realise that the cost of paying salaries and wages in the Minister's Department and the Land Commission is in excess of £5 million and this sum is only for nine months.  I should like to compliment the Minister on the amount of work he is doing in his Department.  I have always found the Minister, his officials, and the officials in the Land Commission, very helpful when I had occasion to approach them in relation to the division of land.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Forestry Division of the Minister's <Col N="659" /> Department are doing a great job.  At Rockingham, outside Boyle in County Roscommon, this division developed a magnificent park which is visited by people throughout the year. I believe the numbers who frequent this park are beyond the expectations of the Minister.  It is a real show-piece where every facility is available for the family on picnic.  I have not visited this park but friends who have done so have spoken in glowing terms of the facilities and the scenery there.</P>
    <P>I have spoken on many occasions about the staff in the Department of Lands and in particular in Land Commission offices.  I am glad the position has improved somewhat.  I have had occasion to visit Land Commission offices in Sligo and Carrick-on-Shannon to find the staff there over-burdened with work&mdash;one active Deputy could keep the entire staff busy&mdash;and as a result the staff were unable to carry out outdoor duties.  In passing I should like to compliment the staff on doing their work under very difficult circumstances. I am glad to see that additional staff will be appointed in these offices.</P>
    <P>While we may find fault with some of the staff it should be stated that they are always in a position to give us a genuine answer to our queries.  It should be remembered that they suffer many setbacks in the course of their negotiations to purchase land.  Legal problems can arise regarding title or a friend who has not been heard of for many years may suddenly appear on the horizon to upset all the negotiations. It takes them a long time to get everything in order before they can make the final transfer.</P>
    <P>I have always expressed my disappointment that it takes so long from the time the Land Commission decide to acquire land until they are in a position to divide it.  Deputies are so accustomed to the situation that they take it for granted that it will be some years before the land is disposed of.</P>
    <P>The precautions taken before land is taken over should be sufficient to enable the Land Commission to dispose of it without much delay.  However, land is being reset for many <Col N="660" /> years with the result that bad feelings are created among neighbours.  When the land eventually is put up for public auction neighbours bid against each other and finish up on bad terms. People in my area have complained that they were robbed over the price they were asked to pay for land which they had held from the Land Commission for many years.  These people felt that because they had the grazing rights for many years they held some title to the land.  The Minister should do everything possible to speed up land division.</P>
    <P>The Minister has explained where the money derived from sales goes.  I was glad to hear this explanation because we have trouble explaining this to our constituents.  Some people think that the Land Commission are making a fortune on the sale of land because they hear of large sums being paid for the land.  It is wrong that land should be in the hands of the Land Commission for upwards of ten years and not divided.  However, I know the Minister will investigate this position with a view to rectifying it.</P>
    <P>Before the Land Commission acquire land they make sure that an adjoining farmer is entitled to it and for this reason it should not be a great problem to dispose of it.  In cases they must wait until they have a pool of land before putting a holding on the market but that does not always apply.  Some farms lie idle for years.</P>
    <P>I should now like to refer to the purchase of land by non-nationals.  I had hoped to have a word with the Minister before I received a document concerning this matter.  Due to pressure in my constituency I have had occasion to discuss with the Minister questions of dividing holdings for the benefit of small farmers.  There is nothing more disappointing for three or four small farmers who have been waiting for a farm for years to be taken over by the Land Commission than to discover they are not going to get it.  Due to the rise in the price of cattle and the high cost of living people are more interested in land than they have been for years previously. Most public representatives have been <Col N="661" /> in the position of making representations through every channel in order to have land taken over, and we hope the Minister and the Land Commission will do their utmost to provide holdings for the small farmers in a locality where land is being divided.</P>
    <P>I must congratulate the Minister on making available a sum of £2,250,000 for the purchase of land for cash. This will solve a lot of thorny problems for the Land Commission and the Department.  I have known the Land Commission for years to be trying to negotiate and reach agreement with people who have farms to dispose of and then they discover that a widow had disposed of her farm unknown to them.  The Land Commission do not like to be harsh, and this provision will save many headaches. This sum will pay for quite a substantial amount of land and will make it much easier on the Minister's staff who will be working from various offices throughout the country.  It was a job to convince people that bonds could be sold and sold well.  It was only a piece of paper as far as the farmers were concerned.  The greater the use of cash as a means of payment for land acquired by voluntary process, the less will be the need for compulsory acquisition.  Everybody knows about the long delays involved in compulsory acquisition, the trouble that leads to Land Commission courts presided over by men from Dublin. Payment of cash means that even relatives who are away from home will be quite happy to know that their parents are selling under satisfactory conditions.  The Minister said in his speech:</P>
    <P>Purchases for cash are, of course, now treated as a capital item and the provision is being made by way of grant-in-aid under a separate subhead G.1 a procedure which will enable any part of the money issued but unexpended to be used in the following year.  This will facilitate forward planning and the orderly regulation of transactions.</P>
    <P>The Minister goes on to refer to subhead G.2 which provides £180,000 for the life annuities which will be set up and the premiums which will fall for <Col N="662" /> payment in the period ending 31st December, 1974, under the new retirement scheme introduced recently. I can assure the Minister this scheme will meet with a very good reception throughout the country, but there are many people who do not know much about it.  Where people rent a farm for 12 years it would be as well to let them know who has to pay the rent for those 12 years.  I know the scheme will get the necessary publicity from those people who will be going around to meet applicants.  It is a scheme that will be very much availed of when people learn more about it.  Further on in his speech the Minister said:</P>
    <P>Deputies will expect me to comment on subhead I under which provision is made for the money required to erect houses and outoffices and to construct fences, roads, drains, and so on, found necessary in the course of estate improvement work.</P>
    <P>A sum of £700,000 is allocated for these works.  This will go a long way towards supplementing the grants from the Department of Local Government. The Minister said:</P>
    <P>The scheme under which advances are made to farmers to supplement grants from the Department of Local Government for the erection of new houses and for reconstruction work on existing houses is also financed under Subhead I and loans amounting to £41,486 were authorised during the year.</P>
    <P>The Minister went on:</P>
    <P>On the acquisition side, the aggregate area inspected during the year was 36,267 acres while the total intake of land amounted to about 20,400 acres.  The total area in the acquisition machine at 31st March, 1974, amounted to some 79,500 acres.</P>
    <P>This indicates the amount of work the Land Commission have in hands during each year, the number of farms they have to inspect and negotiate on and which they might still not succeed in acquiring.  They do an <Col N="663" /> enormous amount of work without much reward.</P>
    <P>I should like to repeat a statement I have made several times.  Along the western coast from Galway, through Mayo, Sligo to Donegal there are thousands of small holdings suitable for acquisition and subsequent vesting. We are told by the Land Commission that they do not take land to give to one person but these holdings are so small that it would not be viable from any point of view to divide them among neighbouring smallholders.  I suggest that where two or three such holdings fall to be acquired they should be given to one person who could then with hard work make them into an economic proposition.  The Minister should seriously consider revising earlier ideas in this regard.</P>
    <P>On the question of land settlement the Minister said:</P>
    <P>As regards land settlement for the year, the total area allotted amongst 1,946 allottees was about 35,600 acres.  The acreage distributed included the provision of 49 fully-equipped holdings comprising 3,493 acres for migrants and the rearrangement of 473 fragmented holdings.  In all, 52 new dwelling-houses and 61 new outoffices were provided for tenants and allottees during the year.</P>
    <P>We must congratulate the Minister on these achievements.  A lot of new homes have been provided for people who needed them.  I know the efforts in this regard are appreciated in Sligo and in Leitrim.  I spoke earlier about the pooling of land.  In this scheme the Land Commission have provided many fine holdings and homes.  The existing pool of land is due to be divided among people who are anxious for extra land and who are living adjacent to the estates concerned.</P>
    <P>The Minister referred to the new retirement scheme and stated:</P>
    <P>I need scarcely say that the future operations of the Land Commission will be governed to a large extent by the success or otherwise of the EEC Retirement Scheme.  Deputies, <Col N="664" /> especially those from rural constituencies, will be aware that on 1st May last I announced that I had made regulations introducing the new farmers' retirement scheme for the implementation of EEC Directive 160 on encouragement to leave farming.</P>
    <P>He explained the objective of the scheme:</P>
    <P>The objective of the scheme is to enable farmers, particularly those in the elderly age group&mdash;over 55&mdash; who for one reason or another are not happily or profitably engaged in agriculture and who wish to give up farming, to retire in dignity and financial security.  It is a fact that in modern society most workers can retire at a certain age and enjoy a pension which will keep them in reasonable comfort for the rest of their lives.</P>
    <P>That would place any farmer in the same position as a worker in industry or an official in the public service. He would be able to go on pension and continue to have the home he had previously.  The Minister explained:</P>
    <P>For the first time in our history a farmer who wishes to retire can do so with a guaranteed income for the rest of his life provided he satisfies the necessary conditions. In this way land will be made available to neighbouring farmers determined to advance their agricultural operations under the modernisation scheme being implemented by the Department of Agriculture and Fisheries.</P>
    <P>The Minister will have no problem in getting people to sign that agreement because they will be financially comfortable at that stage and they will not have any occasion to break the rule.  He has gone further to say that he is not holding these people completely to the rules of the EEC.  He has stated if they wish to go out and work with a farmer they can do so, with certain conditions.  The conditions are much easier than those laid down by the EEC.</P>
    <P>The Minister has stated that if the retiring farmer wishes he can keep the dwellinghouse he has lived in and up <Col N="665" /> to two acres around it.  This is an important consideration for the status and the emotional well-being of the farmer concerned as it means he has not to break with the friends and neighbours with whom he has lived all his life.  That is very useful information to have because at that stage in life people who worked on the land and lived among good neighbours do not like to move away from them.  They do not like to move into a new village and live in a new neighbourhood where they know very few people.  The same could apply to any of us.  It is very useful to those people to know they can remain in their own homes which they have repaired, or perhaps reconstructed, instead of going into new houses.</P>
    <P>There is another benefit of considerable significance.  The Minister stated:</P>
    <P>A retiring farmer can continue to work in agriculture either permanently or casually provided, of course, that he does not engage in commercial farming in his own right.  The directive lays down that a farmer who avails of the benefits of the scheme should cease all agricultural activity.  For myself I regarded this as an unreasonable provision; it would mean that a retired farmer could not even help a neighbouring farmer in times of seasonal pressure. Such a restriction would be bad both for the psychological well-being of the person in question and for the agricultural economy in general where there is often a dearth of labour.  I arranged that this point be presented strongly to the Commission in Brussels and I am glad to report that they accepted our case.</P>
    <P>This means that this man of 55 or 60 years of age is free to go to a neighbour and help him.  If he wishes to earn some money he is free to do so. This new scheme prepared by the Minister gives all the encouragement that is required.  The Minister went on to deal with some aspects of the scheme which have given rise to misunderstanding. He stated:</P>
    <P>One of these is the question of priority access to land made available under the scheme.  The position <Col N="666" /> here is that, as required by the EEC Directive 160, farmers with development plans approved under the Department of Agriculture and Fisheries modernisation scheme will have priority on lands made available by the retirement scheme where their plans confirm that extra land is needed.  The retirement scheme and the farm modernisation scheme are very closely interlinked and arrangements have been made both at local and at headquarter levels to ensure the closest liaison in the administration of the two schemes. A certain amount of anxiety has been expressed throughout the country about the position of a class of farmers now designed as transitional farmers.</P>
    <P>I believe that farmers in a very short time will know enough about this scheme because the Minister has told me that the Land Commission inspectors will be only too glad to go out and interview those people.  This scheme will give great satisfaction to many people.</P>
    <P>I would now like to say a few words about the Forestry Division of the Department of Lands.  This is one of the most efficient sections of any Department.  The staff are trained from the time they become forestry employees.  We were often disappointed when a forestry job was carried out in our own areas that local employees were not taken on. We afterwards discovered that the Forestry Division were right and we were wrong.  They sent a group of men perhaps ten miles to make sure that their staff were in constant employment and also because they knew those were skilled workers and very little supervision was needed.  There is a lot to be said for that.</P>
    <P>The Department pay the forestry workers well but I can assure the Minister they are a very hard-working group of men.  We can often be critical of the Forestry Division but everywhere we go we see the fruits of their work.  There are huge forests all over the country.  We see trucks fully laden with timber and we see sawmills supplied from our local forests.  We also <Col N="667" /> see men employed all the year round by the Forestry Division.</P>
    <P>The Minister mentioned that his Department were finding it difficult to purchase land now.  I did not agree with the reason he gave.  I believe the difficulty is because the price of cattle increased in recent years.  They were very valuable before our present setback. Everybody knows if this winter were over and we got back to normal sales and export trade the price of cattle would increase.  That is why the Minister and the Department have found it difficult to purchase land and I think they will find it difficult to get land in future.  The flow of emigration has decreased.  Many school leavers now go to work on the family farm because up to six or eight months ago they got money for it; cattle prices were excellent.</P>
    <P>Others became interested in land due to the rising cost of living.  They decided they would have to work more and grow more on the land.  I think the time is coming when many of us will have to work harder on the land. Hitherto it was a matter of getting ready money with less work but now we shall all have to do more work on the land.</P>
    <P>As I have said previously, I do not like the Forestry Division buying good land while they do not like buying bad land.  That is understandable.  The Forestry Division will say truthfully that if you buy bad land you must have a fair proportion of good land.  But in many cases the Land Commission have not taken over land for division among four or five small farmers and the Forestry Division have moved in and bought land that could have made comfortable holdings for local people. That is another reason why the Minister finds it difficult to get land.  As he said:</P>
    <P>The difficulty in reaching price agreement for the purchase of land for State forestry and the trend towards a slower rate of closing of sales referred to by me in my speech on the Estimate for last year have become even more acute.  These adverse trends are due mainly to unsettled conditions in the general <Col N="668" /> market for land as well as to a hesitancy on the part of owners in offering lands at all for forestry: owners are obviously reluctant to sell until a clearer picture emerges of the effects of the various EEC directives in the area of agriculture.</P>
    <P>That is what I have been trying to say&mdash;that reluctance to sell is due to the unsettled situation of agriculture at present.  I have no doubt that this crisis has been due mainly to the very bad harvest and that when the effects of this disappear we shall have no trouble in getting back to good prices and the Minister will have a problem in getting land.  The Minister continued:</P>
    <P>In these conditions it is very difficult to predict future acquisition prospects.  Deputies may rest assured, however, that no effort is being spared on our endeavour to attain our acquisition targets.</P>
    <P>The Department should consider establishing some type of factory where forestry has been successful in the west. There are thousands of acres of forest there from which timber must be hauled from 60 to 100 miles across the country while if a factory existed there, the timber could be utilised without breaking up our roads and wasting time and money on haulage.  We proposed in Leitrim County Council that some industry should be started that would absorb forestry timber and the proposal was put to the Department but it was turned down and timber had to be sent from the lower end of Leitrim down to County Clare.  The same applies in Sligo where there is very successful forestry.  Very high haulage expenses are involved without any local benefit while if a factory were established local employment could be provided by the same money instead of spending it on long journeys to some chipboard factory in County Clare.  The Department should therefore consider establishing an industry that would absorb much of this timber.</P>
    <P>A very useful return is being obtained from forestry at present and I must congratulate the forestry workers on the job they are doing. <Col N="669" /> As the Minister said:</P>
    <P>Forest Development and Management, at £4,830,000 is the main expenditure subhead in this Vote.  The major provisions in the subhead relate to the raising of nursery stock in the State forest nurseries, the establishment costs of all new plantations including ground preparation and fencing, road and bridge construction, the development of facilities for public recreation in our forests, the purchase and maintenance of forest machinery and the hire of suitable machinery from outside sources....</P>
    <P>This is very necessary today because without modern machinery progress was very slow.  Today, men and machinery can move in and do a very successful job in a few months that would otherwise take years.  I congratulate the Minister on having allocated so much money to that subhead.  A very substantial sum is being spent in giving employment, on the purchase and hire of machinery and the purchase of land.</P>
    <P>The total provision for the current year, at £4,830,000 is the equivalent of a sum of £6,332,000 for a full year, which would represent an increase of £805,000 on a provision of £5,527,000 for 1973-74.</P>

      <P>Deputy Molloy gave me notice of his intention to raise on the Adjournment the subject matter of Questions Nos. 10 and 11 which appeared on today's Order Paper.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Mr. Molloy Mr. Molloy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>Questions Nos. 10 and 11 which I had down to the Minister for Local Government today were as follows:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>10.  To ask the Minister for Local Government the schemes in the guaranteed order project in which structural defects are alleged to have occurred; and in respect of each scheme if he will give (a) particulars of the defects (b) the date on which the final account was settled and (c) whether the defects <Col N="670" /> were remedied before settlement of the final account.</P>
    <P>11.  To ask the Minister for Local Government if he will give particulars of directions issued to the effect that cheap materials or inferior standards of construction were to be used in the building of any local authority dwellings.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Local Government has repeated on numerous occasions over the past 18 months allegations that instructions were issued by me, while Minister for Local Government, that cheap materials and inferior standards of construction were to be used in the building of local authority houses under the guaranteed order project and executed by the National Building Agency.  My questions today were placed on the Order Paper for the sole purpose of exposing this falsehood once and for all.  This I have succeeded in doing as, in the Minister's lengthy reply&mdash;containing, as it does, so much &ldquo;bull&rdquo;&mdash;the truth shines out bright and clear in the very last line of his reply which stated:</P>
    <P>...no specific directions were given about the use of any particular cheap materials, or any specific inferior standards of construction.</P>
    <P>Attached to the reply is a list of schemes and details of minor defects, all of which have been attended to within the maintenance period order or are being attended to.  The list is a familiar one to any person ever associated with the construction of houses, and their rectification is guaranteed through the use of the retention of the money clause in the contracts.</P>
    <P>Those who have ever had the responsibility of spending the public's money have a duty also to see that they get good value for it.  On this question of value for money I want to nail down one falsehood which the Minister has been propagating.  He has alleged that the primary object of the guaranteed order project was to pare down housing costs to a minimum by reducing housing standards of construction and accommodation. For detailed information about these objectives and the standards of accommodation <Col N="671" /> provided, I would refer Deputies to the annual reports issued by the National Building Agency, which body was responsible for carrying out the project.  In pages 11 and 12 of the 1972 report one finds the agency's general evaluation of the project, and I quote:</P>
    <P>Apart from cost savings in high cost areas, the objectives of the Minister for Local Government in setting up the Project included greater general efficiency in the use of capital resources, better organisation and wider distribution of overheads in the building industry, guaranteed output and greater stability for firms and workers.  The Project was also designed to encourage an open-minded attitude to new materials, techniques and new forms of construction generally and to secure a high standard of finished dwellings, the elimination of delays in the planning and execution of housing schemes and the development of an overall flexible method of housebuilding which can readily respond to periodical demands that may arise for a greater volume of production either nationally or locally.</P>
    <P>In general, proposals accepted under the Project are based on housing standards equal to or better than existing local authority standards and contain many different forms of construction ranging from traditional type of dwellings to a variety of forms of prefabrication. The project is an ongoing one and new names are added to the firms short-listed by the Department of Local Government according as their negotiations result in acceptable proposals.  Proposals for the use of new designs, materials or building methods which offer prospects of economies in cost combined with structural acceptability are welcomed at all times by the Department.</P>
    <P>The agency has developed a specialised service to carry our work under the Project, and for this purpose has engaged the services of highly qualified architectural staff <Col N="672" /> and teams of consultants who have special experience of local authority housing design and construction problems.  It is this special service which has enabled such a large programme to be mounted, and the first houses under it completed, in a remarkably short time.</P>
    <P>Accepting that in any new programme, problems are bound to arise, the Agency is confident that its special service under the Project will help to overcome such problems and give a fast and efficient service to housing authorities.  The quality of the design resources available to the Agency should ensure also that their schemes are of the highest design standards.</P>
    <P>That report and its evaluation of the guaranteed order project speaks for itself.  There is very little I need add to it.  Let me add that that report was not written by me.  That report was presented to me by the chairman and directors of the National Building Agency&mdash;Mr. Shane O'Hanlon, chairman, also assistant secretary in the Department of Local Government in charge of housing; Mr. J. B. Mckenna, then and still a director, as is Mr. O'Hanlon, Mr. H. B. Clerkin, then the technical director in the National Building Agency and since appointed managing director of the National Building Agency, by the Minister for Local Government, with substantial remuneration.</P>
    <P>On the question of accommodation, I would refer Deputies to pages 11 and 17 of the 1971 report which contains plans of the house designs provided by four of the major contractors engaged in the project.  The plans are there for any Deputy who wants to check them out&mdash;for five different types of 3-bedroomed houses, for two types of 4-bedroomed houses and one for old persons, all of which are illustrated. The accommodation in the 3-bedroomed houses measures 765, 819, 843, 852 and 855 square feet and, in the four-bedroomed houses, 892 and 940 square feet.</P>
    <P>If the Minister is refuting the statement in the agency's report that these standards are equal to or better than existing local authority standards, perhaps <Col N="673" /> he would give details of the standards of accommodation generally provided in local authority houses.  The allegation that the objective of the project was to achieve economies by reducing standards of construction is a flat contradiction of the statement which I have just quoted from the agency's report&mdash;that the project was designed to secure a high standard of finished dwellings and that, in general, proposals accepted under the project are based on housing standards equal to or better than existing local authority standards.  I leave Deputies to decide for themselves which version is correct.</P>
    <P>Perhaps I may quote from <i>The Sunday Press</i> of April 21st, 1974 in an article entitled &ldquo;That NBA Housing Row&rdquo;, subtitled &ldquo;Low Cost Problems&rdquo;, where it said:</P>
    <P>Mr. Shane O'Hanlon, NBA chairman, and assistant secretary of the Department of Local Government, explained last week that these were the Department's minimum acceptable standards&mdash;i.e., the standards below which local authorities were directed not to go.  He added that these minimum standards are above the normal standards in many European countries, even in private housing.</P>
    <P>That was Mr. O'Hanlon's opinion.  He presented the report to me at that time on the work of the National Building Agency.  He has been reappointed as chairman of the National Building Agency by the Minister who, by so doing, endorses confidence in the work Mr. O'Hanlon had done before that time.</P>
    <P>I have inspected schemes of houses provided by the principal contractors under the project at Galway, Clondalkin, Finglas Valley and I have spoken to a large number of tenants in those schemes.  From what I saw and from my talks with the tenants I am satisfied that not only is the Minister uttering falsehoods about the objectives of the project but that he is uttering even greater falsehoods about the finished scheme.</P>

      <P>I am saying that the Minister's statements have not been true.  It is not my fault if he persists in malicious propaganda and in disgracing himself by making wild and unsupportable statements about the work of the builders, the designers and the supervisors of this project. My job is to tell the truth and anybody else who wishes to make a liar of himself is welcome to do so.  As every Deputy knows, all public works are carried out in accordance with plans and specifications which form the contract documents and it is within the legal responsibility of the architect to ensure that contracts are carried out in accordance with the contract documents.  Without producing the slightest evidence the Minister is alleging that the specifications for schemes in this project provide for the use of inferior materials and for the acceptance of sub-standard work leading to structural defects.  This is a deliberate untruth and a gross reflection on the work of everybody concerned in the project, particularly the professional officers.</P>

Not only is the Minister doing that but he is casting a gross reflection on the work of everybody concerned in this project, particularly the professional officers. It used be the position that civil servants avoided public discussion about ministerial policies, past or present.  If statements had to be issued about matters of current interest, they were issued usually by anonymous spokesmen. This arrangement had obvious advantages for both sides.

We have now been subjected to a further exhibition of the bad manners of the Deputy who not only has been contemptuous of the Chair but has done something which nobody with any decency would attempt to do, that is, attack the civil servants who, unfortunately, worked with him during his period as Minister.  That is something that must not be allowed in this House under any circumstances and on any occasion on which it is attempted I shall do my best to defend the officials concerned.  These are decent public officials who, at all times, carried out their work in what they considered to be the best interests of the country.  It is outrageous that this attack should have been made on them.  It is obvious that Deputy Molloy had no case and, realising that, he decided to walk out.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>The position is that I gave a reply to the Deputy today to a <Col N="677" /> number of questions he had tabled. The questions related to whether the low-cost housing scheme introduced during his term as Minister required numerous repairs.  I listed both the schemes and the repairs that were required. Tenants of these schemes and, indeed, the tenants of some of the schemes completed before the ones in question, will confirm that the schemes were badly built as a result of instructions given by the then Minister for Local Government and that is something from which Deputy Molloy cannot get away.</P>
      <P>At the opening of a scheme of 50 Dublin Corporation flats, at Upper Dorset Street, on 27th August, 1970, the then Minister said:</P>
      <P>I am prepared to consider proposals for dwellings which might have a shorter life than those provided by traditional methods.</P>
      <P>The attitude was that since only working class people would be living in the houses, the standard could be reduced.  At the opening of the D. O'Malley Park and Kincora Park housing schemes at Limerick on the 7th September, 1970, Deputy Molloy spoke of an examination that was being carried out into the methods of building by the use of rationalised components in traditional building and he said:</P>
      <P>This examination will include an investigation of the possibility of using dwellings having a shorter life than our traditional dwellings. Substantial savings on current building costs must be made.  The country simply cannot afford houses at their present prices nor can families in urgent need of housing wait until the country can afford such prices.</P>
      <P>That was the considered opinion of the then Minister for Local Government in 1970.  At the opening of 153 houses at Dundalk on 27th January, 1971, Deputy Molloy said:</P>
      <P>This is why I am paying particular attention in the new project which I have initiated in my Department for low cost housing to the environment....</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>and he spoke of the concept of <Col N="678" /> securing significant cost economies.</P>
    <P>In the Estimates debate in the Dáil on 27th May, 1971, the then Minister said at column 433, volume 254:</P>
    <P>In inviting building interests to put before me proposals for low-cost housing I had hoped that some radical new ideas might be forthcoming. As I mentioned, one of my aims in launching the project was to encourage proposals for buildings with a probable life span shorter than that accepted for traditional housing, provided that proportional savings in cost could be anticipated. The response in this respect has been disappointing, possibly because a reduction in the probable life span of building seems, in the eyes of builders, to imply an undue lowering of standards and increased difficulties, first in obtaining a satisfactory finish to houses and subsequently in remedying any defects arising.</P>
    <P>How right were the builders.  They knew their job.  They knew that what the Fianna Fáil Government and their Minister for Local Government wanted was a house that could be built cheaply for people who were only working class.</P>
    <P>During an inspection of work in progress on schemes at Clondalkin, Tallaght and Lucan on 23rd November, 1971, the then Minister said:</P>
    <P>The new procedures entailed by the project have certain disabilities and I have no intention of glossing over these.  Some people, for example, have been worried by the term &ldquo;low-cost&rdquo; ...Some local authorities have assumed that the idea was to produce cheap and substandard dwellings.</P>
    <P>Of course, the local authorities were right in so assuming.</P>
    <P>At the annual dinner of the Master Builders Association on 24th November, 1971, Deputy Molloy said:</P>
    <P>The response to my invitation did not produce satisfactory proposals for low-cost housing dwelling units having a shorter life expectancy than that normally acceptable for <Col N="679" /> dwellings but which can be built cheaply and quickly.</P>
    <P>In a circular from the Department to county managers dated 31st July, 1970, it was stated that:</P>
    <P>The Minister has asked that the investigation should include an examination of the possibility of using, within the housing programme, dwelling units which would have a shorter life than traditional dwellings being erected by local authorities at the present time, due regard being had to the maintenance factor.</P>
    <P>Further in that circular there is the comment and I quote:</P>
    <P>These economies have not, however, made a sufficient impact on the rising costs of building local authority dwellings.  He thinks, therefore that a more radical approach must be tried to see whether significant economies can be achieved in the manner now proposed.</P>
    <P>It was a question of building the houses as cheaply as possible, using the cheapest materials in an effort to keep prices down.  The attitude was that Fianna Fáil wanted houses; they would be out of office in any event by the time all the houses were built.</P>
    <P>The Minister sent a memo to the Government in March, 1971, in which he said:</P>
    <P>Arising out of discussions between the Ministers for Finance and Local Government about the need for introducing capital cost economies in the housing programme, the Minister for Local Government, in August 1970, invited manufacturers and contractors to submit for his consideration proposals for dwellings of acceptable standard which would offer significant savings on the basis of substantial guaranteed orders over a period of three to five years.</P>
    <P>So was born the guaranteed order project which guaranteed certain builders an enormous number of these cheap houses.  The former Minister for Finance stated that he had seen when he was in Industry and Commerce various proposals for <Col N="680" /> non-traditional houses, some of which were of the type which could be packed in boxes and erected in a very short time and he thought they should be used.  The houses looked just like the boxes in which Deputy Colley saw them packed and now he can see them all over the place.  I do not want to bore the House with a continuation of this but all the time it was a question of trying to have cheaper houses built.</P>
    <P>Deputy Molloy referred to the size of the houses.  He seems to have forgotten he issued specific instructions to the county managers that the houses should be smaller, that the height of the ceiling should be reduced to eight feet and that the windows should be smaller.  Later on he came forward with his gem that there should be no fireplaces and he put in central heating.  I do not know where it would have finished if the people had not put Fianna Fáil out of office.  They would be building dog kennels, trying to persuade unfortunate people they were lucky to get such houses.</P>
    <P>While this was going on the cost of the houses to the tenants was being increased.  Because of the direct intervention of Ministers on the instruction of their Government houses were built in the cheapest possible way. The phraseology used in a number of circulars was, &ldquo;the biggest number of houses within the amount of money available&rdquo;.  Apparently it was decided by the Minister for Finance and the Minister for Local Government that too much money was being spent in working-class houses.</P>
    <P>The instruction was that cheaper houses should be built.  There were to be no back entrances; the houses were to be built in terraces; there were to be no side entrances; no front walls, or if they had to be built they were to be as low as possible.  People who badly need houses are glad to get new houses; it is only when they get possession that they realise what is wrong.  As a result of the policy of the Minister, a bag of coal or a barrow of manure had to be delivered to the front door because there were no back entrances.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="681" /> Perhaps Deputy Molloy, who was in such a rush out of here tonight, has never had the pleasure of living in a local authority house.  People who live in these houses are very decent people and are extremely houseproud.  When they get a house they paper the walls and the hall and they put carpets on the floor.  It is too bad to ask them to accept that they must have the bag of coal carried through the house on a wet day when it may spill on the floor or rub against the walls or have the barrow of manure wheeled over their carpet.  This is what Deputy Molloy's Government wanted to do and it is what we stopped.</P>
    <P>There will be no more such houses. The houses built now are decent ones. They have fireplaces, they have back entrances or side entrances.  There is no question of houses being built without a wall in front of the garden.  If Deputy Molloy has spare time perhaps he would walk round some of the new housing schemes being built by this Government.  Maybe I should not have allowed it to happen but because a number of schemes had been planned and had been started when I came into office I had to allow them to be finished in the condition in which they were.  I am sorry now I did not stop some of them because when one sees them completed one realises it is unfair to ask people to rear families in them.  They are not proper houses.</P>
    <P>There is a list of matters in the reply I gave Deputy Molloy today which shows what can happen when substandard houses are built.  I agree the builders are being asked to repair them.  In most cases, because the builders want to stay in business, they will carry out certain repairs but the <Col N="682" /> houses will never be suitable.  Even before all this started, there were also the houses that caused all the trouble to tenants in Cork, one scheme in Drogheda and schemes around this city.  These houses are a disgrace to any Government responsible for their erection.</P>
    <P>Yet Deputy Molloy has the audacity to come in here and accuse me of telling lies.  If we want to know who is telling lies and who is telling the truth the records will show the facts.  Anyone who wants to find out the situation before the change of Government and since I got control of the Department of Local Government can see who wanted the bad housing schemes and was prepared to stand over them.  They need not go any further than reading the records.</P>
    <P>I am appalled that a former Minister should come in here and, not for the first time, attempt to belittle the officials of the Department of Local Government.  When I was in Opposition, and now in Government, I always defended the employees of the State.  I believe the officials of the Department of Local Government are the finest officials in the country. I believe that civil servants here have a higher standard than in any other country I know.  It ill befits a former Minister to try to belittle them.  What they did when he was Minister was what he told them to do.  What they are doing now is what I tell them to do.  I am proud of what they are doing; it is rather a pity Deputy Molloy cannot be as proud of what they did in his time.</P>
    <P>The Dáil adjourned at 11 p.m. until 10.30 a.m. on Thursday, 31st October, 1974.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Transport and Power (Mr. P. Barry)</NameTxt>
      <P>Under the Air Navigation and Transport Acts I may <Col N="558" /> grant authorisations for the operation of internal air services and over the years such authorisations have been granted to a number of operators in respect of various domestic routes. There is no application before my Department at present in respect of additional internal scheduled services.</P>
      <P>The Deputy will probably have seen a report of the Committee on Regional Policy and Transport of the European Parliament.  This report is concerned with general infrastructural policy and in so far as aviation is concerned suggests an internal network using 30 or 40 small airfields at a possible cost of £10 million.  The report does not quantify the need for such a network, the extent to which it would be utilised or the prospects of economic operation.  It does acknowledge, however, that &ldquo;with a low density population in small centres, the economics of a fully integrated internal network of developed airfields might be questionable&rdquo;.  This conclusion is consistent with recent experience and earlier studies.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Aer Lingus network provides links on the routes Dublin/Cork and Dublin/Shannon.  Aer Lingus inform me that they have from time to time studied the question of domestic operations. <Col N="559" /> These studies have examined the problem from different angles but have indicated no prospect of commercial success.  As the Deputy is no doubt aware, the Aer Arann service which is operated by a company in which Gaeltarra Éireann have an interest, provides regular links between Galway and the Aran Islands.</P>

      <P>The First Council Directive (EEC) of 23rd July, 1962 as amended by a directive of 19th December, 1972 came into force in Ireland on 1st July, 1973.  The directive, as amended, freed certain categories of international road transport between member states of the EEC from all licensing and quota arrangements; certain other categories of transport were freed from quota restrictions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Directive No. 74/149 of 4th March, 1974, to which the Deputy refers, further amended the First Council Directive by freeing certain other categories of international transport within the Community from licensing or quota arrangements and by revising the list of categories of transport freed from quota restrictions.  As in the case <Col N="560" /> of the earlier directive, the necessary arrangements to give effect to Directive No. 74/149 from 1st July, 1974 were made by my Department on an administrative basis and advertisements were placed in the daily newspapers drawing attention to the amending directive. An explanatory note was made available to interested parties.</P>
    <P>I have since consulted the Attorney General about the desirability of supplementing the administrative arrangements by ministerial regulations under the European Communities Act and in the light of his advice I propose to make regulations in the matter.</P>

The increase in exports to these countries as a single market in 1973 showed an increase of more than 100 per cent over 1972.</P>

      <P>With the permission of the Ceann Comhairle, I propose to take Questions Nos. 469 and 470 together.</P>
      <P>Guidance work, which includes careers and vocational guidance as well as guidance in relation to choice of course and further education, is a recognised activity of the school timetable, where the school employs a qualified guidance teacher.</P>
      <P>In schools of 250 pupils or more, a post of guidance teacher over and above the normal quota of teachers is allowed.</P>
      <P>I may add that some 300 secondary schools now employ qualified guidance teachers.  Of these, about 85 teachers entered this service at the beginning of the present school-year. A further 83 are at present following a course of training in guidance.</P>
