      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>With the permission of the Ceann Comhairle I should like to make a statement on a matter that Deputy Haughey raised on Friday regarding the nonavailability to Members of copies of the statement issued by the Central Bank on the morning of that date. No Minister has responsibility for the distribution of Central Bank statements. The matters covered in the Central Bank statement of Friday last&mdash;control of credit, changes in the liquidity ratios of the banks and changes in interest rates&mdash;fall within the normal functions of the Central Bank.  Announcements on these subjects have been issued frequently in the past in the same form of a Press statement and were not circulated to Members of the Oireachtas.</P>
      <P>I am advised by the Central Bank that statements and announcements are published in its Quarterly Bulletin or Annual Report and in this way a permanent record is available.  The Annual Report is presented to each House and copies are made available to Deputies and Senators.  I understand that the Quarterly Bulletin and the statistical supplement, which is published in months when the bulletin does not appear, are not similarly circulated.  They are sent to persons and organisations who have asked to receive them and it is open to any Member to have his name included on the mailing list.</P>
      <P>I hope that my statement will clarify the position and that it will be clear the nothing was denied to Deputies.  The document was issued by the Central Bank in the proper exercise of its functions, was in the form of a Press release and, as such, was issued only to the news media.</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I understand that the Opposition were anxious to get information on the business it is proposed to deal with before the Recess. It is proposed to complete before the Summer Recess the Anti-Discrimination (Pay) Bill, 1974; the Maintenance Orders Bill, 1974; the Adoption Bill, 1974; the Electricity (Supply) (Amendment) Bill, 1974; the Prosecution of Offences Bill, 1974; the Trade Union (Amalgamations) Bill, 1974; the Agriculture (Amendment) Bill, 1974; the Export Promotion (Amendment) Bill, 1974 and the Finance Bill, 1974.  In addition to these nine, all of which have been introduced and some of which have been circulated and discussed, it is hoped, if possible, to complete the following Bills which have not yet been introduced: the Industrial Credit (Amendment) Bill, 1974; the Protection of Young Persons (Employment) Bill, 1974, and the Shannon Free Airport Development Company Limited (Amendment) Bill, 1974. There are three other Bills at present on the Order Paper: the Local Government (Planning and Development) Bill, 1973; the Misuse of Drugs Bill, 1973; and the Control of Importation, Sale and Manufacture of Contraceptives Bill, 1974, and it is hoped to advance these three Bills and any other which may be introduced as far as time allows before the Recess.</P>

      <P>In paragraph (c), line 21, &ldquo;on each person&rdquo; deleted.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Section 3 (c) provides that two persons shall be regarded as employed on like work where the work performed by one is equal to that performed by the other in terms of the demands it makes on each person in relation to such matters as skill, physical or mental effort, responsibility and working conditions.  That section, as drafted, represents an attempt to put into legal effect the <Col N="1456" /> recommendation of the Commission on the Status of Women in relation to equal pay.</P>
    <P>That recommendation indicated that equal pay should apply in circumstances where it is established that the jobs performed by men and women are of equal value in that the demands, for instance, in relation to skill, physical effort, responsibility and working conditions made on the woman are equal to the demands made on the man in respect of the work each performs.  The amendment before us proposes the deletion of the words &ldquo;on each person&rdquo; in section 3 (c).  There is the possibility, as was pointed out in the Seanad&mdash; admittedly a remote possibility&mdash;that within the terms of this Bill, as drafted, the measurement of the work performed by the man and the woman could be related to the demands it makes on each person and, thus, could be related to a person's individual characteristics rather than to the content of the job.  It was our objective that the relativity should be based on the content of the job and it is in these circumstances that the amendment proposes the deletion of the words &ldquo;on each person&rdquo;.</P>

      <P>I move that the Dáil agree with the Seanad in amendment No. 3:</P>
      <P>In subsection (1) (d), line 32, &ldquo;and may recommend her reinstatement in her former position&rdquo; added.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Subsection (1) of section 10, as drafted, provides that the Labour Court can direct an employer to pay to a woman, dismissed because she has sought equal pay, compensation by way of arrears of remuneration.  I had considered the inclusion in the Bill of a provision which would make it compulsory to reinstate a woman <Col N="1457" /> so dismissed.  As I pointed out during the discussions on previous Stages of this Bill in the House, certain difficulties of a legal nature were mentioned against the inclusion of such a provision in the Bill.  I made the point that the Bill as drafted should discourage employers from dismissing a woman who sought equal pay. Heavy penalties were laid down.  An adequate inspection force is provided for in the Bill.  It would be almost impossible for employers to resort to sharp practice such as penalising a woman for looking for her rights under the Bill.</P>
    <P>I have already indicated that it is my intention to examine the entire question of reinstatement in the context of the Unfair Dismissals Bill which I have already undertaken to bring before the House as soon as possible.  I hope to have that Bill introduced later this year.  The amendment before us, while not adding to the powers of the court in the matters of dismissals, because there is no power given which would provide for reinstatement, may be of assistance in allaying any anxieties a woman might have before taking proceedings under this Bill for fear that the court might not be in a position to recommend her reinstatement.  It may also, in conjunction with the provisions of the Bill relating to dismissals, discourage employers from dismissing workers who have sought equal pay.</P>
    <P>Deputy Dowling moved an amendment on Committee Stage which would make provision for a Labour Court order redirecting reinstatement where a woman's claim for equal pay was judged to be well-founded.  We went over this ground and discussed the legal difficulties which prevented reinstatement.  There the matter rests at present.  This section will not give compulsory power to the court but it should help to allay anxieties.  When some Opposition Senators put forward this point in the Seanad I accepted it in the spirit in which it was offered.  It at least wrote the responsibility into the legislation in regard to reinstatement.</P>
    <P>I move acceptance of the amendment.</P>

      <P>This is one of the big defects in the Bill.  We feel that there is not adequate cover for the person making the equal pay claim who is dismissed because of that claim notwithstanding the fact that her job is still available within the concern.  She cannot be reinstated under present legislation.  If her job is not available adequate compensation should be paid to the individual.  Where her job is still available some means should be sought to ensure that a person would apply for equal pay.  The situation at the moment is that a person may not seek equal pay on the basis that she may be dismissed and that she could not be reinstated in her former position. As already pointed out, there is a possibility, particularly in remote areas, where jobs are not available for female labour in the same volume as they are in the cities, that people would think twice before making an equal pay claim.</P>
      <P>The Minister has indicated that he is preparing new legislation which will cover this aspect.  Why was this not fully covered in this Bill?  Claims for equal pay will be made under the present Bill.  It is important that all aspects should be properly covered. We fear that some employers may avail of the opportunity of dismissing a person on the basis of an equal pay claim while at the same time the desire to end that person's employment may have been there for some considerable time on some other basis.  Because the situation arises following an equal pay claim there is no safeguard for the individual who makes the claim.  She might be unjustly treated.  We are leaving it open to employers to dismiss people who have no means of rectifying the situation other than to obtain the amount to which they would be duly entitled under the Bill, when it becomes an Act, for the period for which they claimed equal pay.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That is a grave defect.  It will discourage many people from seeking equal pay.  It gives too much power to the employers in regard to the dismissal of persons.  They would be free to ensure that a woman so dismissed cannot be reinstated.  The employer <Col N="1459" /> would have to meet his responsibility only in relation to the very small degree of cover that is in the Bill.  A fine is no guarantee.  We do not know whether the maximum fine would be imposed on the employer.  Any fine, even if it was the maximum fine, would mean that an employer might be glad to dismiss a person and pay a small amount.  Other factors may be involved.  There may be a question of redundancy.  It may be a cheap way of dispensing with labour.</P>

      <P>I hesitate to interrupt the Deputy but he is clearly straying far from the Seanad amendment under discussion.

      <P>The words &ldquo;and may&rdquo; are not just good enough. Something more definite should be inserted in the Bill.  If a person has a valid claim she is entitled to reinstatement. The position should not be that somebody &ldquo;may&rdquo; reinstate her.  If an employer wants to dispense with the services of a person there is no way of ensuring that that person can be re-employed.  Under this Bill there is no cover for the person concerned. This is a grave defect.</P>

It is a sorry state of affairs if a watered down amendment like this is accepted.  The people who are dismissed will get very little consolation. While this amendment gives a ray of hope, it is still not positive enough. The Minister promised to introduce legislation but he did not mention if it would be debated before the House rises.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Moore</NameTxt>
      <P>I appreciate that the Minister may have some difficulties with regard to this amendment which, in my view, is the kernel of the Bill.  It can be said that a chain is as strong as its weakest link.  Any Bill is as strong as its weakest subsection. <Col N="1461" /> This amendment states that &ldquo;the Court may recommend&rdquo;&mdash;in other words, it may or may not recommend depending on the mood of the Court.</P>
      <P>Suppose a woman claims equal pay and is dismissed.  Her case will be widely publicised as a warning by employers' organisations.  The court may recommend her reinstatement to her former position but they might do the other thing.  My point is this: having encouraged her to seek equal pay and having set up the machinery to deal with its application, the State cannot guarantee that the woman because she exercised her democratic right will not be worse off than she was before this legislation was introduced. The Minister promised new legislation.</P>
      <P>If it were possible to safeguard the woman's position, why was it not done under this Bill?  I understand from outside sources that there are constitutional difficulties in forcing an employer to employ any person.  If that is so, I cannot see the Minister being able to alter future legislation.  Would it be possible to amend this section further and say that &ldquo;and the court will recommend her reinstatement to her former position&rdquo;?  To change the word &ldquo;may&rdquo; to &ldquo;will&rdquo; would make the section stronger.  If the court says &ldquo;No, we will not do this&rdquo; they are entitled to do that under this Bill. We should say that &ldquo;the court will recommened&rdquo; or &ldquo;the court must recommend&rdquo;.  As it stands, section 10 may render this Bill useless because women will not use it for fear of losing their employment.  If this is so, it would be far better if this Bill were not introduced.  It has raised hopes. Its title &ldquo;Anti-Discrimination Bill&rdquo;&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I feel very strongly about this section.  As I pointed out before, there is a danger of discrimination in this Bill which may prevent people from applying for their rights. As Deputy Dowling said, this section is not strong enough.  Let us take the case of a woman who has a very nice job in the country and does not want to lose it.  She will be afraid to apply for her rights, because of the way this section is worded.  The words &ldquo;the court will recommend&rdquo; should be inserted. This is the only way to ensure that there will not be more discrimination than there was before the Bill was introduced.  This Bill stands or falls on this amendment.  The Minister is setting out to abolish discrimination and bring in equal pay.  This section is more important for the people in rural Ireland, where jobs are not plentiful, than for those living in the cities.  If a woman is in a secure job and knows that alternative employment is hard to come by, she would be very wary of claiming equal pay when she read this section with the words &ldquo;and may&rdquo; instead of &ldquo;and will&rdquo;.  Is there any hope of the Minister changing those words?</P>

      <P>Just for the record, the whole point of the Bill is that there are heavy penalties against an employer who would seek to ignore his obligations under the Act.  These are not light penalties.  There is a fine of £100 on summary conviction and £1,000 on endictment in respect of each worker who may have been dismissed. These are very heavy penalties and their effect will be such that there will be very few attempts by employers to ignore their obligations under the Act.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have been over this before, but for the record Deputy Dowling's Committee Stage amendment provided for compulsory reinstatement.  On the Report Stage he dropped that element of compulsory reinstatement because he recognised the constitutional difficulties.  It is not open to any Deputy to introduce an amendment which would have a compulsory element. <Col N="1463" /> I have told Deputies that I will have this whole area re-examined in the unfair dismissals legislation.  I hope that at that stage we will be able to advance this, but there are these difficulties in framing legislation.  They will still exist when I am framing the unfair dismissals legislation, but we can give it a more through examination and see whether any advance can be made in regard to these constitutional issues.</P>
    <P>This legislation which we are now discussing will not come into effect until December, 1975, and I have undertaken that the unfair dismissals legislation will have been in operation long before that time&mdash;it is hoped, at the earliest possible date.  I bring these facts to the notice of the House for the sake of the record and I ask that these amendments be accepted.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 1.</P>
      <P>In page 4, lines 54 to 56, to delete all words after &ldquo;commencement of this Act&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>The purpose of deleting the words here is to allow, where it is feasible to do so, arrears that were due to deserted wives and unmarried mothers in this country to be paid to them.  We are aware that many of these orders are in existence but in the bulk of cases the orders do not exceed £4 a week because it was only towards the end of 1971 that the limit of £4 a week was removed from maintenance orders and the limit of £1 a week was removed from affiliation orders.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think it is clear from the Committee Stage discussion and indeed the Second Stage discussion that although this Bill will in theory enable defaulting husbands and putative fathers to be caught up with, nevertheless the truth of the matter, which I think is recognised by all sides, including the Minister, is that in a very great number of cases, notwithstanding the possibility of enforcing the orders, it will not in practice be possible to do it because most of the wives will not be able to trace <Col N="1466" /> their husbands.  Therefore the fact that this machinery will be available to them will not effect any great benefit to a great many of them. However quite a number of wives and unmarried mothers will be able to trace the absconding husbands or putative fathers.  Because some of these desertions took place years ago, and because the orders which were made were just laughed at by the husbands, there are substantial sums which are due both morally and legally to these women.  I think it is quite wrong, if this stage is supposed to set out to solve a social problem which arises through inadequate legal machinery, that the inadequate legal machinery should be allowed to continue in respect of the enforcement orders which were made before it came into effect.  I know that it will enforce orders made before it came into effect in so far as the amounts due on them accrue after it comes into operation.  However it is very unfair that amounts which have accrued over the last few years should be uncollectable even though the means is now there to collect them, which it was not before.</P>
    <P>The Minister made the point the last day that there was consultation with British officials who were concerned with this and that they wanted the question of arrears left out.  I suggested to the Minister &mdash; I think last Thursday when we discussed this last &mdash; that the British should be approached again and it should be pointed out to them that the great majority of wives would not be able to collect anyway and the problem that would arise in regard to arrears could not be that great, because if a wife is trying to collect arrears she must also of necessity be trying to collect what is currently accruing to her.  Therefore from the administrative point of view the collection of arrears would not significantly increase the amount of work involved.</P>
    <P>The Minister, the last day when he was replying to me on this point, said that to allow arrears to be collected would be in some sense retrospective legislation, that the husband would be, as it were, held liable for something <Col N="1467" /> for which he was not heretofore liable.  That of course is not a correct statement of the position at all.  He was always liable, both legally and morally, for payments for the support of his wife.  The problem was not that he was not liable or not that he was not found liable by the court but that, having been found liable and an order having been made against him, it proved impossible in practice to collect the money or to enforce the order of the court.</P>
    <P>This amendment would enable at least some proportion, even though it might be only a small proportion, of all these vast sums that are due to deserted wives in this country by their husbands to be collected, and it would be very unfair not to allow it to be collected.  I cannot see any reason, even administrative, why that should not be so, because, as I stated, there would be no additional work burden from the administrative point of view.  There would be no additional cases created that the administrative machinery in Britain would have to cope with.  They would be the same cases; it just means that in certain of them there would be an effort to collect more from the absconding or defaulting husband than if it was sought to collect current amounts.</P>
    <P>I would urge this amendment very strongly on the Minister.  It is only reasonable in all equity and in all justice that these women who were deprived for so long should now have the opportunity of collecting what unquestionably is both legally and morally due to them.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMarkCooney" hpid="Minister for Justice (Mr. Cooney) Patrick M. Cooney">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice (Mr. Cooney)</NameTxt>
      <P>We all must sympathise with Deputy O'Malley's motives in moving this amendment.  Indeed, I expressed my sympathy with those motives the last day.  However, we cannot allow that aspect of it to blind ourselves to the practical difficulties which would result if the right to recover arrears were to be provided for in this Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are a number of reasons why this section should remain as it is.  I cannot recall having said the last day that these husbands were not liable&mdash;<Col N="1468" /> I have not the record here&mdash;but I doubt if I said that, because clearly they are liable and always were liable.  The point is that they have escaped their liability and in that sense have avoided liability.  Of course the liability has been fixed once the court order has been made; nevertheless, the guilty party, the absconding husband, has escaped his liability by departing to another jurisdiction.</P>
    <P>What Deputy O'Malley now suggests is that people in that category should be liable to be pursued for all the arrears from the time of the original order because presumably, if there was a moral or a legal liability there, it should extend the whole way back, as that would be consistent with the nature of the liability.  There would then be no question of compromising on it; if it were to be enforced it would have to be enforced the whole way.</P>
    <P>What we propose in the Bill is that there should be no right at all given to claim arrears, for the reason that if such a right were to be given it would produce practical and administrative difficulties which might well undo any good that might come from it.  The Deputy mentioned that a lot of these cases would involve orders made before the weekly maximum was raised from £4.  That was prior to 1972.  The weekly maximum then was £4 a week, which would be £208 a year.  Four or five years at that rate would bring up the arrears to around £1,000.  If the Deputy's amendment were to be accepted, we would then have the situation that the absconding husband would be pursued by the courts in England or Ireland, depending upon which jurisdiction he was in. The courts would have to enforce against him arrears which could easily amount to several thousand pounds and would frequently be of the order of several hundred pounds.</P>
    <P>We must look at the realities of the situation.  What are the chances of getting that sort of money from that sort of person?  The Deputy will know from practical experience in the District Court that, even in undefended debt collection cases where the proceedings come to the stage of seeking <Col N="1469" /> an instalment order, the solicitor moving the order can ask for any size of weekly sum that he wants.  The reality is that he only asks for an amount that he knows the debtor can afford. That is usually for below what should be the proper amount having regard to the circumstances of the case in question.  Therefore the debtor's actual situation is invariably a constraining factor, and we have to recognise that hard fact in deciding whether or not to take power to allow the courts to enforce arrears.  In the great majority of these cases the financial circumstances of absconding husbands will not permit the enforcement of any substantial amount of arrears.  If orders for arrears are made, there is the distinct possibility that the final sanction of imprisonment will be applied.  In that event, the last position of the maintenance creditor, the deserted wife, would be worse than her first.</P>
    <P>I think the experience of enforcing weekly payments of this nature has shown it is more prudent to fix a weekly sum that is reasonable, having regard to the income of the debtor and his liabilities, in the knowledge that a reasonable sum will be paid week in and week out, thereby improving the position of the deserted wife, rather than to fix a sum which the circumstances would justify but which the debtor would be unable to pay regularly over a long period.</P>
    <P>For these reasons it would be impractical to enforce the payment of arrears accrued prior to the introduction of this legislation.  In fact, it could be counter-productive.  It would be quite likely to drive absconding husbands underground in the other jurisdiction. The success or failure of this Bill will depend on how successful wives will be in tracing their husbands. A husband might be prepared, if his financial position in England has improved or some qualm of conscience strikes him, to accept an Irish order being enforced against him in England, if it is for a reasonable weekly sum.  However, where the order sought to be enforced is for many hundreds or even a couple of <Col N="1470" /> thousand pounds of arrears, I could see him disappearing from his job, moving to another part of England with, probably, an assumed identify.</P>
    <P>The deserted wife would then be much worse off.  We should recognise the constraints and not try to impose an impossible load on the debtor, even though it might be morally justifiable. If the amount sought is reasonable having regard to his circumstances, it is more than likely that it will be paid willingly and no attempt made to evade it.</P>
    <P>I think this is a compelling argument, in itself, for not accepting the Deputy's amendment and for having the section, as at present drafted, stand; that is, that accured arrears be excluded.  There is the fact also that the relevant Hague Convention on the enforcement of maintenance obligations provides, in matters of this nature, that the commencement date of the Convention would be the date on which to draw the line as regards arrears.  Such Conventions establish standards of international obligations and I think our domestic legislation should take note of them.</P>
    <P>Again, there is a precedent in our domestic legislation for the stand we are taking here.  It is not an exact precedent because it does permit arrears but only within a limit of six months. Under section 8 of the Enforcement of Court Orders Act, 1940, which relates to the enforcement of maintenance orders, arrears cannot be recovered for more than six months prior to the application for enforcement. This is a previous recognition by the Oireachtas that it would be impractical, or unrealistic, to attempt to enforce large sums of arrears.  I think the realistic thing to do is to seek to enforce a current order at a reasonable level.</P>
    <P>Having regard to the international precedent I have just quoted and the fact that there is recognition of the situation already in our domestic law, I feel this is the most prudent course to take.  There is one further reason and it is this: henceforward there will be, if you like, two classes of deserted wives; there will be those who had <Col N="1471" /> obtained orders before their husbands absconded and those who can only move now to obtain orders on foot of the powers contained in this Bill where the husband is outside the jurisdiction.  In the first case, there would be the question of arrears could not arise as it is not the practice to make maintenance orders retrospective.  I think it better that this very novel legislation in our country, relating to the enforcement of our orders in another jurisdiction, should become effective from a current date and should not seek to introduce any element of retrospection. Undoubtedly there would be such an element in it if it were sought to include in the enforcement procedure arrears which had accrued from the date on which the original order was made.</P>
    <P>While I sympathise with the Deputy's motives in moving the amendment and appreciate the humanity which motivates it, I feel for the reasons I have given, that, on balance, we would be doing a disservice to deserted wives were we to accept the amendment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>I was disappointed to hear what the Minister had to say. So far as what was said the last day with regard to liability or otherwise, I think the best thing I can do, with your permission, is to quote from Volume 273, No. 9 of Thursday, 20th June, 1974, of the Official Report, at columns 1288 and 1289, where the Minister said:</P>
      <P>A person, even an absconding husband, is entitled to know what the law is at any particular time and to know that with certainty.  If enforcement of arrears were to be allowed it might be possible that a person would be unable to pay them and could find himself imprisoned having assumed that there was no liability on him to pay the arrears.  He might suddenly find himself years afterwards with such a liability.  That would be unjust and possibly in breach of the Constitution.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1472" /> I think the best reply I can make to that now is quote what I said myself on that occasion, at columns 1289 and 1290 which was:</P>
    <P>The Minister, if I paraphrase correctly what he has said, feels that it would be unfair, even to as unworthy a person as an absconding husband, to make him liable for arrears that would impose on him a liability for something which he did not previously have.  I suggest that that is not correct.  He was always liable to support his wife.  He was morally liable and he was legally liable for as long as a maintenance order was in existence against him. The problem that arose was that the wife could not enforce the order because the husband had absconded out of the jurisdiction.  That did not remove his moral or legal liability. He cannot therefore complain if this section were changed to enable his wife to recover what is both morally and legally due.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMarkCooney" hpid="Mr. Cooney Mr. Cooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cooney</NameTxt>
      <P>So long as he was within this jurisdiction.  Once he was in another jurisdiction, he had no liability to pay what was adjudged against him here, because it could not be enforced.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>It may have been non-enforceable but nonetheless he was liable for it.  In the same way, if I get an ordinary civil judgment for a debt or for damages against an individual who before he satisfies it goes to another jurisdiction and I find it very difficult to enforce my judgment against him there, nonetheless he continues liable to me.  If he has any property here I would seek then to get a judgment mortgage against that property or, if possible, try to re-seal the judgment of the other jurisdiction against him and let the proper authorities there collect the judgment. There is no question that simply by going out of the jurisdiction one evades or avoids liability; one retains one's liability.  It is a question of the plaintiff's&mdash;the wife in this case&mdash; inability to enforce the judgment in respect of which the husband has liability.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister may have implied <Col N="1473" /> that by seeking this amendment I would leave it wide open, as it were, for people to go back umpteen years. But I should imagine there could be no question of that, that the statute of limitations would apply in any event and at the very most the arrears that would be recoverable would be six years arrears which, assuming a maximum payment of £208 per annum, would amount to something in the region of £1,200 altogether.  However I am not even arguing that the period need necessarily be as long as the statute of limitations would allow.</P>
    <P>I would be perfectly happy were the Minister to agree to this amendment, to add some words that would confine the ability, or the right, to recover arrears to, say, three years, which to me would seem perfectly reasonable and fair.  I am convinced it is quite futile to produce and pass legislation of this kind if we are going to condemn, as it were, all the orders which the courts here have made heretofore against people who have absconded. If this is allowed to go through as proposed you will have the ludicrous situation that, provided an absconding husband or putative father remains in England or outside the jurisdiction nothing can be done about the arrears due by him but if he comes home he immediately becomes liable for them. This is where I think the Minister's argument has fallen down because on the previous occasion he frequently used the word &ldquo;liability&rdquo;.  I am sure he agrees it is not the best word to use and that a better way of expressing it might be &ldquo;liability to enforceability&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>If the section is allowed to stand unamended nothing can be done about him provided he stays out of the jurisdiction but if he comes home to Ireland&mdash;which is surely what we should encourage people in even this sort of situation to do&mdash;and faces up to his responsibility he immediately becomes liable to six years' arrears. By refusing the amendment the Minister is doing the very thing that he said my amendment would cause to happen.  He is, as it were, forcing the husbands to go underground, to stay abroad, out of circulation by virtue of giving them immunity against what <Col N="1474" /> they owe provided they stay abroad, but leaving them open to the collection of arrears for presumably six years if they come home.</P>
    <P>Neither the Minister nor anybody can argue that if they come home and become amenable to the collection processes of the courts here, they are liable for all the arrears due by them, with, perhaps, the limit of six years in certain instances, and, if possible these arrears would be collected from them. The Minister's argument that this amendment would drive them underground can be used with much greater force against his own position because while he may not be driving them underground in the sense that I think he meant when he said that, he is doing something else which is precisely the same; he is keeping them abroad by relieving them of liability for collection or payment while they remain abroad but making it clear to them that if they come home they immediately become liable for all such arrears as can be collected from them.</P>
    <P>This amendment has justice in it and the Minister should recognise that.  He is not doing justice to wives who have got orders and are due money if he prevents them collecting what is due to them.  In particular, he is not doing justice to wives and families of men who have gone abroad but who might come back if they did not find themselves in the position that while they remain in England they owe nothing but become responsible for all arrears when they come home.  There are a great many cases where husbands never come back; they are probably never heard of again.  It is believed that a number of them marry again in England, legally or otherwise, but there are cases&mdash;and we all know of such cases&mdash;where, happily, after one or two years or sometimes as much as five or eight years husbands do come back and are reconciled with wives and families and things go well for all concerned afterwards.  Putting them in the position that by coming home they are liable for six years arrears but if they stay away they are not liable for anything will not help towards reconciliation.  It will not <Col N="1475" /> help to get husbands to face up to their responsibilities and come home to resume living with and supporting their wives and families.  For that reason I urge this amendment on the House and particularly on the Minister. I think it is reasonable and should be accepted by the House.</P>

    <P>
      <Col N="1478" /> In page 11, line 5, to delete &ldquo;unless&rdquo; and to substitute &ldquo;if&rdquo;; and in lines 5 and 6 to delete &ldquo;to the contrary&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>This relates to section 22, which proposes to allow in evidence a long list of documents and other matters which would not normally be admissible in evidence.  The list is very lengthy.  It is one and a half pages of various situations, documents and so on that might be admitted.  The entire list is prefaced by the phrase in subsection (1):</P>
    <P>In any proceedings under this Act or proceedings to which section 17 (1) relates, unless the court sees good reason to the contrary</P>
    <P>then it goes on to list in (a), (b), (c) and (d)&mdash;all the various things that can be done.  The purpose of my amendment is to change the emphasis there, that these sort of things should not be allowed unless the court sees good reason to the contrary.  In other words, unless the court rules them out, they will be admissible.  The emphasis should be the other way round, that if the court sees good reason for letting them in, then let them in.  The effect of the amendment is to delete the word &ldquo;unless&rdquo; and to substitute &ldquo;if&rdquo; and to delete the words &ldquo;to the contrary&rdquo;.  The beginning then of subsection (1) would read: &ldquo;In any proceedings under this Act or proceedings to which section 17 (1) relates, if the court sees good reason (a), (b), (c) and (d) can happen.&rdquo; I do not think we should allow these things in default of the court stopping them.  The court should be given the cretion in the particular circumstances of the enforcement of reciprocal orders.  The court should be given the option of allowing this to be done, but the position should not be that it will happen anyway unless the court stops it.  It will not have any great material effect but it will at least put the emphasis, I suggest, the right way around rather than as it is at the moment.  It is wrong that some of these things should be admitted in evidence automatically unless the court stops them.  The court should be given the power to admit them if it sees fit.  That would <Col N="1479" /> be the effect of my amendment which I ask the Minister to accept.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMarkCooney" hpid="Mr. Cooney Mr. Cooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cooney</NameTxt>
      <P>As the Deputy said, his amendment is merely a change of emphasis.  The principle of the admissibility of these documents is retained in this section in ease of the parties in these reciprocal maintenance proceedings. I do not think a change of emphasis is desirable in the context of this section.  I sympathise with the Deputy's desire to try to tighten up the section by changing the emphasis but I submit to him that the position is already sufficiently tight by reason of the other safeguards in the section.</P>
      <P>The other safeguards are that a statement in a document can only be admitted as evidence to the same extent as oral evidence of the fact in question by the maker of the statement would be admissible in those proceedings.  That is actually written into the section.  In paragraph (c) of subsection (1), for example, it provides that statements may be admitted as evidence to the same extent as oral evidence of that fact by the maker of the statement.</P>
      <P>Again, most of the documents it is proposed to admit are documents coming from courts of reciprocating jurisdictions and the change of emphasis would have the effect of rendering these documents suspect, so to speak, <i>ab initio</i> rather than the other way round, namely, that the documents are valid and good on their face coming from these jurisdictions and should be automatically admitted unless the court sees good reason to the contrary.</P>
      <P>The emphasis in the Deputy's amendment is that the court should have to see good reason in every case before admitting documents coming from courts of reciprocating jurisdictions. I believe that would be a wrong emphasis having regard to what is intended by the section.  There is adequate protection given by the proviso contained at the end of these various categories of documents and for these reasons it would, I think, be impolitic to change the emphasis in the way sought by the amendment.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>The next amendment relates to only a very small part of (1) (e) but, taking the whole of (e), there are seven subheadings dealing with types of documents and only one of those seven is a document of the kind the Minister mentioned&mdash;that is the document referred to at (v).  This is some form of court document.  The other six are not and some of them are positively dangerous, apart from the one I propose in the next amendment to have deleted, and I am glad to hear that the Minister will accept it.  Things like a statement or certificate of earnings could be positively suspect coming from another jurisdiction. A medical certificate could be suspect coming from another jurisdiction. Indeed, many of our courts here refuse as a matter of principle to accept any form of medical certificate and I believe they are perfectly right in that because there have been instances in which medical certificates were produced which did not stand up on closer examination.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMarkCooney" hpid="Mr. Cooney Mr. Cooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cooney</NameTxt>
      <P>That is a fairly sweeping statement.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>I said there have been instances and some courts are now refusing to accept such certificates and I think they are justified in refusing.  They insist that if a litigant wants to prove some medical fact the doctor concerned will have to come in and swear and hold himself out for cross examination as to the medical condition of the person concerned. The attitude taken up in recent years by some courts in relation to that kind of situation is the right attitude. That attitude is taken up in regard to medical certificates within our own jurisdiction and it is hardly credible that the courts would readily admit in evidence certificates from another jurisdiction.  I believe this is very dangerous because there would be no way of knowing the standing of the doctor who signs the certificate or of knowing if the person who signed it <Col N="1481" /> was, indeed, a doctor at all.  In most courts here there would be no way of readily checking whether such a person was on the medical register in Britain.</P>
      <P>Matters such as this could make the documents in question suspect and they should not be admitted in evidence unless the court sees good reason to admit them.  In an ordinary civil action there would, of course, be no question of a medical certificate or a statement of earnings being admitted in evidence unless both parties agreed to its being admitted.  There is no question here of both parties agreeing and any effort to offer what is called a certificate of earnings or a medical certificate by a party in a disputed civil action would be immediately ruled out as being inadmissible unless the other side consented. Clearly, the kind of proceedings in mind here do not envisage consent on the part of the defendant. Indeed, the very contrary would be the case.  It is envisaged that in practice the defendant will not be present in the vast majority of these cases.  He will be in England and his opportunity to say he does not agree to inadmissible evidence being given against him is in actual fact a very slight opportunity, indeed, and it is for that reason I think rather strongly that this section should not give the plaintiff the right to have these inadmissible things admitted in evidence.  The position should be that the court should in all circumstances have the power to admit if it sees good reason, to use the phrase used in the section, but only then should it have the power to admit.  As the section stands, it must admit such certificates unless it sees good reason to exclude them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMarkCooney" hpid="Mr. Cooney Mr. Cooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cooney</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>No. It is wrong that the court should have to find good reason to exclude something which is not admissible in evidence. We have developed a complicated system of evidence here similar to that in Britain.  It has reached the rather complicated state it is in now through the desire of the courts down through the centuries to ensure <Col N="1482" /> that what was given in evidence was fair to both parties and that one party could not take advantage, as it were, or another and could not introduce matters that could not be checked by the parties before the court in cross-examination.  If this provision is accepted as it stands we will have the situation that all these things will be admitted in evidence and the court will have no power to stop them being admitted unless it can give good reason for excluding them.  I can see why in certain circumstances some of these things should be admitted, but only on certain occasions.  It should not be the position that they will always be admissible unless the court can see good reason to rule them out.  It should be the other way round; they would not be admissible unless in particular circumstances the court saw good reason to let them in.  It is for that reason I say the Minister should accept this amendment.  It is not doing any damage to the applicant or anybody else and it is safeguarding those who will not in practice be present to safeguard their own rights.</P>

      <P>Just to clear up the matter, this is a good amendment and I am grateful to the Deputy for drawing our attention to a danger that could have arisen from the section as originally drafted.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>He goes to the kernel of this type of legislation when he says that this <Col N="1483" /> section is meant to deal with a particular and rather unusual situation. If the exact rules of evidence were not to be eased by this section a lot of the good of this Bill would be blunted.  If, for example, it was not possible for the maintenance debtor in the other jurisdiction to furnish a medical certificate to show that he was ill or capable of earning only so much per week, the court in the home jurisdiction would not be able to make a realistic order.  The only way in which it could make it would be for the medical practitioner to travel from the reciprocating jurisdiction to the domestic jurisdiction so that the court would be fully apprised of the earning capacity of the debtor.  If we were to get into that situation, while, strictly speaking, it would be correct under the law of evidence as it stands, it would undermine the effectiveness of the Bill.  I just wanted to make that point.</P>
    <P>Amendment agreed to.</P>
    <P>Question: &ldquo;That the Bill, as amended, be received for final consideration&rdquo;, put and agreed to.</P>
    <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill do now pass.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to refer briefly to a matter which I overlooked on Committee Stage, that is, the question of whether or not under this Bill orders made by the District Court or High Court, as the case may be, can be enforced not just by the ordinary process of execution by the sheriff distraining for goods and subsequent instalment orders and committal orders where the instalment orders are not complied with, or whether any power is now given to any of these courts to order execution by means other than that and, in particular, of course, by way of attachment of salary or wages.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>So far as I know, the powers of the District Court are confined simply to the ordinary execution order which goes to the sheriff and which, if it results in a <i>nulla bona</i>, as it normally does, starts off the procedure for examination and instalment and committal. <Col N="1484" /> The High Court has much wider powers of execution.  It has powers to do all sort of things which frequently are not done, including things one vaguely remembers out of text books like the appointment of a receiver by way of equitable execution&mdash;I do not even know what that is&mdash;and a couple of other slightly exotic methods of enforcement.</P>
    <P>Presumably because of its wider powers the court would have power, whether by way of appointment of a receiver or otherwise, over someone's salary to order that a certain amount of that salary could be paid in a particular week or month, as the case might be, to a wife applying in the circumstances.  It would be equivalent presumably, to an order of garnishee which the High Court could make in respect of a debt due to a dependent.</P>
    <P>The number of these cases that would actually go into the High Court would be small.  By far the highest proportion of them would be in the District Court.  I would ask the Minister between now and the time this Bill goes to the Seanad to examine the question of whether he might introduce a section which would give wider powers to the District Court which has very little power so far as enforcement is concerned at the moment.  If necessary it would give wider powers to the High Court if the High Court has not already sufficiently wide powers to collect sums due in the manner about which we have been talking.</P>
    <P>I am not quite clear what precisely the powers of the High Court would be in regard to this.  Presumably it would have some sort of residual power in any event to execute in any way it saw fit or thought just in the circumstances.  The Minister should avail of the opportunity between now and bringing the Bill to the Seanad to insert a section into the Bill which would allow, not just as between reciprocating jurisdictions but also in regard to cases within our own jurisdiction solely, the power to the District Court to make an order of the kind mentioned whereby so much could be obtained directly from a defendant's employer rather than <Col N="1485" /> through the rather laborious process of trying to get the sheriff to execute an order against the defendant.</P>
    <P>That is, perhaps, a defect in the Bill as it stands.  It has not improved-and I suppose it did not set out to improve -the internal enforcement of these orders.  Since this sort of enforcement is available in the reciprocating jurisdictions, that is, in England, Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland, it seems remiss of us so far as our international obligations are concerned that we are able to offer only a much more limited method of execution to British citizens who seek to avail of the reciprocating remedies which will be available to them when this Bill becomes law.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMarkCooney" hpid="Mr. Cooney Mr. Cooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cooney</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy's point is that if the High Court here has power of garnishee and power to appoint receivers and power to attach wages, we should examine this to see if this power could be used in the case of orders made presumably by a reciprocating court on the other side.  I will certainly consider that.  As the law stands, it would be difficult to use these powers in relation to maintenance payments.  As the Deputy said, these are terms from text books read in the distant past, but I think the order of garnishee can only be made in respect of a particular sum accruing to the debtor and would not be suitable for periodical payments under maintenance orders.</P>
      <P>I am not sure that I agree with the Deputy that the High Court has power to attach wages in the case of maintenance orders or other orders of that type made by it.  I do not think that power is there, but I will certainly look into it.  I take the Deputy's point that the effectiveness of this legislation depends on locating the absconding husband for the purposes of the proceedings and, in addition, on attaching his wages.  The District Court has not that power at present.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As I indicated earlier, the last report from the Committee on Court Practice and Procedure recommended that such power should be given to the District Court.  I have indicated <Col N="1486" /> that in principle I accept that recommendation and that the consequential legislation will be produced as a matter of urgency.  I am hopeful that we will have it next session.  Our position will then be on all fours with the position in the reciprocating jurisdictions and we will be able to give as good a service here in regard to absconding debtors as they can give to us.  Between now and the introduction of the Bill in the Seanad I will examine the other point raised by the Deputy as to whether there are any inherent powers of enforcement in the High Court which could usefully be incorporated in this Bill.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 1.</P>
      <P>In page 2, line 25, after &ldquo;consent&rdquo; to insert the following:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;, provided always that notwithstanding such knowledge or consent an adoption order shall not be made <Col N="1487" /> unless the religion of the child is the same as the religion of the applicant or of one of the applicants.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The effect of this amendment would be to add to section 3, the section now dealing with religion and which was amended the last day in this Bill, the proviso that, notwithstanding the fact that the natural mother is aware of the religion or religions of the prospective adoptive parents in the case where both of their religions are not the same as that of the child, the board should not make an order unless the child's religion is the same as that of one or other, or both, of the prospective adopters.  I refer in the amendment to &ldquo;the religion of the applicant or one of the applicants&rdquo; because it is possible for one person to adopt a child.  It is not very usual but it does happen every year, usually the person concerned is a widow.  The widow who applies is not infrequently granted adoption orders but the most common case is that of a married couple.  The particular problem that this section 3, by repealing the two sections in the 1952 and 1964 Acts that dealt with religion, seeks to meet is the question of adoption by a couple who are in what is described as a mixed marriage.</P>
    <P>In November, 1972, I announced in the Seanad, and I quoted from the speech the last day and gave the reference, that I proposed to make an amendment to the adoption code in which in effect adoption by a couple in a mixed marriage would be allowed with the proviso that the religion of the child would have to be the same as the religion of one of the parties to that marriage who were proposing to adopt that child.  There was no objection whatever taken by anybody to that proposal which I think was a reasonable and fair one.  I think that as well as being reasonable and fair it is also necessary because we can have a situation where we are dealing with an unmarried mother who is just about to or has given birth to a child and is in a position of great emotional upset.  There is no question but that her judgment can frequently in those circumstances be impaired.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1488" /> Childbirth is a pretty traumatic experience for most women, even women who are perfectly happily and legally married.  The fact that it can be traumatic, even for married women, and can cause an impairment of their judgment has been recognised in our law as far back as 100 years.  It was recognised in the 1870s that a mother who kills her own child within 12 months of giving birth to that child shall not be guilty of murder, no matter what the circumstances, nor guilty of manslaughter but shall be guilty of a comparatively minor statutory crime known as infanticide for which the maximum penalty is very small by comparison with the potential penalties for manslaughter and for murder.</P>
    <P>Medical and psychiatric science were not very advanced in the 1870s. There is no question but that it is only in the last ten or 20 years that major advances came about in those particular fields but notwithstanding the comparative lack of knowledge 100 years ago about these matters the Legislature of the day saw fit to create this special comparatively minor statutory crime because it recognised that women were mentally disturbed and their judgment became unbalanced as a result of childbirth.  If that recognition is there in respect of even married women for as long as 12 months after the birth of a child, then surely we in the 1970s should recognise the possibility that in the case of an unmarried mother either shortly before or after the birth of her child there is a definite danger of impairment of her judgment. The trauma and the medical effects, the physical and psychological effects of the birth of a child to an unmarried mother, particularly if she is very young as most of these girls unfortunately are, often as young as 16 years, can be very great, much greater than the trauma or psychological effects which might lead a married woman to kill her own child within 12 months of the birth of that child.</P>
    <P>It is wrong that we should give the opportunity to a very young girl who may be only 15 or 16 years of age the opportunity to consent to her child <Col N="1489" /> being adopted by people who are not of her or her child's religion and to consent, therefore, to her child being brought up in another religion.  Even though she is aware of this fact I do not think she should be given that opportunity at that particular time and in the particular circumstances in which she finds herself.  We are being quite illogical in trying to give a frightened little girl of 15 or 16 the right to make this major decision a few days before or after the birth of her child and at the same time we will not as a Legislature give a mature man or woman of 20 years and ten months of age the right even to make the simplest contract in this country. There are people with university degrees and a high degree of personal and psychological maturity just under 21 years of age who cannot make a simple contract to buy unless it is for necessaries.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMarkCooney" hpid="Mr. Cooney Mr. Cooney">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>It can normally be argued that to buy shares or to buy property of any kind is not a necessary as long as the person has somewhere to live.  A man or a woman coming towards the end of their 21st year could be well off, very well educated, a university graduate and be mature, emotionally and psychologically, but we as a Legislature do not recognise their right to make a contract unless it is for necessaries.  At the same time we are allowing a frightened little girl of 15 or 16 years of age who may be in some home far from her own people, possibly without even the knowledge of her own family that she has had a child, to make a decision when clearly she is not in a position to do so.  She should not be put in the position of being able to agree to her child's religion being changed, a decision which, frequently, is made a day or two before or after the birth of the child.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister has said that in practice this problem will arise only rarely because a high proportion of the placements made are arranged by adoption societies and that most, if not all, of the adoption societies have a particular religious link.  There is one <Col N="1490" /> Protestant adoption society and there are about 20 which have links of one kind or another with the Roman Catholic Church.  However, we, as a Legislature should not allow this problem to arise.  We are under this obligation now particularly because in this Bill we are proposing to repeal section 12 of the 1952 Act and that section of the 1954 Act which deals with the question of religion; we are repealing the provision whereby a change of religion on the part of a mother would not be recognised for 12 months after that change had been made.  That provision was advisedly put into the 1952 Act.  It was put into the Act for a very good reason.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMarkCooney" hpid="Mr. Cooney Mr. Cooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cooney</NameTxt>
      <P>What was the reason?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>It was for the purpose of preventing or stopping proselytising. When I made the first rough draft of what is now this Bill, I recall having discussions with various people whose knowledge of adoption, from a practical point of view, was considered to be greater than mine and most of these people told me that they could see no objection to the repeal of the legislation I am talking of&mdash; this question of a bar on the recognition of a change of religion by a mother for 12 months after the change had been made.  This was, they said, because proselytising no longer existed to any significant extent.  Apparently it did exist up to and shortly after the war and was an issue of some kind, at least, in 1952 when the first of these Bills was debated here.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>While a number of people agreed in 1972 and 1973 that proselytising no longer existed they told me they were conscious of the fact that if the provision against it in the 1952 Act were repealed there was at least a danger that it might reappear in one form or another.  On balance it is right to repeal those particular provisions but it is not right that, having repealed them, we would allow a wide open situation in which that sort of thing could occur here again and that is what is liable to occur because it is out of these kinds of situations that arose practices which were known in <Col N="1491" /> this country up to 20 years or so ago. It is out of these kinds of situations that such things could arise again in the future and I want to avoid that by legislation against it here.  It can be a simple matter to prevent it happening but there is a particular duty on us, when we are proposing in this Bill to repeal the anti-proselytising provision of the 1952 Act, to ensure that we do not make it easy for people who might so wish to go back to that field of activity.</P>
    <P>All I am asking is that this section be enacted on the lines I discussed in the Seanad in November, 1972, and which won general acceptance at that time from all those who were concerned with adoption and particularly those groups who were pressing for a change in the legislation which would allow couples of mixed marriages to adopt children.  I do not think any couple in a mixed marriage would disagree with a requirement that the child should be of the same religion as one or other of them.  Probably most couples would not wish to adopt a child that was not of the same religion as either of the parties in a marriage.  It is often said that mixed marriages, particularly in the context of children, can give rise to strains and tensions which might not exist in a marriage where both parties were of the same religion but there would be very strange strains and tensions if, in a mixed marriage, a child was of a religion other than that of either of the parties.  What I am proposing would not act unfairly against any child.  Neither would it act unfairly against any natural mother and, assuredly, it would not act unfairly against any prospective adoptive parents.  In particular, it would not interfere with the right of the natural mother to place her child where she wills.  I do not know whether, at the moment, she has the right to place her child where she wills.  She has a right to have her child adopted but she is not told by whom it is adopted. Neither will she have that information so far as this section is concerned but she is being given the opportunity to consent to her child being adopted by <Col N="1492" /> a couple neither of whom is of the same religion as the child.</P>
    <P>In many cases, the mother, if she acts normally and rationally, will say that she will not agree to her child being placed with a particular couple because of this factor but I have described&mdash;I think not inaccurately&mdash;the situation that faces many of these very young mothers at the time of the birth and the psychological effect that the birth or the imminence of the birth has on them and the fact that, unquestionably, their judgement must be impaired.  If, 100 years ago, Parliament could recognise that even a married woman can have her judgment impaired by childbirth for as long as 12 months after the birth, surely we here in 1974 should be able to recognise that an unmarried mother, perhaps of a very young age and in unfamiliar surroundings, is liable to have her judgment impaired. Therefore, we should not give her the opportunity, which is what we are doing in this Bill as it stands, of doing something which on rational and calm reflection, she almost certainly would not have wished to do.  It would not be the position of a natural mother in this country regardless of what might be her religion to agree readily to her child being adopted into or brought up in another religion.</P>
    <P>It is being unnecessarily liberal to seek to give a mother that opportunity now.  She does not need it. It is not a question that she is not going to be able to get her child adopted if she does not give it to a particular couple of a particular religion. There is an enormous waiting list of prospective adoptors of all religions in this country.  The shortage is of suitable children for adoption. There would be no question, particularly as she will not know who the prospective adoptors are, of the mother feeling that if she did not let the child go to that particular couple, it would not get adopted at all.</P>
    <P>I am sure every mother is told by the authorities who consult with her about it that there is no difficulty whatever in having a child adopted. The problem is the opposite.  The various societies are inundated with <Col N="1493" /> applications from people who wish to adopt.  They far exceed the number of children likely to become available for adoption in any one year.</P>
    <P>I would urge on the House and on the Minister to accept this amendment which seeks to do one thing only, namely, to protect the right of the child to be brought up in the religion in which it was born, and which seeks not to give the opportunity to perhaps a very young and frightened girl to agree to her child being brought up in some other religion. I cannot see that there is any onus on anybody in asking that the House would accept that very reasonable proposal which I feel sure would meet with the agreement of anybody who examines the position anyway objectively.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMarkCooney" hpid="Mr. Cooney Mr. Cooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cooney</NameTxt>
      <P>To consider the Deputy's amendment it is necessary to recall what the present position is in the adoption code with regard to religion.  Prior to the recent High Court decision the adoption code provided that all the parties to the adoption had to be of the same religion &mdash;the adoptive parents, the natural mother and her child.  They all had to be of the same religion or in the case of orphans the child had to be a child of parents of the same religion.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This meant that persons of mixed marriages &mdash; we all know what that term means &mdash; were precluded from adopting.  That was one provision. The other decision was that adverted to by the Deputy.  If the mother changed her religion 12 months before or after the birth the adoption could not take place for a further 12 months from the date of birth or the date of the change, as the case may be.  As the Deputy says, this was introduced in 1952 as an anti-proselytising measure.  It is my opinion that an Act of Parliament is not the vehicle to provide for such measures.  It seems to me that to endeavour to introduce the subject of proselytism in an Act of Parliament is inconsistent with the move towards ecumenism which is gaining pace all the time.  It is a subject which I am anxious to avoid. It is not a matter for a statute.  A <Col N="1494" /> statute should not be a vehicle for taking into account the question of proselytism which in this country has tended to go in one direction.</P>
    <P>That was the position until the recent High Court decision which found that the provision of the 1952 Adoption Act which provided that applicants should be of the same religion as the child and its parents, or the child and its mother if the child was illegitimate, was unconstitutional. As a result of that finding and the Government's acceptance of it, we are now seeking to repeal it.  It was our opinion that section 12 (2) of the 1952 Act should be changed.</P>
    <P>The Deputy opposite agreed with that opinion because he indicated when he was Minister that he would change it.  The Government accepted the High Court decision.  As a consequence of that acceptance they felt that the religious provisions in the adoption code would have to fall. None of them is being repeated in this Bill; they are being repealed.  The so-called anti-proselytism measure also falls.  What Deputy O'Malley is now urging on us in this amendment is to re-enact something which I think should not be in a statute and which has been frowned upon by the courts.</P>
    <P>It was felt that in the amending legislation now before the House where the adopting parties differ in religion, or where one of them differs in religion from the mother or her child, this fact should be brought to the attention of the mother.  It was with some hesitation that I decided to insert that provision in the Bill.  I did so feeling that this was a fact of such importance that it should be brought to the attention of the natural mother.  She should be told that the couple with whom her child was being placed were of different religions to that of the child and herself. I felt it should be introduced into this Bill for the reason that if it was not there and the change in the law consequent on the High Court decision took place a mother would no longer have the assurance that the child was being placed with a couple of the same religion as herself and her child. This might inhibit placements or in <Col N="1495" /> cases where placements took place it might lead subsequently to scruples as to whether the mother was right in placing her child for adoption without any knowledge of the religious beliefs of the adoptive parents. It was for these practical reasons I decided to introduce the provision that where the religion was not the same as that of the mother she should be informed of this fact.</P>
    <P>Deputy O'Malley wants to go further and extend that provision by stating as he sets out in his amendment that notwithstanding the fact that the mother knows of the different religions the order should not be made unless the religion of the child is the same as the religion of at least one of the applicants.  I am not disposed to accept that amendment for the reasons which I gave the last day and which I have considered since then.  I think they are good and valid reasons. All that the Legislature can do in a statute like this is to attempt to draw the attention of the natural mother to the fact that the adoptive parents are not both of the same religion.  It is then a matter of free choice of the mother whether she gives her consent to place the child with those parents or not.  Deputy O'Malley makes the point that in many cases because of the trauma of birth and possibly the young age of the mother in question it is unreal to talk of her free choice. She might be constrained to make a decision that would be unwise and one which she would subsequently regret.  This is speculation.  I do not think we can legislate on that basis. Furthermore, although the consent given by the mother at that stage, is the final consent, there is still a six-month interval during which she can withdraw it.</P>
    <P>Again if the situation were as described by the Deputy, the six-month interval can be extended by the Adoption Board.  There is the subsequent waiting period of at least six months in which she can reconsider her decision and withdraw her consent. As the Deputy and the House are aware, consent to adoption can be withdrawn at any time before the adoption order is made.  We have <Col N="1496" /> provided in the Bill for the case of the procrastinating mother who withdraws her consent or will not make up her mind.</P>
    <P>The Deputy's amendment could have a very serious practical difficulty. He wants to ensure that at least one of the adopting parents is the same religion as the baby.  I could envisage a situation where a young girl emigrates and embraces a religion not the religion of her birth &mdash; she might even embrace one of those oriental religions which are becoming more and more popular.  Perhaps she becomes pregnant and returns here to have her baby.  Her baby will have her religion.  She might want her parents who might be members of a church in this country to adopt her child.  If I were to accept this amendment this would not be permissible because the baby's religion would be that of the mother's changed religion which she adopted when she went abroad whereas her parents would have the religion of the family.  If this amendment were accepted grandparents would be prevented from adopting their grandchild. That type of adoption is quite frequent here.  I have known of several cases.  These adoptions have been very happy solutions to difficult domestic situations.  I am sure the Deputy does not intend that but it is a consequence which would follow from this amendment and is a very serious argument against its acceptance.</P>
    <P>Again, having drawn the mother's attention to the fact that there is a difference of religion between her and the adopting parents, I am advised that for the State to go further and say that she shall not place her child with particular adopting parents because they are not the same religion, could be held to be an interference with the natural rights of the mother and could be unconstitutional. If we were to interfere with the type of adoption I have exemplified, it would be clearly an inhuman provision, apart from its unconstitutionality.</P>
    <P>The fact that it could prevent grandparents from adopting their illegitimate <Col N="1497" /> grandchild and could constitute an interference with the natural rights of the mother, are two strong reasons why the provisions in the Bill should not go as far as Deputy O'Malley wants.  We have discharged our obligations to the natural mothers by making provision that they be informed when the religions are not the same.  To go further and say that they can only place the child if one of the parties is of the same religion as the mother is to go too far and is exceeding our obligations and our duties.</P>
    <P>As I indicated earlier, I do not think that an Act of Parliament is a suitable vehicle for dealing with proselytisation. This is not a matter for the Legislature.  Even if it were, it would be incompatible with ecumenism which I think should be the predominant feature on the religious horizon rather than raising the old sores which proselytism brings with it.  For these reasons I am not prepared to accept the amendment.</P>

The Minister's example of a difficulty which it could create, while theoretically right, is so unusual and unlikely to happen that the damage which would be done by accepting the amendment would be about one-thousandth of the damage which would be done by not accepting it.

      <P>Yes, or other religions. It is not unknown for a number of them to adopt exotic religions without going abroad.  I do not know if the Bahai is an oriental religion, but it is not uncommon.  But when it comes to the crunch most of them regard being Bahai or whatever religion the Maharajah of somewhere follows, as being a practice.  I know of at least one marriage in Limerick between two followers of an exotic religion which took place in the Catholic church, the Bahai, or whatever religion it was, not having a provision for <Col N="1498" /> the carrying out of the various religious ceremonies.</P>
      <P>Therefore, I do not consider that the alleged problem referred to by the Minister is real.  The number of young girls who, either abroad or at home, adopt an exotic religion is very small. If the number who adopt these religions is very small, the proportion who become pregnant outside marriage is also very small.  We are now trying to make law in order to justify a one-in-a-million situation.  One should not try to justify making the law, as the Minister wants, simply on the grounds that perhaps one person in a million will be in a very unusual situation.</P>
      <P>It is very hard to believe that a young girl who has adopted an exotic religion and is delivered of an illegitimate child would stick so tenaciously to an oriental or other religion which she recently acquired because it happened to be fashionable with the particular group in which she moved. Normally such a girl would be willing to allow her parents to adopt the child.  It is very hard to see her sticking so tenaciously to it that she would insist her child be described as of some strange Indian religion and in that way deprive her parents of the opportunity, for her child's benefit and for hers, of adopting it.  Such an extreme example on the part of the Minister shows that there could not be much genuine objection to what I am asking.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>He failed altogether in his reply to deal with the question of the effect of childbirth, even within marriage, on women.  He failed to advert to the fact that the Legislature recognised approximately 100 years ago that it had a severe psychological effect even on those who were married, yet here we are coming along 100 years later saying that we do not recognise that the birth of an illigitimate child to a very young girl &mdash; a lot of those girls are around 15 or 16 years &mdash; would have any psychological effect.  Of course it would. There is no question but that it would have a much more severe effect than any of us here would realise or could dream of.  It can be totally shattering <Col N="1499" /> for her, particularly because of her very limited horizon.</P>
    <P>It seems strange that we should make no recognition of that fact, that we should allow her to do something which under the section we almost assuredly would not wish.  If she is uncaring of religion herself and does not want her child to have any religion, then she is perfectly free beforehand to declare that she is of no religion, and then neither I nor anyone else can quibble with the way in which that child is brought up.  But if she declares her religion is X religion, then she must surely not be allowed or encouraged, as could well be the effect of this section unamended, to allow her child to be adopted by people neither of whom is of that religion.</P>
    <P>Up to very recently in this country and elsewhere there was a strong feeling that it was putting a child's future happiness in jeopardy to allow it to be adopted by a couple where both of the parties were not of the same religion as the child.  That opinion was very strongly held in this country up to quite recently, and now we have suddenly come to the situation that we are interfering with the rights of the mother and everyone else if we pay any regard to the religion in which the child apparently will be brought up.</P>
    <P>I am all for liberalising things up to a point, but there is a point and I am afraid this is the point, and it is no use talking of ecumenism and things of that nature.  They are not relevant.  The Minister tried to imply perhaps inadvertently, that children of one particular religion would end up in another religion or in another group of religions.  It could apply equally the other way around.  He said that proselytism, as it is known in this country, envisaged movement from one religion to another.  I am not sure that is universally true in relation to what happened in the past and I am equally not certain that it would be universally true of any proselytism that might take place in the future.  It might well be in the reverse direction to what the Minister tried to imply.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1500" /> However, it is wrong that the inability of a very young and frightened girl to make a clear and rational judgment at an early age in a very traumatic experience should cause her child to be brought up in a religion other than her own.  If we still cling to the fiction that somebody approaching the end of his or her 21st year is not a fit man or woman to make a contract for anything, we are being simply hypocritical when at the same time we expect a young frightened girl of 15 or 16 years to make rational and unimpaired judgment in very traumatic circumstances about something that is considerably more important than making a contract to buy a motor car or some other such article.</P>
    <P>I trust the Minister will not seek to take the view that I am being too concerned with religion and not about anything else.  I am not.  My primary concern is with the rights and the good of the child.  The child has a right to be brought up in its own religion unless, lawfully together, its lawful parents decide to change that religion and the child, if it is of sufficient age, is prepared to go along with them&mdash;if not of sufficient age, of course it cannot do anything about it. There is a positive danger that if a child of a particular religion is adopted by a couple neither of whom has the same religion as it, its religion must necessarily be changed.  Apart from the religious and spiritual aspect of the matter, the normal human happiness of that child must surely be affected by that situation if the change takes place at any time later than when the baby is in the pram.</P>
    <P>I do not think this matter is at all as simple or as unimportant as the Minister would have us believe.  A lot of people perhaps do not realise what is being done in this section.  If they did, they would think twice about it and that is why once again I am trying to urge on the Minister the necessity for the caution that I think arises out of the amendment as put down and which is done for good and valid reasons.  The main arguments put up against it are that it is non-ecumenical and anti-proselytising and that it <Col N="1501" /> does not cover the situation that where a girl adopts an oriental or other strange religion her parents would be stopped from adopting the child.  I do not think any of these three arguments has sufficient validity to offset the necessity for this amendment which incidentally will not cause any problems for anybody but will prevent things happening which I think all of us would agree should not happen.</P>
    <P>I do not think it is right for the Minister to try to argue from the recent case decided by Mr. Justice Pringle, who dealt with section 12 (2) of the old Act&mdash;to argue that that would cover this section if my amendment were in it.  I am quite certain it would not because I am dealing with a totally different thing. That dealt with a situation where a couple in a mixed marriage could not adopt any child in any circumstances because they were of a mixed marriage. Under this section, with my amendment, every couple in a mixed marriage, provided they are otherwise suitable and that they can get a child to adopt, can adopt a child.  It is a totally different situation from that which Mr. Justice Pringle adjudicated on.  That was a situation where, no matter how suitable they were as prospective adoptors, no couple in a mixed marriage could adopt a baby in this country.  I accepted that as being wrong as long ago as 1972.  I accepted that that would have to be changed, not for the reasons that some of those who are advocating the change held but in many ways for quite different reasons.</P>
    <P>In the event it was changed, not by this House in the first instance&mdash; and, perhaps, it might have been better if it had been&mdash;but by the court in a particular case.  We had this the last day in relation to these various divorce cases where the Minister told me I was wrong to try to argue from one case on a particular set of facts to another.  Perhaps I was wrong, but if I was he is as least as wrong today because he is doing that and doing it to a very great and dangerous extent in trying to read into Mr. Justice <Col N="1502" /> Pringle's judgment things that are not there and things he was never asked to decide.  Above all else, whatever a judge might have to decide on this section, whether as amended or not in the future, he will never have to decide in the situation that Mr. Justice Pringle was faced with, that is, that no couple in a mixed marriage could adopt any child even if, as in that case, the child they wanted to adopt was the natural child of the mother in that marriage and the husband in that marriage was more than anxious to adopt it.  That was a unique situation.  It was most onerous on that unfortunate mother, but Mr. Justice Pringle went further, as I understand his judgment, and decided that to prevent a couple in a mixed marriage, even where it was an outside child, from adopting, was not reconcilable with the Constitution.</P>
    <P>That is fair enough.  That is the judge's decision, but that has nothing to do with what we are talking about here.  What I am urging now in the House will not stop anybody from adopting.  It will only ensure that they do not adopt a child of a different religion to each of them.  It is only right and proper, if we have any regard left for the rights of a child, that we should make that provision. It will not stop any child being adopted and it will not stop any natural mother of an illegitimate child placing her child for adoption with a suitable couple.</P>
    <P>To talk about interference with the mother's natural right of choice is wrong, because she has no right of choice.  All she has the right to do is to place the child for adoption. Unless it is placed with relatives she will never know with whom it is adopted.  Mothers never do know that, perhaps, some of the adoptive parents are unsuitable to adopt children.  Some of them are very good, but maybe some small proportion, 1 or 2 per cent, might be unsuitable.</P>
    <P>The board, if it had a chance all over again, might not make an order in respect of, perhaps, one per cent of cases.  However, is it not just as well that the mother does not know that? As I say, she has no choice.  All she <Col N="1503" /> has is the right to chose whether to have her child adopted or not.  Once she decides to have it adopted she never knows where it goes.  Therefore, her right of choice does not arise, and it is not limiting her in any way whatever to say that at least one of the adoptive parents is of the same religion as the child.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMarkCooney" hpid="Mr. Cooney Mr. Cooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cooney</NameTxt>
      <P>I just wish to clear up a couple of points.  First, I did not rely on the recent judgment in the High Court for my opposition to this amendment.  I merely mentioned the judgment of the High Court when I started my speech, giving the background to the section as drafted. Secondly, I am not opposing it on anything to do with the question of proselytism.  It was the Deputy introduced that subject when he indicated that his amendment provided the protection that fell as a consequence of the High Court decision and the Government's repeal of the religious section.  That is not my argument. That is one of his justifications for the amendment, and it is one I do not accept.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is a very practical argument against this amendment.  I gave one instance of where a daughter might change her religion, not necessarily to an exotic religion; she could change it to one of the orthodox religions and would be thereby prevented from having a child adopted by her grandparents by way of private placement. Again, even within the existing churches you could have the situation where a Methodist child could not be placed for adoption with a couple one of whom was a Presbyterian and the other a member of the Church of Ireland.  If the Deputy's amendment were to be accepted we would have to re-enact some of section 12, the section which provides for inter-adoption between members of various Protestant denominations.  There are an endless number of possibilities where worthwhile adoptions would, in effect, be barred by the requirement of the Deputy's amendment that one of the adoptive parents should be of the same religion as the child.  I think it would be regrettable if worthwhile <Col N="1504" /> adoptions were to be prevented by reason of this.</P>
    <P>I think the Legislature should only go so far as is provided in the Bill, namely, that where the parties are not of the same religion, this fact be drawn to the mother's attention and thereafter she would make up her mind. It would be going too far to accept the amendment which, in effect, says that, in addition to that, the child shall not be placed for adoption unless one of the parties is of the same religion.</P>
    <P>The Deputy says I did not deal with the case&mdash;I thought I did&mdash;of the young inexperienced mother who after the trauma of the birth might not be in a position to make a reasoned judgment on being told that the adoptive parents were not of the same religion.  My answer to that is that her consent to adoption can be withdrawn any time before the adoption order is made, should she change her mind when she becomes settled after the birth.  In any event, that begs the question of her being able to make the even greater decision, namely to place her child for adoption at all.  If the capacity of the mother to make a judgment because of the trauma of the birth were to be a consideration, it would apply with even greater force to the new provision in this Bill providing that final consent to adoption may be given at the age of six weeks. The fact that adoption workers and those experienced in this field in England who reported on adoption in detail also found in favour of this age limit of six weeks, is an argument against the suggestion that mothers are incapable of making rational decisions because of the trauma of the birth.  There may be the occasional mother who is in that position but, as I say, her case is protected by the fact that the final order is not made for about six months or longer if the Adoption Board so decide on the facts of a particular case before them.  I do not think there is any risk there.  I think this Legislature should go no further than drawing the mother's attention to the fact that the proposed adopting parents are of a different religion to her child and, after that, it is the mother's right to decide.  She <Col N="1505" /> may well decide that she wants her child placed with adopting parents both of whom must be of her religion. To attach a condition or attempt to give direction as to what she should or should not be entitled to do in that type of situation is going too far and it is not the business of an Act of Parliament, particularly when it would have the consequence of preventing adoptions in many cases where all the parties would be of what we commonly call the Protestant religions but, within that, would be members of different denominations.  If the Deputy's amendment were to be accepted, it could inhibit many adoptions by people who are non-Roman Catholics.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DavidAndrews" hpid="Mr. Andrews Mr. Andrews">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Andrews</NameTxt>
      <P>We do not accept the argument that Deputy O'Malley's amendment would inhibit adoptions, as has been suggested by the Minister. The amendment placed by Deputy O'Malley is consistent with my contribution on Second Reading and, indeed, with the contributions of other Members from this side of the House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We say that the Adoption Bill should be seen as a child centre and that the primary interest of adoption be concentrated on the child's present well-being and future.  In relation to section 2, we are speaking more particularly of illegitimate births.  Having studied this matter very thoroughly, my information is that effectively 95 per cent or 96 per cent of children adopted in this country are illegitimate. And, if we are speaking about children, we feel that the child has no decision in the matter of being brought into the world.  Having regard to Deputy O'Malley's amendment, we say that the child should not be asked or forced to take on a religion in which he has no decision.  We should like to make it clear that the point we are making on Deputy O'Malley's amendment is not a religious one. Rather the point we are making is that we feel the child is being denied its right of choice of religion by virtue of the fact that its mother may decide.  We are talking here about a traumatic situation.  We are not necessarily talking about adult people when we speak of mothers of illegitimate <Col N="1506" /> children.  In some instances, the mother may be 16, 17, 18, or at the very outside, 19 years of age.  A girl who suddenly becomes pregnant is asked to make a decision which will affect the religion of her unborn child for all time.  Under those circumstances, we contend that the amendment we propose is a proper one.  In no way does Deputy O'Malley's amendment interfere with the right of people of mixed marriages to adopt a child.  That is preserved and enshrined in the Adoption Bill, 1974.  In the circumstances outlined by the Minister, he says we are not properly legislating; we accept that.  Nevertheless, by virtue of the Minister's section, if it remains and is passed by this Legislature, we are denying the child its right to a free choice of religion.  If we take the example of a decent young girl from the country who, by virtue of unfortunate circumstances, is found to be pregnant &mdash; she may be 16 or 17 years of age only &mdash; she may argue even that she did not know how she became pregnant &mdash; we are asking this unfortunate young girl to make a decision relating to the religion of her unborn child.</P>
    <P>As we understand the Minister's section, he is making the point that the mother can decide that the child be brought up in a religion other than that of her own.  We contend that this over-rides the right of the child, the very person for whom we hope this Bill is being enacted.  In this Legislature we are providing for the future of the child and properly so.  We are handing the child over to people who have been found eminently suitable, having regard to background investigations and so on, to adopt the child and provide for its immediate physical well-being.  The right of choice does not arise.  The child is being handed over to parents who will look after its physical well-being.  The child has no choice in that.  It does not arise. The people accepting responsibility for the child are themselves responsible adults.</P>
    <P>The point we make is that the choice of religion is being left to the mother who, through unfortunate circumstances, finds herself in such a <Col N="1507" /> situation and, as I have said before in this House, it is not for us to make moral judgments on people who find themselves in that situation.  What we are here to do is provide for the future of the child.  The Minister's section, as understood by us, abandons the right of the child, having regard to the decision its mother may make on its behalf.  The right of free choice, from the very birth of the child, is being abandoned in relation to what many people would consider to be an extremely important matter, namely, its immediate and future religion.  If some time in the future &mdash; the child having become an adult &mdash; it abandons its religion, that is a matter for itself, for the adult.  It would be improper for us to prevent the adult, adopted child deciding what religion it would take on or even reject religion altogether.  As we see it, that is not our function in this House.  Certainly our function is to provide that the child be handed over to adopting parents, one or other of whom should be required to be of the religion of the child itself.  The child has no choice in the matter.  What we want to do is to preserve that choice until the child becomes an adult and may decide that it will continue in the religion of its natural mother, which would be the religion of one or other of the adoptive parents having regard to Deputy O'Malley's amendment.</P>
    <P>On the other hand, the child may reject religion altogether; so to say that we are trying to set out the religion of the child is nonsense.  We are trying to protect and preserve the right of the child to make a decision on whether the first decision was correct or not.  We say that the Minister's section as it stands may abandon that right or entitlement.  We are just as much entitled to say that as the Minister is entitled to make the points he has been making.  We do not agree with him or accept what he says.  We appeal to him to examine the Opposition proposal and have another look at it.</P>
    <P>We must press this matter because we feel very strongly about it.  We were elected to do what we consider <Col N="1508" /> to be correct here: it may be fashionable or unfashionable outside the House but we must bring our knowledge and experience to bear on legislation coming before us.  We may be wrong.  Therefore we ask the Minister to consult with others.  We realise that people outside the House may have greater wisdom and knowledge of matters of this nature than we have. We ask the Minister to give us some undertaking to reconsider the section before the Bill as it stands is passed. We believe the Minister has an obligation to do that.  If the Minister comes back, having consulted others who may have a superior knowledge of these things, and having heard the results of the consultation we may then accept the Minister's findings. That does not say that people outside the House should be taken as final arbiters on matters coming before the House.  We make the decisions in regard to legislation and that is properly so and we make no apology for those decisions.  They may be wrong decisions and, if so, they can be cured at another time.  We believe Deputy O'Malley's amendment is a proper one and the Minister has not satisfied us to the contrary, that it does not protect the rights of the child.</P>
    <P>This is a Bill which secures for all time, as we understand it, the happiness and well-being, physically, educationally and in terms of religion, and in other directions also the future of a child.  As it stands, the section gives to a young woman of, say, 16 or 17 who may not be knowledgeable in wordly affairs the decision and the right to do what the section allows. While all are equal under the Constitution we believe Deputy O'Malley's amendment is eminently suitable and protects the person on whose behalf the Bill was introduced, in the main, the illegitimate child of a mother who may not know or understand the consequences of the decision she makes on behalf of her child.  Through no fault of her own she may not have the education to make the decision set out in the section.  Undoubtedly, she will have the assistance of highly qualified people in reaching a decision but one can visualise her coming to a decision under pressure, not deliberate <Col N="1509" /> pressure, but she may not be equipped to make this decision.</P>
    <P>If the Minister decides that what we say is wrong the matter may have to be contested on the floor of the House.  That is no threat.  The Minister must realise that if what he proposes is not acceptable to the Opposition they have not any alternative but to take whatever course is open to them.</P>
    <P>We would appreciate it if, before the Bill goes through its final Stages, the Minister would give some undertaking <Col N="1510" /> to reconsider this section and consider Deputy O'Malley's amendment further.  That amendment has been circulated for some days.  I think its consequences are important and I do not think another week would make any difference if the Bill were delayed to that extent through further consideration of the section and the proposed amendment.  Again, I appeal to the Minister to adopt this suggestion.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DenisGallagher" hpid="Mr. Gallagher Mr. Gallagher">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gallagher</NameTxt>
      <P>First of all, I want to say I am disappointed with the efforts of the Parliamentary Secretary to improve our social welfare standards.  We find the theme through his Estimate speech is that he agrees there are so many things that need to be done but when we examine the actual Estimate we find there is very little expansion on what was done by the Fianna Fáil Government while in office.  We have had in the House on many occasions suggestions made to the Parliamentary Secretary regarding various aspects of social welfare which are in need of improvement.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>About a year ago I put down a question to him regarding home assistance.  He stated that he agreed there was great need for revision and that he was having the matter examined. He said he hoped to be able to inform the House that steps would be taken to improve the present situation. I am disappointed that in his <Col N="1512" /> Estimate speech last week he repeated almost verbatim what he said in his reply to me on that occasion.  No positive steps are being taken to improve the situation.  It is a shame that this system is being continued. In most rural areas the home assistance officer is described as the relief officer.  It is about time we got away from the stigma of relief and everything that goes with it.  We accept that home assistance is necessary to bring relief to families who are in distress, but as it is being administered at the moment it should be changed.  In fairness to the Parliamentary Secretary he referred to this in his speech but something more positive is necessary.  I cannot see that there is any great progress being made.</P>
    <P>The Parliamentary Secretary referred to the problem of the self-employed; this matter is being examined. We should take a good hard look at the self-employed.  Small business people and shopkeepers in the smaller towns are being hit because of competition from supermarkets and so on. If they go out of business they have nowhere to turn for assistance.  They are not entitled to social welfare.  I know a butcher who had to give up working because of arthritis.  Over a period of 18 months to two years his business went steadily down and eventually he found himself in an impossible position.  He had a wife and five children to support.  In the last resort he qualified for disability benefit. This covers him.  There is no allowance made for his dependants.  I raised this by way of parliamentary question and the answer I got was that this Government were conscious of the need to improve social welfare services.  This man had to avail of home assistance.  People have their pride.  Here was a man who had been carrying on a fairly successful business reaching the stage at which he had to go to the home assistance officer for help.  The Parliamentary Secretary should take immediate steps to ensure something positive is done instead of giving us a list of problems which, he says, require solution and then doing nothing either to change or improve the position.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1513" /> A good deal has been said about informing people of their rights in regard to the benefits available.  I accept that this is a good thing; it is right that people should be made aware of what benefits they can get. However, recently in the post office those who applied for application forms found that the forms were not available.  The sub-postmaster was in trouble immediately because the insinuation was that he was not prepared to co-operate with the people. He was accused of trying to sabotage the Government.  It was unfortunate that an advertisement should have been inserted and the public misinformed. When the sub-postmaster went to check with the postmaster from whom these forms should come he was told the forms were not available for distribution; they had not come in.  That sort of situation should not be allowed to occur.  It was unfortunate that this should have happened because many inferences can be taken from this kind of thing.  In a small community it can lead to things being said about people, things which can cause embarrassment; it can lead to neighbours falling out.</P>
    <P>The Parliamentary Secretary also said he had taken steps to improve the efficiency of his Department in regard to the payment of pensions and so on.  Frankly, I am dissatisfied with the way in which people are catered for; it should not be necessary for an applicant for an old age pension to have to make representations to his Deputy to ensure he gets payment. Then one finds that the applicant may have to wait three, four and sometimes six months before he is paid. That could hardly be described as efficiency.  It should be a fairly straightforward matter.  A person receiving unemployment assistance is cut off when he reaches 70 years of age and one would imagine there should be no great problem about having him transferred to the old age pension without any further delay, provided he has made the ordinary application.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Gallagher</NameTxt>
      <P>I apologise.  It is no pleasure to me to come in here and criticise the Parliamentary Secretary or his Department.  I am quoting instances which I have come across in my work as a Deputy.  I can give the Parliamentary Secretary all the particulars if he wishes to have them.</P>
      <P>This situation should not be allowed to continue.  My experience is that when I write to the Parliamentary Secretary's office about problems, I receive an acknowledgement but I may have to wait seven, eight or ten weeks before I am told the outcome of the representations and the results of the queries raised on behalf of pensioners or other people who are trying to get assistance from the Department of Social Welfare.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Parliamentary Secretary said that increases have been provided for necessitous families, for free travel facilities for those over pensionable age, for free television licences and for school needs.  Reading that there has been an increase from £3.69 million to £5.15 million, one would imagine that something special had happened, or that some extra benefits were being made available to people in those <Col N="1515" /> categories.  In actual fact, there is no expansion of those facilities.  The increases arise because of the fact that costs have increased.  For all practical purposes this £5.15 million does not give any increased benefits in any way.</P>
    <P>The fuel services are not at all satisfactory. One wonders why the Parliamentary Secretary and his Department find it necessary to discriminate against rural dwellers as opposed to urban dwellers with regard to the provision of fuel.  If a person living in the country wants to buy a trailer of turf it will cost him in the region of £30.  It is as costly for the person living in the rural area as it is for the person living in the urban area.  I find it very hard to understand why an old age pensioner living in the country should be expected to buy fuel while the people in urban areas are facilitated under the scheme.  The scheme should be expanded to cover necessitous cases irrespective of whether they are rural or urban dwellers.  I would ask the Parliamentary Secretary to take a serious look at this question.</P>
    <P>With regard to the provision of school meals I speak from my experience in rural areas.  Perhaps in the cities and towns a more efficient service is provided; but, as school meals are handled at the moment in the rural areas, they can hardly be described as meals.  Bread is delivered to the school twice per week.  In many instances there is no storage for it. There are no cooking facilities in the school and there is no room in which the meals can be properly served to the children.  The Parliamentary Secretary should take a look at this problem, and if the service cannot be improved it should be scrapped entirely.  There are many areas where meals&mdash; again if they can be described as such&mdash;are necessary and where poorer people are glad of this assistance.  I would suggest that the whole position should be reviewed and improved.</P>
    <P>To my knowledge the free book service has never worked satisfactorily. People find themselves going to the home assistance officer with the béal bocht trying to make a case for themselves.  This is not satisfactory.  I <Col N="1516" /> appreciate that there are problems.  I know the Parliamentary Secretary cannot be expected to improve every minute detail of schemes of this nature overnight.  Many of these schemes have been there for quite a long time and the set up has not changed over the years.  They are administered in the same way and the methods are outmoded and outdated and in need of review.</P>
    <P>The self employed find it hardest of all to get along at present.  It is necessary to do something positive about changing the set-up here.  I welcome the added benefits given in this year's budget, the help which is to be provided for the dependant of a non-contributory old age pensioner, and the pensions for spinsters over 58 years of age.  In many instances people, through pride, shun the idea of going to a home assistance officer for help but now they will receive this benefit.  I feel sure this will be welcomed by all, but particularly by those in rural areas.</P>
    <P>Where a brother and sister of advanced years are living alone and the male is drawing unemployment assistance he could not claim for the dependant but, as a result of the changes in the budget, such a person will now be entitled to benefit with the result that they will be able to enjoy a better standard of living.  The same applies in the case of married pensioners.  Up to now a married man when he was drawing unemployment benefit could claim for his wife but when he reached 70 years of age he found himself worse off because he only received benefit in respect of himself. This situation has now been changed. We welcome the idea of making it possible for a non-contributory pensioner to claim for his dependent wife.</P>
    <P>In my view many of the increases fall short of what the people need at present.  There is not much point in giving an increase of £1 to a pensioner because it is what that £1 can buy which counts.  The cost of living is increasing daily and at such a rate that pensioners and those in receipt of home assistance are finding it increasingly difficult to make ends meet. <Col N="1517" /> On many occasions I have received representations from people who are drawing home assistance only and they have pointed out to me the difficulty they are having in keeping the wolf from the door.  They have told me of their struggle to purchase food and that they find it almost impossible to purchase clothing and footwear. People preparing children for Holy Communion and Confirmation, because of the huge increase in prices are finding it impossible to clothe them properly.</P>
    <P>It is hard for Members of this House who have received an increase in salary to justify that increase when we compare it with what will be paid to recipients of social welfare benefits. The two do not tally and we should remember that those in the lower income bracket have to live like everybody else.  It is necessary to have some minimum standard set so that those who are depending entirely on the State for help can have a proper standard of living.</P>
    <P>I accept that this is not an easy problem for any Minister for Social Welfare to solve because he is depending on the economy in general in order to be able to give a fair distribution of the wealth of the country to those in the lower income bracket but the situation is becoming more serious.  It is sad to see the way we are treating those who are depending entirely on social welfare and those living on small farms.</P>
    <P>I hope the Parliamentary Secretary will find it possible to implement many of the suggestions he put forward and that he will be able to do something positive about many of the comments he made.  I doubt if we are going to see the benefits which are necessary in order to give people a reasonable standard of living but people are despondent and losing confidence in the whole structure of society. When employment is not provided people must turn to the State for help and it is the duty of the State to do everything possible to give these people a fair share of the cake.</P>
    <P>The Parliamentary Secretary can be assured of the full co-operation of this <Col N="1518" /> side of the House in ensuring that this is so.  Down through the years Fianna Fáil laid the foundation for social welfare services but the Coalition have not expanded these services to any great extent although they had available to them a large sum of money to devote to social welfare services as a result of our membership of the EEC.  However, there are many people who have not benefited as a result of the availability of this money to the extent to which we would have liked them to benefit.</P>
    <P>Sin a bhfuil le rá agam ach ba mhaith liom iarraidh ar an Rúnaí Parlaiminte a dhícheall a dhéanamh chun cuidiú leis na daoine bochta, siad is mó a bhfuil gá le cuidiú a fháil agus ba cheart gan faillí a dhéanamh iontu agus nach bhfágfaí chun deiridh iad.</P>

      <P>Two weeks ago we had a debate here on the Social Welfare (No. 2) Bill and now we have this Estimate before us.  In the debate on the Bill certain suggestions were put forward from this side of the House in an effort to improve many areas of social welfare but it would appear that the Parliamentary Secretary gave little or no consideration to those submissions and that the Estimate must have been prepared at the time the debate on the Bill was taking place.</P>
      <P>This practice conflicts with all principles of democracy.  I have been studying the Minister's brief but I have been unable to find in it any comment on any area that was mentioned by us as being in need of improvement. The Government have set up a commission to investigate areas of poverty.  Would it not have been reasonable for the Department to have waited for whatever information might emanate from this commission before going ahead with the preparation of the Estimate?</P>
      <P>Perhaps it is difficult to define poverty but everybody must be aware of the obvious areas of poverty.  From my experience the poverty I have witnessed has been in the homes of people who are in receipt of social welfare payments.  I defy anyone to say that the position is otherwise.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1519" /> A debate on social welfare is a very important occasion.  No doubt many members of this party will be criticised for making certain submissions to the Government but I assure the Parliamentary Secretary that our criticism is made on behalf of thousands of unfortunate people in our community.  We have a right, as public representatives, to highlight defects in the social welfare field.  I do not think that the Government would wish to deny us that right but neither would I wish the Parliamentary Secretary to give the impression that we are not being constructive in our contributions in this sphere.  We are expressing our views with all sincerity and in the light of the experience we have had down through the years.</P>
    <P>Nobody in Fianna Fáil has ever been satisfied with the moneys that we were able to allocate to social welfare but, unfortunately, we had not available to us the £30 million which was available to the Coalition as a result of savings in agricultural subsidies.  A couple of weeks ago I reminded the Parliamentary Secretary that the availability of this extra money gave to the Government the first opportunity an Irish Government have ever had of doing something worthwhile for the less fortunate in our society.</P>
    <P>I am aware that the Government are endeavouring to broaden the scope of the social welfare services but they should have concentrated mainly on those who are most in need rather than try to spread £30 million across the entire community, thus satisfying nobody.  That is what happened in relation to the first budget.  Unfortunately, the Government failed to take advantage of that first real opportunity. Again, we can see now the effects that their second budget has had on many families.  We know, for instance, that married women with families are now forced to take up employment so as to supplement the household incomes.  An extraordinary situation in this regard is that should such a woman become unemployed she is not entitled to unemployment benefit although, during her period of <Col N="1520" /> employment she had contributed to social welfare.  To my mind she is entitled legally to benefit in those circumstances.</P>
    <P>I do not know any reason for this. Nobody in the Department has clarified it for me.  If a woman is employed but becomes unemployed she is informed by the Department that she is not entitled to unemployment benefit because she is not available for work.  Perhaps the Parliamentary Secretary would have this matter examined.  Great injustice is being done to such an unfortunate woman who was forced to take up employment in order to help to maintain her family and who is refused unemployment benefit.</P>
    <P>I have personal views concerning the lowering of the age for old age pension.  The Department are saving money by reducing the age.  A man who retires at 65 years if he had remained on disability benefit would have had more money than he will get in retirement pension.  Likewise if a man continues on disability pension until he is 69 years his income will be greater than if he was on old age pension at age 68.  The Department of Social Welfare are saving money by lowering the age.  Usually the Department say that a man who remains on disability pension may receive more money.  We should not be told we are doing a service to people by paying them pensions at the earlier age.</P>

      <P>With all due respect to Deputy Kelly, I want to say here what I said a fortnight ago regarding people who retire at 65.  Many people are not ready to retire at 65.  The Parliamentary Secretary, Deputy Cluskey, is a member of the Labour Party and he must be aware of this from his dealings with people.  A fortnight ago I asked him to consider the question of people who retire at 65 taking up part-time employment so as to subsidise their incomes.  I agree that there might be certain difficulties. The main difficulty would be that concerned with insurance and occupational injuries.  There are many elderly people employed at petrol pumps and in caretaking jobs.  These people should be allowed to take up part-time employment without depriving them of their retirement pensions. Such employment would help to keep them active.  Many of our institutions are overcrowded.  When people retire they often get into a rut and lose their interest in life.  The Parliamentary Secretary is aware of this.  Many societies concerned with the elderly have been advocating part-time employment for them.  I questioned the Minister for Social Welfare some months ago in the Dáil about this matter.  He told me he would be prepared to consider the whole question. Nothing has been done so far.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am glad to see the Parliamentary Secretary, Deputy Cluskey, is now back in the House.  I made certain suggestions to him a fortnight ago but no reference has been made now to my submissions.  There is much hardship in regard to unemployment benefit. Sometimes in the heat of the moment because of a dispute with an employer an employee may lose his job.  The extraordinary thing is that the Department of Social Welfare regard that worker as guilty.  As soon as he claims unemployment benefit he is refused it until such time as a referee sits to consider his case. I have seen cases where married men with large families had to wait six or eight weeks before a referee could decide who was right and who was wrong.  I have written hundreds of letters to the Department of Social <Col N="1522" /> Welfare asking them to expedite hearings or to have money paid to a particular man who was awaiting the hearing of his case.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Wyse</NameTxt>
      <P>I am asking the Parliamentary Secretary to do what he said he would do if he were in Government. Those in receipt of social welfare and disability benefits are now looking to him to carry out the promises he made during the last general election.  I mention this in good faith because this can create hardship and poverty.  There is a need for adjustment here.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A man on sick leave is paid disability benefit.  After a certain period he is brought before the medical referee.  If the referee thinks he is capable of working he is ordered <Col N="1523" /> back although the family doctor may differ.  People under the family doctor should carry out his orders. Disability benefit ceases until somebody steps in between the two doctors to decide who is right.  During this time the unfortunate applicant must wait although he may have a wife and family to keep.  Payment should continue until the referee reaches a decision.  That will avoid hardship.  I have no doubt that the commission set up to investigate areas of poverty will come across many cases such as I have mentioned.  For a man with a wife and family to be without income for six weeks is, to my mind, a hardship.</P>
    <P>I mentioned here the long delays in the payment of non-contributory old age pensions.  I will not place all the blame for this at the Parliamentary Secretary's door because a lot of it must be attributed to old age pension committees.  The day for such committees has gone.  Committees of this type should meet once a month.  An unfortunate applicant may have to wait two months for payment of his non-contributory old age pension if the committee fails to meet.  There is hardship here.  The Parliamentary Secretary should consider some other system for payment of non-contributory old age pensions.  Old age pension committees serve no purpose.  They meet regularly and, I am sure, are not even questioned about their findings.  There is an unnecessary delay in the payment of these pensions because some committees may not meet for one, two or three months.  There are adjustments which can be made very easily.  The Parliamentary Secretary should give very serious consideration to this very important matter.</P>
    <P>It is about time that the words &ldquo;home assistance&rdquo; were removed. They give the impression of begging. Only those who are entitled to home assistance get it but it should not be given under that heading.  On this subject the Parliamentary Secretary should consider the co-ordination of a number of Departments because one hinges on the other&mdash;Social Welfare, Local Government and Health.  Home assistance <Col N="1524" /> comes under the Department of Health.  The time has come when home assistance should be reviewed.</P>
    <P>Who claims home assistance?  Many of the people I have already mentioned : those who are refused unemployment benefit until such time as their cases go before the appeal board and those who are refused disability benefit until the doctors decide who is right.  They are the people who must go cap in hand to the home assistance officer until such time as the Department of Social Welfare decide on their appeal.</P>
    <P>Deserted wives start with home assistance.  A wife is not considered &ldquo;deserted&rdquo; for three months.  She may have spent many years in employment and contributed to the Department of Social Welfare during that time but she cannot be considered as a deserted wife for three months.  Then she must go to the officer in charge of home assistance and beg.  Why?  The most important thing for an unfortunate girl who has been deserted is immediate assistance to help her avoid the frustrations she must suffer.</P>
    <P>We know that many a deserted wife had to desert her family in a matter of hours of being herself deserted by her husband.  Immediate action should be taken to avoid further hardship in cases of that kind.  I do not know why deserted wives with a genuine claim should have to wait for three months.  I appreciate that the waiting period was six months and that it has been reduced to three months, but I implore the Parliamentary Secretary to ensure that immediate payment will be made to wives in that predicament.</P>
    <P>For heavens sake, let us get rid of the words &ldquo;home assistance&rdquo; and &ldquo;social welfare&rdquo;.  Let us call them &ldquo;entitlements&rdquo;.  All who receive social welfare benefits have contributed to them in the same way as they would to insurance.  Many people are reluctant, for instance, to divulge their age, and consequently, many refuse to apply for old age pensions.  It is psychological.  We should call the different benefits by names such as &ldquo;Entitlement 1&rdquo;, &ldquo;Entitlement 2&rdquo; and so on to cover the entire field of <Col N="1525" /> social benefits.  In England they are called &ldquo;social security&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>I should like to say a few words about free electricity.  The cost of fuel has gone beyond the capacity of old age pensioners and others and I feel there should be unlimited supplies of free electricity available to them. There is no promise of any such benefit in the Parliamentary Secretary's brief.</P>
    <P>Deputy Faulkner a fortnight ago spoke for some hours and mentioned Fianna Fáil's contributions towards improving the social services.  The Parliamentary Secretary made no mention of that or to our other submissions. His brief was prepared more than a fortnight ago and I was hoping that this year, because of the report of the advisory committee on poverty, some effort would have been made to include some of the recommendations in this Estimate.  Though the information was in the hands of the Minister, no such action was taken.  It is difficult to define poverty and I am concerned about obvious cases in which the Minister might have altered entitlements in regard to many of the benefits.</P>
    <P>The Parliamentary Secretary made a comparison between the amounts allocated by the Fianna Fáil Government in their last year of office and that provided in 1973-74 but he did not make any comparison in regard to the rate of the cost of living increases in the two periods.  This year, because of inflationary trends, new severe hardships will be imposed on the social welfare classes.  Everybody knows that unless drastic action is taken immediately the increases given this year will have been completely eroded and those concerned will have no compensation.  Fianna Fáil exempted from rates non-contributory old age pensioners and I suggest now that this should be broadened to include the contributory class, particularly old couples living on their own.</P>
    <P>I should like to know if the House in the near future will be given an opportunity to discuss the recommendations of the Advisory Committee on Pilot Schemes to Combat Poverty so that we shall all know <Col N="1526" /> the exact areas of poverty.  Great efforts are being made throughout the country by community social service councils to alleviate poverty.  The Parliamentary Secretary should give all the assistance he can to those people who devote their time and energy to voluntary work.  I have no doubt that the greatest source of information where poverty is concerned is the organised social service councils, because they are the people who are now directly involved in fighting poverty, among other things.  I recall questioning the Minister for Social Welfare regarding this effort because it comes directly under the Department of Health as well as under the Department of Social Welfare.  I made the plea that they should consider at least exempting from rates the buildings of these groups administering to the needy.  This is of vital importance to the people I am talking about.  I trust the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Social Welfare will use his influence with his colleague in the Department of Local Government so that every possible encouragement will be given to these voluntary workers in their efforts on behalf of the needy.  Some contribution must come from the Government, be it through the Department of Health or the Department of Local Government, to alleviate the cost of rates on buildings.</P>
    <P>Finally I want to compliment the Parliamentary Secretary on his speech.  I have no doubt that his effort is a sincere one.  We are all anxious to try to reach perfection where the Department of Social Welfare is concerned. Therefore, when Deputies make suggestions in regard to that Department they should be listened to and at least some comment should be made by the Parliamentary Secretary when he is replying to this debate.</P>

      <P>Coming from a constituency where there are a great number of people to whom social welfare means a great deal, I wish to make some comments on this Estimate, which I consider to be one of the most important Estimates to come before the House.  Like the previous <Col N="1527" /> speaker I would like to compliment the Minister on his speech.  I was not here when it was being delivered but I have read through it; I have also read Deputy Faulkner's speech, and there is no difference between them. They are both trying to help.</P>
      <P>I believe the Parliamentary Secretary's heart is in the right place and that he has concern for the people for whom I have been fighting all my life.  It is a pity when two men have so much in common that a little compliment would not be paid to the people of the past.  A great deal has been done for social welfare down through the years.  I am not the youngest man in this House and I can remember when we were fighting for increased social welfare payments for the downtrodden.</P>
      <P>When we write to the Parliamentary Secretary about cases that come to our attention he does his best to get things done as quickly as possible. However, as Deputy Wyse has pointed out, there is great delay in coming to decisions in the Department.  I hope the Parliamentary Secretary will rectify that situation.</P>
      <P>I believe the Parliamentary Secretary and his Department are responsible for keeping the people from being very angry with the Government. Of course what is being done would be done no matter what Government were in power.  The only difference in regard to Fianna Fáil is that we did not have the £30 million from the EEC to distribute among social welfare recipients.  When I was fighting in the general election last February 12 months I was asked about the cost of living.  I said we could not do anything about the cost of living but that with the money we saved on agricultural subsidies we would improve social welfare benefits.  To be fair to the Minister for Social Welfare he has done that, but it is hardly enough to keep in line with inflation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister has tried to get as much as he could from the Government, but the cost of living is very high and guidelines have been set <Col N="1528" /> which are all wrong.  When most people think of social welfare benefits they think only of the urban areas but there are also people in the rural areas who need social welfare, unemployment assistance and so on.  I spoke previously on the question of taxation on valuation.  Some of the valuations on land are unjust.  I have a case before me which is going on appeal.  The land has a valuation of £17.50p.  According to the present way of assessing an income that man is supposed to have an income of £6.73p per week.  All he has on it are two cows, three calves, ten ewes and 15 lambs.  Anybody who knows anything about farming would realise that that man could not possibly have an income of £6.73p.  The case has been appealed, but I do not think the Minister can do an awful lot under the law as it obtains at present.</P>
    <P>However, it is ridiculous to assess a man's income on a valuation basis because the valuations vary so much. I pointed this out before, but I want to emphasise again that these valuations, the Griffith Valuations, have existed for a long time and are extremely unjust.  In the old days in certain estates in this country, where the land was bad and valuations were low, if the old landlords wanted to get on the Grand Jury they could not qualify unless they had a certain valuation. They applied and had those valuations increased.  Consequently when the tenant got that land it was with the increased valuation. I have it all around me in my constituency; it is called landlord's land, where some good land would be valued at perhaps 75p per acre and some even as high as a £ an acre. Those people are assessed on that valuation for everything, which seems to me to be most unjust.  The Parliamentary Secretary, being a Dublin man, may not be conversant with this but I am.  I understand it and I feel it is damnable so far as social welfare benefits are concerned.  I would ask the Parliamentary Secretary to examine this to see if there could not be devised some other way of assessing a man's income apart from the valuation of his land, which is completely <Col N="1529" /> outdated.  I believe his heart is in the right place and he will do something about it.  But unless the law is changed I do not know really what he can do to improve the situation.</P>
    <P>One benefit which I believe has not been sufficiently increased in the last budget is the children's allowance.  I think there is room for improvement there.</P>
    <P>Another matter mentioned in the Minister's speech, which is of vital importance and I am glad that he has taken cognisance of it, is the simplification of application forms. Something should be done in this respect so that people applying for social assistance will not be bothering others for help in the filling up of these forms.  There should be devised some kind of simple application form and let whoever processes it do the explanation, home assistance officer or whoever it may be.  But the form itself should be simplified so that anybody with ordinary schoolboy intelligence would be able to fill it in without running to the local priest or anybody else for help.  There are so many ways in which social assistance is granted at the moment that even a public representative would find it difficult, after much scrutiny, to establish the category into which a particular applicant may fall.  There should be in every town some agency or office where every kind of social assistance would be available, with people there to advise applicants on the type of assistance for which they might qualify.</P>
    <P>I come now to old age pensioners who may have a small pension from some other source.  I have a case in mind of a person, over 90 years of age, who had a small pension which increased gradually, but, as it increased, the ceiling for qualification for the old age pension did not rise correspondingly.  The result was that that person was drawing a pension to which he was not entitled.  This is very important because the Department will then be chasing such people for back money.  The person I have in mind had £500 levelled against him for having overdrawn his pension.  That serves to <Col N="1530" /> prove that the guidelines and the means test did not keep in line with pensions and other benefits.  Imagine persons of over 90 years of age, when they get a small increase in pension, being expected to report the fact to the Department and that the Department should therefore reduce the pension. This happens all over the country.  In the case I have in mind, I know very well the money will not be recouped because the individual concerned has not got the money.  The amount involved was £500 overdrawn in pension over the years because the ceiling had not gone up correspondingly.</P>
    <P>There was very little difference between Deputy Faulkner's speech and the Minister's on this subject.  Both of them have their hearts in the right place.  I think everybody, on all sides of the House, wants to see the best being done for these people because they are the backbone of the country. It is a pity that we have, and will have, people who need this type of assistance. I am against giving anything across the board.  I have always said that the only reason for taxation in any country should be to bring the income of the lower group up to a reasonable standard.  I do not believe in taxing people to make the rich richer.  I would like to see the standard of living of ordinary people raised so that they can enjoy themselves and mix with others, as the Parliamentary Secretary has said.  But certain things need to be examined and revised.  I have no doubt but that the present Minister and his Parliamentary Secretary will do so.  It is a pity that we politicians do not admit across the floor to one another: &ldquo;The man before me did a damn good job; I am continuing it&rdquo;.  That is exactly what the Parliamentary Secretary is doing.  There was a standard set.  There were all the things brought in by Fianna Fáil which should be admitted as being good.  I would always be big enough to admit that the other fellow was doing a good job.  Likewise, the same should obtain <i>vice versa</i>&mdash;that the other fellow should admit that a fair job was done, with limited resources, by the people who preceded him.</P>
    <P>I wish the Parliamentary Secretary <Col N="1531" /> well.  I thank him for his courtesy in replying to various queries addressed to him on behalf of my constituents from time to time.  No man has occasion to write to the Department of Social Welfare more than I have because of the people I represent and whom I am proud to represent.</P>
    <P>I am glad to have had the opportunity of pointing out the injustices existing, particularly in respect of the small farmer who is assessed on a valuation basis.  I would ask the Miniter immediately to consider changing that and have some other type of assessment of a man's income.</P>

    <P>I did not intend to intervene in this debate but there are one or two points I should like to bring to the attention of the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Social Welfare.  Nobody appreciates more than I do the work of that Department and I have sympathy for every official from the secretary down to the humblest employee. It is a Department employing between 1,000 and 1,500 people and no matter how we look at it there will be delays.  Some of these may eventually be overcome but in other cases it will take a very long time.  I do not blame the people who work there.  There is one thing which, if it could be done, should be done as soon as possible.  When an application for an old age pension, for instance, is made it goes to the pensions officer and he goes to the applicant and examines the case.  He reports back and then the matter comes to Dublin for recommendation.  If the applicant does not agree it must go before an appeals board to have the case decided, but I am talking of the straightforward cases with no appeals or anything of that kind.  There must be a certain amount of delay because &mdash;I am sorry to say&mdash;the Department is top-heavy.  We have labour exchanges. I think in all 26 counties, and if an officer investigates an old age pension application he knows when reporting whether that person is entitled to the full pension or otherwise. Where a person is entitled to the full pension I think it could be paid straight away, that the report should go to the local labour exchange and that he could then contact Dublin saying: &ldquo;Pay so-and-so; the file is on its way&rdquo;.  That would avoid a hold-up.</P>
    <P>There is a terrible headache in regard to unemployment benefit and nobody feels it more than the officials <Col N="1533" /> of the Department.  Certificates come in with wrong numbers thus causing confusion.  I believe this work could be done locally in the labour exchanges and by decentralising some of the work the Department's work would be made lighter in Dublin and that would speed up a certain number of cases.</P>
    <P>People applying for unemployment assistance for the first time&mdash;I have dealt with some of them myself&mdash; are often held up for two or three months.  I do not blame social welfare officers or the people in the Department but if the social welfare officer made a report to the local exchange manager on the following day saying: &ldquo;I have visited so-and-so.  He is entitled to £3 or £4 or £5&rdquo; as the case might be, this could be paid the following week and the papers could be supplied afterwards.  The man who makes the investigation is a trained and experienced officer and can make a decision there and then. He knows exactly what the person is entitled to.  If that were done it would speed up cases and reduce headaches in the Department.</P>
    <P>People should be continually reminded, whether through the labour exchange or by enclosures with payments, of the importance of using their correct numbers at all times.  A stencil to this effect could be included every month or two with the payments. That would avoid wrong numbering and consequent delay.  The Department are blamed.  I do not blame them: I know what has been happening and I have the greatest respect for the officials who have a very difficult job to do.  They have my sympathy when they are blamed, as they are being blamed in the wrong, when somebody puts in a &ldquo;5&rdquo; instead of a &ldquo;6&rdquo; or misplaces figures.  Where the official dealing with the case knows exactly what a person is entitled to get, I believe that on his report to the local labour exchange manager, that person could be paid the following week or at least within two weeks.  The file could be sent on to Dublin with a statement to the effect that the case had been examined, that the person <Col N="1534" /> was entitled to so much and that payment could be made right away.  I would ask the Parliamentary Secretary to see if this suggestion can be implemented through the labour exchanges. It would remove some heavy work from the Department and the Parliamentary Secretary would be doing a good day's work for himself and the officials if this idea could be put into effect.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasHussey" hpid="Mr. Hussey Mr. Hussey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hussey</NameTxt>
      <P>I shall be very brief. I did not have time to read in full the introductory speech of the Parliamentary Secretary on this Estimate which is one of the most important to come before the House because it deals particularly with the less well-off section of the community, the people we all want to look after and for whom we want to ensure a fair deal, old age pensioners, widows and orphans, deserted wives and children and so on.  They have no trade unions or organisations to speak for them.</P>
      <P>Even though the Estimate has been increased substantially to the figure of £112 million, when you take the rising cost of food and everything else into account there is very little to spare for people who are living on fixed incomes and depending on pensions to keep body and soul together. There is room for improvement here. I had hoped that the schemes could be expanded or developed.  We have not had any new schemes introduced by this Government.  Those operating are schemes introduced by successive Fianna Fáil Governments and they have not been extended.  I am referring to the free electricity and free travel introduced by our party some years ago, which have been a considerable help to old age pensioners. There are many other things which could be done to help those people and to make their burden lighter and I should like to see the Government doing those things.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In every constituency we hear about the delay in paying benefit to people who are entitled to it.  The situation does not seem to be improving.  I cannot understand why people who are entitled to benefit should have to wait up to six months to get it.  This <Col N="1535" /> happens particularly in the case of old age pensioners.  A claim is lodged. The social welfare officer, due to pressure of work perhaps, cannot investigate the claim for two or three months.  Even when he does so and submits the application to the Department it is often two or three months more before it is processed and the pension paid.  This should not be the case in this day and age when we have so many computers and so many excellent workers.  Perhaps the Parliamentary Secretary would devote some of his time to finding a solution to this problem.  It is very disheartening for a person who has reached the pension age and has, perhaps, in order to qualify for that pension, signed over his holding of land or his business, as the case may be, to a son or daughter, to be left penniless for a few months while his claim is being processed.  If this could be done on a regional basis it might cut out some of the delays.  I realise that certain claims require a lot of investigation but the vast majority of old age pension claims are fairly straight forward. I see no reason why those people should have to wait such a long time for payment.</P>
    <P>The same applies to other benefits, such as unemployment assistance. Here again there is a considerable delay.  I notice that when younger men apply for qualification certificates for unemployment assistance the fact that they are living in their parents' home is taken as means and assessed against them.  This is very wrong because in most cases those young men, not of their own choice but because of their obligations to their parents, have stayed at home to look after their parents.  When they apply for unemployment assistance because they are living in their parents' home their means are assessed at £3 or £3.50 per week and their unemployment assistance is reduced accordingly. Some change should be made in that. The fact that they have free board and lodgings in their parents' homes should not militate against them.  The same applies to applicants for unemployment benefit.  In the case of a <Col N="1536" /> small farmer if his means from the farm exceed 50 pence per day unless he has more than 78 stamps for the preceding three years his claim is disallowed.  With costs as they are today it is well time that figure was changed.  The Parliamentary Secretary should look into this urgently because it does not seem to be a realistic figure.</P>
    <P>I believe that not enough assistance is being given by the Department of Social Welfare to voluntary organisations. Those organisations are doing a very good job.  They are bringing meals to old people who are unable to provide them for themselves and they are doing lots of other good work for people in need of help who are unable to get that help from the Department or from any State agency. The Department should come to their assistance more.  They should be given financial assistance to train people. This would help the many people who are unable to do anything for themselves.</P>
    <P>The Department is a very big one and it is scattered very much around the city.  I can well understand the frustration of an old age pensioner or an applicant for some benefit trying to locate a particular section. It is a pity there could not be some central place a person could get in touch with to make inquiries about applications.  When one rings a particular number he is told that an application is being dealt with by some other section.  This presents difficulties for people who are dealing with these things every day, never mind people who are applying for benefit.  We, the TDs, find it difficult at times to get through to the appropriate section and I am sure the general public have the same problem.</P>
    <P>There are many things we would like to see done.  I hope the Government will ensure that people who are in receipt of assistance, old age pensions and widows' pensions, will be looked after and that their rates of pension or benefit will keep in line with rising costs.  The unfortunate thing at the moment is that, due to the inflation which is sweeping the world, people on fixed incomes find <Col N="1537" /> that the benefits given to them are almost eroded before they get them. Even though the Parliamentary Secretary or the Government may boast about the large sum of money made available for these people they still find it very hard to live.  People who have to live on social welfare pensions are not well off.  They are not getting enough money.  I hope in the years ahead the Government will be able to provide more money and will be able to extend the scope of these schemes which were introduced by Fianna Fáil.</P>

      <NameTxt>Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Social Welfare (Mr. Cluskey)</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to thank the House for the way in which they have contributed, in the main, to the debate on the Estimate for the Department of Social Welfare.  It is, as I pointed out in my opening statement to the House, the first opportunity we have had of discussing the Estimate for that Department since the change of Government.  I tried, in presenting the Estimate, to range over many aspects of social welfare and to try to envisage what the development of the Department of Social Welfare should be in the best interests of the people who finance the Department, as they do every other Government Department.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Department of Social Welfare, as I said in my opening remarks, without exception, deal directly with more of our citizens than any other Department and, therefore, their development, effectiveness and efficiency mean more to the ordinary people than some other Departments.  I said I was going to throw out certain thoughts about the development of the Department.  I mentioned that in doing that I would be taking something of a political risk.  At least one political correspondent misunderstood that.  He thought I was getting into an ideological argument.  I had not that in mind when I mentioned the question of political risk.  I meant by political risk that I was raising issues; that, even with the full agreement of the House and the financial resources immediately available, all these developments could not take <Col N="1538" /> place over-night.  They would have to evolve and a very considerable amount of planning, discussion and consultation would be required before the development of the Department which I envisaged could take place.  If those things were now a reality, before they could be brought into being a considerable amount of time would have to pass.  The risk I referred to was one of being told on next year's Estimate, or possibly long before that, that I had committed myself to doing certain things and they had not as yet been achieved.</P>
    <P>I was reminded very much tonight, listening to Deputy Wyse, of the risk I was taking in raising some of these issues.  He was very forceful in his condemnation of the Department, of me and of the Government in general for not having achieved all the reforms possible in social welfare over the last 15 months although the social injustices that remain in the country took quite a considerable time to build up.  That was the risk I was referring to and I suppose that is a risk I will have to run.</P>
    <P>In general I thought it was quite a good discussion.  I would like to pay tribute to Deputy Faulkner in particular for his contribution to the discussion.  One of the areas I dealt with in my opening remarks was the question of poverty.  When we speak of this subject we sometimes wonder why we should speak about it so forcefully.  Why should we speak about it so often and why should we devote so much of our time and attention to this problem?  I think it is necessary to spend so much time on it and to repeat the statements I have made in the past&mdash;and will make in the future&mdash;on the subject because the vast majority of people, not only the Members of the House but the general public, have not got the insight into this problem that Deputy Faulkner obviously has.  I was somewhat surprised at the insight he showed in his contribution on that particular aspect of my speech.</P>
    <P>Although it has been claimed that between 20 to 24 per cent of our people are living in poverty, that figure is not believed by the vast <Col N="1539" /> majority of the people.  I do not think it is believed by a number of Deputies. People have a mental blockage; the facts are so unpleasant and the charges against the rest of us in this society are so serious that I am afraid a lot of us do not want to acknowledge that this problem is of the magnitude it is.</P>
    <P>I was both pleased and encouraged by Deputy Faulkner's contribution. He was concerned that in the programme to discover and combat poverty those involved in the committee set up for the purpose of investigating the problem would be investigating it at a remove.  He said that in London social workers there had gone and lived in the circumtances surrounding poverty for a certain period in order to try to get a better appreciation of the difficulties experienced and the despair suffered by those born and bred and reared in poverty.  He made the very telling point that it is not possible for us who are not condemned to live in these circumstances and see our children having to live in them, without any hope of relief, to fully understand the hopelessness and the despair these people must suffer. Deputy Faulkner made a very valid point and very properly brought this problem to the attention of the House.</P>
    <P>When social workers go in with the best intention of doing good and getting a proper appreciation of the circumstances they know that they can walk out at any time they like.  Any of us can do that.  Living in such circumstances is for us a temporary experience. It is a voluntary exercise on our part and we simply cannot get, with the best will in the world, a proper insight into the real problem.  I was very glad that Deputy Faulkner made this point.  This is an aspect I am sure, that the committee will take into consideration in their investigation. Indeed, very early on in their deliberations the committee agreed that no solution could be imposed unless the people themselves were involved from the beginning right through in solving this problem.  Otherwise no solution <Col N="1540" /> would be successful.  Again, I thank Deputy Faulkner for that particular part of his contribution.</P>
    <P>A number of issues were raised in the course of the debate.  Deputy Wyse spoke about the lack of democracy we were showing in that he made certain suggestions in regard to social welfare on the Bill discussed here some two weeks ago and they were totally disregarded by me in my introductory speech on the Estimate for the Department of Social Welfare.  There may be some confusion in Deputy Wyse's mind on this because the Social Welfare Bill was designed simply to make provision for the implementation of the budget and the Estimate before the House does not take into account moneys provided in that Bill.</P>
    <P>Deputy Wyse also said he was quite convinced that the Estimate speech was ready some two or three weeks ago and that we knew all these things at that time.  In fact the Estimate speech was not finished until quite late the night before I delivered it here.  Since Deputy Wyse has given me this opportunity I should like publicly now to express my sincere thanks to and appreciation of the staff of the Department who were required to work late into the night to ensure Deputies would have available to them copies of the speech while it was in fact being delivered here.  I can assure Deputy Wyse it was not ready two or three weeks ago and I am also sure that many members of the staff in the Department only wish it had been because that would have saved them a great deal of trouble.</P>
    <P>I do not know if many Deputies have a full appreciation of the difficulties experienced in the Department simply because members of the public will not give sufficient information when they make claims.  I am not for one moment suggesting there are not delays.  Deputy Geoghegan, a former Parliamentary Secretary in the Department, pointed out a short while ago, and rightly so, that the vast majority of the claims submitted&mdash;the volume is considerable&mdash;are dealt with quickly and efficiently.  There are delays, but nobody goes to his local TD or councillor if his claim has been <Col N="1541" /> dealt with properly and quickly. People only go when there is delay. The ones public representatives hear about are the ones that go wrong, not the vast majority that go right.</P>
    <P>I have been concerned about this since I went into the Department and any time a complaint reaches my office, be it from a TD, a councillor or a member of the public, about what would seem to be undue delay I have asked for an investigation to be made and a report submitted to me as to why the delay occurred.  I want to put it on the record now that, out of every ten complaints I receive, eight have been directly attributable to the claimants.  Not only have we have been given wrong numbers, which is a very easy thing to do, but I have come across cases where people have submitted wrong names.  I know that sounds ridiculous, but it is true.  People have applied giving a wrong name.  I am not talking about &ldquo;Mary Jane&rdquo; or &ldquo;Mary Anne&rdquo;.  I am talking about a wrong surname.  If the claim does not go through in the normal time a Deputy is contacted.  The only cases Deputies hear about are the ones that go wrong.</P>
    <P>I am not saying that to indicate in any way that I and the officials in the Department are satisfied or happy with the present situation.  Quite frankly, I am not happy about it.  It is true, as has been stated here during the course of the debate, that, if something goes wrong with a claim for social welfare, it can inflict severe hardship on an individual or, indeed, on a whole family.  So long as there is one delay which can inflict that kind of hardship, we would not be justified in allowing that situation to continue.</P>
    <P>I have wondered about this for a considerable period of time and I am convinced that, unless a considerable amount of money is spent on modernising the Department of Social Welfare, it will not be possible to eliminate delays.  The volume of new claims coming into the Department was estimated, approximately 12 months ago, at over 10,000 per week. With the introduction of new schemes such as the lowering of pension age, <Col N="1542" /> or the lowering of the means test limit, the work of the Department is increased very substantially.</P>
    <P>I pointed out in my opening remarks on this Estimate that I was far from satisfied with the working conditions of the staff of the Department of Social Welfare.  They are far from ideal and with the advances made&mdash;and undoubtedly there have been considerable advances in the last two budgets&mdash;the situation is aggravated so far as the working conditions of the staff are concerned.  If that goes on it must, inevitably, affect their efficiency.  Unless we are prepared to spend a considerable amount of money in modernising our methods of handling claims, we will have to live with that problem for some time to come.</P>
    <P>It might be in the best interests of recipients of social welfare to divert money, which possibly could be used to provide new benefits and new schemes, in order to ensure that this standard of efficiency is attained, a standard of efficiency to which our people who are depending on social welfare payments are entitled.  I should like to hear a discussion on the merits or demerits of doing that.</P>
    <P>A number of issues were raised by Deputies and unfortunately some of them were not too well informed about what actually has been going on in the field of social welfare over the past number of years.  We had a statement here tonight by Deputy Hussey to the effect that no new schemes &mdash; a categorical statement: no new schemes&mdash;had been introduced in social welfare since the introduction of free travel and free electricity. How can we hope to have a discussion in the House on the whole range of social welfare administration and developments when we have an elected Member who is so far removed from the realities of the situation that he will make a statement like that?</P>
    <P>I have no objection to Fianna Fáil Deputies pointing out, and rightly pointing out, that considerable advances in many areas were made over the period in which they were responsible for social welfare.  Deputy Wyse had a whole litany of things <Col N="1543" /> which had not been achieved over the past 15 months, as if these things had developed over the past 15 months only, and no one ever heard of these complaints before.  Most of them were due, in fact, to a strict observance by the staff in the Department, and by deciding officers and appeals officers, of legislation framed, introduced and voted through this House by the Fianna Fáil Party with the help of Deputy Wyse.</P>
    <P>I appreciate fully, as I have said on a number of occasions, that there is a tremendous amount of scope in the field of social welfare.  Without wishing to score political points I think it will be generally acknowledged that over the past 16 years &mdash;maybe not that long but undoubtedly over the past eight or ten years &mdash;of Fianna Fáil Party Administration, social welfare was the Cinderella and, when the Minister for Finance was formulating his budget, social welfare requirements came very, very low on his list of priorities.</P>
    <P>I am not saying that purely politically and I am not speculating on it because the figures are there.  We know how much.  It is a matter of public record how much money was allocated and it is not a question of no thought having been put into it or no work being done.  The same people, exactly the same people, are in the Department of Social Welfare as were there under the Fianna Fáil Government.  Therefore, it was not the skill that was lacking or the thought or the know-how.  What was lacking was the political will to do these things.  Something else that was lacking was the sense of urgency to tackle these problems.</P>
    <P>As far as I can gather social welfare did not appear to be a very attractive proposition as far as vote catching was concerned to some Members, obviously the majority, of the Fianna Fáil Party.  Everything else is the same in the Department of Social Welfare as it was when Fianna Fáil were in control and the only thing lacking was the political will to tackle these problems. That lack of political will, that <Col N="1544" /> lack of activity in this area has built up a vast amount of work to be done in that whole field before we can approach what would be to my mind an acceptable social welfare system for this country.</P>
    <P>I tried to outline to some extent what I saw the future holding in the field of social welfare, what I thought should be the developments in that area.  I stated that in order to try and stimulate discussion on what are very vital matters to a very large section of our people.  The number of our people who have absolutely no social security coverage is considerable. As far as the self-employed are concerned it runs somewhere in the neighbourhood of 31 per cent.</P>
    <P>How our social security system is financed is a matter that will have to be looked at very critically.  How we spend the money that is now available to us also has to be looked at very critically because when you have the problems that we have and the limited resources that we have we must ensure that those resources are used to relieve the people who are in real need.  I was encouraged by the debate, particularly by the contribution of Deputy Faulkner, but I do not think the discussion in this area will end here tonight.  Quite a considerable number of people, not Members of this House but people who have shown over the last number of years that they are vitally concerned about some of the social injustices in our society, people who have devoted a considerable amount of their time and undoubted talents with no compensation in a monetary way, will examine certain specific aspects of this whole area of social welfare and social security.</P>
    <P>In my view these people have made a very considerable contribution towards whatever progress we have made up to now.  I believe that the extent of their contribution has been no way exhausted or realised and that they will continue to contribute to the evolution of our social welfare system.  In my view it is necessary not only that we debate these questions in the House but, as elected representatives, that we <Col N="1545" /> stimulate discussion outside the House and create an awareness among all our people that this is our concern, our concern as a society, and that it will require our combined efforts to overcome some of the many social injustices which are present in our society.  If they are ignored or are not properly tackled, they can do tremendous harm to our society as a whole.  That type of discussion has started and it will continue. In my view it will make a very real contribution towards the eventual establishment of a truly comprehensive social security system that will cater for the needs of our people.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to express my gratitude to you, Sir, for allowing me to raise this matter at this time and I am grateful also to the Minister.  I <Col N="1546" /> shall try to be as quick as possible.  I am speaking on behalf of the 200-odd workers employed in this factory.  I appeal to the Minister and to the Government to keep the factory open and to continue efforts in the meantime to dispose of it to a suitable purchaser who will continue the business carried on in the factory.</P>
      <P>At this stage I consider myself obliged to give a brief history of the factory.  This factory was started by a group of members of the Galway Junior Chamber of Commerce who decided, about 1966, to undertake a project which would provide badly needed employment in the town.  A company called Western Holdings Limited was founded with 17 shareholders, each of whom contributed £10. The company was established to carry out a survey of possible industry for the area and, eventually, they recommended that a glass-cutting factory be established.  The shareholders in Western Holdings were invited to become shareholders in the Irish Crystal Glass Company, Galway.  Of those, about 11 accepted the invitation and each took 200 shares in the glass company at 25p each.  Seven of these 11 were appointed directors and they have managed the company since.  They have increased their shareholding in the company, some of them to a substantial extent.</P>
      <P>At this point I wish to declare my personal interest in the company.  I was one of the 17 shareholders in Western Holdings Limited who invested £10. Subsequently I was one of the original 11 shareholders in the glass company who invested £50.  I was not a director and my shareholding remains at 200 shares at 25p each.  My concern here is not for the £50 worth of shares which I hold and which are recognised to be lost anyway, although I am proud to have been associated with the small beginnings of this factory.  My nominal investment was made to help establish an industry in my constituency.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The position is that a receiver was appointed on 9th April, 1974.  To date he has failed to dispose of the factory and recently he issued notice of the termination of employment to workers in the blowing section for Friday, 28th June and for 12th July for workers in <Col N="1547" /> the cutting section and for the management. Yesterday morning I was able to inform the workers action committee that the receiver had agreed to extend the closure date for all workers and management to the 28th July.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>In the event of the receiver not having disposed of the factory before the 28th July I understand that it will close on that date. In the time available to me now I wish to appeal to the Minister and to the Government to save this factory from closure.  I am asking that the State intervene and that the services of Fóir Teoranta be made available to help rescue the company.  The employment in the factory at present is 168 males and 26 females, making a total of 194.  The factory has received IDA grants which have totalled £120,000.  The company produce high quality hand-cut crystal glass.  The sales record of the company, which was established in 1967, has been one of remarkable growth and expansion. In the few months of the existence of the factory in 1967, sales totalled £4,210.  In 1970 the figure increased to £179,866.  In 1973 sales totalled £383,465.  That is a minimum figure. I expect that the audited figure will be higher because there is also a US company involved in selling these products in the States.  Of the goods produced at the factory 70 per cent are exported while 30 per cent are sold on the home market.  As we know, the sales on the home market are to tourists mainly so one could say that the bulk of the goods manufactured in this factory are exported, either directly or indirectly.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In April, 1974, the position was that orders on hand totalled 53,000 pieces of glass.  That is equal to about ten weeks work in the factory and shows that the on-going prospects for the <Col N="1548" /> factory are good.  The product has always sold well.  Its quality was first class and there have never been any complaints in regard to it.</P>
    <P>I should like to quote from a consultant's report, dated March, 1974, which refers to some aspects of the Galway Crystal products and their sale on the US market.  I am quoting from a brochure issued by the receiver.</P>
    <P>A study of this market was carried out by consultants in March 1974.  It concluded that</P>
    <P>1.  Galway Crystal had become an established brand name, so much so that customers were asking for Galway by name.</P>
    <P>2.  The range of products produced by Galway was sufficiently broad.  The design of Galway Crystal was termed distinct, unique, and beautiful, comparable with the highest quality products in lead crystal glassware.</P>
    <P>3.  The quality was rated high...</P>
    <P>It goes on to say that Galway Crystal surpassed other brand names in the opinion of buyers and it continues:</P>
    <P>4.  The US market for cut crystal was growing at 10 per cent-15 per cent p.a. and cut crystal would remain in vogue for the foreseeable future.</P>
    <P>5.  The US operation could triple its sales volumes, from £400,000 to £1,300,000 by 1980 (and double by 1977)....</P>
    <P>Therefore, the consultant's report seemed bright and the prospects for the factory seemed good.  There are other consultants' reports in relation to this factory.  These consultants and the receiver, also, who has been there since April, 1974, have given as their considered opinion&mdash;and they have wide expertise in this field&mdash;that the factory can be made viable economically within a 12-18 month period. At present, as the Minister will appreciate, the investment climate is not conducive to a successful sale but I would emphasise that there is now a great need for State aid to keep the factory open and in operation <Col N="1549" /> until such time as the private investment climate improves.  The total assets of the company are estimated to be £500,000.  If a sale could be concluded now the figure which would be realised would in no way bear any relationship to the real value of the assets of the company.  Therefore, in view of the heavy investment of Irish labour and of Government investment in this factory it would be a great tragedy if the assets should be sold at a cheap rate.  Worse still, we are faced with a threat of closure of this whole plant.</P>
    <P>I should like to quote to the Minister a precedent for a case such as this.  In 1967 a factory in the Galway area, Galway Textile Printers Limited, were in difficulties of a similar nature. Indeed, there were no cheerful forecasts for the future as to their economic viability, but to protect the employment of workers and in the hope that a sale might be concluded successfully at some date in the future, the then Minister for Industry and Commerce, with the sanction of the then Minister for Finance, gave a gurantee that the losses would be met by the State in the order to ensure that the factory would continue in operation and that employment would be maintained.  Looking back we know that that guarantee saved the factory on that occasion.  Recently in this House a Supplementary Estimate was passed involving a sum of £1 million to cover the commitment made to Galway Textile Printers.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanTreacy" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Seán Treacy">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>I hesitate to interrupt the Deputy but I would point out that it is the convention of the House that if at all avoidable we do not refer by name to firms.  I appreciate the point the Deputy is making.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Mr. Molloy Mr. Molloy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>The name of the firm has been quoted already in the newspapers and I consider it necessary to quote it here by way of precedent for what I am asking the Minister to do in relation to the glass company.  I am asking him to do a similar type of rescue operation for the glass company on this occasion as was done in the case of this other factory.  This <Col N="1550" /> debate began earlier than I had expected. I had hoped to have further references in relation to the other factory and to give the Minister some quotes.</P>
      <P>The Minister is probably aware of how the Galway textile factory was saved by the then Minister for Finance.  On behalf of the workers, their families and the people of Galway, I am asking him to rescue the glass factory.  A bright future was forecast for it.  It would be a great tragedy if it was allowed to close down.  The Minister may correct me if I am wrong, but the IDA have been holding back training grants to the amount of £100,000 and also a £15,000 capital grant and the EEC social fund could contribute towards the cost of the training of workers. This is a source of finance which could reduce some of the overheads and keep the factory on its feet.</P>
      <P>The factory has experienced very rapid growth.  The construction of the blowing plant has drawn heavily on its financial resources.  Under-capitalisation has led to the present difficulties, as well as the heavy training period which has had to be undertaken because of the rapid expansion and the increase in the numbers employed. Another factor in relation to the present difficulties was the untimely death of a new director who was appointed in February, 1973.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not want to raise any hackles about this.  I want to make a very sincere plea, on behalf of all the people concerned, to the Minister to help to avoid the closure and to save the jobs which are available.  The men working in the factory are being paid some of the highest wages of any craftsmen in the west.  The factory has been a shining example to other areas in the west as to how they can establish a factory themselves.  It had small beginnings.  It started with a few pounds thrown together by a few of the lads.  I was happy to be one of those.  I got nothing out of it.  I have no interest in it other than the few shares I have already mentioned which are of no consequence to me. I am concerned that 200 men, many of whom are young, married men <Col N="1551" /> with children attending schools and who have settled there and are paying off mortgages and trying to meet the high rise in the cost of living, are now faced with this very bleak prospect in that one of our most successful industries is being allowed to go by the wayside because of possible Government inaction or disinterest.</P>
    <P>I would like an assurance from the Minister that he will take a more serious view of this situation than has been evident up to now.  I understand that Deputy Coogan, who is sitting behind the Minister, visited the factory last week.  Senator M. D. Higgins also visited the factory recently.  A deputation, possibly arranged by one of those men, travelled to Dublin to the Department of Industry and Commerce in the expectation of meeting the Minister to discuss their problems. I am disappointed to say that the two public representatives did not think it worthwhile to accompany the deputation. They were allowed to travel to Dublin without any guidance from any public representative who would have better knowledge of deputations than they would.  They were met by a principal officer of the Department of Industry and Commerce and others.  I do not consider this satisfactory.</P>
    <P>It is not too late to save the day. The fact is that the receiver and those he represents&mdash;the Bank of Ireland, who are heavily involved in the financing of the company&mdash;have agreed to allow an extension of the closure date.  The Minister had nothing to do with it.  This was done with the permission of those whom the receiver represents.  The receiver himself agreed.  Thanks are due to those persons for the few days' grace given up to 28th July.</P>
    <P>Some positive Government action should be taken within the next three weeks.  Leaving it to the very last day is not fair to the workers, the management, Galway or the west.  If the death-wish is going to hang over this factory for the next four weeks many of the workers will avail of whatever opportunity comes their way.  Some of them may emigrate before 28th <Col N="1552" /> July.  Already, because of the possible closure of the factory, some workers have left to find jobs elsewhere.</P>
    <P>If this wonderful craft industry is allowed to close this will be a blow to the confidence of the people in the west.  It will be a great loss.  It is a great revenue earner for this country, as is evident from the sales to the US. The quality of the glass produced in the Galway factory is of the highest standard, in the opinion of the consultant. The buyers in the shops say that it is better than any other crystal glass cut in any part of Ireland.  A wonderful reputation has been built up.  Great care has been taken to build up that reputation.  Because of undercapitalisation following the rapid growth I would expect that the Government would be aware of the facts and would not allow the receiver or any other person to come in and destroy something which has been so carefully built up.  Tears and sweat have gone into the building of this factory.  It started in a small backyard. Recently massive plant has been installed.  The factory is now concerned with the blowing of glass&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>The House will appreciate that I do not come here often appealing to the Government to save industries.  We have not had occasion to do that.  Factories have closed since the Coalition took office last year.  In all these cases I have studied the facts.  I have arrived at what I hope is a responsible decision in each case.  If I felt there was nothing but closure for it I would accept that, even as a member of the Opposition.  I will not make a political football out of a factory which has to close.  This is the first case of this kind which I have brought before the House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am convinced that a great tragedy will take place if some measures are not taken to guarantee the continuation of this factory.  A period of 12 to 18 months with a certain amount of capital investment in certain areas would help.  The workers have promised that they will try to increase production and will apply themselves even more than they have up to now in <Col N="1553" /> order to keep up the high quality and to produce more products.  They are prepared also to make sacrifices. These have been indicated to me and I expect they will be issuing a public statement themselves.</P>
    <P>This matter has been left lie quietly up to now.  The closure that was nearly sprung on us for Friday came as a surprise to most people in Galway. The impression was abroad that the receiver was in a position to sell to a proper client, somebody interested in glass manufacture and glass-cutting who would guarantee the employment of the men and women there.  It was only within the last few days that the workers became aware that the prospect of a sale was nil, and that the other prospect was closure.</P>
    <P>I hope I have given the Minister some idea about the concern in Galway about this matter.  I now make a special appeal to him to offer something in relation to Fóir Teoranta, or a rescue operation.  He should give us a guarantee that the factory will not close on 28th July and that he will do what the Finance Minister did for the textile factory in 1967. Do not close the factory now.</P>

I arranged for them to meet the Minister and I am very pleased to say that they are grateful to him for what they learned.</P>
      <P>I should like to go further.  The dry rot set in when the Deputy was associated with this firm.  The rot did not start at the ground level but at the top.

I will leave it to the Minister to confirm what I have said.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>This is a profoundly serious subject.  For anyone to suggest that it was a matter of recent concern is nonsense.  My personal involvement dates from my campaigning in Galway at the time of the presidential election, which was a year ago.  It has been of continuous and on-going concern to me for that length of time and to my Department and the IDA for a longer period.</P>
      <P>I regret that this subject was raised now.  I do not think it is helpful and the points conveyed by Deputy Molloy are not accurate in a number of ways, and, indeed, damaging in a number of ways.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I want to deal, first, with a form of words which he used towards the end of his speech.  Having foresworn the desire to raise hackles at the beginning, I thought we would get a serious contribution.  Instead we got a distortion of facts, a glossing over of difficulties and ultimately, a pubthumping close which was the exact opposite to any avoidance of hackleraising. The statement that the prospect of a sale is nil is scandalous and irresponsible and contrary to the facts.  It is damaging to on-going <Col N="1555" /> negotiations to utter it in this House or anywhere else at this time.  To make such a statement is an irresponsible and disgraceful thing to do. It may not succeed but the Deputy has not helped it by his escapade tonight.</P>
    <P>I should like to talk a little about the firm's history.  I am being continuously constrained by my desire to avoid damage to the company and guarantee the outcome which, whatever our disagreement about approach, I know Deputy Molloy wants as seriously as I do, and that is that this factory will continue to grow, prosper and make a good product for years to come.</P>
    <P>Deputy Mollow knows as well as I do, or possibly better, that while the details of the early history of the firm are accurate, in September, 1972, an external auditor informed the IDA that he had uncovered serious irregularities in the company's affairs.  Omitting that in the presentation of this success story is irresponsible.  It was precisely at that stage, without my going into details, again for reasons which Deputy Molloy will appreciate, that all grant payments were frozen.  What else can one do in the apportioning of public funds if there is to be accountability? As soon as it was possible to resume detailed negotiations with the firm that was done.  But a significant amount of time at a delicate period was lost not the fault of the workers, and not the fault of any State organisation.  At that very delicate time there was no option but to freeze availability and when that was over there was a resumption of negotiations.</P>
    <P>Again, I do not wish to give detailed figures although they are before me, because they would be unhelpful.  We have had a glowing account of this firm which was described as &ldquo;one of the most successful industries&rdquo; and &ldquo;a shining example&rdquo;.  Deputy Molloy knows there was a profit in 1970 and 1971 but the loss in 1972 amounted to those two profits.  In 1973 there was a considerably larger loss and in 1974 there is a prospect of a larger loss again.  A good prospect, yes; a good <Col N="1556" /> image, yes; good exports, yes; good profits, no.  One cannot continue throwing more and more money down a hole indefinitely if the management is inadequate and the profits are not there.  To talk about the excellence of the products, and the growth of the exports, with which I agree, and not mention mounting losses is again irresponsible because it does not present an accurate picture.  I do not want to go into detail but those are the circumstances.</P>
    <P>Now let us talk about what has happened, because the State has been involved for some considerable time. Deputy Molloy's figures about moneys due are widely inaccurate and wildly inflated.  He will know from his own time in Government that there is an approval of a grant by the Government, if it is above a certain level, otherwise it is approved by the IDA. The moneys are only paid for fixed assets and if the assets are installed. The grant is only due even if it has been approved on what is installed. The amounts payable on fixed asset investment which actually took place were very much smaller than the Deputy indicated.</P>
    <P>I do not want to produce here and now details of sums of money which have been expended by the State; it is enough for me to say that a sum of money five times as large as that due under fixed assets investment was made available very recently as a training grant.  It is sufficient to say that many months ago without the IDA training and fixed asset grants the firm would have closed.  It has been given a considerable lease of life due to the maximum possible effort by the IDA to make moneys available to it.</P>
    <P>Furthermore, the matter of Fóir Teoranta is under continuous examination. There have been very vigorous efforts by the IDA to find someone to take it over as a going concern.  We can only do that, though, if we describe the situation as it actually is and not give it fanciful descriptions of success which are not there. We will have to tell the truth to in-coming purchasers.  Very vigorous <Col N="1557" /> efforts by the IDA are being made to find a purchaser.</P>
    <P>Deputy Molloy knows from his own time in Government that Fóir Teoranta can only become involved if there is a viable proposition, but I can point to the benevolence of Fóir Teoranta and their willingness to participate in a viable proposition, and I can put it on record that they were always anxious for a viable proposition. The IDA are straining every efforts to find a purchaser.  They have paid as much in asset grants as they possibly can and the firm has been kept going considerably longer than would otherwise be the case.</P>
    <P>All those efforts are of very little satisfaction to the workers in Galway &mdash;almost 200 highly skilled people. I sincerely want, as does everyone concerned with this enterprise, a long life, a great reputation, growing production over many decades for this firm, but there has been a difficult time&mdash;not made by explosive growth, so that there was a cash flow shortage&mdash;due to management defects of a serious kind about which Deputy Molloy knows as well as I do.</P>

      <P>For more than a year &mdash;in my own case for a year, in the case of the IDA for more&mdash;we have done everything we can do.  We have retained the possibility of its being bought as a viable going concern by keeping it going so long.  Indeed, to dismiss its staying open until 28th July as &ldquo;a few days&rdquo; grace&rdquo; is a contemptuous dismissal of more than a month.</P>

      <P>It has more than another month of life.  They called it a few days' grace.  That is the sort of distortion, the sort of fishing in troubled waters, the sort of concern not to rescue the jobs but to paint a bogus position of the real state of the company and then to make political capital out of it in an irresponsible way&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>This is all bogus and hypocritical.  If the Deputy had been interested in the jobs of the men he would have shut up.  It was a piece of bogus vote-catching to raise this in this way.  No possible good can come from it.  Harm can come from it. The Deputy is fishing in troubled waters in a hypocritical, vote-catching&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>The difficulties are not of our making.  The fact that the firm is now open is the result of the efforts of my Department and of the IDA.  Every possible avenue is being explored, not without hope, and now we have this very damaging statement that there is no chance of saving it. The situation is under continuous consideration.  If Deputy Molloy and others over whom he may have some influence really want to help, what they should do is quietly to seek for serious participants in the enterprise. They will be welcomed by Fóir Teoranta and by the Department and they will be given every possible help. We are doing everything we can think of&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>We view the closure of this undertaking with great distress but we are hopeful it may not have to happen.  If it does happen it will <Col N="1559" /> be the responsibility of people who did not discharge their duties at a crucial time.  It is not possible to transfer the responsibility on to the State or the workers or any other group. The story is not over.  Very active work is going on and it serves no <Col N="1560" /> purpose at this moment to exhibit these difficulties and this travail in public.  What is needed now is continuing, quiet negotiation.</P>
      <P>The Dáil adjourned at 9.45 p.m. until 3 p.m. on Wednesday, 26th June, 1974.</P>
