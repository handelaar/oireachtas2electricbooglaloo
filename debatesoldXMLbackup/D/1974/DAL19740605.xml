    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>I would refer the Deputy to my reply to his question on 7th May when I pointed out that in the opinion of an expert committee of the World Health Organisation the desirable ratio of dentists to population for any country would be determinable by the local circumstances.</P>
      <P>The number of dentists on the dental register, now 826, is steadily increasing year by year, as is also the number of dentists, at present 155, employed wholetime in the public dental service.</P>
      <P>At present, I intend to continue to promote the recruitment of additional wholetime staff for the public dental service and am considering if further steps should be taken to improve the dental services.  I am keeping the overall position under review.</P>

      <P>Would the Minister agree that the desirable figure laid down by the World Health Organisation is one dentist per 2,000 people? As we are approaching twice that number, in other words, one dentist per 3,650 people, would the Minister not feel it is essential that we should increase, without delay, the number of dentists in this country?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>I would agree that we should do everything we can in order to recruit more dentists.  The Deputy is aware of that, having been told so on another occasion.  There has been a steady increase in the number of dentists over the last eight or nine years.  As far as the World Health Organisation is concerned, the Deputy may be correct but I am not aware that the ratio is one dentist to 2,000 people.  In Ireland it is one dentist to 3,650 people.  It is no consolation to say that we are still better than the UK, Belgium or Austria.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JeremiahCronin" hpid="Mr. Cronin Mr. Cronin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cronin</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Health the number of qualified social workers employed by each health board; and if he will make a statement on the position.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>As at 21st January, 1974, which is the latest date for which the information is available the following numbers of qualified social workers were employed by health boards:</P>
      <P>
        <i>Health Board:</i> Eastern, 16; Midland, 2; Mid Western, 1; North Eastern &mdash;; North Western 8; South Eastern, 3; Southern, 9; Western, 1&mdash;40.</P>
      <P>Forty-five additional posts have been approved by my Department and arrangements for filling vacancies are in train.  In addition, 61 qualified social workers were employed by voluntary agencies as at 21st January, 1974.  These agencies work in close co-operation with health boards on the provision of community care and are subsidised by the boards in respect of services rendered.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The recruitment of social workers has been stimulated by improved <Col N="450" /> salary scales negotiated within the terms of the national pay agreement, and health boards are now having some success in attracting qualified personnel from Britain.</P>
    <P>In addition to normal recruitment, a trainee scheme has been introduced under which health boards are sponsoring candidates who have obtained places on university courses leading to a professional qualification in social work.  As a result of last year's scheme six professionally trained social workers will be available to health boards for at least two years as from October, 1974, while 30 applications are being considered for sponsorship for courses commencing this year.  These trainees can serve either with health boards or certain voluntary agencies following completion of professional training.</P>
    <P>It is intended to continue this sponsorship scheme in future years. In addition a pilot scheme is being introduced this year under which one trainee with a basic degree or diploma in social science will be appointed by each health board in the expectation of sponsorship for professional training in 1975 should they secure places on a course leading to a professional qualification.</P>
    <P>Moreover, the National Social Service Council are offering scholarships to promote the professional training of social workers in the service of voluntary agencies.  Three such scholarships were awarded last year and four are to be offered this year.</P>
    <P>Arrangements are in train also for the provision of refresher courses for senior and supervisory social worker personnel in the service of health boards and voluntary agencies.  The first of three courses will commence next month.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>I presume the Deputy is referring to the provision of suitable day nurseries for children of working mothers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="451" /> Health boards are empowered to pay grants to voluntary agencies towards the costs of day nurseries, and so on, where the need exists and in areas presenting special social problems to provide such centres directly when suitable voluntary bodies for this work cannot be found.</P>
    <P>Additional financial provision was made in the 1973 budget and in the current year's budget towards the development of community services including the provision of day nurseries. A number of new centres have been opened recently throughout the country and reports furnished to my Department by the health boards indicate that further centres are being provided.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Social Welfare why an applicant for a contributory old age pension in Limerick (details supplied), who was notified on 30th October, 1973 that an appeals officer had decided in her favour, has not yet received her pension book; and why his Department has not replied to repeated letters written on her behalf.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrankCluskey" hpid="Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Social Welfare (Mr. Cluskey) Frank Cluskey">
      <NameTxt>Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Social Welfare (Mr. Cluskey)</NameTxt>
      <P>The person referred to in the Deputy's question claimed an old age (contributory) pension in 1971. Her claim was rejected on the ground that she did not satisfy the contribution conditions for a pension and this decision was upheld on appeal.  She subsequently contended that her employment, <Col N="452" /> in respect of which contributions had not been paid, was, in fact, insurable.  On appeal this contention was upheld but only in reference to a limited period.  This is the decision of which notice was issued to her on 30th October, 1973, and which is referred to in the question. The number of contributions available as a result of that decision is, however, insufficient to satisfy the contribution conditions for an old age (contributory) pension.  Inquiries are in progress as to the insurability of her employment during a period before the period covered by that decision, with a view to establishing whether further contributions may be due which would serve to satisfy the contribution conditions.</P>
      <P>She has corresponded with my Department through her solicitors, who have been made aware of the position at each stage, but recent correspondence was acknowledged only, a reply being deferred in the hope that the inquiries referred to would be completed quickly thus enabling a definite reply to be issued.  I have arranged that she be informed fully of the present position in the matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Parliamentary Secretary agree that this lady was informed on 30th October last that her appeal was allowed?  She was not told any more at that time but that her appeal was allowed.  Notwithstanding that, she was unable to get any pension or any reason why she should not get a pension until I put down this question and got this answer today.  Does the Parliamentary Secretary feel that this is good enough?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrankCluskey" hpid="Mr. Cluskey Mr. Cluskey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cluskey</NameTxt>
      <P>My information is that the lady was informed on 30th October that her appeal was allowed covering the period back to 1962, but, although she had qualified in that respect from the point of view of the stamps with which she was accredited, due to the holding of that appeal, she did not qualify by virtue of the fact that she had not got sufficient contributions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With regard to correspondence, there have been letters from the <Col N="453" /> lady's solicitor since 1971 and all the points raised in the first eight letters have been dealt with.  The most recent letter of 11th March last was acknowledged and that of the 3rd May, 1974, led to further investigation with a view to finding out whether any evidence could be made available as to the extent and insurability of her employment prior to 1962.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Parliamentary Secretary aware that this lady, who was subsequently found by an appeals officer of his Department to have been in insurable employment since 1962 was, in fact, employed by the Department of Social Welfare?</P>

    <Speaker pid="FrankCluskey" hpid="Mr. Cluskey Mr. Cluskey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cluskey</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Parliamentary Secretary not find it very discouraging that this lady, whom an appeals officer found had been in insurable employment for nine years, did not have her cards stamped by her employers who were, in fact, the Department of Social Welfare?</P>

    <Speaker pid="FrankCluskey" hpid="Mr. Cluskey Mr. Cluskey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cluskey</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrankCluskey" hpid="Mr. Cluskey Mr. Cluskey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cluskey</NameTxt>
      <P>Title to unemployment benefit is a matter for determination by a statutory deciding officer or appeals officer who must be satisfied before benefit is paid that a claimant fulfils the conditions and is free from the disqualifications laid down by law for the receipt of such benefit.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>To this end, certain inquiries are necessary in connection with all claims.  In the vast bulk of cases decisions are given without delay.  In some cases, however, more prolonged inquiries are necessary either by correspondence or by a member of the Department's outdoor staff&mdash;perhaps by both&mdash;and a certain amount of unavoidable delay may occur.  If delay <Col N="455" /> appears likely in deciding the claim to benefit it is the practice to pay unemployment assistance in the interim where there is title to it, as is often the case.</P>
    <P>I am not aware that there are long delays in the payment of unemployment benefit claims generally and it is my constant concern to have claims processed as quickly as possible. If the Deputy has information of long delays in particular cases and furnishes the details I shall be glad to have the cases investigated immediately.</P>

But <Col N="459" /> one of their duties is to provide security, in aid of the civil power, in aid of the Garda, under the 1954 Act. The claims made on the forces in this regard vary from day to day according as the situation varies.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="460" /> On 27th May, 1974, I received an application from Limerick Corporation for a provisional order extending the city boundary into Counties Clare and Limerick.  The legislation governing extensions of the boundary provides that after holding a public inquiry into the application and after considering any representations made by the county councils concerned in the application I may either make a provisional order giving effect to the extension with or without such modifications as I think proper or I may refuse the application.  A provisional order does not have effect unless it is confirmed by an Act of the Oireachtas.  In view of my statutory functions as outlined it would be inappropriate for me to comment on the application.</P>

Some road authorities were paid more in 1973-74 than the amounts allocated to them because they had completed road works qualifying for grant payments.</P>
      <P>The reasons why the expenditure by Cork County Council was less than the amount allocated are attributable mainly to delays in land acquisition. Industrial action was to some extent responsible for delays in completing particular road schemes.  When these schemes are completed by the council, payment of grants will be made in the ordinary way.</P>
      <P>I would repeat that the Road Fund allocation to Cork County Council for the nine months to 31st December, 1974 is £1,106,220 which is equivalent to £1.475 million on a twelve months basis compared with a total amount of grants paid to the council in 1973-74 of £1.22 million.  This allows for a substantial increase in the rate of expenditure in the current year.</P>

To go back to the question, whatever way he puts it, the plain facts are that the money allocated to Cork County Council and carried over to this financial year has gone to other counties and is being spent there.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Local Government if he will outline the progress made since the conference of May, 1965 on the achievement of a rational distribution of the working population, of investment and of land use on a regional basis consistent with the fullest possible exploitation of human, material and financial resources and the production of a satisfactory environment.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy does not indicate to which conference he is referring.  There was a regional planning conference held under the auspices of An Foras Forbartha in May, 1965, which reviewed problems of regional planning in various countries and this may be what the Deputy has in mind.  Such conferences are held from time to time to facilitate discussion and thought on the subjects examined.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As to the question of regional development, general Government policy seeks to secure a reasonable distribution of population and the spread of social and economic opportunities through all regions of the country.  The aim is to promote development in underdeveloped areas and to create jobs locally so as to minimise <Col N="469" /> population dislocation by internal migration or by emigration abroad.  While there has been an overall increase in population of 5.7 per cent between 1961 and 1971, there are still regional imbalances to be corrected.</P>
    <P>The capital provision for the infrastructure necessary for a wide range of development has been very substantially increased.  In planning and development account is being taken of the need to use the country's resources to the best possible advantage and of the need to protect the environment and to create satisfactory conditions for living and working, and at the same time every encouragement is being afforded to facilitate the housing of people in their own areas.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. R. Ryan)</NameTxt>
      <P>There is no evidence of any lack of confidence in investment either in the public or private sectors. On the contrary, Government loans and savings schemes are attracting higher investment than at this stage last year and recent reliable guides on investment in the private sector forecast higher investment in business and industry.</P>
      <P>The amount invested in ACC deposit accounts from 1st January to 30th April, 1974, was below the figure for the corresponding period in 1973.  Such deposits fluctuate, however, for a variety of reasons from month to month and receipts to date do not necessarily reflect receipts for the year as a whole.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>No.  The ACC do not require that the person making the application should have a deposit but they would naturally look favourably upon people who, when they had money, deposited it with the ACC.

      <P>Due to the uncertainty about movements in petroleum prices throughout 1974 it is extremely difficult to forecast the effect of the increase in these prices on the balance of payments for the year.  However, if petroleum prices in 1974 remain at the level announced at the end of 1973 the balance of payments deficit on current account would be raised by approximately £100 million.  This should be offset to a large extent by capital inflows and any call on external <Col N="476" /> reserves, which are in any case at a high level, should be small.</P>

      <P>I move: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When I took office I was very conscious that there was and that there had been for some time a persistent demand for changes in the Adoption Acts.  I knew that my predecessor had announced his agreement with the need for change.  As time permitted, I studied the representations that had been made and that continued to be made and I consulted the Adoption Board, the adoption societies and individual social workers.  I say &ldquo;as time permitted&rdquo; for Deputies will, I am sure, appreciate that over the last year a great number of urgent matters have made demands on my time.  I am glad, however, to be able to come before the House now with the present Bill which is the result of my study and which fairly represents the consensus of the views I listened to on the subject.  I do not expect that this Bill will satisfy all the critics of the present law nor do I believe that <Col N="481" /> it is necessarily the last Bill that will be introduced in relation to adoption.</P>
    <P>I think that it is well to make the point during the debate on this Bill that adoption in our law is a voluntary arrangement which is, so to speak, ratified by An Bord Uchtála, the effect of the ratification being that the legal relationship of the child to the other parties is changed.  The board's function is not to settle disputes as to custody but only to ensure that the adoption is in accordance with the Acts and that the adopters are suitable.</P>
    <P>It would almost certainly be contrary to the Constitution to purport to confer on An Board Uchtála power to resolve disputes as to custody.  Moreover, any changes in the Adoption Acts that would be likely to increase the risk of disputes in regard to the making of adoption orders would be undesirable since public confidence in the system could thereby very easily be shaken.  In this connection I might say that over 20,000 adoption orders have so far been made and there have been no more than three or four cases when the action of the board has been challenged.  This is a good record and we must be careful to ensure that it is maintained.  As I have said elsewhere, it is a distinct advantage that we have been able to establish and maintain a system whereby all adoption orders are made by a single board rather than by a multiplicity of courts or boards as in most countries.  However, the strain on the members who, apart from the chairman serve on a voluntary, unpaid basis, is considerable, and we are all much beholden to them.  It is not generally realised that members meet three or four times in the week or that they can be called on at short notice to travel to provincial venues.  I am glad to have this opportunity of paying tribute to them for too often they have to suffer inaccurate criticism from persons on the fringe of adoption work who have not a full realisation of the complexities of the subject.  The proposal in the Bill for the appointment of a deputy chairman is intended to relieve the chairman of the necessity of having to be present at all meetings. This will give him more time for <Col N="482" /> administrative and research work.</P>
    <P>The criticisms of the present law deal, largely, with the following points:&mdash;</P>
    <P>(a)  limitation on adoption arising out of the religion of the parties;</P>
    <P>(b)  withholding or withdrawing consent by the mother raising the question of a time limit on consents;</P>
    <P>(c)  the low upper limit (seven years) on the age of a child eligible to be placed for adoption;</P>
    <P>(d)  the standards applied by adoption societies;</P>
    <P>(e)  private placements;</P>
    <P>(f)  the lack of provision for adopting a child who is neither illegitimate nor an orphan.</P>
    <P>The Bill obviously does not go as far as some people would wish in dealing with the problem of the mother who withdraws her consent to her child's adoption or who withholds her consent even when she has parted with the child, perhaps for a considerable period.  I am of opinion and have so provided in the Bill that this problem, involving as it does a question of custody, should be dealt with in the High Court and not by the board.  In the case, therefore, of a procrastinating or indecisive mother, the adoptive parents may seek an order for the custody of the child and, if granted to them, the board may then make an adoption order on foot of it and notwithstanding the refusal or failure of the mother to make up her mind.</P>
    <P>It will, of course, be necessary to consider whether rules of court can be devised to enable such applications to be heard in such a way as to preserve the anonymity of the parties. This is a difficult area because it is full of emotion involving the dilemma which must face every mother who considers adoption for her child.  This provision seeks to resolve this dilemma in favour of the child and I am satisfied this is the correct approach in spite of the apparent harsh overriding of the mother's instinctive doubts. Family courts would be the ideal tribunal for such applications, but until we have such an institution, the <Col N="483" /> High Court appears to be the most appropriate forum.  I think it would be unsafe to go further than this, for example, by laying down absolute time limits, not least because to do so could, in some cases, have the effect of frightening off the mother from allowing her child to be placed with a family at all.</P>
    <P>The Bill provides that a consent to adoption may be given at any time after the child has reached the age of six weeks instead of the age of six months as is the case now.  There may be some misgivings about this since in some cases the mother's capacity to give a fully rational decision so soon after the birth might be in doubt, but the prevailing view in adoption circles favours this change.  Indeed, it is contended that in most cases the mother in the months prior to the birth will have been giving thoughts to the idea of adoption.  Again, looking at the problem from the point of view of the child, and I submit this is the right perspective, it is common case that the earlier a child can be placed, the better.  In any event the mother will still have the right to withdraw her consent at any time before the making of the adoption order.</P>
    <P>Perhaps the most widespread criticism of the present law was focused on the provision that, with relatively minor exceptions, required all parties to an adoption to be of the same religion.  As I had told a conference of adoption workers in Limerick some weeks ago I had prepared a provision that would have met this criticism and, which, incidentally, would have covered the case that was before the High Court recently.  This Bill was actually first ordered for the day on which the High Court judgment was pronounced, but it had to be withdrawn to enable the relevant provision to be redrafted in the light of the judgment.</P>
    <P>The High Court decision has, in effect, swept away the provision in the Act completely.  The Bill proposes formally to repeal the provision but it introduces the safeguard that a person whose consent is required to the making of an adoption order must know the religion of the adopter or <Col N="484" /> adopters at the time his consent is given in cases where the parties are not all of the same religion.  Section 3 as drafted might appear to go further than this and I will be proposing an amendment on Committee Stage to make it clear that it is only in cases where the adoptive parents and the child and its mother are not all of the same religion that the mother will be informed of the religion of each of the adoptive parents at the time she gives her consent.</P>
    <P>This requirement might appear to some as having the effect of inhibiting placements with couples of differing religions by drawing the difference to the attention of the mother.  It could also be objected to as allowing the mother something she has never had, an exclusion basic to adoption principles, that is an influence, though slight, in the choice of adoptive parents.  The contrary view is that if this requirement were not present a mother would never know whether her child was in a mixed marriage or not and this could have two effects.  It could inhibit mothers from placing children at all where they might have conscientious objection to placement in a mixed marriage or where a mother did consent it could lead to problems of scruples in later years for the mother.  I will be glad to have the views and assistance of Deputies on this point.</P>
    <P>Experience in the 21 years since the original Act came into force has thrown up cases, such as the case that resulted in the recent High Court judgment, where it was clearly anomalous and unfair that there could not be an adoption.  These cases have been rare and unusual, however.  The criticism levelled at the Acts in this connection has usually related to the fact that a married couple of different religions could not adopt.  But this, in itself, did not represent a problem in so far as the welfare of the children was concerned, since there are always far more would-be adopters than children available for adoption.  It could be then, that some modification of the present law in this regard might have served to eliminate the anomalous <Col N="485" /> situations and be in conformity with the Constitution.  The Government, however, have decided to accept the situation as it now is following the High Court judgment.</P>
    <P>It has been contended on many occasions that abandoned or neglected children whose parents are living should be capable of being adopted.  It is difficult to answer the criticism that an abandoned or neglected child is better in a new home than in an institution neglected by its natural parents.  I sympathise completely with the humanity of that plea.  I am advised, however, that the inalienable and imprescriptible rights guaranteed to the family by the Constitution make it impossible to extend the benefits of adoption to legitimate children whose parents are still living.  While these children cannot be legally adopted it is true that people do take them into their homes and rear them as their own in the knowledge that the natural parents may sooner or later come to claim them.  Of course, under our law, they can only successfully claim them if it is for the child's welfare that it be returned to its natural parents.  If the contrary should be the case, the foster parents may seek to retain the custody of the child under the Guardianship of Infants Act which prescribes that the child's welfare shall be paramount.  This would not have all the legal consequences of adoption but nevertheless would secure the wellbeing of the neglected or abandoned child.  The Constitution in conferring inalienable rights and duties on the natural parents in a family has drawn a line in respect of permanent severance of those rights to the extent that it does not permit the extinguishment of those rights and duties in any formal way such as by an adoption order.  This is an important principle and one whose validity is not necessarily impugned by the occurrence of some cases where parents quite clearly cannot or do not wish to exercise those duties.</P>
    <P>One of the most frequent criticisms of the Adoption Acts in recent times is that they have no provision enabling the board to make &ldquo;regulations&rdquo; providing for &ldquo;standards&rdquo; to be followed <Col N="486" /> by adoption societies.  This criticism discounts the fact that the board's powers in relation to societies are very wide in as much as, under section 37 of the 1952 Act, the board may cancel the registration of any society if satisfied that it is not competent to discharge the obligations imposed on it under the Act or if it appears to the board that the requirements of the Act are not being adequately complied with by it or if anybody engaged in its management or control, or engaged in adoption work on its behalf, is not a fit and proper person so to act.  In this connection it is essential to distinguish between procedure and standards.  Guidelines have been laid down by the Adoption Board as regards pre-placement examination, post-placement inspection, medical examination and so on.  What legislation cannot do is to ensure standards.  The law cannot prescribe the level of efficiency at which any individual operates anymore than it can prescribe the adequacy of parents in looking after their children.  I have discussed this matter with the Adoption Board and they have told me firmly that they do not need or want the power to make regulations binding on adoption societies.  I must accept that advice.</P>
    <P>It is well recognised that placements by private persons are in principle unsatisfactory and ought to be discouraged.  Adoption societies exercise great care in selecting adopters.  They keep in touch with the board and they develop an expertise.  Even the best motivated and most careful layman is unlikely to be as competent as a society.  In any case private placements are usually made in the interests of the mother or of the adopters and only secondarily in the interests of the child.  I consider that private placements should be made by the parent of the child, who would usually be the mother, or unless the placement is with a relative of the child.</P>
    <P>As I have already mentioned, section 2 of the Bill proposes that the consent of the child's mother or guardian or any person having charge or control over the child to the making <Col N="487" /> of an adoption order shall not be necessary where custody of the child has been awarded to any person by the High Court, though it is not proposed to repeal the provision that where a person is a ward of court the consent shall not be dispensed with save with the sanction of the court.</P>
    <P>Section 3 of the Bill provides that an adoption order shall not be made unless every person whose consent is necessary to the making of the order knows the religion, if any, of the applicant or of each of the applicants when he gives his consent.</P>
    <P>Section 4 provides that, in addition to existing restrictions on the making of arrangements for adoption contained in section 34 of the 1952 Act, private placements made otherwise than direct by the child's parent or parents will be unlawful unless the placement is with a relative of the child.</P>
    <P>Section 5 provides for the appointment of a deputy chairman to the board who may act for the chairman in the latter's absence.  At present whenever the chairman is unable to act it is necessary for the Government to formally appoint an acting chairman.</P>
    <P>Section 15 of the Adoption Act, 1952, provides that a consent shall not be valid unless it is given after the child has attained the age of six months and not earlier than three months before the application for the adoption order.  Section 6 of the Bill provides for the reduction of this period to six weeks.  This does not affect the right of the mother to withdraw her consent at any time before the making of the adoption order. Section 15 of the 1952 Act further provides that if the mother of an illegitimate child changes her religion either during the 12 months before the birth or within 12 months afterwards, her consent to the adoption of the child may not be given for 12 months after the change of religion or 12 months after the child's birth whichever is the later.  It is not proposed that this provision be re-enacted.</P>
    <P>Section 7 proposes to empower the board to prescribe that a child must <Col N="488" /> be in the care of the applicants for an adoption order for a specified period before an adoption order can be made. It also provides that the board may, having regard to the particular circumstances of the case, make an adoption order in respect of a child notwithstanding that the child has not been in the care of the applicants for the period prescribed.  It has been the board's practice to insist that a child be in the care of the adopters for a probationary period before an adoption order is made.  It is recognised that, generally speaking, a period of at least six months is needed for all concerned to assess whether the adoption is likely to be a success.  The proposal is to give the board power to prescribe a probationary period.</P>
    <P>Section 8 provides that the entry in the Adopted Children Register shall be in the form provided for in section 22 of the 1952 Act and set out in the Second Schedule to that Act or in such other form as may be approved from time to time by the Minister for Justice with the consent of the Minister for Health and shall contain the particulars required by such form. This technical provision has been included at the request of the Minister for Health.</P>
    <P>Section 9 provides that where the board is satisfied that in the particular circumstances of the case it is desirable to do so, it may make an adoption order in respect of a child who was more than seven years of age at the date of the application for the order.  It is recognised that the younger a child is when placed for adoption the better the prospects are for integration in the adoptive family. Nevertheless, situations could possibly arise where it would be desirable to make an adoption order when a child is more than seven years of age.  The board have asked for this power.</P>
    <P>Section 10 provides for the payment of remuneration to the deputy chairman when he is acting as chairman.</P>
    <P>Section 11 and the Schedule to the Bill provide for the repeal of certain provisions in the Principal Act and in the 1964 Act.  Section 12 of the Principal Act and section 6 of the 1964 <Col N="489" /> Act are the sections relating to religion.</P>
    <P>Section 16 of the Principal Act sets out the persons entitled to be heard by the board before the board decide on an application for an adoption order. One of the persons listed is a priest or minister of a religion &ldquo;recognised by the Constitution&rdquo;.  This phrase has been rendered meaningless by the referendum which removed subsections 2 and 3 of Article 44 from the Constitution.  I consider, however, that the phrase should be formally deleted from the Act.  The other repeals are consequential.</P>
    <P>I should like to say that my study of adoption laws convinced me of the vital necessity for adoption societies to maintain high standards and to employ expert personnel.  Societies are responsible for 80 per cent of all placements and their work is highly specialised and delicate.  I should like to pay a tribute to the societies, big and small, who have done great work down the years without any State subvention. Some of them have highly professional personnel and have always maintained standards beyond any that could properly be insisted on by the board or by any other public agency, indeed to the extent of causing disappointment to many would-be adopters by the care they take to select for the children entrusted to them the most suitable homes from among the many available. Early in my term of office I realised that the societies were in need of such a subvention and I very easily persuaded my colleague, the Minister for Finance, to provide me with the resources to make an annual grant to any society that made a case for it.  My basic aim is to enable the societies to employ professional social workers on a more extensive scale than they have hitherto been in a position to do.</P>
    <P>Finally, let me return again to a point I mentioned earlier, namely, research in the field of adoption. Regrettably there has been little or no research in the field in this country despite the advantages for the purpose afforded by our centralised system.  Now that our system has <Col N="490" /> attained its majority it is appropriate that research should be undertaken to establish its particular strengths or weaknesses as well, of course, as the strengths and weaknesses of adoption in general.  It is my intention to encourage such research and I shall be prepared to seek any necessary financial backing for suitable projects.</P>
    <P>I commend the Bill to the House and I look forward to a constructive debate on a highly important and sensitive subject which is, I believe, entirely non-political.  I shall consider carefully all ideas and suggestions that Deputies put forward.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DavidAndrews" hpid="Mr. Andrews Mr. Andrews">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Andrews</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister has called, and rightly so, for a constructive debate on this worthwhile but extremely sensitive subject.  I trust that from this side of the House the Minister will hear constructive arguments and suggestions which we shall be putting forward for his consideration.</P>
      <P>We accept the Bill in principle.  Its purpose is to eliminate what can be described as anomalies in the field of adoption.  The Minister has paid tribute to the Adoption Board and to the various adoption agencies and societies that have been engaged in this work since the enacting of the 1952 legislation.  We in this party join with the Minister in that tribute.  So far as I am aware the chairman of the Adoption Board is the only person on the board who receives remuneration.  The six ordinary members work on a voluntary basis.  All of them deserve the utmost credit.</P>
      <P>As the Minister has said, the agencies have done very good work within the structures that we have laid down for them.  Therefore, any criticism we would make might be regarded as a reflection on ourselves as legislators.  In a way it might be described as inverted criticism.</P>
      <P>The 1952 Adoption Act was the founding Act in this country.  In England and Wales adoption was introduced in 1926 and in Northern Ireland in 1929.  It was introduced in Scotland in 1930.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Since the introduction of the 1952 <Col N="491" /> Act there have been many placements of children.  A figure of 20,000 has been mentioned here in this regard and we are being asked now, 22 years after the enacting of the founding legislation, to have another look at this subject.  All Deputies in the House should endeavour to make some contribution to this debate.  We are legislating here for children, for those who cannot legislate for themselves and who must &ldquo;suffer&rdquo; any legislation that we may enact here on their behalf.  That is why I agree with the Minister when he says that this legislation is of a very sensitive nature.</P>
    <P>Apparently there are some 18 or 20 adoption societies in existence. The Minister has indicated his willingness to accept the possibility of research into the whole subject.  No doubt he is aware that there is being conducted a survey of this nature by the social studies department of TCD.  My information is that the findings will be published within the next month or so.  It was my pleasure and honour to speak to some of the people employed in the survey in that particular college, a constituent college of the National University of Ireland.  The assistance I received from these people in an area of which I did not have very much knowledge before the Minister presented the Bill to the House has been invaluable. I would like to thank them for the time they gave me in formulating what can be described as a contribution to this House.</P>
    <P>The Minister received a copy of the treatise or pamphlet prepared in Trinity College, Dublin.  If possible, I am sure he will give them financial assistance.  There may be a regulation which prevents him from doing so. However, this is now on the record of the House and I look forward to the publication of the document on adoption in Ireland.</P>
    <P>People have various reasons for adopting.  The 1964 Act introduced a number of amendments to fill the gaps in the Principal Act of 1952.  It has been suggested that the 1952 Act was too mother-centred.  We should be <Col N="492" /> thinking of Adoption Acts in terms of children.  These Acts should become more child-centred.  We agree with that.  I do not apologise to the House for using these clichés to express what I am trying to get across.  We believe that the whole area of adoption should be centred around the child.  It is important that the position of adopting parents should be taken into consideration.  We are dealing with children, newly born, who cannot look after themselves.  We are dealing with human beings and placing them in adoptive families.  From that moment the child becomes a third element in a childless home.  Therefore, we must consider any legislation relating to adoption which is introduced here in the context of the child.  &ldquo;Child centred&rdquo; is a good expression.  Although it is a cliché I use it without apology.</P>
    <P>At the beginning of a debate of this kind, it is helpful to set out the motivating factors why couples wish to adopt a child.  They may be unable to have children of their own.  They may want companionship for a single child.  They may want a child to take the place of a baby who has died.  If they have children of their own, they may feel that their home is good enough to bring in another child.  The child may be related to the adoptive parents.  It is not unknown for parents to adopt a first, second and third child.  Parents who adopt children are good people.  Arising out of the motivating factors I have outlined, the people are fulfilling a need.  They are providing a service to the community by adopting a child who, through no fault of its own, its natural mother wishes to have adopted.  Then we have a couple who are willing to take on the future of this child.  This is a very big responsibility.  These are some of the motivating factors in adopting children.</P>
    <P>As the Minister said, this is an extremely sensitive area.  Motivating factors can be of a very sensitive and, in some instances, delicate nature. This Bill gives us an opportunity to re-examine the whole area of adoption. Anything we on this side of the House say will be said in a constructive <Col N="493" /> manner.  It will not be done by way of carping criticism of adoption societies or of the Adoption Board. Quite the contrary.</P>
    <P>Having discussed the whole area of adoption with members of adoption societies&mdash;I did not have an opportunity, unfortunately, of speaking to a member of the Adoption Board&mdash; adoptive parents and a natural mother of an adopted child, one gets a feeling for the subject and an awareness of the lacks which exist within the existing framework.  One matter which kept recurring, particularly in relation to the home or the couple who take on the child, was the assessment of the adopting couple before the child is given by qualified professional workers. The word &ldquo;assessment&rdquo; came through all my discussions with these people, assessment of the couple before the child is placed.  Assessment of the couple by a qualified trained person.</P>
    <P>Only a qualified person can do this very important job.  The Minister has properly said that he will give financial assistance to adoption societies who employ these qualified people. This is a very specialised field.  The only people who can deal with the placement of children are these specialists in the field of adoption, specialists in that one field and that one field only.  That is how important we on this side of the House consider the area of adoption.  That is why we are laying such emphasis on the type of person to assess the couple.</P>
    <P>This can be an extremely anxious time for the couple who intend to adopt.  If one sends in, through no fault of his own, a poorly-educated social worker in the field of adoption, there are sensitivities which can be hurt.  There are things which can be said, or left unsaid, which can hurt the adopting parents.  That is why we stress the need for highly qualified personnel in the field of adoption.</P>
    <P>The qualified professional worker would go into the home of the intending adopting couple on a number of occasions before the actual placement. When the child is given over for a six-month period before the matter comes to the attention of the board <Col N="494" /> the professional worker should again go to work to see how the child is getting on and how the adopting parents are reacting to the child.  The parents should be seen together and separately in their home by the professional worker.  Reaction to the child should be examined.  This is very important.  During the phase in which the proposed adopting parents are being assessed by the professional worker and before they actually take on the child&mdash;and in this I am not sure whether I am using the correct expression and one must be careful of the terminology used&mdash;and in the probationary period, which is a waiting period of six months, there is always the possibility that the natural parent could rescind on her decision to have the child adopted.  This is a very difficult period for the intending parents.  I may be corrected on that particular point.  If that happens I will stand corrected.</P>
    <P>After the board make the adoption order absolute, there should be a follow-up period in which a highly qualified professional worker visits the home over a period of years to see the child and the adoptive parents.  There should be total standardisation of procedures in this respect.</P>
    <P>Having dealt with the care of the child, which is of paramount importance and should be given the highest priority in the whole scheme, we now come to the position of the natural mother.  The natural mother gives birth to the illegitimate child. She is entitled to as much professional advice and assistance as she can get. The medical personnel and other professional people with whom she deals in the course of her pregnancy will be found to be extremely kind and generous in their attention to the unfortunate girl.  That may be the wrong expression, but the girl finds herself in the dilemma of becoming an unmarried mother.  These people are kind in every respect but kindness is one thing and highly specialised advice is another.  We believe that during the course of her pregnancy this unfortunate girl is entitled to the best possible advice, through State <Col N="495" /> agencies.  Basically, when a woman finds herself pregnant and becoming an unmarried mother she is in a state of emotional washout.  It is difficult for a male to understand the feelings of a woman who finds herself in that position.  She is probably in a very emotional state at such a dreadful time.  These professional services should be at her disposal and their availability known to her.</P>
    <P>There is probably much more to be said about the child and the mother in such circumstances.  My intention is to express further views on the matter of professional services and the type of assistance that should be given at a later stage in the discussion on this Bill.  There are Catholic adoption agencies and Protestant adoption agencies.  It is now the Minister's intention that third party agencies should be dispensed with except in the instance outlined in the proposed new section 4 of the Bill before us.  We accept what the Minister has said here. Private adoptions do not have the benefit of scrutiny.  In the main they do not have the benefit of the experience of people who know something about adoption.  That is why we agree with the Minister that third party adoptions should be dispensed with and become illegal.</P>
    <P>The Minister provides sanctions for contravening the laws that will come into existence.  We agree with this matter.  In June, 1972, the then Minister for Justice, Deputy O'Malley, said in the Seanad that he intended to deal with this whole area of adoption and that he would get down basically to the type of Bill which the Minister has before the House at the moment. It is not for that reason we welcome the Bill.  We welcome the Bill on its merits.  We welcome it because it is a good Bill in law.</P>
    <P>I would like to deal with a number of other problems which may prove difficult in practice while they may appear satisfactory on paper.  When it comes to the practice of the law in this regard we may find ourselves in difficulty.  We will deal with that later on.  The Minister said that he <Col N="496" /> would assist agencies wishing to employ the highly qualified staff that are envisaged.  In 1972 there were 12 full-time and 21 part-time unqualified workers employed in 16 societies.  The total number of staff employed by the 16 societies was as follows: professional trained social workers&mdash;full-time four, part-time seven; basic grade workers&mdash;full-time 10, part-time 13; untrained workers&mdash;full-time 12, part-time 21.  Of the personnel employed in adoption work 50 per cent have no training in social work, although some of these have other training which could possibly be relevant. The real need for highly trained professional people exists.  There is a sense of urgency about it.  This is not in any way to under-rate the work being done by adopting societies as they exist at the moment.  I do not wish to be critical of these people.  In the main they have worked well in this field since 1952.</P>
    <P>A person like myself is not competent to discuss the whole area of adoption with any great authority but, like other Deputies, I can bring my own particular experience and knowledge to bear.  We cannot be expected to know everything about the people who actually work on the ground, as it were, in the field of adoption but, having listened to the views and opinions of those involved at all levels in this work, we are entitled to form our own opinions and views and throw them out here for purposes of discussion.  We will hope to do that as constructively as possible.  We have no intention of engaging in carping criticism.</P>
    <P>I have paid tribute and now I think I am entitled to produce my own views and to give some facts and figures in support of those views. Deputies will have received a memorandum from CARE.  I should like to pay tribute here to the work being done by this organisation and to the research they have carried out in the whole field of adoption.  Chapter 9, under the heading of &ldquo;Substitute Families&rdquo; deals with adoption.  In the year 1956 there were 565 adoptions. In 1964 there were 1,003 adoptions. In 1967 there were 1,493 adoptions. Up to recently there was a feeling on <Col N="497" /> the part of some people that there was a sort of stigma attaching to adoption. I believe we are now beginning to throw off this feeling.  There is also a stupid myth that one can bring bad blood into a family through adoption. One can do no such thing.  All this is utter nonsense.  All one does in adoption is to take a child and rear it in a decent environment so that the child will develop on normal lines.  If we do nothing more here than get rid forever of the kind of mentality to which I referred a moment ago, we will be doing a darned good day's work from the point of view of adoption.</P>
    <P>Table 9 (2) in this memorandum analyses adoptions and it is an important analysis.  In 1968 the number of Catholic children adopted was 1,303; other denominations, 40.  This gives a total of 1,343.  The number of children adopted by relatives was 118. The number adopted by non-relatives was 1,225.  The number adopted through societies or local authorities was 1,055.  The number adopted by mother of third party 288.  The number of second children adopted was 442.  The number boarded out by health authorities was 23.  I imagine that relates to fosterage.</P>
    <P>It is interesting to note that CARE proposes that one-third of the members of the board should be qualified in child welfare and an adequate number of qualified workers should be employed by the board to supervise or &ldquo;inspect&rdquo; adoption.  These are regarded as the minimum standards to be laid down for all adoption societies.</P>
    <P>The board at present is constituted of a chairman and six ordinary members.  They are worthy people in every respect who have been willing to perform a voluntary service for the benefit of the community.  We talk about the need for professionals specialising in adoption at agency level.  Why cannot we also have specialists sitting on the board listening to other specialists presenting cases on behalf of married couples proposing to adopt?  It is not unreasonable that the board should have qualified specialists on it.  It cannot be overstressed here that those who <Col N="498" /> are really knowledgeable on this subject do not want specialists with a disparate knowledge of three, four or five different fields.  They want specialists knowledgeable in one field, the field of adoption.  It would be well worthwhile examining the proposition that one-third of the board, two people, should be specialists.</P>
    <P>I am surprised the Minister did not deal with the specific functions of the Department of Justice in this field. Perhaps when he is replying he will deal with these functions.  I understand there are welfare visitors who visit the homes of the adoptive parents.  What are the qualifications of these people?  My information is that they are very good people in every respect but they are not qualified for the kind of work about which we are speaking here.  I understand they are appointed by the Civil Service Commission.  The commission, I believe, when dealing with appointments have sitting with them people qualified in the particular matters in which they are interested.  That is as it should be.  As I understand it, all the welfare visitors require is a good general education, training in and experience of social work.  If I am wrong in that, I presume the Minister will correct me when he comes to reply to this debate.  That, I think, is not a proper position.  The Minister should set the headline in this respect.  He should go into the universities, technical colleges, or wherever and get these qualified people.</P>
    <P>There is another interesting matter to which I should like to refer and which arises from a book I read recently.  The book was entitled In Search of Origins&mdash;the experiences of adopted people, the people about whom we are speaking at the moment.  It was written by a citizen named John Triselotis&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickBelton1961" hpid="Mr. P. Belton Mr. P. Belton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Belton</NameTxt>
      <P>From Cork?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidAndrews" hpid="Mr. Andrews Mr. Andrews">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Andrews</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think so. He is a Celt.  Whether or not he is from Cork I do not know.  In this book he deals with the whole area of <Col N="499" /> the experiences of adopted people, as the title suggests.  It raises the matter of confidentiality and if the child should know who his natural parents are or were.  Scotland allows it, and as I understand it, Finland also.  England will be permitting it in the not too distant future.  In other words, the question is whether or not the option of finding out who are the natural parents should be given to the adopted child.  At the moment&mdash;not having done research into it to any great degree&mdash;I would prefer the Irish system, that the confidentiality of the natural parent or parents be upheld.  I have not decided in my own mind whether or not the Scottish system is the proper one.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>However, we are discussing the child and his rights.  In Ireland, under existing legislation, the adopting parents will never get to know who the natural parents are.  But the question remains as to whether or not the child himself should have the right to know who his natural parents are.  It may be undesirable.  It may be wrong.  It is not for me to decide. Nevertheless, it is a matter that might be considered in the light of the experience in other countries.  One can imagine the trauma that can be caused when a child is told he is adopted and is not the child of the adoptive parents.  One has to pick a time in the development of the child when he can withstand that.  But, having been told, the child might not be that sensitive of the fact.  The child might not be hyper-tensed or whatever and be able to take the fact that mummy and daddy are not really mummy and daddy, if you know what I mean.  Having read a number of pieces of literature on the matter, the child having been told he is not the natural child of his adoptive father and mother seems to begin to build up fantasies.  In some instances he may imagine that his natural mother and father were princesses, kings or whatever.  Whether, in those circumstances, the child should be told&mdash;as obtains in Scotland&mdash;is a question that remains to be solved.  In Scotland a child, if he wants, can be told who are his natural parents to break <Col N="500" /> down this fantasy.  It is suggested that they should be told around the age of 18 years that they have this option.  The option should be left to the child if he is developed enough to understand what is being said to him or the option being offered him.  However, I do not think it is the function of politicians to hand out moral judgments and, if we were to be critical of the Scottish system, this would be a form of handing out moral judgment.  That type of judgment should be left to others who consider themselves competent so to do.  I often wonder who those people are but I do not think it is a politician's function to exercise moral judgment on that or any other matter.</P>
    <P>To come back to the Bill itself, we believe it is untidy.  We were glad to hear that the Minister intends amending, I think it was, section 3 dealing with religion.  He would need to take a careful look at the section and we shall be anxious to see what type of amendment he will put forward. There exists now the case which Mr. Justice Pringle ruled on, as reported in <i>The Irish Times</i> of Tuesday, 14th May, 1974.  The heading reads: &ldquo;Section of Adoption Act Ruled Unconstitutional: Couple Win High Court Action&rdquo;.  The introduction to the story says:</P>
    <P>A young Dublin couple succeeded in their High Court action yesterday in having declared unconstitutional the section of the Adoption Act, 1952, which prohibited them from adopting the wife's illegitimate son.  In a reserved judgment Mr. Justice Pringle made an order declaring section 12 (2) of the Act to be repugnant to the Constitution.</P>
    <P>In fact, the schedule to the 1974 Bill repeals section 12 of the 1952 Act.  In section 3 there is a side note stating that it is religion.  We agree, in principle, with the fact that the natural parent should be told the religion of the applicant parent.  In a Catholic country like Ireland, I personally agree that couples of different religions living together should be entitled, as of right, as citizens of this country, to adopt children.  Of course, <Col N="501" /> that High Court action dispensed with the unreality of their non-entitlement to adopt.  I think it important that the religious factor has now been take out of the area of adoption.  So much for the law.  One can only speculate and the difficulty, as I see it, is that in a country which is 95 per cent Catholic one will find that the natural mother will be a Catholic and she will not wish to place her child with parents of mixed religion.  As I see it, that is the unfortunate nature of the section. But I can understand the Minister's difficulty.  He had to bring in the section. He intended bringing it in anyway whether or not the court ruled otherwise.  He intended bringing in the section doing away with the religious requirement, except in relation to the choice by the natural parent on being told the religion of the adopting couple.  It would then be a decision for the natural mother as to whether or not she found it desirable that the child be brought up in the religion of the adopting parents.  The Minister was in serious difficulty and he had to produce a formula.  He informs us now that he intends amending his own section.  We agree basically with what he intends amending.</P>
    <P>But then he makes a point in the course of his introductory speech, on page 3, which reads as follows:</P>
    <P>It will, of course, be necessary to consider whether rules of court can be devised to enable such applications to be heard in such a way as to preserve the anonymity of the parties.</P>
    <P>We shall have to preserve the anonymity of the parties if this Bill is to work.  It is a difficult area, as the Minister says, and full of the emotion involved in the dilemma which faces people.</P>
    <P>The Minister made clear the reason for section 2.  He was far clearer in this regard than the section itself.  The reason is valid, that the mother may be procrastinating or indecisive, and the adoptive parents may then seek an order of the court for the custody of the child.  If this is granted the Adoption Board may then make an order on foot of the court's decision notwithstanding <Col N="502" /> the refusal or failure of the mother to make up her mind.  It is a harrowing experience for the mother having gone through the whole gamut of becoming a mother and then having to decide whether she will have the child adopted.  One can only have the greatest sympathy with a woman in that situation.  But the Minister must deal with it because, in addition to the mother of the child he must take the child itself into consideration and also the adoptive parents who are also human and sensitive and may be unable to have a child themselves.</P>
    <P>It is an extraordinary thing that, in many instances when parents adopt a child, within a short time afterwards they are able to have their own child.  That is a well-known phenomenon, or whatever the medical expression is; it is a reality.</P>
    <P>We can see the Minister's difficulty on section 2 and we concede that if the unhappy woman is unable to make up her mind some action must be taken to preserve the rights and entitlement of the child.</P>
    <P>We agree with section 3 but if the Minister would tidy it up it would be a great help to the House.  We shall see what he has to say in this respect; he might produce the amendment as soon as possible after the Second Stage debate.</P>
    <P>In section 4 he deletes the restriction, recognised by the Constitution, from the Principal Act which is hereby amended by the substitution for section 34 of another section that must go by definition.  The referendum dispensed with the need to mention any particular religion in the Constitution and that is proper.</P>
    <P>We also agree with the Minister on section 6 which amends the Principal Act by the substitution for section 15 of the following section:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;15. (1) A consent shall not be valid unless it is given after the child has attained the age of six weeks and not earlier than three months before the application for adoption.</P>
    <P>Could the Minister explain the second part of this section?  That may need <Col N="503" /> some clarification.  Having put it to a number of people I found they did not quite understand it and I could not help them to any great extent except by supposing that it could mean this or that.  This is not good enough.  We want to know exactly what it means.  The Minister might clarify that point and if it does need redrafting, let it be redrafted.  We do agree that the consent should not be valid unless it is given after the child has attained the age of six weeks.  It is generally here that the mother has the first post-natal checkup and it is probably the right time. There is a school of thought that the sooner after birth the child is adopted the better from the child's point of view but under the circumstances I think it is proper to have some restrictions on the time.</P>
    <P>We in Opposition have received many representations from various organisations including CARE.  I received a copy of a letter which was sent to the Minister by the Galway branch of CARE.  The Minister, although not paying tribute to CARE has acknowledged that he did receive representations.  This is a copy of a letter which is not confidential.  I am not throwing it in the Minister's face &mdash;quite the contrary.  It says:</P>
    <P>We understand that some amendments to the Adoption Acts 1952 and 1964 are to be introduced in the near future.  We urge very strongly that the following be included in these amendments:</P>
    <P>(1) Private or third party placements to be forbidden.</P>
    <P>(2) adequate pre-placement service to be provided.</P>
    <P>(3) provision for minimum standard of staffing and training before an adoption society is accepted for registration.</P>
    <P>(4) only registered adoption societies to be allowed to place children for adoption.</P>
    <P>(5) standard mode of operation for all adoption societies, and</P>
    <P>(6) abolition of mixed marriage clause.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="504" /> The mixed marriage clause has been abolished in law and we must see how it works in practice.  Some of us may have doubts about its operability.  May I conclude by thanking those who assisted me in formulating my views, the adoption agency and others who assisted the party by propounding views which, having heard them and discussed them, we decided were worth projecting in the course of this debate.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Posts and Telegraphs (Dr. Cruise-O'Brien)</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to speak briefly, first, to congratulate my colleague, the Minister for Justice, on this fine, comprehensive, humane and somewhat overdue piece of legislation which I think will mean a good deal to those who are concerned with adopted children, including adoptive parents and the children themselves. My party have long advocated a number of measures which now see the light in this legislation; the changes affecting the religion of adoptors, the stipulations about withdrawing consent by the natural mother, the age limit and other matters.  I have listened with close attention to the constructive speech by Deputy Andrews on behalf of the Opposition and I am glad to find that there is a consensus in this House on this subject which will enable progress to be made.</P>
      <P>I should like to support the tributes which have been paid to the Adoption Board.  Like a number of other Deputies, I have adopted children and I know from experience the expertise, the thoroughness, tact and consideration which the board show for the adoptive parents, as well as for the welfare of the children.  They do splendid work; the hours they voluntarily work and the quality of their work are remarkable and perhaps they are not sufficiently appreciated. Therefore, I am glad they have been referred to here in proper terms.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should like also to refer to a class of people who have not been referred to hitherto, namely, those people who have care of orphans, of foundlings or abandoned children who are waiting for adoption.  Some of them are adopted while fewer are not <Col N="505" /> adopted.  As one who has been critical of certain aspects of Church influence in this country&mdash;and probably I will be critical again&mdash;I should like to pay tribute from personal experience to orders of nuns who are active in this area.  I have had personal experience of St. Patrick's, Navan Road, and the nuns in charge of the children there. Often in difficult circumstances, I have seen not only by their words but by their actions that they put the welfare of the children under their care first and before any other consideration.  It is right to record that and to pay tribute to them.  Theirs is a difficult and a heartrending task; it is their duty for the welfare of the children to put them through their hands as quickly as possible, however attached they may become to them.  These are very difficult matters.</P>
    <P>I welcome the fact that there has been a movement of opinion here. The point I am about to make may appear a party political point although I do not intend it as such.  I realise that if there has been an evolution of opinion it has been an evolution on both sides of the House; there has also been an evolution of opinion among many clergy, which factor affects this whole matter.  I raised this matter by way of questions in this House on different occasions in 1970 and 1971 and I was given to understand rather clearly that there could be no change.  Two Ministers, both of whom have now left the House and I have no occasion to refer to them by name, gave me that answer; one told me.  &ldquo;There is a stone wall here&rdquo;. Everyone knew what he meant but unfortunately no one wanted to be more explicit about it.</P>
    <P>I should like to be a little more explicit on this matter, not for the sake of any kind of recrimination but to try to eliminate a certain dimension of excessive reticence, what might be called mealy-mouthedness in this area.  Deputy Andrews referred to the earlier legislation as mother-centred but I think that was a euphemism. The earlier legislation was very strongly affected by the opinions and reservations of certain senior clergy at that time which were conservative opinions.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="506" /> What was wrong here and what we are getting away from is not so much the idea that the clergy of the denomination to which the majority belong should or should not influence these matters but rather our way of heeding that factor while making no reference to it.  The dialect of: &ldquo;There is a stone wall here&rdquo; was bad.  I do not think it in any way surprising that in a country where 95 per cent are Catholic&mdash;I am talking about the Twenty-Six Counties &mdash; the Catholic Church should exercise a good deal of influence.  It would be very surprising if it did not.  What was wrong, and what we should try to eliminate, was the failure to consider the nexus, to act as if that was not so when everyone knew it was, the &ldquo;a nod is as good as a wink to a blind horse&rdquo; style which this House adopted during the years as it dealt with that matter.  That, more than any other aspect of our behaviour&mdash; which has not been all that bad&mdash;has tended to be divisive, to arouse suspicion among people in the North, even those who would not be suspicious of us in whatever we did.  Therefore, I welcome the fact that we can make progress in this area, particularly in abolishing the iniquitous rule which prevailed about the religious qualification in relation to prospective adoptive parents, and that we can now refer in a relatively mature and adult way to the sociological considerations which surround us, including the factors I have mentioned.</P>
    <P>Deputy Andrews referred, I think in an unguarded phrase&mdash;I nearly fell into some unguarded phraseology myself so I am not trying to attack him; and I quote because I took down his words at the time&mdash;to a Catholic country like this.  It is a sort of melodeon.  We are never quite sure what we are talking about in this area. If by &ldquo;a country&rdquo; he means what we usually mean when we are watching our words, and our Ps and Qs, which we are not always doing, the whole of Ireland, this island, to describe it as a Catholic country is inaccurate and also is not helpful.</P>
    <P>It is a wording that any of us might fall into, but we have to watch what <Col N="507" /> we are doing.  If we use that phraseology in this kind of context, and if we also say we cannot abandon our inalienable right to unity, what we mean is, and we are heard to be saying is, that we cannot abandon the right to unity of a Catholic country like this.  This is among the sets of attitudes&mdash;it is only one of them&mdash; which have built up the menacing situation we are now in.  I am not, please, to be taken as reflecting on the language of one Deputy.  It is a language into which all of us are inclined to fall from time to time.  We must watch what we are doing and not combine these two claims of a Catholic country and an alienable right to unity.  I should like to take up a couple of other matters in Deputy Andrews's speech.</P>

      <P>It was a long speech and I am replying to it.  The Deputy would not like me to pass over it in total silence.  That would be impolite.  It was a sincere, wellresearched and in part a moving speech.  The Deputy would not want me to pay too much tribute to him so I will stop my tributes and resume my criticisms.</P>
    </Speaker>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Cruise-O'Brien</NameTxt>
      <P>That is very nice.  The Deputy referred to specialists in this area.  I am sure specialists have a role but, from the little experience I have&mdash;it is not much and I should not generalise from it&mdash; the impression I have is that what is wanted in this area is not so much the expertise of sociologists and highly qualified whiz-kids of one kind or another, but common sense, experience and a love of children.  If people dealing with adoption have those three qualities that is all we really need.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I had a little experience of this in America.  There I saw too much of the kind of highly socially trained expertise <Col N="508" /> and not enough of the other qualities I mentioned.  I saw more in this country of the other qualities I mentioned and I thought a great deal more of them than I thought of what I saw there.  I may have been unlucky there; I may have been lucky here.  I do not want to make a black and white comparison.</P>
    <P>In conclusion I should like again to refer to a couple of phrases which were used at the end of Deputy Andrews's speech and which I should like to take up with him by way of appeal.  He talked about when the child discovers that he is not the child of the adoptive parents and that the adoptive parents are not really mammy and daddy.  He is right to refer to these concepts if he is referring to concepts which prevail rather widely about adopted children and their adoptive parents but, with respect, the language is wrong in itself.  If it is a good adoption, the adopted child is the child of the adoptive parents both in law and in love.  He is fully their child even though they are not his natural parents.  They are really his mammy and daddy.</P>
    <P>That must be seen and upheld as I believe it is felt by both parties.  When this language is used you tend to develop uncertainties in those concerned regarding the actual situation. About half the number of adoptors, I should say at a guess, know what it is both to have natural children and adopted children and know also that there is no difference at all in the actual bond of love between the parents and the children of either type.  The idea that he is not really their child and that he should go in quest of his natural parents is misleading. I should not like to end on that note because the contribution from the benches opposite was very thorough and sympathetic.  I think we have a consensus in this House on this matter and again I congratulate the Minister on the Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>I have a particular interest in this Bill because I dealt with aspects, at least, of the problem of adoption in the Department of Justice for some years.  I decided <Col N="509" /> while I was there that, if time permitted which, in the event, it did not, I would introduce legislation on certain lines.  I am glad to say that this Bill includes many of the lines I proposed to include.  It includes some others also, none of which I am in particular disagreement with.  I want to say something generally about the Bill.  There is nothing in it which is very revolutionary or very new&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ConorCruiseOBrien" hpid="Dr. Cruise-O'Brien Dr. Cruise-O'Brien">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Cruise-O'Brien</NameTxt>
      <P>Except that it is a Bill at all.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;in general application.  The fact that no great new general principles are included and why nothing revolutionary has to be introduced now is to the credit of the system which has existed here for 22 years with one series of amendments in 1964.</P>
      <P>I do not think we appreciate the difference between the adoption system we have and the adoption system which pertains in England and the North.  As Deputy Andrews pointed out, we have the great advantage of having one central body which deals with this problem for the Twenty-six Counties.  In England, adoption is a much more haphazard affair.  Each county court judge in each county has jurisdiction so far as the making of adoption orders is concerned. I do not know how many county court judges there are in England but I am sure there are upwards of 100.  One result of that is that you get 100 different types of emphasis laid on the approach to adoption and, in practical terms, it may be rather different in one county from what it is in another.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have the great advantage of having a central system and one board only.  The Minister quoted the figure in his opening speech.  That surely is the greatest proof of all of the fact that our system has been and is basically very satisfactory.  He said 20,000 adoption orders have been made since 1952 and only either three or four of those were questioned.  How many of the three or four that were questioned were questioned successfully I do not know.  I can only think of one offhand and that is the very recent one. <Col N="510" /> Of course, there was not an order made on that occasion.  That was a case of the board refusing to make an order as it had to refuse with the law as it stood.  In fact, only three or four out of 20,000 were questioned and that is surely proof of the efficacy, the equity and the fairness of the adoption system as laid down in law and of the way it has been administered by the Adoption Board.</P>
    <P>In recent years there has been a good deal of agitation on the part of a very small group in the community who allege they were discriminated against.  They are the partners in a mixed marriage who did not have any children of their own and who wished to adopt a child but were precluded from doing so under the 1952 Act, if the mixed marriage included a Roman Catholic partner.  It did not apply if it included two partners of any of the Protestant denominations.  It has been alleged for some time that such people were being discriminated against and that, in particular, it was unfair to children who might be adopted by couples of mixed religions if they had the power or the right to adopt.  As the Minister pointed out, and as I pointed out in the Seanad on the 29th June, 1972 on the Second Stage of the Adoption Bill, 1971, there is not now nor has there been for quite a long number of years any child who was eligible for adoption and suitable for adoption who failed to be adopted because of our laws.  I do not think that point is sufficiently appreciated by many people who may have been taken in by the sort of campaign mounted in recent years by people who found fault, not just with that aspect of our adoption laws, but with numerous other aspects of them.</P>
    <P>Any changes that are made now in this Bill will not, so far as this particular aspect of the matter is concerned, be of any assistance to any child.  There is no child who is not adopted at the moment who will be adopted when this Bill is passed.  We should be clear in our minds about this because the very people who have agitated for this particular change are those who in the next breath will say that the most important things are the rights of the child and that our legislation <Col N="511" /> should be child-centred.  In fact, their problem is that our existing legislation is child-centred and it is not centred on the interests of the prospective adoptive parents.  Let us be brutally frank and honest about it.</P>
    <P>The change which is proposed here, and which I indicated, as reported in column 163 of Volume 73 of the Seanad Report, I would make is not being made in the interests of the children.  It is being made in the interests of prospective adopting parents only.  If one is to establish any sort of hierarchy of rights any reasonable person would say that the paramount individual concern is the child, that next in line so far as rights are concerned is the natural mother, and that very far down the list, if they have any rights at all, come prospective adoptors.  I do not say adoptors because they have rights once they have adopted but prospective adoptors have no rights. They are given rights in law to adopt which they would not otherwise have had but they have no natural right to adopt.  It is no harm that we should remind ourselves of that fact because if one was to read certain newspapers in recent years, and the literature produced by some groups, one would believe that there is a natural right on the part of prospective adoptors to adopt, whereas, in fact, there is no such thing.</P>
    <P>If the adoption of a child makes any couple happy well and good provided that the child itself is happy. The happiness of an adopting couple should be purely subsidiary and ancillary to the happiness of the child concerned.  Those who have a lot to say about that should bear in mind that that is the order of priorities and that prospective adoptors come at the very foot of the ladder and until such time as they adopt they have no rights at all.</P>
    <P>I should like to quote what I said in the Seanad as reported in the Seanad Report, column 163, Volume 73:</P>
    <P>Nevertheless, I have decided to include in a Bill which I will promote, a provision that would <Col N="512" /> permit such couples to adopt if one of them is of the same religion as the child and its mother, if&mdash;but only if&mdash;the mother consents to adoption by such a couple.  I propose to make a provision of the same kind in the case of orphans of parents of different religions.</P>
    <P>When I read section 3 of this Bill, and I read it in the context of the repeal of section 12 of the 1952 Act and of section 6 of the 1964 Act, it seemed to me that it would be necessary for the mother to be informed of the religion of the prospective adoptors in every case.  However, the Minister realises that and proposes to delete it.  I am glad that what may have been an error in that section has been spotted and it will be dealt with.</P>
    <P>In the last couple of months we had the freak case which was referred to by Deputy Andrews.  In that case, in most unusual circumstances, the natural mother of the child was precluded from adopting her own child on her subsequent marriage.  One could not but have, and I am sure the Adoption Board also had, the greatest of sympathy for the mother and her husband who were faced with this problem.  It was most unpleasant and difficult but it is no harm to emphasise that that was a freak situation and that the number of times that could arise would, perhaps, be one in 100,000.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickBelton1961" hpid="Mr. P. Belton Mr. P. Belton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Belton</NameTxt>
      <P>It may be more often.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>I doubt it very much if the mother of an illegitimate would subsequently marry a man of a different religion who was prepared to adopt that child and then find themselves in that difficulty.  Perhaps it has happened once before and it will happen again but that situation has been dealt with now.  However, it is no harm to bear in mind that it was a very unusual situation because it was a combination of circumstances that might conceivably never happen again.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>What I am not altogether clear about is the precise extent of that judgment.  As reported in the newspapers, it appears that the whole of <Col N="513" /> section 12 of the 1952 Act fell as a result of that judgment.  Unfortunately, newspaper reports, apart from <i>The Times</i> of London, of court cases are notoriously unreliable and I have long since given up relying on them.  I have not had an opportunity of reading the judgment itself but it seems to me that it is scarcely logical that the whole of section 12 had to fall from the facts of that case.  If the whole of section 12 did not have to fall, the question arises whether it is necessary or appropriate to repeal it and the consequential section 6 of the 1964 Act.  There may be people who are of the opinion that its total repeal is necessary, subject only to the enactment of section 3 here which it is proposed to amend.  It may be the opinion of some that we are going too far on that.  However, this is something that I might discuss more profitably on Committee Stage since I have not the judgment before me but, perhaps, when the Minister is replying to this stage he will deal with this point.</P>
    <P>I take it that since section 12 as a whole is now being repealed the problem I referred to in 1972 no longer arises, that is, the question of orphans of parents of different religions.  I assume that to be so but I would like the Minister's confirmation of it because these were the most unfortunate people of all.  Up to now these were the only children in the country, who, being suitable otherwise, were not eligible for adoption.  I expect there were very few of them.  Indeed, I am not aware of there ever having been any such case but, potentially, there could always have been children in this position.  In 1972 I was more concerned about such children than I was about the other side of the coin, so to speak, because they had certain rights of which the law was tending to deprive them.  I await the Minister's confirmation that the repeal of section 12 covers such children.  It should be spelled out in the Bill that it is open to a couple of the same religion as the religion of one of the natural parents of an orphan to adopt.  Otherwise if the orphan children of a couple who were of different religions are free to be adopted anywhere or by <Col N="514" /> anyone because there is no one to give consent, they may be adopted by a couple who are of a different religion from each of the two religions of the parents of the orphans.</P>
    <P>This is a matter that could give rise to some problems but I am glad that we are able to talk here today about these difficulties without having any outside pressures of the type referred to by the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs.  It is doubtful that we could have had such a debate 20 years ago.  So far as I am aware no groups other than those to which Deputy Andrews referred have made any representations in relation to the Bill. I am not unhappy that that is so.</P>
    <P>I am glad to see that section 4 tightens the restrictions regarding the making of arrangements for adoption because up to now it has been possible for people who were unqualified and who, in many ways, might have been unsuitable, to arrange for the adoption of children.  One aspect of that which concerns me particularly is that it appears that some children who are suitable for adoption go out of this country for adoption.  That appears to be contrary to a section in the 1952 Act but notwithstanding that it appears that this happens occasionally.  Ten or 20 years ago it was a much more frequent happening than it is now but it should not happen at all.  It is regrettable that any child should go out of the country for adoption other than to a relative particularly when there is a shortage of children for adoption here and while there is a considerable surplus of prospective adoptive parents.  One would hope that with the more stringent restrictions on the placement of children for adoption as proposed in the substituted section 34 of the 1952 Act, there would be no further instances of that practice.  I note from the Minister's speech that the board were of the opinion that they should not have any specific power to make regulations in relation to adoption societies and that they considered their existing power to deregister a society to be adequate.  However, the Minister should be cognisant of the fact that of the 25 or so adoption societies <Col N="515" /> in existence here, some are incomparably better than others.  There are a number of reasons why this is so but the obvious one is the better training of members and staff.  There is an enormous difference in efficiency between various societies and it might be borne in mind by the board that in so far as possible they should encourage an equally high standard of efficiency and care on the part of all societies registered with them.  I agree that the power to deregister a society is adequate but it would be invidious for them to have to set out a series of standards that would have to be complied with by each society.</P>
    <P>The placement of a child for adoption is a unique and special task, a task that may well be different in each case.  In many ways it is for the people involved a very subjective exercise and one that is difficult to classify objectively.</P>
    <P>I am disappointed that there is no explanatory memorandum with the Bill because without having the 1952 and 1964 Acts before one, it is not easy to understand what is contained in the Bill.  Without an explanatory memorandum one would have to go through the Bill deleting those parts that are proposed to be deleted and adding what is proposed to be added while bearing in mind that the 1964 Act made some changes in the 1952 Act.  It would be helpful in relation to Bills of this kind which, in the main, consist of amending legislation, to have an explanatory memorandum indicating what would be the effects of the proposed changes.  Otherwise there is an enormous amount of work involved and it is only after a good deal of study that one realises the exact meaning of particular sections, whereas one could have grasped the meaning immediately with the aid of an explanatory memorandum.</P>
    <P>The next aspect of the Bill with which I wish to deal is the proposal to lower the age of the child at which the natural mother may give her consent for adoption.  On 29th June, 1972 I said in the Seanad that I proposed to reduce this age to three months but I have no objection to its <Col N="516" /> being reduced here to six weeks because I have met a number of adoptive parents with whom children had been placed but who went through a very harrowing time while awaiting the making of the final adoption order.  I met such parents within the last 48 hours.  These people might be misled by the fact that it is stated in section 6 that consent can be given after six weeks.  That is not the end of it.  Section 7 goes on to say that:</P>
    <P>...an adoption order shall not be made in respect of a child unless the child has been in the care of the applicants for such period (if any) as may be prescribed.</P>
    <P>Subsection (2) says:</P>
    <P>The Board may, having regard to the particular circumstances of the case, make an adoption order in respect of a child notwithstanding that the child has not been in the care of the applicants for the period prescribed pursuant to subsection (1) of this section.</P>
    <P>The Minister mentioned in his opening speech that the board thought the minimum desirable period would be 6 months.  Therefore, it may well be that if that period were insisted on by the board as a general rule, the waiting period for the making of the final adoption order would not be less in practice, notwithstanding the passage of section 6 of this Bill by the Oireachtas.  If it will not be less than it is at the moment, I think that would be wrong.  The reason I decided in the first instance, and the Minister subsequently decided, to shorten it even more, was the distress caused to the people who had adopted a child and become extremely attached to that child within a very short time. They lived in horror of the day that the child might be taken away from them.  In every sense the child was their own, except in the purely physiological sense.  The Minister is in danger, if section 7 is to be used in the way he has suggested, of undoing the good which section 6 might do from the point of view of adoptive parents with whom placement has been made.  On the other hand, it would be very unwise <Col N="517" /> not to have a reasonable period of probation, as it was described by the Minister, so that the board and their officials can be satisfied that, in fact, the placement is for the benefit of the child and that the adoptive parents are suitable.</P>
    <P>Section 8 provides for altering the form of entering a child in the register of adopted children.  The proposed alteration is that it can be altered by the Minister for Justice with the consent of the Minister for Health. Apparently, it was at his request that this was put in.  I understand that the register of adopted children is a different register, although it is kept by the Registrar General, from the ordinary birth register.  It would be no harm to suggest that some form might be devised whereby a birth certificate could be provided for adopted children which would not disclose to them, or to anyone else, the fact that they were adopted.  I know there are problems in this regard.  The shorter form of birth certificate does not disclose this.  There are various instances when the longer form of certificate is insisted upon.  The Minister should ask the Minister for Health to see if any way can be devised whereby that problem can be surmounted, because is causes difficulties to children.  I know of a child of nine or ten years of age who is unaware of the particular circumstances in which he was adopted and is unaware of the fact that he was adopted.  He is liable to have this disclosed to him now by some officious people who insist on having the long form of birth certificate produced.</P>
    <P>I am glad to see that there is provision to appoint a deputy chairman under this Bill.  I remember on a number of occasions having to run to the Government at the last minute with a four line memorandum saying that the chairman was ill.  I began to resent the fact that it was necessary for them to make an order.  I do not blame them for that.  I am glad to see also that if the deputy chairman acts for the chairman he will be paid.</P>
    <P>While on that topic, I agree with what the Minister and Deputy Andrews said in relation to the <Col N="518" /> members of this board who, with the exception of the chairman, and, in future, the deputy chairman, are unremunerated. It is not a question of meeting for a few hours once a month.  This board often meets on three or four days a week.  On those days it is not a nominal meeting which begins at 11 o'clock and the members go for coffee at 11.10.  It is a hard slog all day from 11 a.m. to possibly 5 p.m., frequently with a lot of difficult decisions to be made which are of grave importance to the people involved.  We have been fortunate, through the years, that we had people of great competence and generosity who were prepared to undertake this onerous work without remuneration of any kind.  The people of this country are indebted to them to a far greater extent than they are, or ever will be, aware of.</P>
    <P>There are a number of other points to which I should like to refer but they might profitably wait until the Committee Stage.  This Bill is generally on the lines on which I spoke in 1972 and hoped to produce at that time.  This Bill goes beyond that and brings in other things on which I was not very keen at that stage and did not propose to bring in but to which I have no fundamental objection in any event.</P>
    <P>The Minister spoke about the orders of the High Court regarding the custody of children which is referred to in section 2.  He said that he thought that at the moment the High Court was the proper tribunal or forum for decisions on such matters. He also mentioned that he thought ultimately that some form of family tribunal, if and when they came about, might be the more suitable forum for deciding certain questions, such as the custody of children.  I doubt whether such a tribunal would be the proper place to reach such decisions.  I am reminded of my doubts in that respect by what I said at column 160 of the Seanad Report on 29th June, 1972, when it was proposed in the section of the Bill which we were then discussing to give the Adoption Board the power to decide on the custody of the children as <Col N="519" /> opposed to the power to make adoption orders.  I said:</P>
    <P>This proposal too raises a fundamental constitutional problem.  It is extremely doubtful whether the power to determine the right to custody of a child in case of dispute is a limited power within the meaning of article 37 of the Constitution. It is only if it were held to be such that the power could lawfully be entrusted to a body other than a Court of Law.</P>
    <P>I suggest that there is no prospect of the question of the custody of a child ever being held to be a limited function in the context within the meaning of Article 37 of our Constitution.</P>
    <P>It is a very important matter when one bears in mind that the jurisdiction of the High Court is £2,000 and upwards. The question of whether a man gets £2,000 damages or not as a result of an accident or a breach of contract is very trivial compared with the question of who will have custody of a child.  One knows that these sort of cases are often fought very bitterly by the natural mother who may not have looked after the child as well as she should have done but who, nonetheless, has strong maternal interests for her own child and who will do anything not to give up that child. The High Court is probably the lowest tribunal which should properly decide an important matter like that. I do not see any prospect of its ever being held to be a limited power within the meaning of Article 37 of our Constitution.  I would certainly hope that it never would be so.  It would be most inappropriate that something of such fundamental importance as the custody of a child between two disputing parents or between a natural mother and certain outsiders should be ever decided by a district justice. It would be even less suitable to have such a matter decided by a tribunal of social workers, or whoever might constitute a family tribunal.  They might be very suitable indeed for dealing with many of the matters which come before them from day to day, but I doubt very much, even if a district justice were to preside over such <Col N="520" /> a tribunal, whether they would be the proper forum for the decision of such fundamental matters as the custody of a child.</P>
    <P>I do not think there is anything further I want to say at this stage.  I will be interested to hear what the Minister has to say in reply.  I reiterate what I said at the outset.  I regard our adoption system as an excellent one.  It has proved itself over 22 years.  The changes which it is now proposed to make in it are, in fact, minor changes of very little significance. Perhaps they are changes following public notoriety rather than changes of real merit.  The need for change was very slight.  Such slight changes as were necessary are being made in this Bill.  They will get over the small number of anomalies which appeared from time to time in relation to the administration of our adoption laws.</P>
    <P>For that reason I welcome the Bill particularly as it is more or less in line with what I had suggested myself. I would caution people against thinking that there is more in the Bill than is really there.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickBelton1961" hpid="Mr. P. Belton Mr. P. Belton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Belton</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with nearly all the speakers.  This Bill is overdue. As Deputy O'Malley said, there are very few points at which change is necessary.  These changes are necessary because the position in regard to them is serious.</P>
      <P>I agree also with Deputy O'Malley that when a Bill is introduced there should be an explanatory memorandum with it, no matter how small the Bill is.  There are meetings in the House and in the EEC.  Deputies have to attend the Council of Europe. Deputations come in to meet Ministers. All these functions take time.  A Deputy finds he is tied up with jobs or meetings concerning by-elections, and so on.  Deputies should get an explanatory memorandum with each Bill to show exactly what is intended. The details of the Bill should be spelled out.  An overall document should be given.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy O'Malley spoke about the recent High Court case before Mr. Justice Pringle.  It may have been an <Col N="521" /> unusual case in this country but many similar cases occur in England, America and European countries.  We often follow Europe as regards business matters.</P>
    <P>Like many other people in Ireland or elsewhere I knew very little about adoption until I became a Deputy. The first time I took an interest in the subject was when constituents came to me with their problems in this regard.  This is mainly a city problem.  Most adoptions take place in towns and urban areas.  In the country a farmer prefers to take a nephew into his home rather than adopt a child.  Such people feel that there is some slur on their marriage if they cannot produce a child.  In Dublin there are not enough children available for those who wish to adopt them.  I agree with Deputy O'Malley that children should not be adopted by people who live outside the country.  There is an improvement in the control of adoption societies. There is a provision in the Bill in regard to adoption where the adoptive parents are of different religions.</P>
    <P>For a number of years past we have adopted the practice of putting Irish names on boards set up by the Government. We are not all legal men or professors.  Not everyone has a university education.  As a politician I know where to get information but what about the people who leave school at 15 years of age and who go into employment immediately?  How are they to know how to get information and how to find these boards in the telephone directory?  They have to come back to the politicians to find out how to contact the various boards. We have Bord na gCapall, and so on. I left school at 18 and between then and 1963 I did not hear much Irish. People who leave school at 15 are not aware of the Irish titles of the various State agencies.  Such boards should have their names in the telephone directory in both English and Irish. An Bord Uchtála should be listed under the Adoption Board also.  When people want money they know that they have to contact the IDA.  We are just playing with Irish here.  It is a bit unfair.  I have not used Irish for ages. <Col N="522" /> In my constituency the Protestant clergyman happens to know more Irish than the Catholic priest.  The use of Irish can sometimes give a rich person an advantage over a poor person.</P>
    <P>There are a few points I have come across in my political life in regard to adoption.  The standards for adoption societies should be strict.  There should be safeguards to ensure that adoption societies are not used for the conversion of a child to a certain religion. That certainly happened before the 1962 Act.  I know of two cases &mdash; one Catholic and the other Protestant &mdash; where the adopted child was converted to the particular religion of the adoptive parents.</P>
    <P>It would be a good thing to have specialists.  I agree with both Deputy Andrews and the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs in this.  I am not a great believer in professional people; sometimes I think we have too many of them.  What we want is a mixture of the professional and those experienced on the ground.  As Deputy Andrews said, the professional should be top class and used only in the assessing of the adoptive parents. After all, when one goes to buy a business one employs an expert to assess the value of the business.</P>
    <P>The argument so far has been that there are not enough children for adoption.  Up to a point that may be true.  There are cases in which people have adopted more than one child and they have to go through the same procedure for each successive child. That should not be necessary.  I also know of a mixed marriage where the couple were very anxious to adopt but could not do so under existing legislation.  I really think that the important thing is that the child should be reared as a Christian and given a good start in life.  The difficulty could be met by getting the mother of the illegitimate child to say in what religion she wants the child to be reared.</P>
    <P>I have not had time to go into this subject very deeply, but my constituents have advised me about certain things.  I knew a case of a girl of 16 or 17 who had an illegitimate baby. <Col N="523" /> She was kept in a home while she was having the baby and she agreed to have the child adopted.  When she left the home she got a job and then she changed her mind and wanted to keep the child herself.  The home told her she could not have the child until she paid six weeks' maintenance.  I do not know what happened because the girl never came back to me.  I suggest that some of the money the Minister is getting now could be used to help people in her particular position.</P>
    <P>This Bill is an improvement on former legislation.  I congratulate the Minister on it.  So far there has been no dissentient voice.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnGrattanEsmonde" hpid="Mr. Esmonde Mr. Esmonde">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Esmonde</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome this Bill and any criticism I offer will be offered for a constructive purpose. First of all, I congratulate the board on the magnificent work they have done to date.  In certain cases they have come up against considerable difficulties.  This Bill is evidence of that and it seeks now to resolve some of those difficulties.  Compliments have been paid to the board.  I doubt if the board really need these compliments from this House.  They have been in existence for 22 years and have dealt with 20,000 cases of adoption.  The only paid members are the chairman and the secretary.  A great deal of the work of the board is done voluntarily and we, on behalf of our constituents, express now the thanks of the people for and their appreciation of what the board have done.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Andrews raised the question as to whether an adopted child should have the right to know who its parents are.  I gather that information is not readily available and I would like to raise just one <i>caveat</i>.  There is one possibility that can arise.  Where two people have sexual relations they may produce a son and a daughter.  Is it possible that that brother and sister could subsequently get married?  Some procedure should be found to deal with that situation.  Furthermore, when an adopted child reaches a certain age that child should know something about the background of the parents if he or she so wishes because people's <Col N="524" /> attitudes change and I do not see why a child who has been adopted should be placed in a disadvantageous position <i>vis-à-vis</i> the parents.  Some parents behave in a very extraordinary manner towards their children.  We all know that; it is a fact of life and of human nature.  A child should be in a position to protect himself and know where he stands.  I can foresee the case of a child who might not be aware that he was adopted and who might suddenly, at a future date, have it thrown in his face that he was an illegitimate child. We must first of all look at this legislation from the point of view of the child.  That is fundamental to this legislation and all thinking in relation to adoption.</P>
    <P>I do not want to appear to be critical or carping but medical science has made tremendous strides in the examination of children and infants and, as a result of modern technology, doctors are very often able to ward off illnesses when they know that people are prone to certain illnesses by reason of hereditary or other factors.  One case came to my knowledge where an adoption did go through, and the result was that the adopting parents were left with a child severely handicapped.  It was not apparent to the parents at the time.  Unfortunately, this fact has given rise to considerable family trauma.  The fact came to light fairly soon after the adoption.  I think adoptive parents are not sufficiently geared to deal with adverse circumstances of that nature. Possibly extra care should be taken in the checking of health, both physical and mental, of the child.  There are now many tests available.  I am sure they are availed of and this might have been an unfortunate case.  But, as we are talking very frankly here and trying to be constructive.  I would be lacking in my duty if I did not refer to the fact that such a possibility might arise.</P>
    <P>When looking at this legislation we must bear in mind that the only children we are considering in this matter are illegitimate and orphaned. I was a little disheartened listening to the Minister.  I know he is trying to go as far as he can to be as helpful as possible, as is everybody else in this case, but I was a little depressed when <Col N="525" /> I heard the advice he had been given. In his introductory speech he said:</P>
    <P>It has been contended on many occasions that abandoned or neglected children whose parents are living should be capable of being adopted.</P>
    <P>He went on to say:</P>
    <P>It is difficult to answer the criticism that an abandoned or neglected child is better in a new home than in an institution neglected by its natural parents.</P>
    <P>The Minister continued:</P>
    <P>I sympathise completely with the humanity of that plea.</P>
    <P>I do not think anybody could do otherwise.  The Minister also said:</P>
    <P>I am advised, however, that the inalienable and imprescriptible rights guaranteed to the family by the Constitution make it impossible to extend the benefits of adoption to children whose parents are still living.</P>
    <P>I always become somewhat concerned when I hear the words &ldquo;inalienable&rdquo; and &ldquo;imprescriptible&rdquo; used.  If a child is abandoned or neglected, have not the parents, in relation to that child, thrown away their rights to be called normal parents?  I think there is room in this legislation, despite the wording of the Constitution and despite what any judge may have said in relation to certain parts of the Constitution, for better cognisance to be taken of the judicial rule which is referred to in Professor J.M. Kelly's &mdash; as he was then &mdash; book on the Constitution when discussing the Guardianship of Infants Act, 1954, where he states that:</P>
    <P>Statutory force has now been given to the judicial rule that &ldquo;the welfare of the child is paramount&rdquo; in cases involving the custody and education of children.</P>
    <P>I do not see why the welfare of the child is paramount in relation to two facets only, namely, the custody and education of the child.  We have to deal with the entire life and ambit of the child when we are considering adoption.  The Minister makes the point that the guardianship of the <Col N="526" /> child can be protected under the Guardianship of Infants Act.  If that Act can be used to retain possession, custody and education of the child, why should not that child be entitled to the full benefit of the care and attention of the person who is now the guardian in law by virtue of an order made under that Act?  Why should the child be denied the benefits of the name of those people who have befriended him and have acted as his parents?  With respect to those who have expressed views on the Constitution I think they have taken a biased and narrow view.  Parents and families have rights and they have those rights only when they act as such because Article 60 of our Constitution says:</P>
    <P>All citizens shall, as human persons, be held equal before the law.</P>
    <P>I do not see why the adoption, use of a name and the benefits that adoption bring should be restricted merely to illegitimate or orphaned children.  In effect, the child who has been abandoned or neglected is an orphan; the fact that its parents are alive does not change the actual circumstances of that unfortunate child.  I think it is time this House took a step forward in that regard and took cognisance of the fact that parents who abandon their children have not, in law, the right to call themselves the parents of those children.  They may be the parents in name, in the sense of using a name in a very ephemeral sort of way because, although they have rights &mdash; and I am talking about ordinary parents &mdash; they also have duties. It is a fundamental principle and interpretation of law that if a person has a right to something, he has also obligations and duties.</P>
    <P>In considering this measure I think the Minister will have to consider section 10 of the 1952 Adoption Act and I suggest he should make some provision that where a certain person is given custody of a child under the Guardianship of Infants Act, after a due length of time the child and the guardian should have the right to get a full order under the Adoption Act. This is only fair to the child.  We live in an age of form-filling, producing birth and other certificates and is a <Col N="527" /> child to go through life and be regarded as not wanted by its parents and not fully integrated with its guardian?  It is our duty to take the place of the family structure and provide machinery to allow the child to have a full life.</P>
    <P>It has come to my knowledge recently that there can be difficulty following adoption.  I may be speaking incorrectly and contrary to what is in the two Adoption Acts and the full meaning of the new Bill, but adoptive parents are human and an adoption home can break up.  I think the effect of the Adoption Act is that once the child is adopted the adoptive parents are the parents of that child. I should like the Minister to say if there is any legal machinery to permit a once-adopted child to be readopted to cover such a situation.  I know of a case that has arisen in the environs of Dublin recently which is giving some cause for concern.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMarkCooney" hpid="Minister for Justice (Mr. Cooney) Patrick M. Cooney">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice (Mr. Cooney)</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to thank all who contributed to this debate for the content of their contributions and especially for the spirit in which they were offered.  This is a sensitive area and it has been sensitively handled by the House.  I think it was Deputy O'Malley who said that there was nothing revolutionary in the Bill and that was because the general code of adoption had been successful and did not require revolutionary changes. That is correct.  A large number of orders have been made and it is obvious that, at least, in terms of quantity, adoption has worked.  We have not had any research into adoption to assess its impact on the children and adoptive parents and we cannot talk in terms of success shown by research carried out in the area, but it would be a fair inference that in a society as small as ours, 20,000 orders could not have been made and have been absorbed into our society unless they were successful.  If that number of orders was throwing up social or domestic problems they would surely have manifested themselves and would have come to our notice.  I think we can claim that the <Col N="528" /> system has worked well.  That is not to say that it is perfect and that is why we have this amending Bill here today.</P>
      <P>To take up first the contribution by Deputy Esmonde, I think the burden of his contribution concerned the plight of the abandoned child.  He took me up on the point I made in my opening speech that the abandoned child is not capable of being the subject of an adoption order because of the constistitutional position concerning the inalienable and imprescriptible right of the family.  I would respectfully say to Deputy Esmonde that his human heart ran away with his legal head here.  There is no doubt that our constitutional position at present prevents adoption of abandoned children and once that is so we in this House, no matter how much we may regret the absence of that right on humanitarian grounds &mdash; and I share Deputy Esmonde's sympathy for this class of children &mdash; have no right to ignore the basic law of the State.  What would have to be done would be to change that basic law and this would be a complicated procedure.  From the judicial precedents available to us &mdash; and these are scarce &mdash; it would seem that it would not be even possible to put a judicial gloss or interpretation on the Constitution to achieve what the human instinct in us wants to achieve in particular cases.  Having to argue like this, I am a cockshot for people who say: &ldquo;Surely you cannot put forward such a callous point of view and stand over it.&rdquo;  Unfortunately we are circumscribed by our constitutional position and we must be realistic even if the realism appears to be callous and hurtful.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is a point of principle in getting to the root of the argument concerning the abandoned child. Deputy Esmonde touched on it when he spoke of such a child being in the custody of foster parents for some time, getting all the benefits of an ordered home and of paternal and maternal love that it was denied by its own natural parents and he said that after &ldquo;due length of time&rdquo; in the custody of the foster parents, why not have provision for an adoption <Col N="529" /> order to be made automatically?  Who is to define &ldquo;due length of time&rdquo;? This is where we have a practical difficulty in changing the law to admit abandoned children within the ambit of the Adoption Acts.  Who is to say that a child has been finally, totally and absolutely abandoned by his natural parents?  There could be a situation in which that child's natural parents, as a result of changed social or economic circumstances might find themselves in a position to offer the love the child lacked from them up to then and to offer proper and complete home environment to their own child and would it not then be a difficult situation &mdash; to put it at the mildest &mdash;if they were unable to offer their own natural child all the benefits of his own home if the child had been taken irrevocably from them by an adoption order made under the Acts? This is a practical difficulty in regard to abandoned children.  As Deputy Esmonde pointed out, a custody order gives them everything except the legal name of their foster parents.  It is not altogether an unsatisfactory situation.  It is a difficult area and I do not propose to try to solve it here because I do not think we are in a position where we can solve it.</P>
    <P>Deputies Andrews and Esmonde raised some points dealing with the question of the adopted child being told of his origins and they wondered if this was a good or a bad thing. Deputy Andrews mentioned the research carried out by Mr. Triseliotis who is attached to the University of Edinburgh in his book called &ldquo;In Search of Origins&rdquo;.  Deputy Esmonde thought information should be available for the child so that he would be aware of his ancestry and that this might possibly prevent what I thought was an extreme example, the dangers of an incestuous union at a future date.  I suppose it cannot be absolutely guarded against.  On the other hand, we have to balance that unlikely event against the question marks that are necessarily raised if one is to reveal the identity to the adopted child.</P>
    <P>Most research has shown that it is in the interest of the adopted child to be <Col N="530" /> told as early as possible that he is adopted.  The experience of adoptive parents has been that by and large this does not produce a curiosity on the part of the child regarding his natural ancestry.  Research has shown that in cases where adopted children have shown such a curiosity the homes of the adoptive parents have not been stable ones, but that where the adopted children had been reared in steady environments with stable parents they have had no curiosity regarding their natural ancestry.  It is basic to our adoption code that the adopted child becomes the child of the adopting parents in everything except the natural blood.  It would be contrary to that principle if we allowed to be introduced into that relationship curiosity or questions concerning the natural ancestry of the child.  We want to ensure that the family together with the adopted child becomes as far as possible a natural family, bonded in terms of natural love as the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs said.  We want to achieve that aim and it would be going against that if we were to facilitate information regarding the ancestry of the adopted child to be given to him. So far as possible we want to make him the child of the adoptive parents and this is a reason for having our code of adoption as it is, preserving the secrecy of his origin from the child.</P>
    <P>Deputy Andrews spoke of the need for assessment before placement.  He said the need for this had been made clear to him in conversations he had after the Bill was published and in his general research into this matter.  I share the view that assessment is needed and I have covered this aspect in my speech by indicating my concern that the highest calibre of professional assistance be available to adoption societies.  I said that subventions to enable them to employ this kind of assistance would be made available to them.  It is up to them to decide the qualifications of the persons coming to work for them but I hope they will look for persons with professional qualifications.  Deputy Andrews was critical of the wording of the advertisement placed by my Department seeking welfare officers in which it referred <Col N="531" /> to a good general education with experience and/or training in social work.  That does not exclude professional social workers.  There is no bias against a professional qualification in social science; in fact, we welcome such people into the public service and I know adoption societies are anxious to avail of their services.  As I have said, I am arranging for subventions to be paid to the societies to enable them to recruit social workers.</P>
    <P>Deputy Andrews raised the point that it might be desirable to have a system of visits after the adoption order has been made.  This is controversial and I think that essentially it is unacceptable.  It is basic to our adoption code that when the adoption order is made the child is then the child of the adopting parent.  It would be an invasion of the privacy of that family for the State, via the Adoption Board, to introduce a system of compulsory visits.  If the assessment is thorough before and after placement and before the adoption order it should have removed any doubts and cleared everyone's mind regarding the suitability of the family to adopt. If one says there should be postadoption visits in the case of adopted children, logically one should argue for similar visits in the case of natural families.  It would be too controversial and the only circumstances in which I could see such visits would be for research purposes and on a voluntary basis.  As I indicated in my opening speech after 20 years of operation of the Acts, I am keen to see some research carried out into the Irish experience of adoption.  This will necessarily involve visiting homes where there have been adoptions and the success and depth of the research will depend on the co-operation made available by adoptive parents.  For reasons of privacy many of them will be hesitant in co-operating with that research and this is one of the factors that makes research into this matter more difficult.  Another factor is the tremendous time-lag and changing social conditions and attitudes towards adoption.  Deputy Belton touched on this matter when he said that until comparatively recently <Col N="532" /> adoptions were rare in rural Ireland, that they were confined generally to cities and large urban areas.  That was due to an attitude of mind that is changing.  It is indicative of how attitudes can change and this change can tend to invalidate research which must be carried out over a generation or half generation.</P>
    <P>Speaking on this question of research, I am aware of the research document produced from the social science school in Trinity College.  There was no request to me for funds to aid this research.  I understand that arrangements for its publication have been made.  I welcome this research and congratulate the researcher.  It is probably the first such research project carried out in this country, and I hope it will be the first of many.</P>
    <P>Some Deputies referred to the question of having specialists on the Adoption Board.  Deputy Andrews felt that a proportion of the board should be composed of specialists in the adoption field.  The Minister for Posts and Telegraphs took an opposite view. I would share the view of the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs.  The place for the experts in this area is at the assessment and placement investigation levels, not on the Board.  The essential qualities which the members of the board should have are stable personalities and common sense.  We have been lucky in having boards composed of such persons.</P>
    <P>It would be difficult to say which type of specialist should be on the board.  Deputy Andrews suggested specialists in adoption work, but that is a wide field.  Is it to be a paediatrician to look after medical matters, or a child psychiatrist, or the whiz-kids of the 20th century, or the sociologists.  It is hard to know what speciality should be represented. There is the danger that, if a speciality is represented on the Board and the person knows he is there representing that speciality, his special point of view may be the one he feels he has to put forward at all times. This could mar the smooth running of the Board and conflict with the professional advice the Board might be getting from the adoption society <Col N="533" /> worker or from their own social workers in a particular adoption.  By and large, the arguments are in favour of having a non-specialist board, a board of mature people with common sense.</P>
    <P>The Bill proposes to implement the recent findings of the High Court in regard to the prohibition on adoption by persons of mixed marriages.  As a result of that decision that prohibition has been removed completely.  Deputy O'Malley raised the question as to whether the entire section fell.  What the court found was that section 12(2) was unconstitutional and, as the rest of the section depended on that subsection, the entire section fell. Deputy O'Malley made a point about that case.  He said it was an unusual case.  Deputy Belton disagreed and thought it was something that could happen.</P>
    <P>There was a very unusual feature about it which probably brought it to the stage of litigation.  If the child in that case was being reared in its mother's religion, its mother could have adopted it, though not jointly with her husband.  What was unusual about this case was that the child was being reared not in the mother's religion but in that of her husband, who was not the father of the child.  It was a most unusual situation and I think Deputy O'Malley would be more correct than Deputy Belton in saying that it is most unlikely to happen again. It highlighted this problem and it anticipated the change I was proposing. As I said, the Bill with the change in it was actually ordered for First Reading on the day the judgment was delivered.</P>
    <P>Where a child is to be placed in a mixed marriage there will be need to inform and obtain the consent of the natural mother to such placement. That provision will be in the Bill when the amendment which I propose to bring in on Committee Stage is made. I was in some doubt as to whether this proviso should be there and I mentioned that doubt in my opening speech.  Judging by the reaction of the House that doubt has been removed. I think it is a good proviso.  No objection has been voiced to it.  No doubt Deputies will give it further <Col N="534" /> consideration between now and Committee Stage.</P>
    <P>The reasons for having that proviso are good.  It might inhibit placement altogether if mothers felt that their children would be placed in mixed marriages, unless they knew in advance and their consent was given.  If there was no provision for obtaining their consent and they knew that mixed marriages were eligible for receiving children, some mothers, for conscientious reasons, might not want to place their children at all.  As I am a firm believer in adoption, I should not like to see that consequence.  Even in the case of mothers who, at the time of placement, would not have worries on that score, they might subsequently develop scruples.  I would like to obviate that as much as possible.  It is a second valid reason for maintaining the proviso.  However, as I say, Deputies will have time to consider the point further between now and Committee Stage.  I will be interested to hear further views, if there are any on this point.</P>
    <P>Deputy O'Malley raised the point that the custody of the child is of such fundamental importance that the only forum competent and proper to decide such questions is the High Court.  I agree that this is extremely serious and must be dealt with only in a court of high jurisdiction.  In my opening speech I mentioned the possible advent of a family court and Deputy O'Malley interpreted this as meaning some sort of tribunal with social workers.  This is not my concept of a family court. My concept is that it would be part of the courts under our Constitution. While I have no fixed ideas at this stage as to its rank or level, it certainly would not be a court of inferior jurisdiction.  Deputy O'Malley can be assured that I share his opinion that the question of the custody of a child is of such fundamental importance that it must be dealt with only in a superior court.</P>
    <P>He also raised the question of birth certificate in the hope that in the long form all reference to adoption, could be deleted.  The short form, of course, does not contain any reference to adoption, but the long form does.  If the principle of telling <Col N="535" /> the child that he is adopted is invoked and practised at as early an age as possible, so that the child comes to terms with his status from a very early age and it assumes a naturalness for him, I do not think there would be any difficulties or that any hurtful or harmful situation could be caused to a child in the event of having to use the long birth certificate.</P>
    <P>The occasions demanding the production of the long certificate are few. We have to consider the other point of view that the long form of birth certificates are birth records and one of the reasons for having them is to enable people to trace their ancestors. If their accuracy, so to speak, were to be diluted by deleting references to adopted children where such references were pertinent, the accuracy of our records for research and inheritence purposes would disappear. This is a contrary point of view.  It may be a rather harsh point of view in an emotional area but it has to be put forward.  The difficulties of the situation can be met by the fact that the short certificate does not contain any reference to the adoptive status of the holder of a certificate. Secondly, parents should be encouraged, and are encouraged, to make sure that their children know from as early an age as they have sense to comprehend it that they are adopted children.</P>
    <P>Deputy O'Malley raised the question of the removal of children abroad.  This is prohibited in the 1952 Act, section 40 of which has stringent provisions in relation to the removal from the State of children.  It was, however, right that it should be raised so that the matter could be kept under observation.</P>
    <P>Deputy Andrews queried the meaning of the second part of section 6, that is, the new form of section 15 (1) and he asked what exactly it meant. The object of it is not to have a consent hanging in the air.  Deputy Andrews said that this point had been referred to him by people in the adoption world but I should like to point out that this is a repeat of what was in the earlier Act.  In practice <Col N="536" /> most consents are given after the application for adoption so that the provision in practice will have relevance only in cases where the person giving consent knows the adopters.</P>
    <P>Deputies Andrews and O'Malley raised the question of the probationary period and said that, while we have reduced the age at which consent to adoption can be given to six weeks, this does not necessarily mean that the adoption order would be made any sooner than they are being made because the probationary period of six months is being provided for. However, this probationary period is not mandatory.  It is desirable in the board's view as being the minimum period within which the board can be satisfied that the placement is proper and that the child and parents are adjusting to each other and that a successful adoption is the likely outcome of that placement.  It is a precautionary, desirable measure and for parents who have to go through the uncertainty of that six months it is a time of stress and strain but it is unavoidable so that proper assessment can be made.</P>
    <P>The board have power in cases where they feel that a probationary period could be dispensed with or shortened to dispense with it or to shorten it.  When the Bill becomes law one could, in theory, have a consent and an adoption made within seven weeks of the birth of the child.  That legal situation is opened up by the change in the Bill.</P>
    <P>Deputy Esmonde mentioned the necessity for careful medical screening. The board is well aware of this and does have a system of medical screening of adopted children to ensure that they are healthy before being placed for adoption but it is only as efficient as the persons providing the service. It can happen that an obscure case of handicap might escape even the closest observation and the most meticulous diagnosis.  I agree that should that only come to light after the adoption has been made and the child cannot be returned it is a very traumatic experience for the adopting parents to find that they have a mentally handicapped child on their <Col N="537" /> hands.  The board is well aware of the importance of accurate medical screening in advance of adoption.</P>
    <P>There was criticism that this Bill was not accompanied by an explanatory memorandum.  This was made by Deputies O'Malley and Belton who complained of the difficulty and of the delay of having to read the Bill in conjunction with two earlier Acts. I sympathise with their point of view but I think an explanatory memorandum would not cure that difficulty because if it was to ease the situation it would have to have within it the earlier Acts so that all would be within the same cover.  However, it would not ease the difficulty of reading what is a fairly technical piece of law.  I was anxious that the Bill would not be controversial and an explanatory memorandum necessarily would have to put forward points of view in an area that could be controversial. It was important to avoid that in this particular Bill but I take their points that it was a pity that it was not forthcoming but I do not think it would have improved the contributions because they were of a high level and the Bill was well understood by Deputies.</P>
    <P>I suggest that my opening speech discharged what an explanatory memorandum sets out to do.  It explains the thinking behind the Bill and the provisions in it but it had to be assimilated there and then because the debate is an ongoing process.</P>
    <P>Deputy Belton criticised the title of An Bord Uchtála.  It is not as bad as some Irish versions, the worst one that comes to mind is An Bord Dumpála.  It has not reached that low level but, nevertheless, I take his point that people who may need to get in touch with the board in a hurry unless the name is also in the telephone directory in English translation might have some difficulty.  I presume the name is in English also in the telephone directory but if it is not I will arrange that it be inserted in English in the next issue.</P>
    <P>All Deputies joined with me in congratulating those in the adoption field, the members of the board, for the vast amount of voluntary work they <Col N="538" /> carry out and defended them from much of the criticism they have to endure and suffer in silence because the members of the board cannot become involved in public controversy. It is galling, I know, for them to read and hear criticism that is inaccurate and made without the full comprehension of the subject or the difficulties attending to the subject. These people are deserving of our thanks.</P>
    <P>Likewise, all the voluntary workers who comprise the adoption societies up and down the country and all the staff attached to the Adoption Board and the adoption societies are deserving of our thanks.  Deputy Andrews made reference to the involvement of the Department of Justice with the Adoption Board.  I should like to set the record straight, the Department of Justice is not involved with the Adopttion Board beyond the fact that it comes within the general aegis of the Department.  The Adoption Board are independent in their operations and it is my desire that that independence be maintained.  In fact they have real independence, and this is one of the reasons that has contributed to their success.</P>
    <P>In congratulating and thanking all the people who have contributed to that success we should pay tribute also to the 20,000 sets of parents who have adopted children so successfully and harmoniously during the past 20 years. These people deserve the thanks of the nation for providing stable and secure homes for all these children who, otherwise, would have been condemned to an institutional life or at least to life in homes where they would not have the benefits of full legal adoption.  The case for the abandoned child was put very sympathetically and eloquently by Deputy Esmonde.  Whether the motive for adoption is the one of having the delight of a child in the home or whether it is solely for the purpose of giving a home to a child, all those parents deserve our thanks.  As has been said during the debate there are now more would-be adoptive parents than there are children available. However, there is a class of child that can be neglected.  I refer to the child <Col N="539" /> that is handicapped physically.  The greatest act of love that adoptive parents could demonstrate would be to adopt one of these children because the task of rearing such a child requires a high degree of dedication.  No one would be expected to adopt a child that was severely mentally handicapped because children in that category require institutional care and are condemned by their medical condition to life in an institution.  There are also children who are suffering from the handicap of being of mixed race. Sometimes these are forgotten; so it is no harm to avail of the opportunity of this discussion to draw the attention of persons who may be waiting for a long time for children to the existence of these other children who are not normally put forward for adoption but who have to be requested specially.</P>
    <P>I thank the House for the sympathetic and constructive way in which the Bill has been received.</P>

      <NameTxt>Parliamentary Secretary to the Taoiseach (Mr. Kelly)</NameTxt>
      <P>When I concluded last Thursday I had been speaking about the telephone service and I had in mind to add some fairly minor points to what I had said already in regard to that service and to the Post Office service.  However, the hour is pushing on and I shall not trouble the House with as long a speech as I had intended; but I should like to put to the Minister a few matters, some of them of a minor nature, on which I should be glad to have his views.</P>
      <P>In the broad spectrum of European countries we are unique in having a very wide and thick network of post offices.  The average continental European town with a population comparable with that of, say, Limerick, would have a head post office, but would be lucky to have two sub-post offices, whereas the system we have here &mdash; I do not know whether we have inherited it or developed it &mdash; has left us with a very thick network of sub-post offices distributed in such a way that in an urban area one is rarely more than a five-minutes' walk from a post office while in the country one can count on a post office existing in every village no matter how small.  This situation is an enormous advantage so far as post office work is concerned, and it means also that the service can be used as a potential escape route in cases of national emergency of an administrative kind.  What I have in mind here particularly is the difficulty in which this country found itself on two separate occasions of a bank strike, the first of which lasted for three months and the second for five months, if not more.  Indeed, the second one was so prolonged that people were wondering whether it would ever end.  During that time cheques were used in the same way as currency.  Some people made money by printing cheque forms on which individuals could issue promises that directives to their banks would be met.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>From the point of view of the ordinary citizen these two strikes may not have been very severe but the repercussions for the business community were severe.  Although both <Col N="541" /> strikes occurred during the tenure of office of the last Government there is no certainty that we might not have another such strike &mdash; so far be it from me to place unnecessary blame on the previous Government &mdash; but I should like the Minister to tell us, if possible, that somewhere in the Department there is a section with some intelligent man in charge where there is being worked out a contingency plan for using the Post Office system as a kind of make-shift banking system by establishing current accounts that would be operable through post office branches in the event of there being a bank strike of the duration and severity of the last two.  That is a point on which I should like to hear the Minister's reaction when he is replying.</P>
    <P>There are three or four other points I wish to make in regard to the postal service generally before I go on to deal with the subject of the broadcasting services.  The Minister told the House that the Universal Postal Union is to hold one of its meetings here shortly.  This organisation is used by lecturers in international law as an example of how international law functions in an unspectacular way, as it has been doing for more than 100 years, in the direction of carrying out regulations that are made freely by countries who enter into the UPU.  It is worth reflecting that this organisation came into being through a simple consideration of mutual convenience.  If a person in Dublin wishes to send a letter to a friend in Bulgaria all the State here requires is that a 7p postage stamp be affixed to the letter and that it be deposited in a mail box.  The Irish State will have completed its part of the bargain as soon as the letter goes into a sack and is sent on its way.  It is then transported by umpteen hands to Bulgaria where it will be delivered, perhaps, to the central mountain area of that remote eastern European country.  All that has been done for an expenditure of 7p to the Irish State.  The Bulgarian with whom one is corresponding will get an equivalent service by paying a small sum. This will ensure that his letter can be delivered to the far reaches of the <Col N="542" /> Mullet Peninsula by an Irish postman, very largely at the expense of the Irish State.  The essential sense of the system is its mutuality.  It works very well.</P>
    <P>The Universal Postal Union is a model of what an international organisation should be.  The common interest behind this is obvious.  I note that the union will have its annual beano &mdash; if that is not too frivolous a word to use, but my experience of these international congresses is that they very rarely rise above the level of a beano &mdash; here in the near future. I hope the Minister will let the rest of the world see that we have a fair share of good sense.  I hope the Universal Postal Union meeting in Dublin will be remembered for the abolition of some of its idiotic and antiquated rules.  I could list these all night but the House does not wish to hear them.</P>
    <P>I should like to see the Universal Postal Union celebrate its meeting in Dublin by deciding to do away with sealing wax as a necessity in the registration of post.  In less sophisticated times to put sealing wax on a knot guaranteed that the package would not be opened by an unauthorised hand.  Those days have gone. Does anyone seriously imagine that the perfunctory dab of sealing wax applied to the knot of a parcel by a Post Office official is a guarantee against anything?  A child could open the knot and replace the blob of sealing wax with another blob.  The fact that the package had been opened would be indiscernible to the cursory glance, which, of course, is the only kind of glance the package will ever get from any postal official between here and Istanbul.</P>
    <P>The whole system of the registration of packets and parcels is a technical one on which I will not offer views.  To me it has always seemed a nuisance.  No one in this age uses sealing wax for anything at all except for the necessary registration of parcels which are tied by string.  Only for that, there would not be such a thing as a sealing wax company in existence.  Even the lawyers &mdash; and everybody knows they are conservative &mdash; have done away with seals, in <Col N="543" /> the sealing wax sense, because a legal document can be sealed with a paper seal.  A wafer with a little gum at the back of it will do as a seal.  The necessity to use this wax in order to shore up the insurability of a parcel or the responsibility of a postal department for the safety of the parcel can no longer be defended.  I would like to see the meeting of the UPU in Dublin remembered for the disappearnce from international postal practice of idiotic and antiquated requirements of that sort.</P>
    <P>I was interested to hear the Minister say that philatelic operations of his Department brought in more money last year.  He said £130,000 had been harvested by what were identifiable sales of stamps for philatelic purposes.  I wish him good luck in that respect.  I will not bore the House with my views on the design of postage stamps.  I was upset when I heard that the Minister proposed to replace the existing permanent series. It does not matter whether one likes the permament series.  I dislike the practice in the modern world of doing away with something which is perfectly all right and putting something else in its place.</P>
    <P>We had our first issue of stamps in 1922 which persisted into the late 1960s when it was replaced by the present series.  That first series was an old-fashioned, poorly designed and not very interesting series.  It had a sword of light, a Celtic Cross and the arms of the provinces.  It was an unimaginative and dull series; but to me it stood for the stability of the Irish State under all Governments from that day to this.  That series stood for the fact that this State was essentially &mdash; naturally I do not deprecate the social advance &mdash; politically and constitutionally the same kind of State it had been 50 years previously.  I was very sorry to see that series, although artistically it may not have been defensible, being ditched in favour of a new series, even though I like it. This new series shows animals allegedly taken from Celtic manuscripts. What is the reason for ditching this new series?  What is this <Col N="544" /> passion for change?  I am not necessarily one of nature's conservatives.  I think it is unhealthy, in small and great things, that one should be always looking for things to smash and replace.  Is the change to be made because the stamps are easily forged? Or has an unnamed expert decided that they are not aesthetically satisfactory or do not fulfil their subsidiary function of attracting tourists? Why is the present permanent series of Irish postage stamps being discarded?</P>
    <P>As a footnote on the subject of design, I will illustrate the madness to change things which we have all grown up with and which are in a small way a part of our lives.  I noticed during the last two years, and this was started by the previous Government, that the old symbol of the Department of Posts and Telegraphs, the so-called Gaelic script  was discarded.  Why has that gone by the board, on all but the oldest vans which nobody has bothered to repaint?  It is being replaced by modern lower case Roman sans serif &ldquo;p+t&rdquo;.  To me that symbol is hard to read.  Whether it is right or wrong, I protest against the passion to do away with the symbol which we all remember from our childhood.  The new symbol would be perfectly acceptable as the badge for an industry or business.  Why could we not have held on to the old symbol?  What was wrong with it? Probably some trendy young man with a tweed tie was given 50 guineas to sit down and design a new symbol for the Department of Posts and Telegraphs for no obvious reason.  If there is a reason I would be glad to hear it from the Minister and from his predecessor.  This was done at public expense.</P>
    <P>The drab green vans were changed into marigold vans.  Is there a sound reason for that?  Drab green is a better colour for a van than marigold. A bright colour when it gets dusty or dirty looks a good deal shabbier than a dull colour.  But one cannot prevent Post Office vans from getting drab and dirty.  I am sorry to see the old green vans with the old  which I remember from my earliest childhood disappearing, in favour of marigold <Col N="545" /> vans with their, to me, not easily legible and unnecessary replacement in these lower case sans serif letters about which I have spoken.</P>
    <P>That is a small point.  I almost apologise for taking up five minutes of the time of the House by mentioning it.  I would like to register this protest because of what I see as a general tendency both in Ireland and in the world.</P>
    <P>The last thing I want to say about the postal service is something which may seem even smaller to the Minister. In my long years as a householder in Dublin I have been friendly with postmen who come to my door. I have often had sympathy with these men who worked in all kinds of weather trying to stuff the literature which I get through a small letterflap in my door.  Partly to facilitate them and also to make sure that my post was not damaged beyond recognition, I installed a large letterbox some time ago in my own house.  I do not say that to seek the praise of the House, but I think the Minister would be doing a useful service in alleviating the conditions of some of the State's employees if he were to recommend to the Department of Local Government and to local authorities which build houses on a large scale that the size of the standard letterbox flap in private houses should be enlarged.</P>
    <P>The documents which every Deputy gets every day of the week and the shiny reports from State-sponsored bodies will not go into the ordinary letterbox.  I hope that the Members do not think I am complaining about the material arriving at my house.  I am merely putting myself in the position of the postman who travels a couple of miles a day in a suburban area in a highly-populated district.  This man has to push a big wad of post through slots which are barely wide enough to take a Christmas card.  Since the local election campaign started, I have been going around my constituency.  When I come to a house where there is no one in I put the canvassing material through the letterbox, having written a few words on it indicating that it is a <i>billet doux</i> from their Deputy and <Col N="546" /> saying that I am sorry to miss them. In at least 99 out of every 100 houses the dimensions of the available letterbox slot appear to be six inches by two inches.  I reflect on what my life would be if it was my business to stuff enormous masses of material, such as every Deputy in the House gets, as well as many other people get, into slots six inches long and, perhaps, one-and-a-half or two inches wide.  The Minister should do something to ease the work of the employees.  He could recommend that no house would be built by a local authority, or would qualify for a local authority loan, which did not have reasonable access for the kind of material which is common in postal deliveries today. These are the points I wish to make about the general postal service and the telephone service.</P>
    <P>I come now to the question of broadcasting.  My departure point was conveniently made for me by Deputy Blaney the other day when he said in the course of the speech on the Estimate that he thought Irish nationality was weakening.  I do not think there is a Deputy in this House whose political views and mine would be further apart.  I barely need to wait for Deputy Blaney to get up before I know he is going to say something with which I profoundly disagree. But that particular sentiment which he voiced here was one with which I agree.  The Deputy speaks in blunt words.  He deserves the thanks of the House for saying something I have been waiting for someone to say for a long time.  The Deputy said we were weakening as a people.  I believe that is true.  We are weakening as a people not in the sense that the three million people in the Republic are individually becoming lazier, but in the sense that the idea of national identity which sustained their predecessors, whether they belonged to the physical force tradition or to the parliamentary tradition through suffering and sacrifice, is weakening. Deputy Blaney is right about that.  It is very important.</P>
    <P>If the kind of man that John Redmond was on one side, or Pearse was on the other side, had been able <Col N="547" /> to look forward 60 years and see the kind of country that would be produced by their joint efforts &mdash; and it was by their joint efforts in a sense&mdash; they might have asked themselves if it was worth their while giving up their lives or virtually dying of broken hearts to produce the kind of country which is culturally so porous, so pregnable, so vulnerable and so lacking in self-confidence and without belief in itself as that which exists in 1974.</P>
    <P>I quite realise that when we talk about cultural leadership we are only a step away from ugly things.  When talking about them, we are only a step away then from a kind of tyranny, whether fascist or communist, which we have been lucky to avoid.  I am conscious of that danger.  Deputy Blaney is right in saying that we are weakening as a people.  The number of concrete criteria which we can point out in this country to a foreigner as differentiating us from our nearest neighbours and as having justified the work, let alone the fight, to establish independence even for Twenty-six Counties, is very small indeed.  Those criteria are lessening day by day.  I am not speaking about any particular class.  The Dublin middle-class use terms like &ldquo;It was only fantastic&rdquo;.  That is not an Irish turn of speech.  A lower stratum of the population write on walls, &ldquo;Boot boys rule O.K.&rdquo;.  That is not an Irish turn of speech.  My own children, who have no inherited interest in this regard, follow English soccer clubs because they see in their schools and in their world that people take an interest in what is happening to Leeds United, Sheffield Wednesday and other clubs.  These are English soccer clubs.  It would not be so bad if they were interested in Irish soccer clubs.</P>
    <P>Driving along Irish suburban roads, one does not notice a single architectural or social feature which would identify the houses as those of Irish people.  This is so whether it is a road of corporation houses or a road on which the houses cost £20,000 to £30,000.  Similar houses and roads can be seen in Scunthorpe, Macclesfield and Bromley, Kent.  I look at the lives <Col N="548" /> of the people in these houses and from what I see there is nothing which differentiates them from people across the water.  I do not think one should give up one's way of life in order to be different, but I recognise that the people in the generations before us &mdash; and in this I hope I am speaking for Deputies on both sides of the House &mdash; whether they believed in the constitutional or the physical force way of doing things, felt then there was something in this country which deserved a separate existence and breathing space &mdash; something which could never get that breathing space under a British government. That is why I believe men broke their hearts or shed their blood for Ireland in the centuries gone by.  I dislike the word &ldquo;culture&rdquo; and, like Hermann Goering, I tend to reach for my gun when I hear it mentioned but I am afraid that these men would be disappointed at the degree to which the shape and taste of our life here are becoming progressively more and more meshed into that of the island next to us.  In saying that I do not want to be taken as saying anything anti-British. If I were British I would be proud of it, but I am not, and I recognise that this House and all the panoply here of a separate parliament exist only because our fathers and grandfathers would not recognise that they were British either.  I have to ask myself then what would their reaction be if they were still alive to speak their minds about the island they would see today.  I am afraid their reaction would be one of disappointment, a feeling that they had given their blood and broken their hearts for nothing.</P>
    <P>We have Bills passed into law here and there is absolutely no reason to suppose we would not have had the same legislation if the British had remained here.  There are exceptions. The Bill we had this afternoon was an exception.  I was moved by the public spirit, the unanimity and similarity of feeling between both sides and by the fine speech of Deputy Andrews, the Opposition spokesman on Justice.  I know we have an adoption system here which is different from and better than the one they <Col N="549" /> have in Britain, but most of our legislation and most of our ways of doing things are not different.  Not only are they not different but they are merely cogged from the British.</P>
    <P>This has been a long prologue and the Chair has been very patient in putting up with it as an introduction to what I want to say about Radio Telefís Éireann and the broadcasting system under the Minister's charge.  I think the sustaining of Irish nationality &mdash; I do not mean the idiotic, Chauvinistic inflation of Irish nationality&mdash; but the sustaining of it and the prevention of Irish people ever being ashamed of what they are, of the way they speak, of where they come from and who their parents were and where they were born &mdash; and the sustaining of their kind of culture, whether it be good or bad, is something on which a broadcasting service can have a unique effect and I am supported in that belief by the Broadcasting Review Committee.</P>
    <P>The Minister had some hard words to say about them, and I agree with him in some of his hard words, but I am supported in what I say by the most central of their conclusions at page 20, paragraph 341.  The committee noted the lack of any statement in existing legislation as to what the purpose of broadcasting is and they very rightly tried to say what they thought it should be.  They said, and I agree with them:</P>
    <P>Broadcasting should be concerned with safeguarding, enriching and strengthening the cultural, social and economic fabric of the whole of Ireland.</P>
    <P>I have already said it is very easy to teeter into fascism, communism, into tyranny or puritanism if one takes a text like this and over-drives it.  I am not asking the Minister to do that, but I believe that this is very near what most people who think about it would expect the purpose of a broadcasting system to be.  I should like to see a system here, no matter what it cost and no matter what the difficulties may be, accepting its role to sustain Irish nationality.  We are a small people.  We are a poor people.  We have the misfortune to share a language with the <Col N="550" /> most powerful cultural complex in the world, a culture which is by no means in certain respects congenial to our way of life, and we are battered, I believe, by the cultural environment mediated to us through that language.</P>
    <P>Radio Telefís Éireann has got a duty to sustain Irish nationality.  If I appear to be diverging from anything the Minister has said inside or outside the House he will, I hope, be big enough to forgive me.  I believe that Radio Telefís Éireann has sometimes, perhaps, been not fully responsible for dragging politics into everything.  I believe that a large slice of the Telefís Éireann staff understand in their heart of hearts the obligation the Broadcasting Review Committee would wish to see formally accepted, and even the oddest or maddest of them has a very strong sense of Irish nationality and of the function RTE has in this regard. I am swallowing and choking down my very strong feelings about what I think has been occasionally&mdash; I do not mind saying &ldquo;deliberately&rdquo;&mdash;the glorification by one branch or other of RTE of movements which I believe deserve nothing but the one hundred per cent hostility of decent Irish people.  I am choking all that back.  I am not going to dwell on it. But, leaving that aside, I believe the majority of the staff, or a very large proportion of it, particularly those dealing with Irish language programmes, have got a sense of Irish nationality and a sense of responsibility for it and, so far from seeing less of them &mdash; again I hope this will be taken as a sign of open government when I say this in the Minister's presence &mdash; I would like to see the influence of that section, if only they would keep their politics out of it, growing rather than diminishing.</P>
    <P>I believe that those whom we sometimes, a little derogatorily, perhaps, call Gaeilgeoirí, even the maddest of them, belong to the best people we have.  Some of them are very mad, but I still believe they belong to the best people we have and I believe they represent, even in their madness &mdash; a lot of their madness arises from the frustration they have suffered and the hypocrisy they have been shown <Col N="551" /> by this State on both sides over the last 50 years &mdash; real Irish nationality. I believe they are basically a people who deserve support and understanding, even though it is sometimes hard enough to understand them and hard enough to support them and their equation of Irish nationality with a political point of view of which I would be ashamed.  They enrage me and, I am sure, many others; but I believe they deserve admiration and support for struggling both inside and outside RTE in face of a hostile world.</P>
    <P>It might be socially easier for them and, perhaps, materially more advantageous for them to throw in the towel but they do not do that and, if these Gaeilgeoirí are the worst tyrants or the worst fanatics this country ever has to deal with, we will be getting off very lightly and very easily because they are basically people who, when they first started off 60, 70 or 80 years ago only had a culture in mind.  They have been opposed by political interests.  They have been treated with disdain and hypocrisy by the State, but they keep on plugging, trying to do what they think right for the country, in conditions that are unpopular, conditions in which it is easy to sneer at them.  I think they deserve the gratitude of the people of this State, whether or not they are wealthy.  We should make an effort to sever our feelings of gratitude towards them for that from our feelings of rage &mdash; and in my case it is unspeakable rage &mdash; for, in the case of many of them, trying to shackle the Irish language movement on to the physical force movement in the sense which that phrase bears today, which includes the &ldquo;excusable&rdquo;&mdash; in inverted commas &mdash; murdering of innocent people.</P>
    <P>I know the Minister will take this in a friendly spirit.  I would like to see that lobby &mdash; if it can be called such although I have no evidence that it actually works as such &mdash; I should like to see that branch of the broadcasting services strengthened. Even if it is cost us money I should like to see it strengthened.  I should like to see a full radio and television service <Col N="552" /> in both languages.  I, for one, would be willing to defend here in the Dáil what financial sacrifice was necessary to make that possible.  My favourite Irish author &mdash; and I do not mind telling the House if it is of any interest &mdash; in this century is the late Brian O'Nolan who wrote a column in <i>The Irish Times</i> under the pen name of Myles na gCopaleen.  I often think, particularly in moments of dejection, that he was the only completely sane Irishman born in this century.  Although he was a savage enemy of all cant, hypocrisy, and humbug, and mercilessly demolished the pretensions of anyone, Gaeilgeoir or otherwise, I remember one article he wrote probably 30 years ago, sometime during the war, in which he picked up for a change the whinings of some group who complained that Mr. de Valera was spending £500,000 a year on restoring the Irish language.  From memory &mdash; it is one of my bedside books and I know the article almost by heart &mdash; what Myles na gCopaleen said was this: &ldquo;I may be a wild Paddy, but I take the view that for a poor country like ours to spend £500,000 a year in trying to revive a language is nothing to apologise about; nothing to be ashamed of; it is a civilised and urbane pursuit particularly at a time when the so-called civilised nations of the world are spending about £200,000,000 a day trying to destroy each other&rdquo;.  In a nutshell, that is my point of view about it too.  If only I could see that the effort had the hearts of people in Government, on whatever side they may be, behind it and it was producing results, I would be completely happy.</P>
    <P>That is the correct attitude towards this thing; it is nothing to be ashamed of.  I believe that RTE must pull its weight here.  Even if it means spending money on it, even if it means a penny on the pint, I would put that penny on the pint in order to raise the Irish language from the condition in which it is.  I do not mean it is in a poor condition but it is in a posture of defence.  I would put money into that and I would defend it here even if it meant having to produce a budget, perhaps at a time which might <Col N="553" /> not suit too well, and having to explain to the people why you were putting a penny or tuppence on the pint.  I would do that, because I think that is the kind of thing for which this State was founded; for which the people on the constitutional side worked or, on the other side, died. If we did not fight and work for our independence for purposes like that, what did we work for?  Was it merely that we would have a kind of glorified county council of our own?  Or what was it for?  because, day by day, I see these national objectives receding further and further into the distance. It is becoming more and more socially acceptable by people on all political sides to sneer at, laugh at, or speak dismissively or condescendingly about this objective.</P>
    <P>The last thing I want to say about the Irish language and its position in regard to Telefís Éireann is this: that the assaults on Gaeilgeoírí are very often justified because, as I have said, they very often tie their flag to a mast which I would hack to the ground if I could.  Although that is true, as a movement they are weak. They have not got the pulling or pushing power of other pressure groups.  They do not draw enough water in Fine Gael, Labour or Fianna Fáil to make any real difference.  Let me be quite honest about it: this House and country have seen in the past couple of months the Government &mdash; having issued a White Paper on taxation proposals &mdash; producing a further set of proposals which, while in no way departing from the principle of capital taxation, represented a very substantial modification of those proposals.  We are not children and no one is going to make hay of this because everybody knows that one of the reasons behind that change was that the representations which the Government were getting from professional organisations, trade associations and other interests &mdash; all perfectly legitimate interests &mdash; were powerful ones and could not be ignored.</P>
    <P>The Irish language lobby would not succeed in getting something like that done for itself.  It is an easy dog to <Col N="554" /> kick; it is an easy target.  The Irish language lobby would not have knocked a halfpenny off the wealth tax but the massive reaction of individuals, political and trade organisations did so.  When I see a body which represents, in no matter how distorted a form, something which the people who went before us worked and slaved for &mdash; even if they did not die for it &mdash; having to defend itself against attacks, I say to myself: With all their faults, these are people I should stand up for. I detest and abominate the tendency of these organisations to get involved in savagery.  I will call it no other thing and I never have called it anything else; I have never put fine words on what is barbarous and shameful.  I think the Irish language lobby has got itself mixed up with deeds and activities that would make one ashamed of being Irish and sometimes have made me ashamed of being Irish.  But, when all that is said and done, these are people who, for the most part, are not in this effort for what they can get out of it.  For the most part they represent a movement which is weak, which cannot bring all that much pressure to bear on a Government or Opposition; and that means that it should be defended by decent people; it should not be stamped on or stood on.  It should be criticised; it should be checked; it is in no way immune from the world of criticism, opposition or hostility when it does, as I believe many of its representatives have done, ally itself with barbarism and savagery. If we can get away from that &mdash; and that is not easy; I do not want to get away from it; I realise the immediacy of people's lives and deaths must take precedence over what I am talking about &mdash; but if it is possible, in a time of agony such as that which we are now going through, to separate these things, the Irish language lobby would be far from being an object of laughter, which they are conventionally amongst the middle class &mdash; I will not put a tooth in it &mdash; the middle class and whatever comes under the middle class as well. There is no particular class in this country, high, middle or low, which has a completely clean sheet in regard to this.  It has been sneered at by too many people too often and those who, <Col N="555" /> for the most part, have worked and given their lives for nothing, for no reward, except for doing what they believed their fathers and grandfathers had worked for.</P>
    <P>Whether it was only by contributing to the Irish Nationalist Party, the Redmondites, or going out and spilling their blood, these people deserve the support of this State and the ideals they stood for deserve the support of the State and the State broadcasting system.  Even if it meant not a penny but five pence on the pint I would provide an all-Irish television and radio service, not impose it on people, not substitute it for the English language one, but as a choice or alternative. I know it cannot be done overnight and I am not trying to make small beer of what are very substantial difficulties.</P>
    <P>I want to put on record what my feelings are on the matter: I am not ashamed of them and I think that many other people, if they devoted their minds to it, would be not far from agreeing with me.</P>
    <P>The last thing I want to say concerns section 31 of the principal Act which has been used, for the most part, in order to prevent material of certain kinds being broadcast.  The last Government &mdash; and it was a frequent matter of complaint from my point of view &mdash; when they wanted something broadcast or not broadcast, could make a telephone call and things did not go out, like the programme about the Mount Pleasant planning scheme which Mr. Boland did not want broadcast or like the programme about the Special Branch which the then Minister for Justice &mdash; I cannot remember who he was &mdash; did not want sent out.  That was the end of that.  This Government, so far as I am aware, make a practice &mdash; whenever they require something to be broadcast or not to be broadcast &mdash; of putting it on the record via a direction through section 31.</P>
    <P>I should like to draw the attention of the House to the fact that section 31 has two subsections.  One deals with the prohibition on the broadcasting of certain types of material and the other <Col N="556" /> subsection, which is positive rather than negative, empowers the Minister who has collective responsibility with the whole Government to direct the broadcasting of certain material.  At the risk of being called a fascist beast who wants to indoctrinate people, I believe that power has not been sufficiently used.  I should like to see section 31 liberally used by the Government in regard to putting across messages about which, broadly speaking, there is no disagreement.  The degree to which that is done at present is minimal.  We get advertisements from the Department of Local Government &mdash; all credit to them &mdash; in regard to road safety and these are well made.  There are advertisements &mdash; I do not think they are all that well made &mdash; in regard to smoking put out by the Department of Health; but at the risk of doing the unforgivable thing in modern Ireland and going a step beyond the English for a change, instead of trailing along on their coat tails and waiting for 20 years after they have done something, I should like to see the broadcasting service &mdash; I would wish to have a consensus about this; I would not want any Government to use this power in the teeth of what the Opposition were willing to accept &mdash; undertake the transmission of certain broad generalities in advertising form, and explicitly as such, under section 31, under direction of the Government through the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs.</P>
    <P>There are large social problems here which go miles beyond anything as simple as the health problem regarding the tendency of smoking to give one heart disease or lung cancer. I believe these social problems might be responsive to large scale advertising provided it were not done in an offensive way.  I do not want the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs or the Taoiseach to lecture people in the Castro mode with four hour speeches urging them to do good and avoid evil.  But there are large-scale problems which I think would respond to positive direction.  I believe it would have to be a consensus direction and it would be quite wrong if any Government were to put across a <Col N="557" /> message which suited its own ideological book but was poison to the Opposition.  I want to make that clear in case the idea ever becomes actual.</P>
    <P>We all know that a family which is not, say, sufficiently equipped educationally to understand the consequences of getting into progressive debt and is not able to budget should be preserved from the consequences of excessive hire purchase commitments. I am certain Deputies opposite would agree about that.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiBrugha" hpid="Ruairí Brugha Ruairí Brugha">
      <NameTxt>Ruairí Brugha</NameTxt>
      <P>Certainly.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMKelly" hpid="Mr. Kelly Mr. Kelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>I am grateful to Deputy Brugha for conceding that.  We all agree about that.  Why cannot we have programmes &mdash; I agree we are only a hairsbreadth away from paternalism, from quite ugly things to which I would be first to object &mdash; to put that message across?  There are people educationally so handicapped or whose family background is so poor that they cannot see the consequences of landing themselves in hire purchase debt.  I can see it as a Deputy, when they come to me, and so can Deputy Brugha and Deputies behind him and I know the despair it causes.  I can see the consequences of improvidence; but what I cannot see is why the State is somehow debarred from taking an interest in this human weakness which produces such frightful social problems.  I see families up to their necks in debt. There would never be such a thing as excessive money lending, let alone the 7 Days tribunal which occupied the public scene for months on end, if people were provident, trained to be provident, and if this was regarded as on of the ordinary virtues of a citizen, particularly of one with the responsibility of a family.  I cannot see why there should not be section 31 directives to Telefís Éireann to broadcast programmes directed at making people budget in such a way that they did not land themselves in this kind of situation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Many people are impervious to advertising of this kind but I should like to see it tried.  There was a row in RTE about six years ago and three quite prominent people resigned from <Col N="558" /> it and, having done so, they sat down and typed out a record and produced a book which gave their experiences in RTE, dressed up in a language more appropriate to the invasion of Normandy than the resignation of three broadcasters, but yet a most interesting and exciting book.  They alleged that a programme which had been laid on by RTE to help consumers to spend their money properly had been taken off at the instance of commercial interests whose advertising they felt was being dented by this warning to viewers to be careful not to be taken in by such things as &ldquo;3p off&rdquo; and &ldquo;4p off&rdquo; and so on.  I notice that the Broadcasting Review Committee was told &mdash; and I accept it &mdash; by RTE executives that that was not the reason for taking off this programme, that there were other reasons.  But the committee acidly noted that that programme had not been replaced.  In other words, whether these people were right or wrong in alleging that commercial pressure had resulted in the killing of this programme about consumer spending, trying to make people spend their money wisely, that programme is dead and has been dead for the past six years and there is nothing to replace it to show people how to spend wisely and not spend on cheap, perishable goods but in such a way that they will have something to show for it later.</P>
    <P>That is a sad position.  I believe it should not be left merely to the programme makers to devise programmes like that.  I should like to hear from somebody what magic line there is which prevents the State from putting across a message like this.  We know improvidence and thriftlessness cause severe social problems.  Why cannot this important and effective medium be used to head them off if that can be done?</P>
    <P>There is another matter even more difficult and delicate and in mentioning it at all I am leaving myself open to the charge of being a fascist of an even deeper dye, but it is something which, if not the cause is certainly the accompaniment and possibly a cause of severe social problems here.  It is the rapidly decreasing marriage age.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="559" /> Naturally, any Member of the House would be glad to see more Irish people rather than fewer married.  We are glad the population trend has been reversed and that there is net immigration instead of emigration &mdash; I hope I shall not be misunderstood &mdash; but I notice that the people who come to see me in my little clinic with severe problems &mdash; usually housing but also other problems &mdash; are people who married at an age at which their parents would never have thought of getting married, very often when they did not know where they would lay their heads.</P>
    <P>In the time of our parents or grandparents you would be thought highly improvident if you did this.  I am not speaking about the Protestant ethic. Protestants have the name of being more careful and thinking of the morrow in a way Catholics have not &mdash; rightly or wrongly.  But the ordinary Catholic in Ireland thought twice before undertaking a serious thing like matrimony.  The 50 or 60-year-old bachelor was a stage joke.  Of course, there was a strong economic dimension in this.  These were reasons which go back to the Famine and beyond it. I think the Famine was recognised by the people who were alive then as being a consequence of the fantastic, sudden explosion of the Irish population between 1780 and 1840 when people got married when they were very young, subdivided their holdings and bred large families.  That left a dreadful scar on the national conscience or memory, and possibly the delaying of matrimony afterwards had something to do with it.  Certainly the kind of stage Irish bachelor, the 60-year-old who had been walking out for 20 years, was a legitimate figure of fun but there were plenty of other people, those in their thirties, who waited before they got married to see where they would lay their heads.</P>
    <P>I hope I have the understanding of the House on this.  I am not such a hard-hearted person as not to understand the call of the flesh and the heart, and I can perfectly well see that people who think they cannot live without each other must get married.  Of course, the State must not prevent <Col N="560" /> them and it owes a duty of charity and compassion to help them as far as possible but, at the same time, the crude experience of every public representative, of clergy and social workers, is that the younger the marriages are contracted the more problems they tend to create.  Dublin Deputies such as Deputies Brugha, Fitzpatrick and others &mdash; and I am sure this can be said of Deputies from Kildare, Galway or elsewhere &mdash; will know of many cases where a woman of 21 or 22 years comes into their clinic looking for a corporation house. She may have two children, with another on the way, and living either with her mother or mother-in-law. There could be 13 or 14 people in a three-bedroomed corporation house; perhaps her own mother is not past the child-bearing age and both women could be pregnant simultaneously. Probably the mother's family is quite large, maybe there are sons of 20 or 21 who come in at night-time having had a few drinks and make life difficult for the children.  The whole syndrome of overcrowding is intimately associated with a very low marriage age.  While it is easy to be misrepresented or to be thought cold-hearted when protesting about this, the fact is that people who get married, who move into their parents' home, are a social problem almost immediately. Every Deputy knows this is true.</P>
    <P>I cannot imagine what a television programme would look like if it were designed to head people off from that situation.  I can well imagine it could be very indelicately and disgustingly handled if we had a programme that effectively told people not to get married.  I do not want that to happen but, if the television service is going to do what the committee rightly thought it should do, attention should be paid to the large-scale social phenomena which have such deadly effects which all of us feel.</P>
    <P>It is not just a case of the housing shortage.  We could never build enough houses to keep up with this tendency if it went on indefinitely.  I can see no rule of thumb that should prohibit this Minister, or any other Minister, from acknowledging that he <Col N="561" /> has in his control a most powerful weapon of persuasion and instruction and this horrible social problem which grips hundreds of thousands of people could be averted or reduced if the vehicle which reaches their fireside every night were to contain some warning or instruction that would alert them to what is ahead of them. Even though the people may be only 20 or 21 years, time goes by very quickly and they may face the kind of situation I have outlined in 20 or 30 months' time.</P>
    <P>I am quite well aware that what I am saying is open to misrepresentation but I know the gentlemen here will not do that to me.  I should like to see television a good deal less shy, and I should like to see this Government, of the other crowd if and when they get into office&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. G. Fitzgerald Mr. G. Fitzgerald">

      <NameTxt>Mr. Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>I meant the Opposition. If this Government do not take the action I have suggested, I hope that if the Opposition get into office they will do so, that they will be less shy about trying to make out of the broadcasting service an instrument of instruction.  I do not mean brainwashing or ideological tyranny but enlightenment for people instead of what it is at present.</P>
      <P>Enough Deputies have complained about the terrible programmes on our television service, the canned muck about Scotland, with a Scottish fellow singing songs, horse operas from the Wild West and so on.  I will not go into this area but my feelings can be imagined.  Quite apart from that, television should be less shy in propagating a message among Irish people which would represent an honest consensus attempt to alleviate serious social problems and to sustain the national identity.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The national identity is there, provided the people can be protected from the effects of a lack of selfconfidence and feeling ashamed of themselves because all the forces of the modern world conspire to make them this way.  If the television service <Col N="562" /> could be more courageous it would have justified itself.  When this Government were elected I had great hopes &mdash; I still have them &mdash; that we were going to do something not done before in a general way by any Government. I had thought we would march ahead of what they do in England.  We are always looking over our shoulder at what the English are doing.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnMKelly" hpid="Mr. Kelly Mr. Kelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>I accept we are not in disagreement about that.  In all areas we tend to wait until the English do something, even if it is only the production of a seven-sided 50-pence piece, and then we copy it.  Let us march ahead of them and not be afraid if someone says we are a crowd of prating Puritans or Fascists.  There should be a consensus, so far as the broadcating service is concerned, regarding the necessity to sustain the national identity which is the only thing worth fighting and working for. I would sooner be an Englishman, be under the Union Jack, than live in a kind of fake country where the things which seemed important to our grandfathers have been forgotten.  I am sure the Deputies on the far side do not disagree about that.  If the service could be used to sustain that identity and to carry the social messages I have described it would deserve well of the people.  What is needed is courage. By courage in this context is meant not waiting until the English do something, rather we should do it ourselves.  That is the message I will give the Minister and I hope he and his Department will take it to heart.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickPower" hpid="Mr. Power Mr. Power">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Power</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to compliment the Minister on the format of the notes presented to enable us to digest his Estimate.  I found them most helpful and informative in that they outlined the varied functions of his Department.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One of the items that struck me most forcibly is the fact that the Department of Posts and Telegraphs pay out many millions of pounds <Col N="563" /> annually but that there are very few cases of misappropriation of funds.  I am sure it is the case that the evil men do is instantly publicised in these cases but the good is often interred with their bones.  In the Department there is an excellent staff and certainly in my area the postman always comes on time.</P>
    <P>The staff I know in the different sections of the Department are helpful and courteous.  When you compare the attention you get from the Department with the attention you get from the Department of Social Welfare, the Department of Posts and Telegraphs come out very well.  If letters were delayed as long as the issuing of cheques is delayed in the Department of Social Welfare there would be uproar. I compliment those who work in the Department.  They are constantly at the beck and call of the public and they do their job well. Compliments are due to the Minister, too, on the courtesy he extended to me in all my dealings with him during the year.  I must admit that when he took office I was not prejudiced in his favour.  I did not expect the courtesy which he extended to me.  During the course of the year the Minister improved on acquaintance.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Power</NameTxt>
      <P>The Department are used as a purchasing agency.  I wonder have they a certain amount of freedom with regard to where they purchase?  Is everything possible done to ensure that they buy and use Irish goods?  We have a duty to set a headline and we should explore every avenue to ensure that so far as possible Irish goods are purchased.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A few years ago &mdash; before the Minister's time &mdash; I was involved in negotiations with the Department for the setting up of a Swedish firm here. There was some difficulty about getting a guarantee that a certain amount of the Department's requirements would be channelled through that firm or obtained from them.  I am glad to say that they have set up here.  This means that the expertise and the technical know-how we have can be utilised at <Col N="564" /> home.  In future we should try to produce the more sophisticated equipment which the Department require. A small firm in Kilcullen have acquired a contract to supply certain smallish items to the Department.  This has led to the success of a small firm and the employment of more people in my county.  More efforts like this are needed.</P>
    <P>I was somewhat critical of the Minister when proposals were made to spend a very large sum of money in the next five years on the development of our telephone system.  I compared the amount of money being made available through the European Investment Bank for the development of the telephone service with other areas which I considered deserved a higher priority, such as the sanitary services which are required in many areas.  I suppose I should not quibble because the Minister is dealing with his own Department. I must compliment him on the success which has attended his efforts in securing this money for the development of the telephone service.</P>
    <P>The service is bad.  I have come around to the belief that good communications are essential to the development of the country and the establishment of industries.  I was told at one time that the provision of a proper network of roads would help in the development of industry.  This had not struck me but I am sure many counties in the west of Ireland would have more industries if the roads connecting Dublin with the west were better.  Industrialists who come here are enticed to go to the west but when they travel as far as Kilcock and find that they are held up at every corner, I am sure they feel more like turning back than going on to see the new site. When they use our telephone service to make a local communication or to communicate with another country, they must feel the same.</P>
    <P>We all realise that our present telephone system is outmoded and outdated. I compliment the Minister on getting this huge amount of £7½ million in the coming year, and more to come.  To the ordinary people the provision of a telephone service, when they have not got one themselves, is <Col N="565" /> not important.  I do not know what the ratio of telephones to the population is.  Ordinary people may not see any great need for telephones, but other Ministers who deal with matters affecting the every-day lives of people would do well to look about them for money for essential projects.</P>
    <P>Every day I get letters from people asking that the installation of their telephone be expedited.  If the House will bear with me I will read an extract from a letter I got today:</P>
    <P>I am writing to you in desperation. I have recently opened a business of my own and I am plagued by the fact that I cannot obtain a telephone.  I think you will appreciate how vital a telephone is in any business and to be without one for six months is disastrous.  I am an auctioneer and nobody can get in touch with me except by mail.  I first applied for a telephone when I was living in Dublin in August or September, 1972.  Subsequently I moved to this address approximately six months later &mdash;</P>
    <P>It is in the northern part of our county.</P>
    <P>&mdash; but still no satisfaction.  As well as there being an urgent business need the matter has been aggravated by the fact that neighbours on either side of me have had telephones installed despite the fact that they moved into the neighbourhood some months after me.  I think this type of treatment is grossly unfair and I would implore you to do something for me as my business stands in jeopardy if I have no telephone.</P>
    <P>That is a genuine letter which arrived in my post today and its sentiments would be re-echoed 100 times during the year by people who need a telephone.</P>
    <P>It is bad enough to need a telephone but to feel that there is a political influence at work which could provide a telephone more quickly for somebody who did not need it as badly as an earlier applicant is very frustrating and aggravating.  For all I know this attitude existed in the Department of Posts and Telegraphs <Col N="566" /> long before the present Minister took office.  He is a member of a Government who promised to do great things and he would be well-advised to ensure so far as he can that politics is taken out of his Department. I am confident that he knows this attitude exists.  He must know it has existed in his own time.  Political patronage should not exist in this area. The Government promised to remove it.  I have evidence of people getting telephones in my own area through political pull.  The Minister is aware of this too.  He should apply himself to this and see to it that this policy which may not have originated with him &mdash; I am sure it did not &mdash; will cease.</P>
    <P>I should like to bring the Minister back to a matter which I raised here at Question Time and subsequently on the Adjournment.  It was the only occasion on which I ever raised a matter on the Adjournment.  It is in my files still as unfinished business to some extent.  I refer to the delay in the reconnection of a telephone to the man in charge of the fire brigade in Maynooth.  The Minister will recall that in his answer to me at Question Time the excuse was given that there was an underground cable to the man in charge of the fire brigade while the veterinary surgeon who lived next door had an overhead cable. This was advanced as the reason for the delay.  Subsequently, the Minister wrote to me and stated that he was misinformed and that that was not the reason for the delay.  It seemed that the Minister had agreed that his investigations and the details on the file presented to him indicated that it was possible to cover up something that should not have happened and that he was misinformed on that occasion.</P>
    <P>Has the Minister ever sorted out to his satisfaction why he was told that the phone was reconnected to the man in charge of the fire brigade on a Thursday?  I am confident that the truth of the matter is that the phone was not reconnected until the following Saturday.  I have spoken to the man involved and he remembers vividly that it was reconnected on a Saturday. He told me that he was watching an <Col N="567" /> international rugby match on television with his son who is a priest in Dublin when an official from the Department of Posts and Telegraphs informed him that his phone was now working.  That was on a Saturday.  The Minister when he investigates something in his Department should not allow himself to be misinformed.  A Minister's position should be such that he knows what is happening at ground level and that no amount of covering up will prevent him from finding the truth in matters like this.</P>
    <P>I should now like to deal with the question of the provision of telephone kiosks in rural areas.  The Minister has had a rash of inquiries about these during the year.  I can recall that during his early days in the Department they caused him some annoyance.  The regularity of the questions caused the Minister some annoyance but the monotony of the answers caused annoyance on our side of the House.  If we examine this situation we will all agree that there is a case for a telephone kiosk in remote areas which are far removed from shops and other phones. In such areas the urgent need of a doctor, a priest or a veterinary surgeon means a long treck to a phone.</P>
    <P>In my county we have chosen five areas, as part of a pilot scheme, and the county council have agreed to guarantee phones installed there against working loss during the year.  I hope the scheme proves successful because in my view, it is worthwhile and should be encouraged.  Because the council have given the Department a guarantee against working loss the Department are prepared to erect kiosks in these areas.  I am confident that these kiosks will get the use that warrants their erection.  If we show our young people that we have faith in them we will have less malicious damage to telephone kiosks.</P>
    <P>When I write to the Department requesting the erection of a kiosk in a rural area I am fed back with the answer that there is a public coin box in the local sub-post office and that the amount of usage it gets does not warrant the erection of a further telephone kiosk.  Deputies who are <Col N="568" /> acquainted with rural areas and sub-post offices realise that there are often good reasons why the phone in the sub-post office does not get the use it should.  Firstly, there is a great lack of privacy in such post offices.  It is usual that the phone in such places is on the wall inside the entrance and one has to make a call while children buy ice pops at the counter and adults wait for the evening paper and purchase grocery items.  It often happens that such people if they fail to obtain a copy of the evening newspaper are not short of news having listened to the telephone conversation.  This matter should be looked into because in my view a public telephone provided in places other than the local sub-post office would be used to a greater extent.</P>
    <P>While some members bemoan the fact that the postage is dear, I feel that when one looks at the increase in values all round it is not dear.  It is wonderful that one can have a letter delivered the day after postage.  By and large, we have a very good standard of delivery.</P>
    <P>I should like the Minister to investigate the possibility of providing phones for disabled people.  I have found the Minister helpful in this regard in individual cases.  A phone would be of great assistance to those people who are disabled and have difficulty in contacting the outside world in emergencies.</P>
    <P>Three years ago I made a complaint about the telex service here.  I should like to know if the Minister's Department have received any complaints about this service and if the situation has improved in this regard.  I should also like to know what the Minister proposes to do to improve this service in the future.</P>
    <P>I should now like to deal with the attitude of our people towards saving. A savings bank is a very good idea and it should be promoted to a greater extent in all our schools.  The foundation laid in the schools should be followed on in after life.  I believe that our people differ very much in this regard from the continentals in that we have not a great desire for thrift.  With inflation running so high maybe those who are not of a thrifty mind are as well off as those who save, but every <Col N="569" /> encouragement should be given to people to provide for the future. Young people should be encouraged to save at an early age so that they can make provision for the day when they need a house.  In Germany it is customary for young boys and girls when they start work to put by a certain portion of their pay for the house which they will require later.  In my own county where people would prefer to take a chance of backing a 50 to 1 winner it would be difficult to inculcate this type of virtue but the Department of Posts and Telegraphs, and other Departments, should give people a greater incentive to save.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Power</NameTxt>
      <P>Whatever about that aspect, every effort should be made by way of extra concessions to encourage saving so that there would be a pool of ready money at the disposal of the Government, a pool of money such as was not available to them at the time they floated the last loan.  Returns for savings last year show an increase of only £0.3 million on the previous year.  That is a very significant increase and would not as much as counteract the effects of inflation. I would impress on the Minister and on every other Minister involved the need to ensure the encouragement of a policy of saving both in the primary and post-primary schools as well as in factories and other places of work.  Many organisations operate savings schemes of one type or another but the efforts in this direction should be co-ordinated to a much greater extent and we should explore every avenue open to us in our efforts to encourage people to save.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Parliamentary Secretary to the Taoiseach spoke of the dangers of hire purchase and of the desire of putting before the people a programme that would alert them to these dangers.  Perhaps a worthwhile programme on saving would be as effective as the type envisaged by the Parliamentary Secretary.  The Parliamentary Secretary was concerned also because of evidence he has regarding <Col N="570" /> a lowering of the marriage age.  This is something new in our country but it is not a matter about which I would worry unduly.  However, I was perturbed at this reference to Catholics and Protestants and to his statement that Protestants are not as prone to rushing into marriage as are Catholics. It would be dangerous for anyone to generalise in this regard.  For example, if one were to generalise about the representatives of my constituency where I am the only one who is married while the other two are bachelors and are members of the National Coalition one could draw the same sort of conclusion about the Government party and about Fianna Fáil.  I suppose some wit would say that I have made up for the tardiness of the other two.</P>
    <P>The Department would be doing a good day's work in encouraging young people to save for the future, in particular to save for homes of their own, regardless of when they would have need of their own houses.</P>
    <P>I would not be too concerned either with the previous speaker's anxiety regarding big families and the fact that grandmothers and mothers might be having children at the same time. This should be no great worry in a country that has a population of only three million people.  However, should that be a source of anxiety a remedy could be found by raising the legal age at which one could be married.  Our biggest problem remains the number of bachelors in our country.</P>
    <P>During this debate last week Deputy Blaney spoke of the lack of publicity which he received and he accused us on this side of the House of whimpering. I hear nobody whimpering in this regard but the Deputy.  He should realise that he is one Deputy out of 144 as is each one of us here.  No doubt the Deputy will be given more publicity than will be given to me but, perhaps, if I made some out-landish statements of the type that he is prone to make, I would be given publicity, too.  The Deputy said also that it was shameful that the situation in this House is such that in regard to many matters the Government party and the party to which I belong <Col N="571" /> find common ground and that Deputy Blaney is the only one who disagrees with us.  I have no sense of shame in that regard.  It would be well for Deputy Blaney to analyse why the views he expresses do not get more support in the country and why those who supported him in the past do so no more.  Perhaps he experiences a sense of shame in that all the other flowers have gone and, like the last rose of summer, he is left blooming alone.</P>
    <P>Deputy Blaney mentioned, too, that there was a weakening of the people and the Parliamentary Secretary appeared to agree with him.  I do not see any reason why the voice that differs from the general body of opinion should be given an equal share of space in the media as any other.  Although it is important that the views of each side should be made known, I should hope that the number of agnostics in this country would form only a small minority but if a person should wish to express the view that there is no God he could hardly expect to be given the same publicity as those of us who believe that there is a God.  To follow on that, possibly the views expressed recently by Lord Arran would represent his views only.  The only sentiment of his with which I would agree would be the delight he expressed when he said that he had not a drop of Irish blood in his veins because I would share his delight to that extent.  However, I do not think that Lord Arran should expect to be given equal coverage with everyone else.</P>
    <P>In the nature of things those who are extremists in their views get the most publicity because they make news while those who express the views of the ordinary people are given very little publicity.  No one wants to hear of a case of the dog biting the man.</P>
    <P>I should like to deal now with the attitude of the Minister to Irish culture. There is a volume of opinion and I think the Parliamentary Secretary subscribed to this, but not directly, that we have a right and a duty to demonstrate that to be Irish is not <Col N="572" /> merely to be English.  It is right and proper that our distinct identity and our Gaelic culture &mdash; by that I do not mean Cultúr na Gaeltachta &mdash; would be exemplified in our Irish language, in our dancing and in our music.  Of course, we have had many famous writers in the English language.  We should not lose our particular brand of Irishness.  The Parliamentary Secretary expressed this is a much better way than I am capable of doing.  He mentioned that his children seem to await the English and the American way of life on the screen.  I notice the same tendency all around me.  It should never be necessary for us to have to apologise for being Irish or for pursuing our Irish ideals.</P>
    <P>The Minister's image throughout the country, so far as I am aware, is one that raises a doubt regarding our attitude towards our Irish culture and our distinctive Irish way of life.  In some ways one is afraid that this attitude might find its way on to our television and radio programmes and that there will be portrayed on the media a way of life that we do not wish for.  My personal view is that if the attitude of the Minister is followed, it would succeed only in making us a mere province of England. It would appear that the Minister would wish us to suppress any feelings of nationalism that we may have even in so far as our songs and commemoration of past events are concerned.</P>
    <P>A number of questions were asked about the future design of our stamps. On that occasion reference was made to a design which had something to do with a rugby motif.  It was suggested that a rugby rather than a nationalistic emblem would be the right one.  I mentioned to the Minister that, perhaps, adopting a rugby emblem might be dangerous because a certain element of apartheid could creep in. He did not see the point then but, perhaps, he sees it now.  Who designs our stamps?  Do we bring in foreign experts?  Do we let our own people do it?  As a nation, we are supposed to have an imaginative flair.  Our stamps should portray our ideas.</P>
    <P>Are our news programmes geared to <Col N="573" /> being seen in England?  During the last fortnight an English journalist came here and hoped to hear some of the debates from the Press gallery. He was not allowed into the Press gallery.  He went to the public gallery but was not allowed to take notes. Therefore what he got was only second hand.  Can our radio and TV service be beamed to the public in England so that they can hear the real truth?  Have the events of the past fortnight been told to those people?  Have they heard the real truth?  As everybody knows, the ordinary English people have a sense of justice.  Are they aware that their Prime Minister and the British Army reneged on their duty in the North by allowing the loyalists to run the country for the past fortnight?  The might of the British Empire after a fortnight's inactivity could only succeed in turning their soldiers into petrol pump attendants.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>The standard of the programmes on radio and television is very good. Sports gets a good coverage.  Since Mícheál O'Hehir left there seems to have been a shifting of emphasis in racing, especially from Punchestown. The Punchestown races had a place in our lives and I should like to know why television coverage was discontinued. I know we have money difficulties. I agree with Deputy Brugha when he spoke of our small population and the small return we get from licences in comparison with other countries which have a larger population. We are dependent on advertisements, and more is the pity.  While it may be expensive, we should try to show more home produced programmes rather than the canned variety.  Programmes with a local flavour have proved to be good and they are what the people want.  I refer particularly to &ldquo;The Riordans&rdquo; which is high in the Tam ratings.  We have always assumed that we have a <Col N="574" /> certain amount of talent for acting. Why can we not channel this ability into studios such as Ardmore and produce programmes which could be sold abroad?  In that way we would be showing the Irish way of life.  This could also help our flagging tourist trade.  Home produced programmes are best.  Apart from the monetary reason, I cannot see why 75 per cent of our programmes should be a replica of what is seen on American and British screens.  Any visitor coming from America or Britain looking at television would not be aware for most of the time that they are tuned into an Irish channel.</P>
    <P>Every year there are amateur dramatic competitions held throughout the country.  Possibly I have a vested interest in mentioning this.  The group which won the All Ireland urban section came from Naas.  The group which won the All Ireland rural section also came from Rathangan, County Kildare.  With a little co-operation, surely it would be possible to have extracts, if not the whole play, seen on our screens.  If this were done every year, it would be a great boost for amateur dramatics.  It could also be the means of providing programmes which would not cost very much.</P>
    <P>Over the past 11 or 12 years television has become a way of life.  It has done wonders for the old, infirm and people who cannot go into the outside world.  Of course, it has changed the Irish way of life.  While it may be good for lonely people, it has changed the way of life in ordinary homes.  Once television is switched on conversation stops and card playing is no longer known.  We should all be very much aware of the fact that television can set a standard of values, behaviour, outlook and actions.  We have in television, as the previous speaker said, a powerful weapon which can be used for good or bad.  I suppose in general the influence over the past few years has been good.  If we examine means of improving it we could easily find them.</P>
    <P>It is a pity that certain parts of the country still have black spots.  It must be a great frustration when people <Col N="575" /> have not good reception in their homes.  I know that efforts are being made to change this.  I believe that to provide a second channel would cost £3 million in one year.  I do not know if this is possible but I hardly think it will happen this year.  Open broadcasting will probably cost £10 million. That is not likely to happen for many years.</P>
    <P>People in Leinster and the castern parts of the country have BBC reception at the moment.  There is a demand that people in the rest of the country should have it too.  Is there any possibility that our programmes could be seen in Britain?  If we are to be subjected to BBC influence, we should expect something comparable. I would never agree that we should give our channel to the BBC.  We would reach the stage where we would have no control over what is being beamed to our people if we give away our authority.  It can be said that BBC programmes are being beamed to the people in the eastern part of the country at the moment, but there is no official recognition of that.  What the Minister has in mind would be likely to give official recognition to that.  The effect would be that we would lose our identity still more. Therefore, it is important that we should control our own broadcasting.</P>
    <P>I have every sympathy with the views expressed by the Parliamentary Secretary with regard to our attitude to Irish.  He complimented me when speaking on the budget and referred to the fact that some of the tax which now causes the price of petrol to be so high should be taken off and the taxation could go on the price of beer, spirits and cigarettes.  I remember he mentioned at the time that that was a grave statement to make. Tonight it is even more grave when he has openly suggested that we should provide more money to encourage the Irish language.  It is not something we should stifle in any way.  We should be proud to have it.  I share his views on certain hardliners in the movement of Gaelgeoirí who would try to shove their views down people's necks.  I think he has the right attitude <Col N="576" /> when he mentions that we should be prepared to pay.  We should be prepared to raise taxation in order to promote Irish.  He was very insistent on that.  I would like to feel that the views expressed by the Parliamentary Secretary will find an echo in the heart of the Minister.  I would ask the Minister not to contribute to the downgrading of anything that is traditionally Irish.  We have already evidence that Irish is to play a lesser role in our schools.  Reference has been made to the revision of the Irish history books.  I do not see how anybody could write the history of Ireland without telling about the 800 years of persecution and 800 years of the struggle to survive.</P>
    <P>The Minister gave the impression that he does not want Irish and is not very enamoured of the Irish language or culture.  I would say to him that he should not sell our birthright for a mess of pottage or, in the case of broadcasting, for potted or canned messes, as the case may be.  That is what we will get if we are subjected to this mass culture from outside.</P>
    <P>The Parliamentary Secretary mentioned why the Irish language lobby did not carry much weight with any of the political parties.  There is not enough of them to form a pressure group.  They did not draw enough water in the Labour Party, Fine Gael or Fianna Fáil.  He mentioned in a comparison that the taxation proposals in the budget, when they were faced with another and stronger group, were affected.  What happened? I would agree with him entirely there.  The farming group carried enough water to ensure that the wealth tax proposals and other proposals were well diluted before they appeared in their final form.  It is debatable whether they have departed in any way from the Minister's original intention.</P>

      <P>&ldquo;Dilution&rdquo; is a good word.  I mentioned that there are many people in the Irish movement who cannot see anything but right <Col N="577" /> in their ways.  I would agree with the previous speaker on that.  Some years ago I was asked to sign a document about letting the Irish language live.  Being a teacher I have spent many years of my life giving the kiss of life to the language.  I did not feel it was necessary for me to sign any document to show my grádh for the language.  The action of the Gaelgeoirí is to be understood when it is understood that there is a pressure group on the other side also.  I refer to the Language Freedom Movement. They see no good at all in Irish. So far as Irish is concerned they want to extend very little freedom to it. The hardliners in the Gaelgeoirí movement can be understood when one compares them with the hardliners on the other side.  What we have in mind is some middle way.  The Minister should look for such a way, a way where we would be prepared to pay, if necessary, to encourage Irish.</P>
      <P>In conclusion, I should like to say that the Department of Posts and Telegraphs is one which we take for granted.  It is like our bottle of milk which appears at the door every morning.  The Post Office are concerned with the payment of money at regular intervals.  Very seldom, if ever, do they fall down on the job. They are working as an agency for different Departments.  Many of the servants in that Department carry out their everyday duties in an exemplary way and are completely unsung.  I wish to conclude by paying tribute to the good work done by those people.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EdwardCollins" hpid="Mr. E. Collins Mr. E. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>The work of the Department of Posts and Telegraphs is, to a large extent, not a matter of critical controversy.  Now and again, in a field like RTE, where the RTE Authority were dismissed in November, 1972, their function becomes noticeable.  That is not generally the case.  The work of the Minister is concerned with improving the services of his Department.  I wish to discuss these services under separate headings.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The telephone services come to mind first.  These services are very poor.  The reason they are poor is <Col N="578" /> probably a reflection of the progress and growth of our economy.  Surely the demands for telephones are directly related to the growth in the welfare of the community and the expansion of business, industry and agriculture.</P>
    <P>Be that as it may, the expansion of the telephone service has not kept pace with the demands for the service. It is a pity.  In saying that I would certainly welcome the Telephone Capital Act, 1973, which provides for expenditure of £175 million over the next five years in order to expand and improve the telephone service. This is a move in the right direction and is to be welcomed.  It was certainly overdue.  Perhaps if this massive step forward had been taken five years earlier the telephone service would not be as poor as it now is. I hope that the matter will be improved.</P>
    <P>There are two aspects of this subject which I feel should be kept in mind.  By far the more important one is the establishment of an automatic dial subscriber service between Ireland, Britain and the Continent.  It is in this area that there has been a massive increase in the demand for service.  It has been my experience that there have been inordinate and undue delays, for whatever reason, in getting a telephone connection either from Ireland to England and the European countries, or from these places to Ireland.  I welcome in that context the establishment of the new international exchange.  This is a step in the right direction.  I am pleased, too, to note there has been an improvement in the service between Ireland and the United States. This is certainly welcome.  In relation to internal developments the sooner we can go on to complete the automatic service the better it will be.  People who have to go through a local exchange to ring up a neighbour four miles away feel they are second-class citizens compared with their urban counterparts who can take up a telephone and dial direct.  The sooner we have a completely automatic system the better.</P>
    <P>There are problems in relation to <Col N="579" /> kiosks.  I appreciate that a great deal of damage is done every year to public kiosks.  I know the Minister is in favour of establishing kiosks or booths, if at all possible, in private houses and shops.  That is a good move.  In newly-developed urban areas there is need for a sufficient number of kiosks as soon as the estates are developed.  The Minister might pay some attention to this.</P>
    <P>I was wondering if the whole service from the point of view of telephones, telegrams and telex should not be handed over to a private corporation to be run on business lines similar to the operation of the telephone company in the United States.  Such a company could have State-guaranteed capital but work as a private company outside the ambit of the Civil Service altogether.  This would be a desirable move.  It would probably increase efficiency and thereby provide a better service. There is always delay when the Civil Service is involved because civil servants have to examine and be satisfied before they can recommend sanction.  Everything must be in order in accordance with rules and regulations and that tends to slow down unnecessarily much needed development. It is because of that I suggest a private company which might have regional offices and far more autonomy than exists at the moment in the Department.  That would be a positive step, one which should increase the efficiency of the service.</P>
    <P>In relation to providing adequate accommodation for personnel, a blatant example of how slowly great bodies move comes to mind in the case of the proposed building of an office block in Waterford city.  The site has been vacant for so many years now that no one knows for what it is available; it is, in fact, available to house the staff of the GPO and other departmental sections.  It is over a decade, I think, since the site was procured.  It is now a derelict site. I do not know to what it is a monument, possibly to inefficiency.  Some sane person should come along and finalise the plans and get on with the <Col N="580" /> job.  My information is that the reason why the site has not been developed is simply because of red tape.  In a developing centre like Waterford the provision of adequate office accommodation for the various staffs is imperative.  I urge the Minister to look into this immediately with a view to finalising and sanctioning the building of the proposed office block. It would certainly not be before its time.</P>
    <P>I have come across far too many substandard post offices with the staffs working in Victorian conditions.  They have not been improved since the turn of the century.  There should be a planned development and modernisation of all post offices.  Certainly the Waterford city post office could be modernised and given a face lift.  The Minister is aware of a request from the people of Tramore, the commissioners and Waterford County Council to establish a State run post office in Tramore.  This demand is justified. Tramore, especially in the summer months, needs a prestige post office. The volume of business during six months of the year at least warrants the establishment of a State run properly staffed post office.  I ask the Minister to examine the possibility of establishing such a post office in Tramore.</P>
    <P>I have no complaints about deliveries of letters and parcels.  I find delivery quite adequate and I compliment the staff concerned.  I am not aware of any volume of criticism, which is a good thing.</P>
    <P>I would like to see the establishment of the proposed council.  It would act as a watchdog and in doing so provide a useful service and perform a useful role in the development of the services given by the Post Office.</P>
    <P>With regard to Radio Telefís Éireann, I welcome the proposed cable television service initiated by the Minister.  I congratulate him on this move and I look forward to a very speedy introduction of this service in areas where it is both economic and feasible.  I know the Minister is examining certain applications in relation to Waterford and Cork and I <Col N="581" /> would like him to announce the results of these applications as soon as possible in order to assure the people that we are indeed going to have cable television.  It is always disappointing for me when I come to Dublin to discover there is such a wide choice of programmes here, programmes which are not available except in certain areas along the eastern seaboard and those bordering on Northern Ireland.  If possible this wide choice of programmes should be extended.  The introduction of a second channel is welcome though there is a move down the country for an assurance that, rather than have one station only through the second channel, there would be a choice of stations or at least a variety of programmes from different stations. I know this may be difficult but I would ask the Minister to ensure that wherever possible the widest choice of programme be made available throughout Ireland.  In relation to programmes available from RTE, I feel we need better quality Irish-made programmes.  Compared with good quality canned programmes imported from England and America, our own programmes do not stand up to the test of quality.  I do not say that in an overall situation but, time and again, we have inferior productions which are most disappointing.</P>
    <P>I wonder if the Minister would carry out a survey in Dublin to ascertain how many people look at RTE as opposed to BBC 1, BBC 2 or ITV, and how many hours they spend looking at RTE compared with the other stations.  I should imagine the Minister would be very disappointed with the percentage of people who viewed RTE rather than the other stations.  Of course, this is a competitive game in certain respects. In Dublin RTE is competing with the British stations, ITV and Northern Ireland, and people naturally will turn on the best entertainment.  By &ldquo;best entertainment&rdquo; I do not mean what one might call bawdy or cheap entertainment, but they will turn to the channel which they feel gives them the best news coverage, the best current affairs coverage and the best <Col N="582" /> entertainment in the widest sense.  I would suggest that RTE does not fare too well when compared with other stations.  I wonder if the Minister would carry out such a survey and I wonder what RTE feels is the case.</P>
    <P>There should be more programmes of provincial interest put on RTE television. Far too many of the programmes are based on Dublin repertory, Dublin actors and actresses. There is much talent in the country which is not being tapped.  The last speaker mentioned the amateur drama field.  That is a fair comment.  People in the provinces would be far more interested in Telefís Éireann if there were more programmes of local interest.  An improvement could be effected in this field.</P>
    <P>Concerning advertising, I am not too happy with the current emphasis on the advertisement of drink.  When I look at RTE, every 15 minutes or so I feel I am going to be bombarded with advertisements for drink.  I would not be at all adverse to banning drinking advertisements on RTE.  While I am aware there would be a substantial loss in revenue, I wonder if the loss could not be recouped out of a subvention directly from State funds not connected with the licence.  The present emphasis on drinking advertisements is detrimental to young people especially.  The Minister should curtail drink advertisements or, if not, consider banning them altogether.</P>
    <P>I agree fully with the Minister's proposal or suggestion that RTE should be available throughout Northern Ireland as well as the Republic and that BBC Northern Ireland should be available throughout the Republic.  This would be a desirable thing.  Indeed, I would not be averse to having RTE available in England &mdash; although perhaps the expense of doing this would be excessive &mdash; if that were technically and financially possible.  I travel a fair amount as a member of the Council of Europe.  I visit most European capitals now and again and I am certainly aware of the publicity which the British Press, especially, and British Government officials get in Europe.  I am satisfied that the British point of <Col N="583" /> view is always put forward very strongly.  I am not satisfied that the Irish point of view is portrayed adequately, especially on the Continent, but also in Britain.  There is a biased reporting of Northern Ireland affairs in Britain which spills over also into the continental news media.  Anything we could do to correct this would be very desirable.</P>
    <P>I do not wish to enter into a discussion on the Broadcasting Review Committee's proposals.  I am not altogether in agreement with the proposal to set up a commission.  We have far too many committees and commissions, advisory committees and so on.  The present authority, properly constituted and working, are sufficient to run RTE, both radio and television.  I am glad to note that the Minister intends to remove section 6 from the Act and give broader scope so far as a motion must be passed by both Houses before the removal of the authority can be affected. I feel it was a mistake to disband the RTE Authority in November, 1972.  It was unnecessary; it was like trying to crack a nut with a sledgehammer. It was politically bad and I think has done the image of Government/State-body relationships a certain damage.  I hope that will never be repeated.  It is something I should not like to see repeated under a National Coalition Government.</P>
    <P>I think the Minister's task lies more in providing better services, in improving technical services and improving television, radio, postal and television services in an economic and futuristic way.  He would have the support of this House in so doing.</P>
    <P>Finally, if we can, say, in a year's time, introduce a cable television service, this would be a very good step and one which would be welcomed throughout the country.  If we can improve the telephone service within the foreseeable future this also would be a positive contribution to the development of the Irish economy.</P>

      <P>Tá a fhíos agam ach níl aon airgead leagtha amach agat sa Mheastachán agus sin é an fá go bhfuil mé ag clamhsán faoi.  Má táimid dáiríre faoi theanga na tíre seo agus faoi Radio na Gaeltachta ba cheart go mbeadh airgead leagtha amach agus go mbeimíd in ann cláracha an radio seo a scaipeadh ar fud na tíre uilig.  Ní bhíonn Radio na Gaeltachta le cloisint ach dhá uair gach oíche sa tseachtain &mdash; óna seacht go dtí a naoi.  Ba cheart uair ar a laghad a bheith ann ar maidin, cúpla uair ag am dinnéir agus óna chúig um thráthnóna go dtí a naoi.  Dá ndeanfaí é sin do bheadh níos mó daoine ag éisteacht leis námar atá i láthair na huaire, mar ní chuile dhuine is féidir bheith ag éisteacht leis óna seacht go dtí a naoi san oíche, go mór mhór gasúraí óga nó daoine atá ag plé le leabhair scoile nó rudaí den sort sin. Más féidir leis an Aire an rud a mhol mé a chur i bhfeidhm beidh mé buíoch de.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>Maidir leis na boscaí telefóin atá sna tithe phoist, ba cheart chuile cheann acu sin a bheith thaobh amuigh mar tá chuile theach phoist ar fud na tíre, go mór mhór amuigh faoin tír, dúnta ar a sé a chlog um thráthnóna.  Tá a fhios agam go leor áiteacha i gConamara atá i bhfad ón dochtúir agus i bhfad ón dtréidlia. Luaigh mé áit amháin &mdash; Caiseal &mdash; an bhliain seo caite.  Tá na daoine ansin i bhfad ón dochtúir, cuid acu beagnach scór míle agus cuid eile scór míle ó dhochtúir na mbeithíoch.  Dá mbéifí in ann glaoch ó bhosca telefóin ón dtaobh amuigh bheadh sé níos éasca <Col N="585" /> ag na daoine agus bheadh se níos féiliúnaí ag na daoine dul ansin ná dul go dtí aon áit eile.  Tá a fhios agam go dtiocfaidh tú thar n-ais leis an bhfreagra go bhfuil go leor, leor guthán ag daoine a bhfuil tithe ósta acu nó ag daoine atá ag coinneáil cuairteoirí.  B'fhéidir go mbeadh chuile dhuine ag éisteacht leo, an rud atá i gceist acu nó rud ar bith eile mar sin. Más féidir leo dul isteach san mbosea telefóin atá taobh amuigh de theach an phoist ní bheidh aon duine ag éisteacht leo.  Tá a fhios agam go bhfuil ceann taobh amuigh de theach an phoist ar an gCeathrú Rua.  Tá ceann eile taobh amuigh de theach an phoist i gCarna.  Tá súil agam nach gceapfaidh an tAire go bhfuil mé ag déanamh an-chlamhsáin faoi.  Níl iontu seo ach na pointí atá ardaithe liomsa ó dhaoine im cheantar gur ceart na boscaí seo bheith taobh amuigh.  Ní chosnóidh sé mórán na boscaí seo a chur taobh amuigh agus ní bheadh aon duine ag éisteacht leis na daoine.  Tá áit eile ann atá i bhfad ó bhaile agus sé an teach posta is giorra dó ar thaobh amháin Mám.  Tá sé 15 mile ar a laghad uaidh agus tá áit eile fós ó dheas atá 11 míle nó mar sin uaidh.  Má theastaíonn rud éigin ó na daoine ins na bailte úd san óiche ní chuile dhuine a bhfuil carr acu agus tá siad fágtha amuigh.</P>
    <P>Labhair mé faoi rud éigin eile an bhliain seo caite líne a fháil ó Chorr na Móna go dtí an Mám.  Níl i gceist ach tuairim is dhá mhíle go leith.  Má theastaíonn ó dhuine scéal a chur go dtí an Mám caithfidh sé dul trí Chlar Cloinne Mhuiris, síos go Cathair na Mart agus chomh fada leis an Mám &mdash; trí scór míle ar a laghad.  B'fhéidir go ndéanfadh an tAire dul isteach sa cheist sin chun go mbeidh an scéal scioptha ó Chorr na Móna go dtí an Mám.</P>
    <P>Labhair mé an bhliain seo caite freisin faoi seo agus is rud é seo gur ceart don Aire breathnú air.  Má phostálann tú litir anseo i mBaile Átha Cliath suas go dtí a trí an chlog sa ló ba cheart é sin a bheith ar fud na tíre lá arna bháireach.  Rinne mé scrúdú ar an rud seo leo dhá bhliain anuas gur anseo i mBaile Átha Cliath atá an mhoill.  Níl a fhios agam an <Col N="586" /> feidir leis an Aire an scéal a réiteach. Má phostálann tú litir suas go dtí a tri a chlog anseo sa Dáil nó suas go dtí a cheathair a chlog tá chuile thraen ag imeacht ar fud na tíre &mdash; go Coreaigh, go Portláirge, go Ciarraí, go Gaillimb, go Maigheo, go Sligeach agus tá chuile cheann acu sin idir a sé agus a hocht san oíche.  Bailíonn fear an phoist na litreacha agus tugann sé leis iad go dtí oifig an phoist.  Oibrítear ar na litreacha ansin agus cuirtear an post amach an mhaidín dar gcionn. Téann na litreacha amach i gcás na Gaillimhe ar a sé a chlog ar maidin go dtí leath uair tar éis a seacht agus tá siad imithe amach an lá céanna. Tá súil agam, a Aire, go mbreathnóidh tú isteach sna cúrsaí féachaint an mbeidh tú in ann aon dheifriú a dhéanamh faoi sin.</P>
    <P>Luaigh tú freisin faoi carannaí maidir leis na fir phoist.  Tá mé ag ceapadh go ndúirt tú in áit éigin anseo go rabhthas ag dul ar aghaidh le níos mó i mbliana ná mar a rinneadh an bhliain seo caite.  Is maith an rud é sin.  Is í an bhliain 1974 atá ann, agus ní ceart ligint do na fir phoist dul thart ar laethanta dona gan aon éadach ceart orthu, fliuch báite go dtí an craiceann.  Ba cheart na vananna beaga seo a dhéanamh níos compórdúla.  Tá áiteacha ina bhfuil vananna agus áiteacha eile nach bhfuil.  Tá na rothair iontu fós. Bliain go leith nó mar sin ó shin chuir mé scéala chuig an Roinn faoi cheann thiar ó Conamara agus bhí sé réidh an t-am sin go mbeadh van ann faoi cheann trí nó cheithre mhí agus tá sé ansin mar sin fós.  Duradh liom go mbeadh an van ann.  Ba mhaith liom dá dtéadh an tAire ar aghaidh chomh luath in Éirinn agus is féidir leis é chun na vananna beaga seo a thabhairt do chuile fhear phoist.  Ba mhaith liom mo bhuíochas a ghabháil le chuile dhuine a raibh baint aige leis an bpost.  Thugadar seirbhís dhílis don tír seo agus tá buíochas an Tí seo ag dul dóibh.</P>
    <P>Ba mhaith liom freisin mo bhuíochas a ghabháil leis na cailíní atá ag obair thíos anseo san oifig.  Is minic a chuireamar isteach orthu maidir le glaonna telefóin.</P>
    <P>Ní raibh mé anseo an tseachtain <Col N="587" /> seo caite nuair a d'fhreagair an tAire ceist a chur mé síos maidir leis an gceadúnas telefíse.  D'iarr mé air dhá leath a dhéanamh de.  Is é a bhí i gceist agam daoine a bheith ann nach bhfuil acu ach cúpla púnt sa tseachtain agus tá an ceadúnas úr roint trom orthu.  Bheadh sé níos éasca ag an dream seo é a íoc faoi dhó sa bhliain.</P>
    <P>Tá go leor leor daoine istigh ar ghutháin faoi láthair.  Cúpla mí ó shin chuala mé fear ag clamhsán.  Níl a fhios agam cé mhéid airgid a d'ioc sé maidir leis an ghuthán ach tuairim is sé mhí ina dhiaidh sin ní raibh aon ghuthán fáite aige.  Bhí Roinn an Aire ag déanamh airgid as airgead an fhir sin.  Ní ceart don Aire an t-airgead a iarraidh ar na daoine seo go mbéifear beagnach réidh leis an nguthán a chur isteach.  Má chuireann daoine isteach ar ghuthán teipeann ar dhochtúirí, ar shagairt, ar Theachtaí Dála nó ar Sheanadóirí.  Tá mé ag ceapadh go bhfuil mé ceart ansin. Má tá oifigeach Airm as baile agus gur mhaith leis glaoch ar a bhean chun a chur in iúl di nach bhfuil sé gortaithe nó a leithéid sin, chítear dom gur cheart é bheith ar an liosta fresin mar tá sé an-thábhachtach go mbeadh sé in ann scéala a chur abhaile.</P>
    <P>Má théann tú isteach i mbosca telefóin agus má chasann tú roth an telefóin gheibheann tú freagra ón malartán telefóin.  Iarrtar ort: &ldquo;An uimhir, más é do thoil é&rdquo;.  Tugann tú an uimhir.  Má thugann tú uimhir fhir éigin eile go bhfuil guthán aige, an bhfuil aon seans go gcuirfear sin síos in aghaidh fhir éigin eile san áit sin? An bhfuil aon réiteach déanta i leith na gcúrsaí sin?</P>
    <P>Tá súil agam go raghaidh an tAire ar aghaidh leis an gclár automaiticiúil chomh luath agus is féidir.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelBegley" hpid="Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Local Government (Mr. Begley) Michael Begley">
      <NameTxt>Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Local Government (Mr. Begley)</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to congratulate the Minister on his wonderful approach to the whole question of broadcasting.  It is a great thing for the country that we have a Minister <Col N="588" /> who is prepared to say out loud what he is really thinking.  It is refreshing that at times his comments draw worthwhile criticism from people in all walks of life.  He is big enough to accept criticisms if they are valid and to reject them if they are not.</P>
      <P>It is fair to say that we have inherited a legacy that parliamentarians have the power to give a telephone to a man if he writes to us.  This is a legacy men in public life have inherited, possibly through their own fault.  We should tell the public at large that they will have to take their place in the queue and that no one can jump the queue.  This would relieve everybody in the House of a fantastic amount of correspondence. I do not want it to be taken from my remarks that I do not want to entertain these representations.  Far from it, but people should be told that each person must take his place in the queue for a telephone and that there will be no favouritism and no patronage.</P>
      <P>It is unfortunate that at this point in time there should be a breakdown in our telephone system in certain parts of the south west.  I do not know the pros and cons of the dispute, but some post offices are not available for the use of the telephone or to take telephone calls, and this is causing grave inconvenience, and did so in my peninsula over the Whit weekend.  The public are not aware of the cause of the dispute.  The Department should have advertised in the local papers and in the weekly, daily and Sunday papers, that there would be inconvenience and that people could go to another telephone box seven or eight miles away.  This information was not made available to the public and it was unfortunate that that should have been the case. I do not know if this is a union dispute but I hope there will be an early settlement.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is a wealth of information in the notes provided by the Minister for Deputies.  Speaking as a man from the Gaeltacht, I am disappointed to find that no dialling system is being provided for the Kerry Gaeltacht.  I know the Minister is slow to promise anything <Col N="589" /> but perhaps he could tell us when such a dialling system will be introduced.</P>
    <P>I now come to a hardy annual in this House, the provision of a telephone system for the people in the Black Valley in Killarney.  These people live seven or eight miles up the valley and are as entitled to have a telephone for use in emergencies as are other people in any other part of the country.  They live off a rough, unsurfaced road and if they require a doctor, a priest or a veterinary surgeon they face the difficult task of having to go down to the valley.  I am aware that this matter has been treated as a play-toy by politicians for many years but nevertheless the people are entitled to this service. This part of the south-west is isolated but with modern radio techniques it should not be very difficult for the Minister to give them the service they require.</P>
    <P>I am pleased that the Minister dealt in depth with the question of staff training.  I found it very refreshing that when five posts were advertised in my area recently more than 200 young boys applied.  This is an indication that the youth regard the job in the post office as a lucrative one.</P>
    <P>On many occasions I have asked about television reception in west Kerry.  I am aware that the Minister and the Opposition spokesman on Posts and Telegraphs, Deputy Brugha, spend their holidays in west Kerry and I feel sure that they are aware that many areas do not receive Telefís Éireann.  Reception in some parts of the peninsula is very haphazard and it does not take a storm to put the Caherciveen station out of action.  I accept that this is in a very exposed place but I feel sure that it is possible to do something about the matter. Deputy Colley, when he was Minister for Finance, said he was thinking of putting a booster station on the Dingle peninsula.  Perhaps the Minister will see the light and give us that booster.</P>
    <P>I should also like to compliment the Minister on putting forward the suggestion of a second channel for RTE. <Col N="590" /> It is only right and proper that the people in the south-west and west should have the same privileges as the people on the east coast.  When I spoke on the Estimate for this Department last year I suggested that the licence fee for the people in the south-west should be cheaper than the fee paid by those on the east coast. That suggestion did not go down well but it should be remembered that the people in my part of the country have not half the facilities those living on the east have.  In fact, they do not get any reception at times.</P>
    <P>I welcome the decision to give free television licences to old age pensioners and I would like the Minister to investigate the possibility of giving those in receipt of disability pensions free licences.  It would be a big step forward for these people if the Minister decided to give them free licences. It may be possible to introduce a scheme whereby, with the assistance of voluntary organisations, such people could be provided with free televisions.  With the advent of colour televisions it will be possible to purchase black and white sets for as little as £25.</P>
    <P>Radio na Gaeltachta, since its inception, has provided a very good service, not alone for the people living in the Gaeltacht areas but for those who can receive the station on their sets.  I compliment the Minister for his work in this regard but I would ask him to consider extending the number of hours of broadcasting by Radio na Gaeltachta.  I believe that only nine people, between reporters and technicians, work this station to produce the two hours of broadcasting daily but it is fair to say that some of the programmes put out by Radio na Gaeltachta are far better than those on television.  The hours of broadcasting of Radio na Gaeltachta should be extended because many people outside the Gaeltacht areas are anxious to improve their Irish.  At the same time there should be more respect on the part of some of the reachtaraí for Members of this House, whether they be of the Government or Opposition parties.  It was unfortunate that Radio na Gaeltachta <Col N="591" /> did not see fit to send a reporter to Cloghane on Sunday week last.  A tremendous amount of good has been done by Glór na nGael and one would have expected coverage of the competitions by Radio na Gaeltachta. Their failure in this regard was, to say the least, an insult to the Bishop of Kerry who presented the prizes. It was an insult also to the Minister for the Gaeltacht who was present and it was an insult to me.  The station is located only 12 miles from Cloghane.  I do not know what the reason was for their attitude on that occasion but if it was intended to snub either the sponsors of the competition or the Minister for the Gaeltacht, the reasons for that snub should be stated.  Those of us who were present on that occasion were embarrassed when the chairman of Glór na nGael emphasised the absence of a Radio na Gaeltachta representative. The attendance was in the region of 2,000 people and these came from all parts of Ireland.  It would have been only right that some of the speeches were recorded so that the country might be made aware of the wonderful work that Glór na nGael are doing for the Irish language.  It appears that Radio na Gaeltachta assume certain powers to themselves but, we would all like an explanation as to why they were not present in Cloghane on that occasion.  I trust that never again will there be a recurrence of this attitude on their part.</P>
    <P>Unfortunately, I cannot say that this incident was an isolated one because recently when the Minister for the Gaeltacht visited Donegal he was ignored by the station's reporters. What are we coming to when a Minister, duly elected by the people and appointed by the Taoiseach, is boycotted by a handful of people?  That was the term used in the papers to describe the absence of Radio na Gaeltachta reporters on the occasion of the Minister's visit to Donegal.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Posts and Telegraphs and the Minister for the Gaeltacht, also, visited Dún Chaoin on the occasion of the comhchaidreamh for the scríbhneoirí but again their visit <Col N="592" /> failed to get a mention on Radio na Gaeltachta.  I trust the Minister will be able to tell us publicly what is going on between the Radio na Gaeltachta reporters and the Minister for the Gaeltacht.  Apart from those criticisms Radio na Gaeltachta have produced some very good programmes.  For instance, great credit is due to the producer of the programme on an file, Seán Ó Catháin.  I trust that the records of the programme will be used time and again, especially on the occasion of the anniversary of the poet.</P>
    <P>However, there would appear to be a certain amount of looseness so far as reporting is concerned.  One incident I have in mind concerned a local man who was known by a nickname.  It was unfortunate that Radio na Gaeltachta used that nickname in referring to the death of that man's mother.  Radio na Gaeltachta has great potential but I trust that incidents of the type I have described will not occur again.  For the greater part, they are on the right lines. Some of the criticisms I have made of them might be made also of RTE. Recently we read in the papers that cearta siabhialta na Gaeltachta had a march in Galway which consisted of 14 or 15 marchers.  The march lasted for three days and RTE were able to devote a full half hour to that number of people but at the same time there was a comhchaidreamh in progress at which there was a wonderful exhibition of Gaeltacht paintings and also an exhibition by prominent publishers from Dublin of old Irish stories by various Irish authors.  Yet, they did not see fit to send a representative to that comhchaidreamh which was visited by 3,000 or 4,000 people, including the Minister.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dowling</NameTxt>
      <P>I am aware that the Minister met the representatives of <Col N="593" /> the various unions today.  I am not aware of the outcome of those discussions. I hope they will put an end to the present conflict by obtaining a willingness from both sections to come to an early agreement.</P>
      <P>On radio and television today the Minister painted a very depressing picture.  There is grave public disquiet because of the flippant manner in which the Government have treated this dispute.  Efforts have been made to bring it to an end, but not in a serious way.  Many people have to walk to work.  Shopkeepers in the centre of the city are on the point of closing.  Jobs are at risk.  Many trade unionists are on, or about to go on, short time.  Dublin workers are complaining because they are losing money as a result of &ldquo;lates&rdquo; and short time and because there is no alternative transport.  As I said, this is a very depressing situation.</P>
      <P>This Dublin Government should be close to the people of this city but their actions and statements show that they are far removed from the realities of the situation.  The blame lies squarely on the shoulders of many Ministers.  I am glad to see the Minister for Transport and Power here because he and CIE have a responsibility for the bus strike and they cannot divorce themselves from this responsibility.</P>
      <P>The impression was created that the Minister did a disservice to his union, and that the union was embarrassed by the lackadaisical manner in which he acted.  The fact that he is a member of a union has given rise to the suggestion that he is biased when taking action in relation to the position as he sees it from his union's point of view, as distinct from the point of view of a Minister.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This is an inter-union dispute.  Such disputes are not settled in the normal course; therefore, the action taken to settle them differs from the normal course of action.  The Minister can be relied on to make certain suggestions with a view to settlement.  He must face up to these difficulties because that is what he is paid for. When in Opposition he had a cure <Col N="594" /> for every ailment, from bald heads to bunions.  Now that he is in Government the situation is different.</P>
    <P>The workers of the city cannot afford to suffer much longer.  Action must be taken.  We realise the difficulties which exist with regard to the provision of Army transport.  The Government should give some consideration to providing alternative transport for workers living on the perimeters of the city and some distance from their places of employment. Alternative transport must be provided if they are not to lose money because of &ldquo;lates&rdquo; or short time.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Local Government spoke today about one of the many strikes in operation at the moment. Because the bus strike was the result of an inter-union dispute the Minister tried to brush it aside.  I sympathise with him because I know the difficulties he faces in trying to find a solution to a dispute of this kind.  Consideration must be given to the overall position.  On previous occasions Army lorries provided a commuter service.  The security situation must be kept under review.  If transport by Army lorries from the perimeter areas to the central areas are provided, this will ensure that life in Dublin will be maintained, jobs are secure and the people at risk at the moment will find themselves in a happier position.</P>
    <P>This dispute must be solved by consultation, assistance and advice.  There are principles involved and they must be respected.  The only thing to which the people can look forward as a result of this strike is an increase in fares.  Because of the strike substantial losses have been incurred.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanTreacy" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Seán Treacy">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JosephDowling" hpid="Mr. Dowling Mr. Dowling">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dowling</NameTxt>
      <P>This is a depressing situation.  By now the Government should have realised the drastic developments which are taking place in Dublin.  They should make an honest effort to ensure that the problems of the workers, trade unionists and large and small shopkeepers are examined and analysed.  They must <Col N="595" /> take action to ensure that life in the city can proceed in the normal way.</P>
      <P>The Minister for Labour spoke about facilities at airports.  Dubliners are more concerned about getting to and from their jobs and ensuring that they have full pay packets at the end of the week in order that their families can exist in a reasonable degree of happiness.  That happiness is denied them at the moment.  Therefore, I hope the Government will take action soon and that the Minister will continue in a more positive way to bring about an improvement in the situation and to bring about the termination of the strike by using whatever assistance, advice and judgment are necessary. The strangest feature about this dispute was the fact that CIE had to make a suggestion to the trade unions with a view to settling the strike.  This is extraordinary in an inter-unions dispute.</P>
      <P>I will not delay the House.  Other speakers wish to contribute.  I want to impress on the Minister that there is grave disquiet among the workers of the city because of the continuity of the bus strike.  The Minister is probably limited in what he can do.  The difficulties of an inter-union dispute are well appreciated.  The Minister must realise that he is the man in the cockpit at the moment.  He must make some decisions.  They may be decisions which, if he were otherwise engaged, he might not be prepared to take.  He must not await other developments.  He must ensure that there is a climate in which there is a willingness to negotiate and that without any loss of principle the trade unions can come together to discuss the situation.  Principles are involved on this occasion.</P>

      <P>I do not know what progress the Minister made this evening when he met the leaders of the unions.  I hope he made worthwhile progress towards a settlement.  Whatever the merits or demerits, the situation proves to us the frightful conditions of human relations which exist in the public sector of our industries.  It will be noted that our <Col N="596" /> greatest troubles come from the semi-State bodies.  The private sector do not suffer as many strikes.  There is a reason for this.  In this case the reason would appear to be the attitude of the Government towards this whole matter and the Minister's cavalier attitude to the strike.  The fact is that the strike did not seem to be a serious upset to our citizens until very recently but the strike has caused serious hardships on the less affluent sector who do not own cars.  The Minister cannot compel men to return to work if they do not want to.</P>
      <P>The Minister, through the Department of Labour, has a serious onus on him to find ways and means of probing the real cause of this strike. He must then try to apply remedial action so that the men can have confidence in the Department of Labour. They are shedding this confidence all the time.  Unless the Minister acts effectively in this case he and the Department of Labour will become irrelevant so far as industrial workers are concerned.</P>
      <P>The Government should set up a council in which the Ministers for Labour and Transport and Power would meet with nominees from each of the three unions involved.  They should examine the whole cause of the dispute.  In the meantime the men should accept the goodwill and the word of the Government when they are told that the matter will be thoroughly examined and that big changes affecting the workers of CIE will take place.  The men should go back in the meantime.  In the interests of their fellow workers and of the citizens the men should go back in such circumstances, pending the result of such an inquiry.</P>

      <P>There is some old adage which speaks of it being better to travel hopefully than to arrive. While that might be applicable to the Minister in his ministerial position it does not apply to the many citizens who are finding it impossible to get to their destinations.  We should thank the motorists who have been so willing to assist people but now <Col N="597" /> many people find themselves having to spend a few hours travelling from the outer parts of my constituency to their city destinations.</P>
      <P>There is much hardship on old age pensioners, many of whom as a matter of convenience collect their pensions in the centre of the city.  They visit the GPO and then go shopping. They can be seen on the roads trying to make their way to the GPO.  The Government have not been examining the position carefully.  They should assist certain sections of the community and should at least indicate to the pensioners that their pensions will be payable at the nearest post offices.</P>
      <P>In regard to schoolchildren, I see no reason why the Minister if he were interested enough should not have had consultations with the Minister for Education to arrange that the school buses which are already employed on that work should now be diverted to bring all children to their schools, especially those in the post primary sector who are about to sit for the most important examinations of their lives.  The Minister says that this is an inter-union dispute.  Having regard to the fact that the Minister knew how serious the matter was he should not, having regard to his known affiliation with one union, have entered into consultations or directed the Labour Court to investigate the position so early on in the strike.  Having done that, there is now an obligation on him to make Army lorries available to the people of Dublin.  When we debated this before the Minister said that that was a matter for the Minister for Defence.  This would seem to indicate that the Minister had not concerned himself at all with the dispute.  Listening to the Minister on radio recently I noted that he said that the Government had had plans to introduce Army lorries.  If that were so, why did the Minister say in this House that this was not a matter for him but something that had to be done by the Minister for Defence?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is not possible to say all one would wish to say within a few minutes.  I say now to the Minister that he must settle this strike.  We <Col N="598" /> listened to him for many years offering the solution to all industrial ills; now the obligation is on him to settle this strike immediately.</P>

      <P>I would like to join with my colleagues in expressing public dissatisfaction at the apparent complacency of the Government in regard to the serious strike now affecting our city.  I do not wish to discuss the merits and demerits of the dispute but to bring to the notice of the House the serious hardship which my constituents in north-east Dublin are suffering.  These people are not able to get to their employment.  Children are not able to reach their schools. People are not able to visit hospitals and clinics.  They are expressing grave dissatisfaction at the apparent inactivity of the Minister of whom great things were expected in this Government.</P>
      <P>It is regrettable that this semi-State company, CIE, have been bedevilled by a long history of trade disputes. A stage has now been reached where some consideration should be given to the setting up of an independent committee or a parliamentary committee to examine the whole structure of CIE.  There should be an inquiry into their workings.  The relationship between management and staff should be well researched.  There are grounds to believe that there have been contributory factors&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Labour (Mr. M. O'Leary)</NameTxt>
      <P>This dispute arises from the fact that three of the unions involved object to the introduction by CIE of the five-day working week and to the new schedules attached to that five-day week.  On the other hand, there is the situation that if CIE defer the five-day week the fourth union will take strike action.  That is the impasse which has led to the dispute. It has not been resolved despite <Col N="599" /> the many efforts made to bring about a settlement, including my personal intervention on two occasions, and the involvement of the Labour Court and the conciliation services.</P>
      <P>As I said here on 16th May in reply to Deputy Dowling:</P>
      <P>...Is should be possible, given a willingness, to isolate the agreement reached in principle on the introduction of the five-day week from the practical difficulties of operating schedules in the context of the five-day week.</P>
      <P>I met the unions this evening to see if the present deadlock situation could be reversed and I shall resume these discussions at 11 o'clock tonight. It will not be a simple task to reverse this deadlock situation, as the course of the dispute clearly shows.</P>
      <P>I have been concerned from the start about the effects of the strike on employment and about the hardship it has imposed on the general public, particularly the old and those attending hospitals and clinics.  A great strain has been placed on the Garda at a time when they are already heavily committed on the security front.</P>
      <P>Serious damage is being inflicted on the economic structure of the company. As each day passes relationships between those on strike become more poisoned and this will have longterm repercussions on labour relations in Córas Iompair Éireann.</P>
      <P>I have been abundantly conscious of the gravity of the dispute from its commencement and it was for that reason, following a review of the situation with the chairman of the Labour Court, that I asked the court on 8th May to investigate the dispute.  In my letter to the chairman I said I was concerned about the grave hardship caused by the absence of transport on the many thousands of workers who depend on public transport to reach their places of employment.  It was for that reason I asked for a review of the situation with the chairman in order to get the court to intervene.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The investigation which followed by the court was, of course, a continuation <Col N="600" /> of a long involvement by the court in the question of a five-day working week for Dublin busmen, negotiations on which had been in progress since 1964.  There followed the Labour Court recommendation of 10th May, accepted by the Congress passenger group of trade unions but rejected by the National Busmen's Union.  Arising out of the Labour Court's intervention a senior officer of the court, Mr. James McCauley, brought the parties together again on 14th May.  When he reported that no progress was being made I myself held discussions with each of the unions on 15th and 16th May.  The purpose of these meetings was to explore whether any common ground existed between the Congress group of unions, on the one hand, and the National Busmen's Union on the other.  I reported to the Dáil in reply to the Special Notice Question tabled by Opposition Deputies on 16th May.  In the course of my reply I said:</P>
    <P>An examination of the protracted negotiations up to now...makes it clear that the five-day week was accepted in principle last November but the practical outcome of that decision in terms of schedules was unacceptable to many busmen.  It should be possible, given a willingness, to isolate the agreement in principle on the introduction of the five-day week from the practical difficulties of operating schedules in the context of the five-day week.  It is possible...to get a resumption of bus services by agreement on this method of reconciling differences.</P>
    <P>My discussions at that time were followed by an initiative on the part of the Irish Congress of Trade Unions which resulted in a meeting between Córas Iompair Éireann and the group of unions on 17th May.  The company also met the National Busmen's Union later on the same day.  No general acceptable formula emerged.</P>
    <P>At this stage there was a further intervention by Mr. McCauley and the Labour Court and on 22nd, 23rd and 24th May they held discussions with the unions on a formula which would be operative on the five-day week on a preliminary basis to be <Col N="601" /> followed by a ballot.  Again no agreement could be reached.  On 16th May the chairman of the Labour Court took the unusual step of writing to the Press.  In the course of his letter he said:</P>
    <P>In spite of the best efforts of the public agencies concerned with industrial relations neither group of men is prepared to change its attitude.</P>
    <P>On 16th May I undertook to continue my contact with the parties involved in the dispute.  I have so continued and I and my officials have been in daily discussions with both sides in this dispute.  I have been concerned at all times not to jeopardise the efforts being made to resolve this dispute through the normal industrial relations channels.  Many of the initiatives taken and the efforts made to resolve the dispute took place without the knowledge of the public since their possible effectiveness could be negated by undue publicity.</P>
    <P>I shall continue, as I am continuing tonight, to maintain a strong and determined attempt to bring the parties to a frame of mind which will allow a settlement to emerge.</P>
    <P>The question of using Army lorries was raised.  Deputies are as aware as I am of the serious security situation which makes this whole situation a far graver situation than that which existed in 1966.  I would remind Deputy Tunney that, far from ruling out Army transport on 16th May, I said that, in a dispute of this kind, involving hardship for so many, consideration would always be given to such a service being provided.  The Government took a decision on the provision of Army buses.  There followed the tragic events of that weekend.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesCTunney" hpid="Mr. Tunney Mr. Tunney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tunney</NameTxt>
      <P>Where are the buses at the moment?  Are they in Dublin?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sorry.  I should have said &ldquo;Army lorries&rdquo;.  At that time the use of Army lorries was <Col N="602" /> not ruled out.  I gave no affirmative answer, but I explained this was a constant consideration in a dispute of this kind involving hardship for so many.  There was a Government decision taken to introduce Army lorries. That decision was negated by the events of that very tragic weekend.</P>
      <P>It is ludierous to suggest &mdash; perhaps the suggestion is not meant seriously &mdash; that my efforts in this dispute are in any way biased by my membership of one of the trade unions involved.  I act on behalf of the public with the public interest in mind.  Deputy Dowling accepts the difficult situation with which we are faced.  I am glad Deputy Dowling understands that in a matter like this agreement is a <i>sine qua non</i> of any settlement reached.</P>
      <P>I do not see how anyone could describe our response to this serious situation as either flippant or cavalier. On any occasion on which a major initiative was taken by the agencies directly involved naturally it was not for me to intervene.  That was my situation over the past few days while efforts to see whether a ballot could take place were proceeding.  It was only when this latest attempt fell through that I came back again into the picture. The fact that I was asked to make a speech last Monday came in the normal course of my work.  That appointment was made months ago.</P>
      <P>I have given the Deputies opposite a fair account of the urgent steps we have taken from the very start of this serious dispute.  We have been at all times energetic and active.  Whatever else this dispute suffers it certainly does not suffer from any lack of activity on the part of the agencies concerned with industrial relations, on my part or on the part of my officials. As I said earlier, I am resuming discussions with the unions at 11 p.m.</P>
      <P>The Dáil adjourned at 11 p.m. until 10.30 a.m. on Thursday, 6th June, 1974.</P>
