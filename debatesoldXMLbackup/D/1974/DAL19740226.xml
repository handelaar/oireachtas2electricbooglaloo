      <NameTxt>Dr. Gibbons</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Transport and Power if he will request the ESB to make electricity <Col N="1446" /> available to demountable houses without the imposition of a special service charge when these houses have been assembled by the local authority.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PeterBarry" hpid="Mr. P. Barry Mr. P. Barry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>I am informed by the ESB that terms for supply to premises have regard to the anticipated revenue and are normally calculated on the assumption that supply will be required permanently.</P>
      <P>Some demountable houses are located on sites owned by local authorities and are connected to water and sewerage services.  In calculating terms for supply to such houses, the terms applicable throughout the country to similarly situated permanent houses apply.  In the case of mobile homes and demountable houses on sites with very short leases the calculations must assume that supply is required for a temporary period and a capital payment is therefore required in accordance with the board's rules for temporary supplies.</P>
      <P>The board are empowered by their statute to fix their methods of charge and I do not propose to intervene.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesMGibbons" hpid="Mr. J. Gibbons Mr. J. Gibbons">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Gibbons</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Transport and Power whether there is any difference in the price of a unit of electricity charged to rural consumers <i>vis-à-vis</i> urban consumers; and, if so, how this difference is justified.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PeterBarry" hpid="Mr. P. Barry Mr. P. Barry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>I am informed by the ESB that there is a difference in the price of a unit of electricity charged to rural and urban domestic consumers. This difference applies only to the first 75 units per two months. Units in excess of 75 are charged at the same rate to both rural and urban consumers.  Assuming a rural domestic consumer uses 75 or more units in a two monthly period, he would be charged 62 pence more than his urban counterpart in respect of unit charges. The main reason for the difference in charges is to offset in part the substantial extra cost of bringing supply to rural consumers as compared with urban.  Other costs such as maintenance, depreciation, interest, provisions for renewal of assets and meter reading are also significantly higher in rural areas.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesMGibbons" hpid="Mr. J. Gibbons Mr. J. Gibbons">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Gibbons</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister not agree there is something basically and intrinsically wrong in maintaining a differential between different citizens for the same supply and the same service by a State company? Should not each consumer pay at the same rate regardless of whether he is a rural or an urban consumer? Is not the reason for the different cost that it is easier for the ESB to supply large built-up areas than consumers in scattered rural areas&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="PeterBarry" hpid="Mr. P. Barry Mr. P. Barry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>The answer is that the supply of electricity to rural areas is already being subsidised to the tune of £4 million per annum, so the urban consumer is subsidising the rural consumer to that amount every year.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PeterBarry" hpid="Mr. P. Barry Mr. P. Barry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>I am informed by the ESB that those houses which had been wired by persons other than those who are members of the ETU are now being connected to the electricity supply in the majority of cases. It is hoped that following on an examination of the position which is at present being carried out the remaining houses will also be connected.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickPower" hpid="Mr. Power Mr. Power">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Power</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Transport and Power when he proposes to implement the recommendations of the Fletcher Report with particular regard to the findings regarding new connections to houses in rural areas.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PeterBarry" hpid="Mr. P. Barry Mr. P. Barry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>Some of the recommendations in the Fletcher Report which relate to the internal administration of the ESB have been implemented or are in the process of implementation by the board.  Proposals for a revised system of capital contributions for new connections and other recommendations which would require Government approval or new legislation are under examination.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The proposals for capital contributions recommended by Fletcher provide for a standard charge of £50, unless the actual cost of the connection <Col N="1449" /> exceeds £100, in which case the contribution would be the actual cost less £50.  I would point out that these terms would be less favourable to the consumer than the terms already available to rural consumers under the planned post-development scheme and would not significantly change the consumer's contribution in the case of high cost connections outside the scheme.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickPower" hpid="Mr. Power Mr. Power">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Power</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickPower" hpid="Mr. Power Mr. Power">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Power</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister intend helping rural dwellers who are now faced with a penal charge, in some cases up to £700, before they can have electricity?  People who are building a new house have never got the opportunity of availing of subsidised terms if time has passed them by.  The Minister is furthering a policy of denuding rural areas.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PeterBarry" hpid="Mr. P. Barry Mr. P. Barry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sorry about that.  The cost of bringing electricity to rural dwellers under the rural electrification scheme is being subsidised to the tune of £10 million over a five-year period which expires on 31st March next year.  This is the second chance most rural communities have had of getting subsidised electricity and until that scheme finishes I do not think the Government should introduce another scheme which would overlap with the present one.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickPower" hpid="Mr. Power Mr. Power">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Power</NameTxt>
      <P>With regard to consumers who are anxious to get a connection to a new house for the first time, would the Minister not ask the ESB to take this huge capital charge in instalments and spread it over a period?  This has been offered to the ESB but is not acceptable to them.  Does he not agree that this charge raises the cost of a new house for people in a rural area entirely beyond their limits?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PeterBarry" hpid="Mr. P. Barry Mr. P. Barry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not sure what are the objections of the ESB to such a scheme but I shall certainly undertake to discuss it with them.  I think there might be something in that idea.</P>

    <P>The CIE wages grades pension fund includes the pension contributions of the staff now employed and its assets are required to meet the ongoing liabilities to existing pensioners and <Col N="1457" /> to provide for the pensions of existing staff.  At the last actuarial valuation of the fund for the five year period ended 31st December, 1968 assets were £10,971,000 and liabilities £14,036,000.  The actuarial valuation of the fund for the five year period ended 31st December, 1973 is at present in progress.  Moneys in the fund are invested in trustee stocks or in other investments for the time being approved of by the Minister for Finance.  The annual interest accruing to the fund varies from year to year; that for 1972 amounted to £543,181, which when added to the fund, brought the total assets of the fund at 31st December, 1972, to £8,383,016.</P>
    <P>Under section 44 of the Transport Act, 1950 the onus is on CIE to make proposals to me for both new superannuation schemes and the amendment of existing superannuation schemes.  CIE have made proposals to increase the pensions in the CIE wages grade pension scheme and these are at present under active examination.</P>
    <P>There is no provision in the wages grade pension scheme for increasing the pensions of existing pensioners. CIE pensions are, however, linked to Social Welfare benefits, which are revised from time to time.</P>

      <P>Aer Lingus, in common with many other airlines, have embarked on a programme of investment in activities which are ancillary to the company's airline business.

I subsequently endorsed the policy because I am anxious that the air <Col N="1460" /> companies should be enabled to continue to provide the necessary level of air transport services to and from Ireland without the need for special State assistance.</P>
    <P>The capital employed in Aer Lingus in associated activities is raised in money markets which would not normally be available as sources of capital for investment in Ireland. Moreover, I would have reservations about unnecessary encroachment on the private sector and accordingly any question of large scale investment by a State-sponsored body in a new area of activity within the economy would require very careful consideration. For these reasons the bulk of the Aer Lingus investment in associated activities has been concentrated abroad and the need for specific consultation with other State-sponsored bodies does not arise.  There is, of course, continuing close liaison between the various State bodies in the travel and tourism field and there is a considerable amount of collaboration, particularly in the promotion of tourist traffic to Ireland.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>I am satisfied on both points.  In relation to the second point, I am satisfied that the running of these activities helps the profitability of Aer Lingus.  There is, of course the argument that Aer Lingus could raise this money and invest it in Ireland but there is no guarantee that the money would be made available to Aer Lingus to invest in this country.  I have discussed this very fully with both Aer Lingus and Aerlínte.  I have impressed on them, even though I approve of this policy and think we should go ahead on these lines, that their main function is to carry people in and out of Ireland and they must never lose sight of that.</P>

To encourage them to do so and to spend their money in Teneriffe may be in conflict with the national interest regarding the encouragement of people to stay here in Ireland.  Is the Minister satisfied that Aer Lingus will take sufficient steps to get visitors from other countries to visit their complex at Teneriffe?  Has the Minister given any thought to this?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PeterBarry" hpid="Mr. P. Barry Mr. P. Barry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes.  There is a big investment by Aer Lingus in the Canary Islands.  They will naturally want to make the undertaking as profitable as possible.  The number of <Col N="1462" /> people they could expect to carry from Ireland to Teneriffe would not be sufficient to make the venture profitable. They will have to seek other people elsewhere.  No matter how &ldquo;high profile&rdquo; a campaign for home holidays is conducted, there will always be people who want to go to the sun at odd times of the year for their holidays.  I think it is desirable that Aer Lingus should carry them rather than another airline.</P>

      <P>As there has already been substantial progress in securing industrial projects for a number of locations in Border counties, including Monaghan, Letterkenny, Ballyshannon, Carrigallen and Mohill, and as the existing incentives are already very attractive, I do not consider it necessary to provide increased incentives in those areas.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>The system of two-tier boards modelled on the German system has been proposed in the draft EEC fifth directive on harmonisation of company law.  The draft directive is, of course, subject to change before adoption.  When it is adopted, Irish company law will have to conform to its provisions, but I do not propose to make any changes in the law regarding boards of companies until I know the final requirements of the directive.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JustinKeating" hpid="Mr. Keating Mr. Keating">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>It is very difficult to forecast, particularly at the moment because we have all seen examples in recent months of things which we have expected to happen quickly in the Community being slowed up.  It is difficult to predict firmly.  It is unlikely that there will be real progress in under one year.  That is a guess but that is probably the order of the time.  The Deputy will be aware that with something as complex as company law it would be foolish and wasteful of time and energy to introduce changes in law which we would subsequently have to change soon afterwards.  It seems prudent to await at least much more clarification even if we have not got final adoption of the fifth directive before we proceed.  It will not be very <Col N="1472" /> long and, of course, it does not prevent us from making changes.  Changes in company law would make these things obligatory but there is no reason for either public or private companies&mdash; by that I mean State or private enterprise companies&mdash;not to innovate, not to try out different forms of worker representation in the meantime irrespective of when it becomes compulsory. I would personally be in favour of such an arrangement.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JustinKeating" hpid="Mr. Keating Mr. Keating">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>No.  We could certainly do things now.  There are two matters: one is what companies do and there is also the question of the application of the fifth directive.  When that directive is actually adopted&mdash;and I give an estimate of a year or so&mdash;it will then be binding on us, but it will be of a general kind which will permit the experiences of different national industries to express themselves in slightly different forms.  We shall not have an absolutely identical structure everywhere. We could certainly make some progress pending the adoption of the fifth directive and pending the question of a major reform of our company law.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Industry and Commerce if it is proposed that the IDA and Córas Tráchtála will establish a world-wide network of raw material purchasing and information centres; and, if so, if they will keep the Department of Transport and Power informed of developments.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JustinKeating" hpid="Mr. Keating Mr. Keating">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>A supplies information service has been established by the Industrial Development Authority and Córas Tráchtála after consultation with the Confederation of Irish Industry.  Sources of supply are sought for the requirements notified by Irish industrialists and the network of IDA <Col N="1473" /> and CTT overseas offices in the principal supplying countries are used for this purpose.  It is for the industrialist to negotiate prices and deliveries with the identified source.  Any information at the command of the service is available to Government Departments.</P>
      <P>My Department are kept fully informed of developments in the supplies information service; the Department of Transport and Power are being fully informed in so far as they are concerned.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JustinKeating" hpid="Mr. Keating Mr. Keating">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>I am, indeed, so aware.  This has been a preoccupation of the Department and myself since the full extent of the energy crisis began to emerge probably in mid-November. First, this supplies information service structured through the IDA and CTT is working well.  They are to be commended.  Secondly, the disruption that was feared, perhaps, two months ago is much less than anticipated.  Thirdly, we are extremely concerned with the situation but we have continuing contact both with that service and with CII and individual companies and we are doing our utmost to minimise the adverse effects of the raw materials and supplies shortage which is worldwide but is affecting us less than had been feared.</P>

At the weekend it was found by shopkeepers that there were 25 increases in that week.  If the price list is not in order, according to the Minister's standards, the shopkeepers would be summoned but otherwise they would be at a loss?</P>

    <Speaker pid="JustinKeating" hpid="Mr. Keating Mr. Keating">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>There is a need for commonsense and balance in the application of these Orders and I believe there is such.  Where indication is given of a contravention of the order, and there are valid grounds for it, or a genuine mistake has occurred, we are not ruthless in the prosecution of people.  On the other hand, the order exists for the protection of the public.  Were they not to be seriously applied in cases where genuine contravention exists, they would lose their effect and the public would lose its protection.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JustinKeating" hpid="Mr. Keating Mr. Keating">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>I relate the two of them by the fact that the Deputy does not understand the existing legislation. If he did he would not have asked that supplementary.  The answer I have given relates to contravention of maximum prices orders.  That is an entirely separate category&mdash;not prosecutions for overcharging but prosecutions in the same period for breaches of the retail prices display orders.  Of those there have been 414.  There are also more than 200 cases pending. These pending cases are being dealt with every day.

      <P>asked the Minister for Industry and Commerce if he is aware of the crisis situation caused by his action over the past six months in sanctioning long lists of price increases and his inaction in dealing with the larger lists of price increases which have not been sanctioned; and, if so, if he will indicate the action he intends to take in the matter.</P>

      <P>Manufacturers and firms or persons providing services are required by order to give me two months' notice of proposed increases in prices or charges.  Applications for increases in prices or charges are first examined in detail by the National Prices Commission who then make their recommendations to me.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In their report for January, 1974, the National Prices Commission gave a breakdown of the annual costs in 615 applications considered by them from 30th May, 1973, to 22nd January, 1974, and went on to point out that of £71.6 <Col N="1479" /> million of increased annual costs claimed in these 615 applications, £61.4 million was considered to be allowable and £56.9 million was actually allowed. This means that as a result of the commission's recommendations the prices of the products covered by these applications rose by one-fifth less than they would have risen if the applicants had not been subject to price control and that consumers have to pay £14.7 million per annum less for them than they would otherwise have had to pay.</P>
    <P>With a view to moderating the rate of inflation, a package of five orders was introduced by me in June last. Included in this package were orders freezing the cash margins of importers, wholesalers and retailers on a wide range of goods at the levels which obtained on 23rd June, 1973.  Another order fixed the maximum retail prices for a specified list of household goods. This was in addition to orders already in force fixing the maximum retail prices for bread and milk throughout the country and for drink in certain towns and cities.  The range of commodities for which a price must be displayed by a retailer was also considerably extended.  The advance notice required of any proposed increase in prices was extended by order from one month to two months.</P>
    <P>In the light of what I have just said I do not think I can be accused of any complacency in the matter of prices.  It must be recognised, however, that a significant factor in the inflationary spiral is the increase in import prices of materials and manufactured goods. The Deputy will appreciate that it is not possible for me to exercise control over this.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Labour (Mr. M. O'Leary)</NameTxt>
      <P>The reason is that the original title of this Bill was the Conditions of Employment (Equal Pay) Bill, 1973.  Since the introduction of that Bill under that title I have examined the entire area of discrimination somewhat more deeply and I consider that the purpose that I intend to discharge over this area of discrimination in employment would be more accurately described as the Anti-Discrimination Bill.  This would more accurately describe the intent that I have.  That is why I sought this particular change.  It will be linked with legislation later this year relating both to unfair dismissal and to the general question of discrimination in employment. I wish to indicate in the title of the Bill that it is part of a trinity of legislation dealing with discrimination in all its aspects in employment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="Mr. J. Lynch Mr. J. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>I fail to see the necessity for the change of emphasis. We have operated our Conditions of Employment Acts for almost 40 years under that title and it would seem to me that any changes required, whether by way of eliminating discrimination or otherwise, could well fit into the continuation of that title. However, the Government are entitled to change the emphasis if they wish.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should like, Sir, to put another question to you&mdash;whether in view of the fact that the apparent content of the proposed new legislation was widely debated in today's newspapers, some person on behalf of the Minister or the Government is in breach of the privileges of this House in permitting <Col N="1485" /> these matters to be debated in this fashion before this House had the opportunity of seeing the Bill in question?</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOLeary" hpid="Mr. M. O'Leary Mr. M. O'Leary">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>It would be naive to think that the subject matter of equal pay legislation has not been the matter for serious discussion in the media.  As the Leader of the Opposition will be aware, this legislation has been on the books in the northern part of this island for some time and, therefore, the main elements of such legislation are well known.  I have simply sought permission of the Dáil to introduce it under a different heading today. The Bill will be circulated to Deputies and I would hope to proceed to the Second Stage next week.  Therefore, I think the Leader of the Opposition need not be worried about any confidential information having been given to the Press.  Most of the elements of this legislation are well known to members of the Press and, indeed, to Members of the House.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not asking the Minister to justify his action in permitting features of the Bill to be released to the Press.  I am asking you, Sir, to consider whether the fact that it was done on the Minister's behalf, by somebody at his direction or with his permission, means that he or she is not in breach of the privileges of the House.  We now note that the Minister wants the Second Reading of this Bill next week.  This Bill was largely prepared before the Minister came to office.  He moved the First Reading of the Bill several months ago and he comes into the House now, on 26th February, asking for a Second Reading next week.  I still fail to see the terrible urgency of this matter.  The Minister was dilatory in proceeding with the Bill as originally presented to the House, yet he now asks for a debate on a matter that seems to have been widely debated already in the Press.  The Press would not have had access to the material without somebody on behalf of the Minister communicating it to them. I want to make it perfectly clear that we are anxious to see enacted as quickly as possible the provisions of this Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1486" /> The previous Government endorsed the spirit and intention of the Bill; not only had we endorsed them but we had initiated their implementation by introducing the idea of equal pay in the public service with a view to its ultimate implementation in the private sector.  I come back to my point&mdash;it is a matter for you, not for the Minister or me, to consider whether there has been a breach of privilege in the fact that all this matter has been disclosed in the Press by reason of somebody giving them the particulars in advance of the publication of the Bill.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>I have made the major part of my contribution on this Second Report on Developments in the EEC, and I have only a few brief remarks to make in conclusion.  I concentrated mainly on the section dealing with education and, in particular, on the reference in the report to a report which was commissioned by Professor Henri Janne.  Therefore, I shall conclude on the question of education in the Community by suggesting that some initiative should be taken, not an Irish, French or German initiative, but an initiative known to be a Community initiative in education.  After all, it is only quite recently that the EEC decided they would drop one of the Es and concentrate both in terminology and in fact on the idea of it being a European Community, not merely an economic community.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have a suggestion to make, not a well-formed one at the moment, but one which would deserve study and which has been mentioned on occasions by various people already in Europe, that some kind of European education institute should be established. Professor Janne in his report did say that one of the places where the Community should be very strong in the educational field is in that of modern language teaching.  The languages are there; the experience and the expertise should be there. What I am suggesting is this&mdash;and I <Col N="1490" /> may do something about it by way of motion later on&mdash;a European educational institute where a concentration could be made on the teaching of modern languages, particularly the European ones, and European languages spoken outside the existing Community as well.  I am glad to say that comments generally by the experts in the Janne report also took in other countries which are not now and may not be members of the Community.</P>
    <P>This institute could also develop educational technology generally, but particularly the technology that is now in use in the teaching of modern languages.  It could also be developed into a fine centre for a European library, a library, that is to say, for books which, through a liaison with the national libraries in the various countries of the Community, could be very useful.  It could also act as a library for films of one kind or another, not purely educational in the narrow or professional sense.  It could also quite usefully engage in mounting itinerant exhibitions of paintings, for example.  I know there is a difficulty about this.  We discussed this already in another context, and the question of security and expense is one that has to be taken into consideration. However, if we are to believe what we said ourselves and what other Europeans said, that it was not for the money bags situation that the Community was developed, we could spend some money in this line too.</P>
    <P>Incidentally, I would like either the Community Commission or the Community itself to get out some kind of handbook in which there would be a glossary of the terms that are in use, not merely for the general public but for people who are interested in the various legislative assemblies.  There is a rash of initials, dots and capital letters, and it is very difficult to pick one's way through them.  It is only a minor point but one that occurred to me on reading the reports.</P>
    <P>The whole purpose of my advocacy of this type of institute is, as I said, to give some kind of educative European dimension to the educational scene in Europe.  I know there was a <Col N="1491" /> proposition already for a European centre for educational development, and I believe a commission was set up &mdash;I am a little vague on this; there is no reference to it in the report as far as I remember&mdash;and people were asked to develop a programme of action in this field.  Perhaps we could hear something about how it is getting on, if I am right in thinking that is the case.</P>
    <P>Our Minister here could take some kind of European initiative.  We do not have to wait on Mr. Darnedorf or any of the Ministers in the various other member countries.  We could do this as an earnest of our interest in the EEC.  There has been great concentration on economics and on the social and regional policies.  I do not wish to be pessimistic about our progress in regard to regional policy but it has been bad and very disheartening. If achievement in some other field could be put before the people the pessimism which will inevitably set in if the monetary and economic union problem and the problems concerning the regional policy are not solved could be lessened.</P>
    <P>I have not much more to say about this second report.  I have a little to say in reference to paragraph 7 (1) of the Second Report, and on page 8 paragraph 24, and on page 9 paragraph 28 of the supplementary report which was circulated, and also in relation to directives Nos. 160 and 161. Directive No. 160 deals with the cessation of farming and Directive No. 161 deals with the socio-economic guidance to be provided for farmers.  I should like to say a few words about this.  Paragraph 28 of the supplementary report says that the socio-economic guidance will be by way of expansion of existing facilities.  It is rather difficult to make out what that is.  I am sure there is a document which has been submitted and I should like to be able to read such a document some time.  Does this mean purely economic guidance?  We have not got a highly-developed social guidance team. Does this mean the people who are directly employed by the Department of Agriculture and Fisheries or the <Col N="1492" /> Department of Lands, or does it mean that money may be provided for organisations such as Macra na Tuaithe and Macra na Feirme which are involved in educational work of this particular type?</P>
    <P>Directive No. 160 refers to the people who will be persuaded to leave farming.  This is purely an educational question.  That is why I am raising it here at all.  It says that the people who opt to lease or sell their land so that it may become available to development farmers will not be allowed to keep much land.  The area of the land they keep will be limited.  They will not be encouraged to produce in marketable quantities from the amount of land left to them.  I am reasonably familiar with the rural scene and I see serious problems in this proposal.  The human problem must be dealt with. Most people engaged in agriculture work long days and work every day. They work very hard.  If they are to be persuaded to leave most of their land in the pool for development farmers, it would be wrong to deprive them of the power to engage in horticulture.  I will define how this is relevant.</P>
    <P>A person who ceases to be involved in intensive activities will be lost and will not know what to do with himself. This is a serious social problem for a person of 55 to 60 years of age.  I understand that 55 years will be the relevant age in Ireland.  If such a man has a small plot of land, approximately an acre, left to him it is quite possible that he could derive a great deal of human fulfilment from using that acre or so for the production of vegetables. Quite often such a man does not know very much about the intensive cultivation of vegetables.  In this instance the socio-economic guidance could be brought to bear on the scene.  There could be someone who would instruct the man.  The social problem could be dealt with and the farmer could develop his acre or half-acre of garden. It would be ridiculous if he were allowed to develop it but not to sell the produce.  There are both social and educational problems here.</P>
    <P>I do not know whether we have power to amend or change a directive. I am sure we were not involved <Col N="1493" /> in the formulation of the directive. Consequently we could not have brought this idea to the Commission when the directive was being formulated. This is a problem which should get attention.  The fact that it is a social problem and that education is also involved to a certain extent means that it is a Community problem.  This would also enrich the country.  In rural areas vegetables have often to be brought from the capital city to the small towns. Developments in this regard could take place.  In Russia it is well-known that the collective farms are not totally satisfying to the people who work them but the Soviet authorities allowed patches of land for individual, private cultivation and as a result great quantities of horticultural produce came on the market and enriched the State.</P>
    <P>I will conclude by saying that there has been much disappointment along the road to economic and monetary union.  Would full economic and monetary union suit this country if we had it?  There has been much disappointment about the regional policy. We feel that the Community were not &ldquo;putting their money where their mouths were&rdquo;, when we were advocating joining the Community.  Some initiative that would succeed in the educational world would be a great boost to the whole idea of the Community.</P>
    <P>In the supplementary document reference was made to scientific and technological matters.  I would hope that we might get some help also about such matters.  There seems to be considerable discontent about the involvement of the country in higher technological education.  There are rumblings from the Dublin Higher Technological Colleges in Bolton Street and in Kevin Street and also in the College of Commerce in Rathmines. In developing these colleges we should try to take note of the European dimension.</P>
    <P>In this regard I hope there will be no false antithesis posed by anybody between the Dublin colleges and the regional technological colleges.  Some person in a rather important position <Col N="1494" /> has started this and is stating that the regional technical colleges will get all the money and the Dublin ones will not.  I hope this will die a sudden death in our own community as well as in the context of the European Economic Community.</P>
    <P>There is a reference in the supplementary report to cross-Border co-operation. I should like to make a brief reference to the submission which, I think, the Minister for Foreign Affairs got from Mr. Simpson of Queen's University in which a plan for the development of the Monaghan-Fermanagh region was tentatively outlined.  I am sure I do not have to ask the Minister to have a look at the map and to see that the large Cavan panhandle comes in between Fermanagh and Leitrim, both of which counties are mentioned. Mr. Simpson, for some reason, seems to have skipped over the western part of my native county and constituency. I am sure I can rely on the Minister, as a favour, to make sure that part of the constituency is taken into account if there is to be development in that region&mdash;I hope there is&mdash;as well as in the Derry-Donegal region.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Thornley</NameTxt>
      <P>I did not mean that rudely.  I meant that I should like, with your permission, Sir, to make a contribution from a specific point of view: that of someone who has been engaged with the others as a representative of this country in the European Parliament for the last nine months and to give those present in the House and the Minister the benefit of whatever lessons I have learned or mistakes I have made.  That is all I meant.  I did not mean to be in any way impertinent or offensive to the Deputy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This is the first opportunity I have had to contribute to the debate because for most of the time it was <Col N="1495" /> debated I was in Europe or buckled into one of the seats of EI 647 on the way to or from Europe and consequently not in a position to give my views.  Even at this moment I should be at a meeting of the very enlarged committee to which the Deputy refers.  I am not able to do so because I cannot be in two places at once. Thereby hangs a tale, one with which the Minister will be familiar, and one which I want to recount.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>The tale of the impossible.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidThornlet" hpid="Dr. Thornley Dr. Thornley">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Thornley</NameTxt>
      <P>Exactly.  Not even I could do that.  Only Deputy Gibbons has mastered the feat of being in two places at the same time, according to the newspapers.  I want to say something specific about the contribution we can make in Europe and the contribution Europe can make to us. Frankly, after nine months' membership of the European Parliament I am struck very sharply and very depressingly by the feeling that all of us are totally unprepared for accepting the obligations of European membership. I do not think we are ready for it; I do not think the Civil Service are ready for it; I do not think Deputies are ready for it and I do not think I am ready for it.  That does not mean that I am making a philosophical argument that we ought to withdraw from it.  I think that is quite impossible. On the contrary, having entered it, I think we should gear ourselves as rapidly as possible to it but I do not think we have succeeded in doing this.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The present status of Ireland in the European Economic Community is akin to that of a donkey entered for the Grand National.  Even when Deputies have finished talking about technological education and things like that, even in regard to such facilities as fluency in a second language this country positively disgraces itself by comparison with the other eight member states&mdash;every one of them, particularly the Scandinavian States. There is not a single member of the Irish delegation of ten who could <Col N="1496" /> conduct any kind of technical, sophisticated dialogue about anything in any other language than English.  The most any one of the ten of us can do is order a meal.  This is an appalling reflection on ourselves and on our educational system.  This is one of the things I want to get off my chest here today.</P>
    <P>Say a serious technical discussion comes up and Walter Scheel, the German Foreign Minister, is present. If the speaker is talking in English, French or German he takes off his instantaneous translation headphones and listens to what they are saying, whether they are talking about the &ldquo;snake in the tunnel&rdquo;, the floating of the French franc or nuclear disarmament. There is not a single Irishman in Europe from this Parliament who can do this.  I cannot do it.  I am probably the best French speaker of the five members of the Coalition Government and my French is diabolical. That, in the first instance, is a reflection on us.</P>
    <P>Secondly&mdash;I want to get this one off my chest, too&mdash;when we are all finished debating the mass of consequent legislation from the European Parliament we should bear in mind that the vast majority of the time of the members of the European Parliament is spent getting to and from the places in which it is meeting.  Aer Lingus, in their wisdom, deem the European Parliament to be so trivial that they are incapable of sustaining a direct service to Brussels, Strasbourg or Luxembourg with the consequence that the taxpayers' money, which sustains me and my colleagues in this representative position, is largely expended by my sitting in London Heathrow Airport waiting for connections to bring me to Strasbourg, Brussels or Luxembourg, if I am lucky enough to have one of those connections arrive on time.  If I am not there is always the hovercraft, which one of my colleagues had the good fortune to travel in from Ramsgate to Calais, arriving at midnight after a 12 hours' journey, not exactly in the best intellectual condition to make a massive contribution on the floating of the French franc.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1497" /> In these circumstances Ireland&mdash;I am being deliberately sarcastic here; I mean this and am not being funny&mdash; should again take a close look, and the Minister should also take a close look, at whether or not we are really in Europe.  Do we mean business?  The European entry campaign was sold by people who enthused about the importance of our European involvement. Is this importance being adequately reflected when overworked and tired men, like all ten of us&mdash;I include my colleagues on the other side of the House as much as my colleagues on this side of the House&mdash; are sent to Europe in a cumbersome, complicated and dilatory manner, inadequately briefed and in many respects unaware of what our obligations are and unable to make an adequate contribution?</P>
    <P>I do not for a moment want to enter into party politics.  I have no reputation in this House for being somebody who makes party points out of a relatively technical report, such as the kind we have before us.  I will, however, make the point that the Labour Party was the only party of the three parties in this House to to oppose membership <i>ab initio</i>.  We argued against my friends in Fine Gael who said that entry into the Common Market would be followed by a bonanza to the farmers from the common agricultural policy and to the workers from the regional and social funds.  We said this was impossible. We said Europe was already overproducing primary goods.  We said that the Germans would not continually pick up the price bill for the regional and social funds.  We said the honeymoon was coming to an end.</P>
    <P>The honeymoon is coming to an end and Europe, as everybody admits &mdash;the Minister mentioned this in his speech last night&mdash;is facing one of the most difficult and dangerous periods since the inception of the Common Market.  The honeymoon is coming to an end and owing to a series of coincidences, like the election in North Tipperary which led to a general election, the gentlemen who negotiated the protocol of accession now find themselves in opposition.  They are, <Col N="1498" /> therefore, arguing that the consequences which were predicted by people like Deputy Kavanagh, Deputy Keating and myself are in some way the result of our neglect.  They are nothing of the kind.  They are the consequences we predicted would in fact take place.</P>
    <P>I simply do not know how the stress could be placed on the imminent bonanza deriving from the common agricultural policy in the context of a situation where the French farmers are holding a sit-in in Strasbourg, complaining that they are not receiving adequate return for their products. How in these circumstances we can anticipate that the other eight countries are going to act as a charitable institution towards Irish agriculture, I cannot understand.</P>
    <P>I was attacked in Ireland for a vote which I made on support prices for a certain agricultural product.  That vote was on a technicality, that an urgency motion should be accepted.  I was not voting on principle against the acceptance of the form of support prices envisaged by those who supported the permission to have a vote of urgency. I simply saw no point in having the urgency vote when Commissioner Lardinois had made the statement he made.  Having said that, let me say&mdash; and no politician should say it&mdash;it is possible that in that instance I made a mistake.  I submit this, not so much because it is in any way damaging to me but because I want to underline the point that Irish delegates to the European Parliamentary Assembly from both sides of the House will continue to make mistakes while they are expected to be walking encyclopaedias on every aspect of European policy almost totally unsupported by any form of specialist information, at least until very recently.  Inevitably, we may make mistakes on both sides of the House; let us be honest and admit this.</P>
    <P>The other countries go to the European Parliament armed with support staffs.  I am not weeping and demanding ten secretaries or an executive jet but I am making the point that as everybody who goes to the Common Market Parliament knows&mdash;and every <Col N="1499" /> Deputy here who goes will bear me out on this&mdash;the volume of material that comes in our post every day of the working week is so incredibly great that it would be beyond the capabilities of Einstein to decipher that part of it which is relevant to Irish needs as against the great 99 per cent of it which is not.  As a result, we are led into making instantaneous judgments and, perhaps, these judgments in some cases on both sides have been wrong.  If we continue in this amateurish attitude towards the European Parliament they will continue to be wrong from time to time.</P>
    <P>I also want to stress the illusion that some people have about membership of the European Parliament.  To many people the European Parliament is a slightly more lucrative extension of the Council of Europe to which one goes for the occasional trip, as it is so euphemistically called here, bringing the wife if one can wangle her in at 50 per cent in Aer Lingus.  It is nothing of the kind; it is virtually a full-time job.  The Fianna Fáil Gaullist who is, I think vice-President of the Progressive Democrats, M. Cousté, referred to us the other day as exhausted men at a meeting in Berlin.  This is perfectly correct and in Europe there is increasing discussion of the whole concept of the dual mandate and whether it is possible for people like the eight of us who are Members of the Dáil to sustain our role in which we make a meaningful intellectual contribution to the European Parliament over a vast range of topics of vital importance both to Irish industry and agriculture and at the same time at weekends look over our shoulders to see if we can hang on to our seats at constituency level.  This problem applies not only to me, or even to the eight of us, but to the French, the Italians, the British and everybody else.  Deputy Kavanagh has just interrupted me to add &ldquo;the British&rdquo;.  On our last trip to Europe the Parliament was barren of Britons because the Britons were back at home making sure that they would be back there again&mdash;if you follow my logic.</P>
    <P>Joking apart&mdash;I know I have a <Col N="1500" /> rather flippant style&mdash;it is an impossible situation where you run what is technically the Parliament of nine nations in this kind of haphazard, backwards and forwards manner. What the ultimate solution is I do not know but it will certainly involve a vast increase in back-up services at home.  Until we&mdash;or our successors when we drop, are sacked or are dead &mdash;have people saying to us before we go: &ldquo;This or that is a matter of vital Irish urgency&rdquo; we will be unable to do our jobs effectively.</P>
    <P>Whatever rumours may have appeared to the contrary in the Press the ten delegates who go to Europe act, in the main, as a team in a very united and friendly fashion and we discuss all issues between ourselves. There are occasional divergencies, more often arising from misunderstanding owing to incapacity to communicate in an enormous building seating some 400 people.  In the main, we tend to act together as a unit in the interests of the Irish nation and I think my Fianna Fáil friends will agree on this.  I should like to see more of this, a point to which I shall return.</P>
    <P>Deputy Wilson, I think, raised a tremendous argument about increasing technological education here.  Let me say: For heaven's sake, will the Minister communicate with the utmost urgency to his colleague, the Minister for Education, the necessity to take a cold, hard look at the curriculum in primary and secondary education in order to ensure that Irish people have a facility in at least one European language because with the growing possibility of an axis of emigration aiming not so much towards England but towards the Continent, the prospects for our ordinary people are extremely bleak.  England may have done us a great deal of harm&mdash;I think she did; I know that is not a popular view now&mdash;but at least she taught us the language of the conqueror so that when we go to England we are virtually undetectable except, perhaps, by our social habits in the Finchley Road.  At least we can get work.  If we are going to work in Dusseldorf or Frankfurt it could be a very different situation.  The ordinary barman in a <Col N="1501" /> hotel in Brussels has a greater fluency in three languages than I have as a university professor.  This is a terrible state of affairs.  Even if it means the savage battering of some items in the secondary school curriculum like, for example Irish, I am afraid, it may be necessary to do this in order to make sure that children carry at least one Continental language with them in a fresh migratory situation.  Already, as the Minister knows, Europe is deeply concerned about the fate of migrant workers in the Ruhr of, say, Turkish, Hungarian or Czechoslovakian extraction. I should hate to think that Irishmen, who can speak only English or, perhaps, rusty Irish, will find themselves lumped in the same sort of living conditions in which people from eastern Europe and parts of Italy at present find themselves in the Ruhr.</P>
    <P>It may be suggested that I am making a mountain out of a molehill. It is valid to say: Deputy Thornley is a member of the European Parliament which is a lucrative position&mdash; in the main, it is.  It is also membership of an institution which has no power except the residual power to pass a vote of no confidence in the Commission.  There is a grain of honesty in that and yet, as I am sure the Minister knows, the sort of moral influence which the European Parliament exercises over the Commission and the Council of Ministers is quite extraordinary and is bound to grow. As a relatively young man I am quite terrified at the lack of understanding of the significance of Europe that the ordinary man-in-the-street in Ireland has at present.  We are a tiny country and if we are defeated on things like the common agricultural policy, the regional policy or the social fund, the lives and livelihoods of ordinary Irish people will be qualitively affected, possibly as they have not been affected since the Famine.  This must be brought home to the people and it has not yet been done.</P>
    <P>Some day an Irish Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries will rise and say: &ldquo;I am doing it this way&rdquo;.  An Irish Minister for Finance will rise and say: &ldquo;I am awfully sorry, we are giving up direct taxation and going <Col N="1502" /> straight over to value-added tax.&rdquo;  An Irish Minister for Social Welfare will say: &ldquo;I am sorry, we are proceeding to a certain footing of insurance schemes in the future&rdquo;.  Then what a certain political commentator would call &ldquo;the pundits&rdquo;, will scream and say: &ldquo;Why wasn't it done differently?&rdquo;. The Minister will have to say: &ldquo;I did not do it differently because under protocol PE/374, subsection X/Y of 1974, I have no alternative but to do it this way&rdquo;.  Then and only then will the ordinary voter realise how important this exercise was.  This is why Deputy Kavanagh and I, who both opposed entry to the Common Market&mdash;indeed, as far as I recall Deputy Kavanagh's constituency returned the highest vote against the referendum&mdash;now being Members of the Parliament, feel that it is our duty to put the maximum amount of endeavour and effort on behalf of our country into that institution.</P>
    <P>In this we would like and ask for two things: The support of the Minister of back-up services of one kind or another and&mdash;despite any apparent altercations which have taken place between Fianna Fáil delegates and I in Europe&mdash;the support of the Fianna Fáil Party.  Europe is facing an extremely delicate and difficult economic situation which is in no way the result of any action taken by the Government. It is inevitable that prices have risen and will rise further.  I will explain why this is relevant in a moment.</P>
    <P>If there is an election in three years time I foresee that it will be inevitable that somebody like Deputy Nolan will go to my constituency and say: &ldquo;The price of steak was Xp per pound in 1972 and it is 2Xp in 1976.  That is what Coalition Government does for you&rdquo;.  I shall say: &ldquo;This is the situation. Because the snake escaped from the tunnel, France floated the franc, which was a form of concealed devaluation, Kissinger, in turn, in alliance with France, endeavoured to divide the Common Market, the German Social Democrats became hostile at picking up 80 per cent of the bill, and the energy crisis so altered the terms of trade unfavourably <Col N="1503" /> to Ireland that there was no other consequence but that prices would go up.&rdquo;  I am inclined to think that the electorate will listen to the shorter explanation rather than the longer one.  Nevertheless the longer one would be more correct.</P>
    <P>We should give attention to a point which is passing through the European Parliament at the moment and that is the control of multi-national corporations.  I am frightened that the minority of Irish firms which had geared themselves to genuine competition will be in serious danger over the next decade or two.  I foresee a very unpleasant future for Irish industry. Firms fall into two kinds: those which have ignored the CIO report and did not prepare themselves for free competition and those, such as Irish Distillers, which have prepared themselves for free competition but are in danger of growing to such a competitive level that almost inevitably they will be taken over by larger international groupings.</P>
    <P>I should like to discuss how the European Parliament works.  Whatever the report may say about the control of legislation, the fundamental work of the Parliament, as any member of it on either side of the House knows, is done through groups and committees, particularly committees. This is unspectacular work. It does not get any publicity, nor does it get any kudos on the home front. Deputy Kavanagh and I, in the main, but not in every case, have taken the view that we should work through our group, the group of Social Democrats which is the largest group of 51 members.  Since it is the most disciplined group and the one which, in many ways represents the Government, that is the German Social Democratic Government which is paying for the Regional Fund, we have taken the view that it is more effective for us to be influential within that group rather than endlessly to be making political gimmickry as individuals on behalf of Ireland.  This has led us into some difficulties about the common agricultural policy.  I will not argue the point as to whether a <Col N="1504" /> larger proportion of a smaller regional fund, or a <i>juste retour</i> of a larger regional fund, would be more equitable for Ireland than a smaller share of a larger fund based on the principle of <i>juste retour</i>.  I am inclined to the first view, with which I think the Minister will be sympathetic.  If membership of the Parliament gives us any advantages it is possible that it will allow us to by-pass our traditional dependence on the British market and open up allies in both France and Germany.  This is the line which Deputy Kavanagh and I have tended to take with our group which is largely dominated by the German Social Democrats.  We have very good friendly and influential relationships with this group.</P>
    <P>It would be wrong if party politics were played between the two groups. Deputy Kavanagh and I are two of a group of 51, representing all nine countries.  The Fianna Fáil delegates are five of a group of 16, representing two countries.  If they will forgive my apparent rudeness, I think it is common knowledge that their group&mdash; of Fianna Fáil delegates and Gaullists &mdash;was brought into existence to qualify for secretariat assistance under the then Rules of Accession.  All that both groups have in common is that both arose out of war situations and are dedicated to the memory of great leaders&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>It would be a great pity if we were to compare the two groups in a childish way.  As the Minister brought out correctly last night, while it is possible to attack the Germans for arguing that they have an urban orientated frame of mind, it is also arguable to say that French nationalism has held back the real development of the Common Market more in the last few years than any other single factor.  I say it is &ldquo;arguable&rdquo; because nobody knows at the moment who is responsible for the present state of the Common Market. The Washington Conference and the independent decision to float the franc have not exactly done this country any good.  I do not think that my Fianna <Col N="1505" /> Fáil friends should boast too much about their close links with the Gaullist Party.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Thornley</NameTxt>
      <P>If I thought that for Deputy Kavanagh, Deputy Dunne, Deputy McDonald, Deputy Creed and I to go to Europe and stand in the European Parliament and scream &ldquo;Ireland, Ireland, Ireland&rdquo; every five minutes would get us anywhere, I would be the first to advocate doing it. From my experience of the European Parliament I know that such an attitude would not be particularly successful.  It would be akin to the speeches that used be made about partition in the United Nations some 30 years ago, which, when I last looked, had not achieved any productive result.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With due respect to Deputy Nolan there is a point here which we must look into.  There is a tug between the urban and rural concept of the European Parliament.  There are those in the European Parliament, and they are not confined to the socialist group, who envisage farming as virtually a redundant form of activity and would like to see agricultural services reduced by any manner possible to the detriment, ultimately, of the Irish people.  When I see that danger coming from those people I will be the first to consult with Deputies Nolan, Gibbons and Herbert in an effort to arrest that.  I admit such people exist but I do not think they are confined to the socialist group.  It is a problem <Col N="1506" /> of European dimensions and must be treated on that scale.</P>
    <P>Unless we bend ourselves to this very great problem of European involvement with a seriousness which we have not shown, at least where the Parliament is concerned, over the last nine months, I see a very grim future for this country.  I want to place on the record of this House the future I see for this country unless we are successful in winning allies in Europe, and more specifically in Germany, since the cost to that country of a substantial contribution to the regional and social fund would be so small in terms of the German Exchequer that it would hardly matter.  Unless we make friends on the Continent, and particularly in Germany, I see a prospect of an Ireland in which some two million people will live in Dublin and Cork, employed by multi-national corporations, threequarters of a million will live on large farms in the midlands while the rest will be scattered around picturesque areas of the west and south-west in order that they may be photographed by continental and American tourists leaning against the doors of white-washed cottages preserved by An Taisce.</P>
    <P>That is not an Ireland in which I particularly want to live.  If I have made any mistakes <i>vis-à-vis</i> my Fianna Fáil friends on the Continent, I apologise for them now.  The areas in which we should look with a single voice from this country are the areas of regional policy, social policy, common agricultural policy, monetary policy and, ultimately, the significance to this country of the inevitable, if delayed, emergence of direct elections.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelHerbert" hpid="Mr. Herbert Mr. Herbert">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Herbert</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to make a brief contribution to this important debate.  The report before us deals with the second period of the first year of our accession to the EEC which is by far the more important of the two periods.  Starting from the Paris summit of October, 1972, the Community was preoccupied with the commencement of its second stage of evolution, its humanising stage.  The two sectors most involved in this operation were the social affairs sector and the regional policy sector.  Under <Col N="1507" /> the able guidance of Dr. Hillery and Mr. Thomson, Commissioners who have done an excellent job, the deadlines set down by the Paris summit will be met.</P>
      <P>If the Commissioners worked hard so also has the European Parliament. The area I am most conversant with is that dealing with regional policy and in this regard the European Parliament worked very hard under their adverse conditions and in a hurried fashion due to delays in other institutions. That Parliament passed four important reports.  The European Parliament has a good tradition, a strong history in the field of regional policy.  They were the forerunner in advocating a genuine regional policy. In 1966 they adopted the Berujani Report and sent it to the Commission but, unfortunately, the Community did not take heed of Parliament's thinking in this regard with the result that today the gap between the richest area in the Community and the poorest is in the ratio of 5:1.</P>
      <P>Be that as it may, the Parliament has performed admirably over the past six months in this field.  I should like to place on the record of this House the activities of the European Parliament in this field; it would be more appropriate for me to say the appropriate committee of that Parliament, the Committee on Regional Policy and Transport.  On 16th May the Council of Ministers forwarded to the European Parliament document No. 1150, the Thomson Report on Guidelines For a Community Regional Policy.  This report was sent to the Committee on Regional Policy and Transport and, after many hours and weeks of in-depth study and serious deliberation, the Parliament, through their rapporteur, submitted their first report contained in document 120/73.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That document endorsed the idealistic motivation of the Paris summit. Not merely did it endorse the guidelines of the Thomson Report but in many ways it strengthened it.  Even a casual study of the motions in the resolution of this report will illustrate clearly Parliament's deep commitment <Col N="1508" /> to a genuine regional policy. The main theme of that report was that the funds should be concentrated in the areas where the need was greatest. It rejected the principle of <i>juste retour</i>.  Paragraph 10 of this motion was of great importance to Ireland.  I should like to quote the paragraph of this resolution:</P>
    <P>The European Parliament considers that in the case of development regions extending beyond an internal frontier of the Community binding forms of co-operation should be established and be legally binding in the member States concerned.</P>
    <P>I am glad to see that this has been referred to in the report before us.  In reference to paragraph 10, I should like to tell the House that in my speech to the European Parliament contained in volume 164 of the official debates of the European Parliament I said:</P>
    <P>Paragraph 10 of the motion refers to cross-border co-operation.  This is of great importance to a number of Member States which, for one reason or another, were unable to synchronise development in their cross-border areas and are now faced with serious problems in these areas.</P>
    <P>For us in Ireland&mdash;and when I say &ldquo;Ireland&rdquo; I mean all Ireland ...&mdash;section 5, paragraph 9, is of very special importance.  Unfortunately, a boundary exists in our country.  Whatever may be said for its existence politically, it most certainly has no justification from an economic viewpoint.  When the border was drawn its draftsmen completely ignored economic and social considerations, and, consequently natural and homogeneous regions that should have developed simultaneously during the past 50 years have economically drawn apart not merely to their own detriment but to the serious impairment of the economy of the entire country.  Consequently, these areas are the most depressed in the entire Community. ...I draw these areas to the special notice of Commissioner Thomson and ask him to ensure that regional <Col N="1509" /> policies are co-ordinated by both Dublin and Westminster in the implementation of regional policy in Ireland.</P>
    <P>I am glad to note that that has been done.  The European Parliament forwarded a second report again through its rapporteur, Mr. Delmotte.  It is contained in document 178/73, based on Commission documents 11 71, 11 70 and 12 18.  The first commission document was a draft directive on the decision to create a committee for regional policy.  The second was a financial regulation on special provisions to be applied to the European Development Fund.  The third was the regulation establishing the regional development fund.</P>
    <P>The second report reiterated the thinking in the first report, namely, that the fund should only intervene where national aid is inadequate to be effective.  In paragraph 19 of the explanatory memorandum of that report a practical example is given. Paragraph 19 reads:</P>
    <P>The most representative example is that of Ireland which has practically no single region able to make up for the disadvantageous position of the others except for the coastal region which is the most highly industrialised.  The <i>per capita</i> is the lowest in the Community.  Moreover, the growth rate of the GNP is particularly low, at about 4 per cent.  Without Community aid the country would not be able to take on the Community tasks arising from the economic and monetary union.</P>
    <P>Resulting from paragraph 19, the Fianna Fáil members of the European Progressive Democrats realised the importance of this paragraph as far as the motion for a resolution was concerned and consequently proposed an amendment to the resolution on November 7th.  This resolution read as follows:</P>
    <P>In the allocation of regional aid, account must be taken of the unique character of the regional problems in countries which have no developed regions within their borders on which to draw internally for a transfer of resources.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1510" /> At this point I should like to digress and correct an inaccuracy in the report before us.</P>

      <P>Page 85.  It states that it was proposed by the Irish delegation. It was not proposed by the Irish delegation.  It was proposed by the European Democratic Group on the initiative of the five Fianna Fáil members. I just say that to correct the record.</P>
      <P>The third and final report on the regional policy committee contained in document 276/73, based on the Commission documents 17 50 and 17 51 governing the Areas Maps for the RDF and FEOGA was submitted to the European Parliament by the Committee on Regional Policy and Transport. The report, in the main, rejected the lists of regions as contained in the regulation and the rapporteur stated that the proposed lists must be regarded in a very general framework within which it would be necessary to establish priorities.</P>
      <P>When speaking on this report in the European Parliament on 13th December, of last year as reported in volume 169 of the Debates of the European Parliament I said:</P>
      <P>These areas should not be regarded as mendicant areas, and the large financial aid they must receive should not be regarded as a charitable donation.  On the contrary, it should be regarded as a Community investment.  These areas represent a very substantial opportunity for growth by Community industry.  In such areas&mdash;I refer specially to Ireland&mdash;are to be found the very last sources of Europe's under-employed and unemployed labour, a labour force of a very high quality which is among the most adaptable in the world.  In such areas as Ireland are to be found the natural resources necessary for industrial development.</P>
      <P>At the conclusion of my contribution on that day, I stated:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When we meet again in plenary session the fund will, I hope, have been established.  I pray that our <Col N="1511" /> dreams and aspirations will at last be on the road to fulfilment, making Europe a better place for all its people, from the West Coast of Ireland to the southern tip of Sicily.</P>
    <P>Alas, that has not happened and the Regional Policy Committee of the European Parliament are naturally very disappointed at the Council's failure to establish a regional fund. They tabled a question to the Council at the last plenary session of the Parliament but the answer was not very satisfactory.</P>
    <P>Despite the pessimism regarding the Regional Fund voiced by the two previous speakers, I am optimistic that the fund will be established at the next Council meeting.  The Council must regain for the Community their rapidly disappearing credibility. The Community have received many body blows in recent months. There was the artificial oil crisis, two member states were left without Parliaments, Britain and Belgium, with peculiar implications for the Community so far as the British election was concerned, and there was a new Government in Denmark.</P>
    <P>All these events and problems did not help the Community in their decision-making. Setting up the fund now would be a much needed symbol of solidarity at a very crucial period.  The fund can scarcely be less than 1,400 million units of account, which is approximately 50 per cent of the Commission's demand.  On reflection, this is a colossal figure when one considers the thinking of the Community eight months ago.  Naturally, we would like to see the largest possible fund but the Committee last week were assured by Commissioner George Thomson that, irrespective of the size of the fund, Ireland and the Mezzogiorno would get their proper share.</P>
    <P>At this stage I do not attach all that importance to the size of the fund.  What is important is that a fund be established so that the principle and the philosophy behind the fund be accepted freely by all member states.  The Regional Fund is not a stop-gap measure or an emergency <Col N="1512" /> aid scheme for a period of three years. I am sure it will become a permanent feature of future EEC budgets.  I am convinced that if the Commission are given the degree of flexibility they are demanding they can, and will produce a genuine regional policy.</P>
    <P>Having placed the endeavours of the European Parliament with regard to regional policy on the record of this House and turning to the report before us, I do not see any signs of preparedness on the part of the Government to avail of aids from the fund.  In relation to infrastructural projects and help and guidance to the private sector in industry, have the Government an overall national development plan?  Have they consulted the nine RDOs?  Have they required them to submit plans for the various regions?  Are they co-ordinating these plans into an overall national plan?  These matters disturb me.  The fund should have been off the ground on 1st January last; if it were operational now the Commissioner would be open to accept projects but yet there is no evidence of an national plan in regard to regional development.</P>
    <P>The only evidence is contained in the supplementary report we received this morning.  It states vaguely that discussions at official level have been held between the British and Irish authorities on the joint approach by both Governments, with the assistance of the Northern Ireland Executive, to the Commission for a proposed study of the development of cross-Border areas in Ireland.  I do not know what agency the Government will use, but perhaps the Minister will tell us in his reply.  Is it suggested that they use the agency of the Council of Ireland?</P>
    <P>Let me tell the House of Unionist thinking in this regard, as expressed by a very close and trusted friend of the CEO of the Executive, Brian Faulkner.  This person is Rafton Pounder, Unionist Member for South Belfast, speaking in the European Parliament in relation to the Regional Fund and the proposed Council of Ireland.  In Vol. 167 of the official <Col N="1513" /> journal of the debates in the European Parliament he stated:</P>
    <P>The second point I wish to make concerns specifically the application of the Regional Development Fund to Northern Ireland and the Irish Republic.  As I am the only person in this Parliament who comes from Northern Ireland and quite a number of Representatives from the Irish Republic have already spoken and more are on the list, I should like to make my position absolutely clear on one point which has already been raised.</P>
    <P>I think it was raised by Deputy Nolan. He went on:</P>
    <P>In recent weeks and months there has been much talk in Ireland about the possibility of establishing a Council of Ireland which, if and when it is created, should be given certain powers and functions.  In certain political circles in Ireland it has been advocated that the Council should be empowered to determine the projects which may attract Community regional assistance.  That is a view I totally and utterly reject.  I do not wish to see any Council of Ireland involvement in the policy of the Committee.  The Commission should decide the projects it will assist.  The Commission should establish the procedure for funding and supervising the projects which will arise.  It would be wholly wrong for any outside organisation such as the Council of Ireland to act in an agency capacity.  I believe passionately in the Regional Fund, but I want to see it administered, financed, organised&mdash;everything&mdash;through the Commission.</P>
    <P>This is Unionist thinking as expressed by its only spokesman in Europe, Mr. Pounder.  Irrespective of what Mr. Pounder says about the trans-border areas, 200 miles long and 20 miles deep on either side, involving 250,000 people, it must have immediate access to the Community regional aid or its position will deteriorate further.  If this is delegated to the proposed Council of Ireland it may fall a victim to the veto of the Council of Ministers.</P>
    <P>In relation to regional aid <i>vis-à-vis</i> the rest of the country, I want to see <Col N="1514" /> the correction of the national imbalance rapidly pursued as it was by Fianna Fáil in their last 16 years of office&mdash;it was the central plank of our platform in that period.  I could quote some figures in support of that but I would briefly refer to the Thomson Report of May 3rd which proves conclusively that in the past 15 years the Government had a well-balanced regional plan and were having great success in correcting the imbalance between the east coast and the rest of the country.  I have not the reference but the report is there for anybody who wishes to read it.</P>
    <P>It is my contention that the east coast should not qualify for regional aid.  It should be given to the areas most in need of it, the south-west, the west and the north-west.  If I may be parochial for a moment, I should like to refer to the Lands Use and Transportation Study put forward by the Midwest Regional Development Organisation.  This report contains the basic infrastructural requirements for the region.  It is in four volumes and is a fine report of its kind, the only one to be embarked on and presented by an RDO in the country.  I should like, indeed I insist, that this report be processed immediately by the appropriate Department.</P>
    <P>On the matter of help for the private sector of industry, I blame the Government for deliberately hiding or going slow in the matter of regional benefits to that sector.  For example, why do the IDA in their literature not state that their aid to this type of industry can be supplemented to the extent of 50 per cent from the EEC Regional Fund?  Are the Government wilfully concealing information in order to save money at Community expense to the detriment of Irish industry?</P>
    <Speaker pid="MylesStaunton" hpid="Mr. Staunton Mr. Staunton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Staunton</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Deputy referring to the EEC Regional Fund?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelHerbert" hpid="Mr. Herbert Mr. Herbert">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Herbert</NameTxt>
      <P>I am.  Speaking of aid to small industrialists under the 50,000 units of account who are precluded by article 4 of the regulation establishing the regional fund, I think such industrialists can qualify for aid from the regional fund from the point <Col N="1515" /> of view of sector or region and I should like to hear the Minister's comment on that.  I am speaking of the many little men in industry who were so enthusiastic about accession to the EEC and who feel they have been let down.</P>
      <P>Recently I visited Sicily as a member of a delegation from the Transport and Regional Policy Committee of the European Parliament and I was shocked to learn of the lack of awareness of the Government and of the Sicilian local authorities.  That is one of the most depressed areas in the Community.  Having, as it were, a fairy godmother in Brussels leaning over backwards to help them, Sicily slept through it all.  I mention this Sicilian experience to alert the Government and others concerned with regional development to the fact that I have invited a similar delegation here for five days, commencing on Monday.  They will be spending three days in the South and two in the North.  There will be nine parliamentarians and some people from the secretariat of the committee.  I spoke to the Minister for Foreign Affairs last week on this and submitted my thoughts on the itinerary of the delegation. I told him of the types of people this delegation should meet and the places they are anxious to see. They will start in Dublin and I would propose that they visit the south-west, the mid-west, the west and the north-west as well as the trans-Border areas. They will cross the Border at Derry.  I will accompany the delegation for their two days in the North and my counterpart in the North will accompany them here.  I have given details to the Minister who received me very courteously and was very enthusiastic about their visit.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Another defect in this report is the omission of any reference to the FEOGA Guidance Section <i>vis-à-vis</i> Ireland.  The country should have full and free access to this fund.  The entire country qualifies under the fund's criteria and its importance to us is self-evident.  The Guidance Section of FEOGA finances structural reform in farming and improvements <Col N="1516" /> in production and marketing methods. The range and scope of the grants covers group water schemes, land reclamation, pig breeding, horticulture, the food processing industry equipment and, of course, marketing.  As I have stated, this fund is the agricultural Regional Fund and to it Ireland should have unlimited access.</P>
    <P>In 1973 I understand 92 applications were submitted covering the area I have just mentioned.  The value of the grant applications exceed £12 million and this certainly is a sizeable figure, a figure not to be treated lightly.  But apparently from current correspondence in <i>The Irish Times,</i> the Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries is alleged to have taken this aspect of his work lightly.  Fergus Pyle, who is a very well-informed journalist and who always has his finger on the EEC pulse, had a most revealing article in <i>The Irish Times</i> of 29th January, 1974, entitled &ldquo;Did Ireland Bungle FEOGA Applications?&rdquo;  He states that the applications were badly presented, lacking in vital statistical information and many were returned on this account; consequently, applications for much needed grants will now have their chances of success greatly diminished.  The Minister for Local Government is alleged also to be guilty in this respect.  If this allegation is true, and I have every reason to believe it is, then the Government are guilty of gross neglect.</P>
    <P>However, there is another question in relation to FEOGA which is not being asked, and I am asking the Minister for Foreign Affairs: why was the maximum amount of grant not sought?  Is it true that only 25 per cent of a grant was sought for each of the 92 applications?  Was it not known to the Ministers concerned that certain projects can qualify for a 45 per cent grant?  The certain projects I mention, according to the FEOGA regulations, are production projects within the farm gate.  I have examined the FEOGA volume containing the list of successful applications for 1972 and find that all the production projects qualify for a grant of 45 per cent of the amount invested. Why was only 25 per cent sought in <Col N="1517" /> the case of our applications?  This is something I should like to hear the Minister explain.</P>
    <P>In conclusion, I wish to make a number of small points briefly as referred to by Deputy Thornley. Recently I was appointed a <i>rapporteur</i> on a very important EEC draft directive, a directive that will have serious economic and social implications for Ireland.  I sought the opinion of the Department of Local Government on this directive.  I did it correctly and consulted the Minister's office.  I was given a name to contact, which I duly did, to be met with a great degree of caution, reluctance and doubt as to whether the national viewpoint should be taken at the Council level or at the European Parliamentary level.</P>
    <P>I now wish to be told in plain language the implications of this statement.  Was it due to Civil Service over-caution or was it due to a Government directive, as part of an overall Government strategy <i>vis-à-vis</i> the Council of Ministers and the European Parliament, with special emphaasis on the Fianna Fáil Members? From subsequent events in connection with this matter, I am convinced that the latter reason is true, as my queries had been channelled through the Department of Foreign Affairs and the observations came back from that Department&mdash;in actual fact the observations amounted to nil.  This draft directive, with very serious economic and social implication for Ireland passed through the Council of Ministers and I thought it would be highly desirable from the national viewpoint that this should be opposed at the first available opportunity, which was at Parliamentary level.</P>
    <P>I wish to refer, in particular, to paragraph (c) of Article 6 of Commission Document 862 on the harmonisation of laws relating to vehicle driving licences, which provides for:</P>
    <P>A medical examination as to the applicant's physical fitness, designed in particular to test his sight, hearing and nervous system, and to ascertain whether he is suffering from any pathological condition which would lead to loss of consciousness <Col N="1518" /> or any serious impediment of movement...</P>
    <P>Paragraph (d) provides for:</P>
    <P>A psychological examination involving a character test as to the applicant's fitness to drive.</P>
    <P>Article 8 goes a little bit further and states that people under the age of 50 must present themselves for that type of medical examination every five years, every two years in the case of persons over 50, and every year in the case of persons over the age of 65.</P>
    <P>The Department of Local Government had no comment to make on this serious directive.  I am convinced that if this directive was applied in Ireland approximately one million licence holders, between mopeds and juggernauts, would be put off the road straightaway.  This would be disastrous. Nevertheless, the Department of Local Government had no comment.  There was a suggestion of a two-tier system and that member states should issue driving licences to be operated within their own countries.  The Department of Local Government comment on that was that it would be contrary to the spirit of the Community.</P>
    <P>This was the first occasion on which I had an opportunity of getting Government opinion on a draft directive. I would hate to think that Fianna Fáil Members are being denied the right to express the national viewpoint. Is the Minister for Foreign Affairs acting as chief censor in this regard?  Is he giving us as little as possible, when it suits him best?  For example, the speech which the Minister made to the Council of Ministers in October mysteriously appeared in the plenary session prior to the debate on the regional policy.  This makes one wonder.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Herbert</NameTxt>
      <P>I made the point that the Minister gave as little as possible at times which suited him best.  I was comparing my lack of briefing from the Department of Local Government to the Minister's speech which appeared <Col N="1519" /> mysteriously in the Chamber in Strasbourg.</P>

      <P>In conclusion, I should like to refer to Deputy Thornley and his reference to the incompatability between the Fianna Fáil group and the French Gaullists. Let me say here and now that this is one of the most cohesive groups in Parliament.  We had studied the political philosophies of the various groupings in the Parliament for six months before we decided to form this group. I am committed to the grouping.  We share all common ground in relation to the domestic policies of the market with particular reference to CAP and the regional fund, and the French understand the subtleties of our traditional <Col N="1520" /> stand on neutrality.  If our opponents appear to be making misjudgments on the various occasions that is not our fault.  We are not playing politics in the European Parliament. The European Parliament is an extension of national Parliaments where delegations are looked on not as national delegations but according to their philosophies.  They act accordingly.</P>
      <P>On important issues, such as the issue of neutrality, CAP, and the regional fund, we have never acted against the national interest.  Perhaps Deputy Thornley is in the wrong political department in Europe.  I hope that the next Council meeting, which I understand is next week, will have the regional fund on the agenda.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MylesStaunton" hpid="Mr. Staunton Mr. Staunton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Staunton</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad that I am speaking after Deputy Herbert in the sense that he had much to say about the regional policy in the EEC.  I hope to address a few remarks to that topic. We should bear in mind that this debate is taking place at a time when the EEC are under a cloud to a certain extent especially since the recent energy crisis which seem to have had a very traumatic effect within the Community.  At the same time I should think that if the EEC face fundamental crises, as they appear to have been doing recently, this gives the opportunity to our Minister for Foreign Affairs to play a disproportionate and highly objective role in the deliberations of the EEC.  Our country is in a sense detached from the major countries on the European mainland.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should like to compliment the Minister on his recent initiatives in Washington during discussions relating to the energy problems and the problems of European unity.  The Minister attempted to propose certain solutions.  I listened to Deputy Herbert with considerable interest when he spoke about the regional fund of the EEC which is, of course, fundamental. If we look back at the debate that took place in this country when we decided to join the EEC, apart from the emotions and the advantages which emerged in terms of the philosophy of joining Europe, there were certain pragmatic measures which <Col N="1521" /> were extremely important.  The lowest common denominator of those in favour of entry was that we did not really have a choice.  Our major market, Britain, was joining the Community. This would tend to leave us out in the cold.  If there was no choice, then we had the obligation to join the EEC.  Rising a little above that, and again looking at it pragmatically, there were two particular areas in which it was suggested that it was in the national interest we should become a member of the EEC.  One of those areas was a common agricultural policy.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>I move:</P>
      <P>That Dáil Éireann re-affirms the following resolution, unanimously passed on the 10th May, 1949, protesting against British legislation endorsing Partition:</P>
      <P>Dáil Éireann,</P>
      <P>Solemnly re-asserting the indefeasible right of the Irish nation to the unity and integrity of the national territory,</P>
      <P>Re-affirming the sovereign right of the people of Ireland to choose its own form of Government and, through its democratic institutions, to decide all questions of national policy, free from outside interference,</P>
      <P>Repudiating the claim of the British Parliament to enact legislation affecting Ireland's territorial integrity in violation of those rights, and</P>
      <P>Pledging the determination of the Irish people to continue the struggle against the unjust and unnatural partition of our country until it is brought to a successful conclusion;</P>
      <P>Places on record its indignant protest against the introduction in the British Parliament of legislation purporting to endorse and continue the existing partition of Ireland, and</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Calls upon the British Government and people to end the <Col N="1522" /> present occupation of our six north-eastern counties, and thereby enable the unity of Ireland to be restored and the age-long differences between the two nations brought to an end.</P>
    <P>In moving this motion, perhaps, I should re-assert my own personal stand in regard to the matter that the motion deals with and say, for the benefit of the House and the records of the House as well as for the benefit of those who may have other views of my outlook, that my views on the Partition of our country and the best way in which a solution of lasting peace, not alone between north and south but also between Great Britain and Ireland, might be sought has been expressed on many occasions by me and, indeed, received quite a wide measure of publicity.</P>
    <P>Naturally, there were many critics of those views.  Some of those critics have often sought to saddle me with hidden motives ranging from self-ambition to mischievousness or worse. In reply I will only remind the House that I come from an Irish republican background.  I was raised in an Irish Republican tradition and I have never to my knowledge betrayed or reneged on that tradition.  The House will grant me the fact that I speak with some knowledge of the northern scene and I have always been consistent&mdash;indeed, one might say persistently consistent&mdash;in the views I have expressed.</P>
    <P>Those who wish to criticise me should at least examine the various points and speeches I have made over the past four or five years.  They will find that many of the tragic things I warned against have come to pass. They will further find that what I have always argued is, unfortunately, only too true&mdash;that those who have condemned the violence that bedevils this land, who have condemned without seeking to understand and remove the underlying roots of this violence have been in the main responsible for its continuation and escalation over the past few years.</P>
    <P>This motion which I now move is in no way contrary to the views I hold on the question of Partition.  The motion, unanimously passed by Dáil <Col N="1523" /> Éireann on the 10th May, 1949, was moved by the then Taoiseach, Mr. John A. Costello, and seconded by the then Leader of the Opposition, Mr. Éamon de Valera.  It is as follows:</P>
    <P>Dáil Éireann,</P>
    <P>Solemnly re-asserting the indefeasible right of the Irish nation to the unity and integrity of the national territory,</P>
    <P>Re-affirming the sovereign right of the people of Ireland to choose its own form of Government and, through its democratic institutions, to decide all questions of national policy, free from outside interference,</P>
    <P>Repudiating the claim of the British Parliament to enact legislation affecting Ireland's territorial integrity in violation of those rights, and</P>
    <P>Pledging the determination of the Irish people to continue the struggle against the unjust and unnatural partition of our country until it is brought to a successful conclusion;</P>
    <P>Places on record its indignant protest against the introduction in the British Parliament of legislation purporting to endorse and continue the existing partition of Ireland, and</P>
    <P>Calls upon the British Government and people to end the present occupation of our six north-eastern counties, and thereby enable the unity of Ireland to be restored and the age-long differences between the two nations brought to an end.</P>
    <P>That is the motion as passed by a unanimous resolution of this Parliament on the 10th May, 1949.  I now wish, in the present circumstances, that it should, appropriately, be reaffirmed. I should add also, of course, that this resolution passed in 1949 was not only passed without dissent but was passed with applause and approval of the various contributions then made, particularly by the proposer of the motion, the then Taoiseach, Mr. Costello. Further, a copy of it was directed to be sent&mdash;and I am quite certain it was sent&mdash;by this Parliament through the Ceann Comhairle's Office to the Governments of all countries in which we had representation and to the <Col N="1524" /> governments of all countries in any part of the world that were regarded as friendly.</P>
    <P>So far as this resolution of 1949 is concerned, it was not only unanimously passed in this House but was circulated, brought to the notice of and put on the record of the vast majority of governments of countries of the world.  I take it that that record in all of these countries&mdash;whether they are now friendly or not is not at issue&mdash;still shows what we as a Parliament had to say unanimously in 1949 in reply to the Ireland Bill, as it was then known, which later became an Act.  We took such exception to that measure that we set down at the earliest opportunity, to the best of our ability and with the greatest emphasis possible, what we felt about such a Bill being enacted by a British Government to continue and copper-fasten Partition which we have never recognised and I sincerely hope never will.</P>
    <P>I want to say at this stage that I deliberately have not arranged for a formal seconder for this motion.  I have decided to leave the seconding of the motion to the individual conscience of each of the other Deputies in this House or to each of the Leaders in the House on behalf of their party or parties.  I want, in fairness, to say this to the Members of the House, at this stage rather than at the conclusion, as I might well have done, lest anybody might feel that had they known they might have done differently to what they may now do.  However, apart from that and apart from the motion, the Taoiseach has put down an amendment to this motion. I feel Deputies should examine it very closely before making up their minds on the motion or on the amendment. First of all, the Taoiseach calls on the Dáil to:</P>
    <P>recognise that the Irish people comprise different elements all of which contribute to Irish life and culture, and each of which has the right to pursue its legitimate aspirations.</P>
    <P>That is a plain statement and nobody would disagree with it.  The question I <Col N="1525" /> really direct to the Taoiseach is: Is it another way of trying to think that the majority of the people of Ireland are not entitled to self-determination and that the minority of partitionists in the north-east corner of Ireland are entitled to opt out of the nation?  That is the question I asked arising from what, to me, is a plain statement of fact but adds nothing to what we already know and cannot, in my estimation, in any way either take from or put to the motion that I am advocating that the Dáil should adopt and pass.</P>
    <P>Going back a little, Mr. Costello, who was Taoiseach in 1949, Deputy Cosgrave's predecessor, had no doubts about this point when he moved the motion to adopt the resolution similar to that which I have before the House at the moment.  He had no doubt at that stage that the people of Ireland were entitled to determination.  He had no doubt that the minority of partitionists in north-east Ireland did not have the right to opt out no more than the majority of any county in the 26 would have the right to opt out at the present time.  In that regard I refer the House to the Official Report of 10th May, 1949, column 794, where the then Taoiseach, Mr. Costello, in the course of his contribution proposing the motion for the adoption of the resolution had this to say:</P>
    <P>The fundamental democratic principle on which all democracy rests is the right of the majority of the people of a State or nation to determine its own destiny.  That is all this country asks for, but the people who give lip service to democratic principles apparently will not put them into practice in the case of Ireland.</P>
    <P>No doubt Mr. Costello, when referring to lip service, was referring to the lip service of the British parliamentarians at that particular time who were foisting on this country through the Ireland Bill&mdash;which later became the Ireland Act&mdash;something which was a contradiction of democracy in action.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach's amendment then goes on to recall&mdash;and I quote:</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1526" />&mdash;recalls the efforts of successive Governments here over the past 25 years to bring about a spirit of harmony, understanding and co-operation between these different elements in the interests of the common welfare.</P>
    <P>Again, a pious platitude which in effect means nothing at all.  I hope I may say this without being regarded as uncharitable.  The various efforts to foster cross-Border co-operation in the past in cases in which they failed, failed because those participating in those efforts ignored the root cause, namely, the British presence in Ireland.  That failure was dramatically shown up in the emergence of the civil rights movement which led to the present situation in the Six Counties.</P>
    <P>Mr. de Valera, in seconding the motion of 1949, which I am now bringing before the House, was in no doubt about how co-operation for the welfare of the two elements should be brought about.  I quote from the Official Report of 10th May, 1949, columns 812 and 813 where Mr. de Valera had this to say:</P>
    <P>I had hoped that there were sufficient fair-minded people in Britain who, when the facts were known to them, would be able to influence their Government to do justice to Ireland.  If this thing is to be ended peacefully it should be ended by British action to start with.  Britain has done this thing and Britain ought to undo it.  They have the power to do it.  If they really want to, they can tell this minority in our country that is not a fifth of the population of this country and not a fiftieth of the population of Britain, &ldquo;We are not going to support you in your claim for privilege.  We are not going to permit this small minority of the two peoples to continue to set the two peoples by the ears and to stir up and continue the old antagonisms between them.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach's amendment finally asks the House to declare&mdash;and I quote&mdash;&ldquo;that the use or advocacy of violence to secure unity is abhorrent to it and affirms that the aspiration <Col N="1527" /> towards a united Ireland can be achieved only by peaceful means with the consent of a majority of the people of Northern Ireland.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Let us look at those words carefully and closely.  I have always held that the use of force was legitimate in the circumstances that a situation developed in the North in which the British Government proved unable or unwilling to halt widespread, armed attacks on isolated and helpless communities. I have always felt that in such circumstances of a civil war situation of which certain Deputies in this House continually warn, we would not only have the right but the duty to intervene.  That apart, I have never, nor has any other commentator suggested, to my knowledge, that unity and lasting peace can be achieved other than by agreement. The Provisional IRA, for instance, have never advocated force as a solution to Partition.  Their acceptance of the Boal plan recently as a basis for discussion gives the lie to such emotive propagandist phrases as &mdash;and I quote&mdash;&ldquo;Trying to bomb one million Protestants into a united Ireland.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Unity by agreement is the only way and every Deputy.  I have no doubt, subscribes to that.  However, before going further I should at this juncture, perhaps, refer to the latest amendment. I do not say that in any way reflecting on the further amendment that was circulated here this evening and which I was sorry I did not have much earlier so that I might have included it more fully in what I was preparing to say to the House, that is the amendment in the name of Deputy Jack Lynch, Leader of the Opposition who proposes, as I understand it, to add to the motion that I have already in my name and on which I am speaking, these words:</P>
    <P>And, further, that Dáil Éireann</P>
    <P>Recognises that the Irish people comprise different elements all of which contribute to Irish life and culture, and each of which has the right to pursue its ligitimate aspirations.</P>
    <P>I can see no great difficulty in bringing <Col N="1528" /> these two points of view together, the view expressed in the Taoiseach's amendment and the beginning of the Opposition amendment.  I have nothing really to say on this because, to all intents and purposes, as I read them, the two are identical.</P>
    <P>Then we come to the second part to be added by way of amendment to my motion:</P>
    <P>Recalls the efforts of successive Governments over the past 25 years to bring about a spirit of harmony, understanding and co-operation between these different elements in the interest of the common welfare,</P>
    <P>My comments have already been made and I do not intend to enlarge on them. The third part of the amendment states:</P>
    <P>Declares that the use or advocacy of violence to secure unity is abhorrent to it,</P>
    <P>This is identical with the amendment already circulated in the name of the Taoiseach.  I have dealt with it and have nothing further to add.  The Opposition amendment continues:</P>
    <P>Re-affirms the inalienable right of the people of Ireland to a united Ireland.</P>
    <P>That is the first section to depart in any way from the Government amendment.  In the short time I have had to look at these amendments I cannot in any way see how this particular part of the Opposition amendment adds, confirms, improves or says anything which was not said better in the original resolution passed in 1949 and which I wish to have reaffirmed at the moment.  Perhaps in the course of discussion we may learn what makes this worthy of being part of the amendment and what part it is proposed it should play when added to what is already better and more fully stated in the original resolution and in my motion which is before the House.  I will quote again from the resolution:</P>
    <P>Dáil Éireann solemnly re-asserting the indefeasible right of the Irish nation to the unity and integrity of the national territory, reaffirming the sovereign right of the people of Ireland to choose its <Col N="1529" /> own form of Government and through its democratic institutions, to decide all questions of national policy, free from outside interference.</P>
    <P>I set these two parts of the resolution against the fourth part of the Opposition amendment.  I cannot see how this adds anything or makes more clear the intention of the original resolution.</P>
    <P>The remainder of the Opposition amendment says</P>
    <P>Re-affirms their aspiration to achieve this by peaceful means&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <P>I take it that &ldquo;this&rdquo; refers to the unity of the country&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <P>and</P>
    <P>Accepts that for practical purposes this involves the agreement of the people of Northern Ireland.</P>
    <P>I will now return to the Taoiseach's amendment.  The Taoiseach, in the last part of his amendment, says:</P>
    <P>affirms that the aspiration towards a united Ireland can be achieved only by peaceful means and with the consent of a majority of the people of Northern Ireland.</P>
    <P>I may see things too clearly as black and white.  While there is some difference in the wording and emphasis on the particular words used, I can see no difference in the ultimate practical outcome or intention of these two tail-ends to the amendments.  I may be enlightened in the course of the debate and I will welcome this enlightenment.</P>
    <P>Unity by agreement is the only way and every Deputy subscribes to this view.  Agreement, however, between men and women will not be possible&mdash;I repeat will not be possible&mdash;until Britain makes clear her intention to withdraw from Ireland. The Taoiseach carefully avoids this basic point when he calls for recognition by this House of the right of the partitionist majority in the Six Counties to decide when they shall, if ever, sit down and talk about unity by agreement with the majority of the people of Ireland.</P>
    <P>Let us examine the rights of the partitionist majority in the Six Counties.  The Government of Ireland Act, 1920, which created <Col N="1530" /> Partition gave them no such right. The British Parliament reserved to itself the right to decide.  The measure which caused the motion of 1949, which I have re-tabled for re-affirmation and which was passed unanimously under the Ireland Act, 1949, changed the position which existed since the 1920 Act because it said that Northern Ireland would remain part of the United Kingdom until such time as a majority of the Northern Parliament decided otherwise.</P>
    <P>Under the Sunningdale Agreement and the terms of the amendments which the Taoiseach and Deputy J. Lynch have tabled, the right to opt out is transferred from the Northern Parliament to the majority of the electors of Northern Ireland.  I ask for enlightenment as to what the difference is if democratic institutions are to be constituted and remain in the Six Counties.  Further, that right of the Government in Northern Ireland is now guaranteed by the British Government in its declarations on the Sunningdale Agreement, paragraph 5.  Now 50 years after the passing of the Act which brought about Partition and all the tragedies which have followed from it, we have the British Government utilising the Sunningdale Conference under paragraph 5 of the Declaration, giving a further unnecessary, gratuitous and, one could say, provocative guarantee to the Government of Northern Ireland to determine when, if ever, they will agree to join with the rest of the country in unity and in peace.</P>
    <P>In my estimation Sunningdale is underwriting the Ireland Act of 1949 which this House unanimously condemned. What has happened in the meantime to justify such a change on our part?  Power sharing, and the proposed Council of Ireland, are the two carrots offered to us.  We are being told that power sharing has brought a transformation in the Six Counties but the question is who is sharing the power?  Sixty per cent of the Protestant population are trenchantly opposed to it as seen from the fact that 60 per cent of the members they elected to the new Assembly oppose it.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1531" /> The election now in progress in the Six Counties will demonstrate just how many of the minority also oppose it.  The opposition to it is mainly, in my estimation, because it is power sharing by a select middle-class sectional grouping selected by the British Government.  This is another attempt by Britain to impose a partitionist settlement which does not have the full support of the people of the Six Counties.  It is, therefore, a new recipe for further violence.  I have already indicated this at the first opportunity available to me, on the Taoiseach's Estimate on the Adjournment.  What I said then is worth looking at now, and it backs up what I am further reemphasising here tonight.  I said then:</P>
    <P>The second Sunningdale carrot we are offered in an attempt to persuade us that things are changed is a so-called Council of Ireland.  Each of the 14 Ministers, seven from the North and seven from the South, will have the power to veto any decision of that Council.  The seven from the North will be chosen by the Executive on which the Unionists have already insisted and got a majority.</P>
    <P>Mr. de Valera in seconding a motion similar to mine in 1949 spelled out all too clearly what such an arrangement really means.  Mr. de Valera said in column 815, Volume 115:</P>
    <P>There can be no solution, however, so long as those who are in a privileged position can say: &ldquo;We will not touch you unless you are prepared to agree with us.&rdquo;  They have only to say &ldquo;No&rdquo;.  Bring them into a conference, it has been suggested &mdash;I have heard it suggested even in this House when I was in charge of External Affairs that the representatives of the Government of Ireland, of the British Government and of the Six Counties should get together and sit down at a table and try to work out a solution.  Surely everybody knows what would be the result of that.  As long as one member of the conference is going to say &ldquo;No, I will not accept that&rdquo;, the result would obviously be that there <Col N="1532" /> could be no agreement, and the end of such a conference would obviously be worse than the beginning.</P>
    <P>That, better than any words of mine, describes the whole tragedy of Sunningdale as a solution.  In putting this motion I have not arranged a formal seconder.  It is for the Deputies, for the parties, and their leaders, to consider this motion and what I regard as the obvious attempt by the Taoiseach, in his amendment, to evade the truth, the real truth, of the present situation.</P>
    <P>Wolfe Tone, who spoke of his aspirations, said:</P>
    <P>To unite the whole people of Ireland and to substitute the common name of Irishmen in place of the denominations of Protestant, Catholic and dissenter&mdash;</P>
    <P>prefaced that statement, and this is not often quoted, by saying:</P>
    <P>by the need, if it were to be achieved, to break the connection with England, the never-failing source of all our political evils.</P>
    <P>Parnell, who spoke of the struggle, said:</P>
    <P>For that which may seem possible for us&mdash;</P>
    <P>warned that:</P>
    <P>&mdash;we must struggle for it with a proud consciousness that we shall not do anything to hinder or prevent better men who may come after us from gaining better things than those for which we now contend.</P>
    <P>Sunningdale, and the terms of the amendment which the Taoiseach has tabled here, do, in my estimation, just that.  Sunningdale, and the attitude of the Taoiseach to it, would tie the hands of those who in the future will face the task of trying to undo once again this second British version of Partition and it is no other.  Mr. de Valera in seconding his motion in 1949 said:</P>
    <P>By this resolution we assert the right of our nation to its unity and independence.  By it we promise that we will do everything we can to maintain that right.</P>
    <P>With these words I commend the motion to Dáil Éireann and I look forward to what may be a most interesting <Col N="1533" /> event, to see who, in fact, wishes to second the motion.  I look forward to hearing what has to be said on both amendments.</P>

    <Speaker pid="LiamCosgrave" hpid="The Taoiseach Liam Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I move the amendment in my name:</P>
      <P>To delete all words after &ldquo;Dáil Éireann&rdquo; where that phrase first occurs, and to insert the following:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;&mdash;recognises that the Irish people comprise different elements all of which contribute to Irish life and culture, and each of which has the right to pursue its legitimate aspirations,</P>
      <P>&mdash;recalls the efforts of successive Governments over the past 25 years to bring about a spirit of harmony, understanding and co-operation between these different elements in the interest of the common welfare,</P>
      <P>&mdash;declares that the use or advocacy of violence to secure unity is abhorrent to it, and</P>
      <P>&mdash;affirms that the aspiration towards a united Ireland can be achieved only by peaceful means and with the consent of a majority of the people of Northern Ireland.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>Three years ago almost to a month I moved, as a private Member, a motion like that now before the House in my name tonight.  That motion expressed our rejection of violence as an instrument to secure unity and welcomed the steps then taken to end discrimination and establish fundamental freedom in Northern Ireland. The motion was passed by this House, without a division.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Tonight, three years later, we see, I hope, the beginning of developments which will, I hope, put an end to violence and the use of violence as a political instrument in our island. The essence of these developments is the involvement in the administration of Government in the North of Ireland <Col N="1534" /> of two sections of the community and the recognition that progress in our island can come only from the process of discussion and agreement. Conviction, not compulsion, must be its instrument.</P>
    <P>I want to ask the House to lend its support to this approach and I hope in the few words I say to explain as clearly as I can the objectives which we seek to achieve, and why I believe we can hope at last to begin to resolve an issue which has previously defeated every generation since we have had the responsibility of dealing with this problem.  In what I say I hope, as far as possible, to keep to facts rather than abstractions. I hope to deal with the realities of the present and not get too diverted into past debates, discussions or the introduction of anything that is past other than in so far as it is relevant to the present.</P>
    <P>For more than half a century now the island of Ireland has been divided; and for a much longer period its population has differed in its loyalties and its political allegiances.  These are facts.</P>
    <P>It is also a fact that the political division of Ireland over 50 years ago did not end conflict.  It simply bottled up the old conflict of loyalties within Northern Ireland.  This conflict has come to a head at the present time; and it has been aggravated and brought to a new and more dangerous level over the past five years by wanton killings and destruction; and by the fears, apprehension and bitterness to which this has given rise.  I hope that nothing that is said in the course of this debate will, in any sense, exacerbate the situation in the North of Ireland.</P>
    <P>The consequences of present dissensions are not confined to Northern Ireland.  Though they press most heavily on the population there, they spill over and affect all of us throughout the island, so that none of us in any part of Ireland&mdash;even if we wanted to&mdash;could regard ourselves as uninvolved.</P>
    <P>The events of recent years, terrible as they are have, however, had at least one salutary effect on all of us. <Col N="1535" /> By showing us clearly the danger underlying present conflicts, they have had a chastening effect throughout the island.  The result, I believe, is that we all now understand much better than before the realities of the situation in which our history places us; and we are correspondingly ready to accept the complexity of that situation without the comforting illusion that there is any easy or simple solution. The Irish people, as it has often been said, comprise many different elements, with many different beliefs and aspirations, held often with a passionate conviction.  These different elements contribute in their own way to Irish life and culture&mdash;and have a right so to contribute, within the law.  Recognition of this diversity of traditions and aspirations is a necessary first step if we are to come to terms with the problems with which history has presented us.</P>
    <P>In the past, each of the major traditions in Ireland saw the issues much more simply.  Each asserted its own loyalties in direct opposition to those of the other, and each claimed the right of a majority as absolute. But one applied this principle to Ireland as a whole, maintaining that the unity of the island was indissoluble; and the other to Northern Ireland maintaining that the division of the island is irrevocable.  Neither of those views was compatible with the other.</P>
    <P>What is new in our day, and what offers us a basis for hope, is that each tradition has begun now for the first time to accept that its own claim is not absolute.  Both within Northern Ireland, and in Ireland as a whole, each community is beginning to see that it cannot either ignore or repress the aims and hopes of the other; or expect them to change or disappear overnight.  Each is coming to understand that it must learn to live with the other and accept that the hopes of the other are legitimate, at least as aspirations.</P>
    <P>Once each tradition begins to do this&mdash;once each accepts the validity of the other and allows some scope to its aspirations without abandoning its <Col N="1536" /> own&mdash;an accommodation which can grow into a settlement becomes possible for the first time because reconciliation between different sections of the community can be given precedence over the fruitless struggle to settle the old conflict definitely either way; and political institutions which encourage people to work together and build on what they have, for the common good of all, can be established.</P>
    <P>It is right, I believe, to recognise that if this approach is to work, it is essential that all concerned commit themselves to the process of establishing trust and understanding.  Once there is this genuine commitment, all concerned can work together in the present without ulterior motives.  The resolution of the issues which may arise in the future can then safely be left to the future, perhaps a very different future, to decide.</P>
    <P>This approach to the deep, and so far intractable, problems of this island is the basis for what happened at Sunningdale last December.  I believe that only this approach is realistic in our present situation and that it is the only approach which can bring genuine peace to Ireland. The agreement there has an immediate relevance to what we are discussing tonight.</P>
    <P>All of us at Sunningdale accepted one fundamental principle: that neither tradition in Ireland can be suppressed or ignored.  It follows that an accommodation between them is the only alternative to continuing conflict.  Each side must take account of the fundamental concerns of the other and both must agree despite their differences to work together to common advantage.  We have, in the past, as a nation, always resisted coercion.  On what precedent in history, or reason, could we now urge a solution for others based on that principle?</P>
    <P>The parties at Sunningdale took as a basis for their discussions the agreement in principle on a power sharing Executive which had already been reached by elected party leaders in Northern Ireland.  They sought to work out political structures which <Col N="1537" /> would build on, and at the same time, support the earlier agreement. Ideally we would have liked if representatives of all the parties elected to the Northern Ireland Assembly could have been present.  But by refusing to accept power-sharing within Northern Ireland, some of those elected had excluded themselves from Sunningdale because they refused to accept the underlying principles on which it was based.</P>
    <P>After four days of detailed discussions and negotiations in which each of us tried honourably to look beyond our immediate interests, we reached an agreement which we believe to be a coherent and balanced response to the overall needs of the present situation in this country.  What we agreed on was a package worked out with great care and attention.  It must be taken as a coherent whole.  No party or interest can select one part of the package and say that it is acceptable but the remainder is not. This, I may say, is a fundamental attribute of what was decided at Sunningdale. What the communiqué describes must be accepted or rejected in its totality.</P>
    <P>The agreement which was reached last December was widely welcomed at the time.  Indeed, I think it is true to say that seldom in my political experience have I received comment as enthusiastic or from so wide a range of interests as I did following the conference.  Young and old alike were caught up by it and saw in it the beginning of a new hope.</P>
    <P>In the time that has elapsed since then, the agreement has been widely commented on, interpreted, and criticised.  I am glad that it has been closely studied; and I welcome the fact that part of it has recently been upheld by the courts.  But there is some danger, too, perhaps, that all this comment and interpretation may upset the basic unity of purpose which was reached at Sunningdale and obscure the terms of the agreement itself.</P>
    <P>The communiqué had three basic elements which were closely interlinked. These elements follow closely the terms of the motion we are now discussing.  Firstly, the communiqué <Col N="1538" /> dealt with the present status of Northern Ireland.</P>
    <P>Secondly, it provided for the setting up of a Council of Ireland as an institution with worthwhile economic objectives and to develop trust and understanding throughout the island; and, thirdly, it addressed itself to the need for action against violence in any part of Ireland and the need to ensure widespread community support throughout the island for such action.</P>
    <P>The Supreme Court have not yet, to my knowledge, handed down their written judgment in the recent action questioning the constitutionality of the parts of the communiqué dealing with the status of Northern Ireland.  Therefore, I cannot go into this question in further detail until I see the court's judgment.</P>
    <P>A second important aspect of the Sunningdale communiqué which has given rise to some controversy is the agreement to establish a Council of Ireland.  In the months since Sunningdale we have engaged in detailed discussions at both ministerial, political and at official level with the Northern Ireland Executive on the precise functions which the Council will carry out.</P>
    <P>The Council of Ireland will be a new body.  So far as I know it has no precise precedent anywhere.  It certainly has no precedent in Ireland. The Council will not be a threat to the interests or the loyalties of the majority in Northern Ireland who now oppose any change in the status of the area.  It is not a way of achieving unity either by stealth or against their wishes.  We see it as a body which will help a large section of the community in the North to identify with the institutions of government and which can achieve the economic advantages spelled out in the Sunningdale communiqué. I refer, in particular, to the passage in paragraph 8 which indicates the objectives to be borne in mind in the studies of the functions to be performed by a Council: (1) to achieve the best utilisation of scarce skills, expertise and resources; (2) to avoid, in the interests of economy and efficiency, unnecessary duplication of effort; and (3) to ensure complementary <Col N="1539" /> rather than competitive effort where this is to the advantage of agriculture, commerce and industry.</P>
    <P>But above all, as well as these objectives, we see the Council as a means of establishing co-operation and trust between both parts of the island and of encouraging them to work together to common benefit, without any sacrifice of principle on any side.</P>
    <P>Part of the amendment in my name, before the House, is a condemnation of the use or advocacy of violence.  In this the amendment reflects the views expressed in the earlier motion moved by me in this House in March, 1971.</P>
    <P>It is indeed a sad and regrettable commentary on our times that such a condemnation is necessary.  Surely by now the effects of violence are clear for all to see.  It hardens divisions.  It entrenches hatreds.  It perpetuates the partition of minds which has kept our people apart.  Its effects will not pass away with the lives of those responsible. For generations, the memory of a son, a father, a brother, a sister, a child or mother killed or maimed in the name of an abstraction will breed its own bitterness and make that abstraction&mdash;whether it is loyalist, nationalist or republican in its purpose &mdash;abhorrent to those who survive.</P>
    <P>The Sunningdale communiqué recognises the need for concerted action to deal with violence in any part of the island, and the parallel and equally pressing need to ensure that measures taken to deal with violence are such that they command the widest possible support throughout the whole community.  I want to make it clear that we do not see action to deal with violence as something which we must do on our part in return for agreement on other issues of more direct concern to us, such as, for example, the Council of Ireland.  It is quite clearly in the interests of all of us to ensure that those who insist on having their way by violence will find no refuge anywhere in this country, north or south.  That must be accepted and asserted to by every Member of this House and by everyone in the community who wants to see peace in Ireland.  There cannot be any escape <Col N="1540" /> from that reality and there cannot be any escape from accepting the consequences that flow from it.</P>
    <P>We have been criticised for the way in which crimes of violence have been dealt with here.  Let me make the position clear.  Over the past 19 months or so, since the Special Criminal Court has been operating, the number of persons convicted of offences involving firearms, explosives <i>et cetera</i> in Border areas was 155.  Of these persons, more than two out of three were from Northern Ireland. In other words, the violence is not of our making: it originates in the North and spills over into our territory. And it is on our forces of Garda and Army that the burden of containing it is thrown.  I do not make this point in any cavilling spirit.  Neither do I want to take issue with those with whom we have a common interest in quelling violence.  All I want to establish is that the Army and Garda forces here are doing a difficult job better than they are often given credit for and, though they may not prevent all violence, they are making a substantial contribution to containing it.</P>
    <P>Precisely because we accept the importance of eradicating violence from our island we went to Sunningdale with specific proposals to deal with the legal problems which would inevitably arise when extradition is sought in one jurisdiction for a politically motivated crime committed in another.  We wanted to ensure that if extradition in such cases gives rise to problems the accused will still be brought to trial in the jurisdiction where he was arrested even though the crime was committed elsewhere. We were ready to begin at once to legislate here for a common court system in Ireland which would have this effect, and we also suggested measures linked with these proposals to guarantee human rights in each jurisdiction which would help to ensure broad community support.</P>
    <P>I am sorry our proposals for a common court system were not immediately accepted at Sunningdale but they have not been shelved.  It was put to us at Sunningdale that they <Col N="1541" /> gave rise to complexities and problems in British law, and because of this we agreed that these proposals, as well as other approaches to the same problem, should be studied by a legal commission established by both Governments. I hope that the commission will soon be able to submit a report on which we can act.  And I would suggest that both Governments ask it to do so&mdash;at least on an interim basis&mdash; before the conference to ratify the Sunningdale Agreement reconvenes&mdash; on condition that this does not mean any postponement of this second stage of the conference.  We are not only willing but anxious to act on these issues&mdash;and we want to see reciprocal action in Northern Ireland.</P>
    <P>The alternative which has received a good deal of publicity offers no way in which understanding and trust between all sections of the community in Northern Ireland can be developed. Instead it would confirm minorities in their old frustrations and confine them to a situation in which there was little hope of real participation in Government.  It would institutionalise the old antipathies and bottle up the old hatreds&mdash;for yet another explosion of violence in the future.</P>
    <P>The great merit of the agreements made at Sunningdale is that they are a genuine attempt by elected representatives who each accepted the valid interests of each of the others, to reach a settlement which would take account of the complex reality of our present situation in Ireland and yet be flexible enough to allow for change according as the situation itself may change with time in the future.  It is a settlement built on present realities which does not attempt to impose a single rigid pattern on the future.</P>
    <P>The fundamental principle which all who met there accepted and which I have tried here again to set out explicitly can be summed up as follows.  So long as each of the main traditions in the island of Ireland maintains its present aspirations and its present loyalties, an accommodation between them is the only alternative to continuing conflict.  We should never overlook that.  An accommodation means a settlement <Col N="1542" /> in which each takes account of the most basic concerns of the other, and both agree, despite their present differences, to work together to common advantage.</P>
    <P>Can those who oppose the accommodation which we reached together at Sunningdale say as much?  Do they accept present realities in Ireland and, if so, how do they believe they can be dealt with?  Do they think we could have reached a wholly different accommodation?  Or do they oppose the very idea of an accommodation between different aspirations, as expressed by different people, merely because they still want to see the issues resolved simplistically in their own favour or because they prefer to see conflict continue and increase so that, on the ruins, they may build an Ireland in accordance with their own personal vision?</P>
    <P>These are questions which critics of Sunningdale must ask themselves&mdash; and answer honestly.  They will not be answered simply by ingenious or imaginative proposals.  The test of any proposal in this country today is not whether it is ingenious or imaginative but whether it takes account of realities including the reality of what people will really accept.  If our problems could be met by ingenious or interesting proposals alone, I venture to say that they would long since have been settled.</P>
    <P>I am even inclined to question whether at this stage any single proposal of what I might call a static character&mdash;however well-intentioned &mdash;could meet the present situation, aggravated as it has been in Northern Ireland by wanton killing and destruction by various groups of extremists. Even if any one such solution within Northern Ireland or on an all-Ireland basis were widely accepted it would still be likely in the present situation to draw such bitter opposition from some sections of the community that it could not easily work.  You cannot build a future on coercion.  Surely our history has taught us that, and that is why we sought and signed the widest possible agreement at Sunningdale.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1543" /> The Sunningdale agreement and the agreement on power-sharing in Northern Ireland which preceded it, and which is so closely linked to it are not static or definitive solutions to our problems; and they do not compete for support on this basis with this or that other &ldquo;solution&rdquo; offered by one group or one individual or another.  Taken together, the Sunningdale proposals and power-sharing provide a framework for trust and future co-operation between people of different views which can accommodate and we believe provide any change which may occur in these views.  This is a framework worked out in patient negotiation by elected representatives from all parts of the country voicing the deepest concerns of those they were elected to represent&mdash;a framework within which the people of all Ireland can begin to work towards a solution without compromise on their basic present aspirations.</P>
    <P>The truth is, I think, that a solution to the kind of problems we face in Ireland will not come as a formula to be discovered at this or that moment.  It will come as the gradual outcome of a process, and it will require time, patience and honesty of purpose by people prepared to commit themselves to that process.</P>
    <P>That is why we cannot say that Sunningdale itself will or will not work.  It is rather a basis on which we can work.  Let me repeat that it is we who have to make Sunningdale work for us.  By &ldquo;we&rdquo; I mean all people of goodwill throughout this island, North and South, all those who have seen enough of killing and destruction and who want to shout &ldquo;stop&rdquo;; all those who believe that it is past time for all of the people of this country, by their own combined efforts to lift the burden of their history from their own shoulders and those of their children.</P>
    <P>What I am saying in all this is that the resolution passed by this House in 1949 was passed in entirely different circumstances.  Even the phraseology of the Ireland Act which was then going through the British House of Commons differs very dramatically from the Act which established the <Col N="1544" /> Assembly in the North of Ireland. The position has changed in the aftermath of that legislation and particularly in the aftermath of Sunningdale. For too long we have been prisoners of our past and tried to build for our children a future we could not know, much less determine.  I said after Sunningdale and I want to repeat it now, that we are dealing with the realities of the present.  We are not dealing with statements, documents, however numbered, in the recent or remote past.  We are not dealing with what those who had to deal with it said or did in the past.  It is as relevant to quote Brian Boru today as it would be anyone else.  We are dealing entirely with the realities of the present.</P>
    <P>The measure of agreement we reached at Sunningdale, the proposals we put before the people, we believe to be the basis by which progress can be made.  I listened carefully to Deputy Blaney's speech.  I did not think there was anything new in it.  He was a member of a Government for many years and as far as I know most of the time if he disagreed with what was being done by his colleagues on co-operation with the North of Ireland he sat and stayed in office, silent most of the time on the North of Ireland.  We are trying now to deal with the realities of the present and I would hope that the seconding of the resolution by the Opposition does not in any way commit the Opposition to the approach which is regarded as not being in the interests of peace in this country as enshrined in some of the suggestions that have been made by the proposer of this motion.  We want to seek peace in this country.  We want to see it based on justice.  We believe that we have made a useful start to that process and we ask for the support not only of this House but of the people in the common interests of all the people of Ireland to make that arrangement work in the interests of the present and the future.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="Mr. J. Lynch Mr. J. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>The amendment standing in my name is as follows:</P>
      <P>To add to the motion the following:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1545" /> And, further, that Dáil Éireann</P>
    <P>Recognises that the Irish people comprise different elements all of which contribute to Irish life and culture, and each of which has the right to pursue its legitimate aspirations,</P>
    <P>Recalls the efforts of successive Governments over the past 25 years to bring about a spirit of harmony, understanding and co-operation between these different elements in the interest of the common welfare,</P>
    <P>Declares that the use or advocacy of violence to secure unity is abhorrent to it,</P>
    <P>Re-affirms the inalienable right of the people of Ireland to a united Ireland,</P>
    <P>Re-affirms their aspiration to achieve this by peaceful means, and</P>
    <P>Accepts that for practical purposes this involves the agreement of the people of Northern Ireland.</P>
    <P>Before I come to the amendment I want to say that we were not aware until Deputy Blaney announced it while he was speaking that he did not have, nor had he sought, a seconder for his motion.  We arranged deliberately to have his motion seconded, for a number of reasons.  I will come to some of the reasons later, but one of the reasons was that, as Deputy O'Kennedy said, in formally seconding the motion, we wanted to hear the Government's views on the motion and on other matters as well, particularly on the Sunningdale agreement and more particularly on paragraph 5 about which some questions have been raised and in respect of which clarification has been sought.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Mr. Molloy Mr. Molloy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>Hear, hear.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="Mr. J. Lynch Mr. J. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>We were informed that because of the action originally in the High Court challenging the constitutionality of that paragraph, and subsequently appealed to the Supreme Court, that it was not possible for any clarification of paragraph <Col N="1546" /> 5 by or on behalf of the Government because it may have been held to be in contempt of court because the matter was then <i>sub judice</i>. I submit that that matter is no longer <i>sub judice</i>.  The decision of the Supreme Court is final and binding as far as that action is concerned. Therefore, we expected to hear more on that paragraph other than the one sentence in the Taoiseach's speech which dismissed it:</P>
      <P>I cannot go into this question in further detail until I see the court's judgment.</P>
      <P>I submit that the content of the court's judgment can make no difference whatever to an agreement reached in Sunningdale and which was incorporated in the Sunningdale communique. The decision has been made, and the reasons for the decision could not in any way affect the Government's knowledge of why paragraph 5 was written into the Sunningdale agreement in the formula in which it was written and what was understood by those who agreed to the writing of paragraph 5 in that form.  We are, therefore, to say the least of it disappointed that we have not received any clarification from the Taoiseach even yet, even after there was no risk of the <i>sub judice</i> rule being invoked against him or any member of the Government.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I want to come to the generality of this motion before I go into any more particulars of this nature.  Deputy Blaney's motion seeks to re-affirm the motion that was passed in this House fewer than 25 years ago.  The Taoiseach in his speech said it was no longer relevant, and by his amendment seeks to delete the terms of Deputy Blaney's motion and, I hope not, derogate from the subject matter of that motion itself. We assert that irrespective of developments, developments that we welcomed, this motion still fundamentally represents the views and aspirations of the Irish people in relation to Partition and that they ought not to be abrogated. I hope to demonstrate that in the little time I have available, and again to ask the Taoiseach why he should seek to delete the terms of this motion, which is not Deputy Blaney's <Col N="1547" /> motion but a motion proposed on the 10th May, 1949, by the then Taoiseach, Deputy John A. Costello, supported by the Leader of the Opposition, Deputy Eamon de Valera, spoken to by way of amendment by only one other Deputy&mdash;an amendment which received no seconder&mdash;and therefore, subject to that reservation, obviously received the full approval of Dáil Éireann as it was comprised at that time.  I should like to repeat the terms of the motion, if the House will bear with me:</P>
    <P>That Dáil Éireann solemnly re-asserting the indefeasible right of the Irish nation to the unity and integrity of the national territory&mdash;</P>
    <P>There is nothing there that we should delete or derogate from in that preamble.</P>
    <P>&mdash;re-affirming the sovereign right of the people of Ireland to choose its own form of Government and, through its democratic institutions, to decide all questions of national policy free from outside interference.</P>
    <P>I ask the Taoiseach is there anything in that preamble that he or any Member of the Government or any member of the party supporting the Government can disagree with?  To me it is basic republican philosophy, and I see nothing in it that we need in any way change at the present time. It goes on:</P>
    <P>Repudiating the claim of the British Parliament to enact legislation affecting Ireland's territorial integrity in violation of these rights...</P>
    <P>It has been fundamental from the start that we do not accept the right of the British Government to legislate for any part of our national territory. That was asserted in the motion already proposed by the former Taoiseach, Mr. John A. Costello, when he said:</P>
    <P>Our essential objection is that part of our country has been taken away from us and is being annexed by this Bill, which purports to annex it permanently even against the wishes of the representatives of Great Britain in the British parliament</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1548" /> There are other quotations which may be more relevant to comments which I shall make later on, if I have time. The recital goes on:</P>
    <P>Pledging the determination of the Irish people to continue the struggle against the unjust and unnatural partition of our country until it is brought to a successful conclusion...</P>
    <P>Again, the word &ldquo;struggle&rdquo; can have no sinister meaning in the context of the times that were in it.  The former Taoiseach moved it and the former Leader of the Opposition, Deputy de Valera, supported it, because the policy was that that struggle for the ending of Partition was to be pursued by peaceful means.  I see nothing whatever offensive in that part of the preamble, which goes on to say:</P>
    <P>Dáil Éireann places on record its indignant protest against the introduction in the British parliament of legislation purporting to endorse and continue the existing Partition of Ireland.</P>
    <P>I have already quoted one sentence from Mr. John A. Costello's speech when he was Taoiseach, in which he expresses, and rightly so, his indignation at this attempt in the 1949 Ireland Act to legislate for, as he regarded it then, the permanency of Partition.  The motion concludes:</P>
    <P>...calls upon the British Government and people to end the present occupation of our six north-eastern counties and thereby enable the unity of Ireland to be restored and the age-long differences between the two nations brought to an end.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach has suggested that this motion is now irrelevant.  I would have preferred if he indicated in what manner and in what instance it was necessary for him to move an amendment deleting what I think are the tenets of the belief of those who want the re-unification of our country, and that achieved by peaceful means.  That does not create any new situation.  It does not, I submit, prejudice the current situation as it has developed in the 25 years since this motion was passed unanimously by Dáil Éireann, passed incidentally by <Col N="1549" /> the first Coalition Government that was set up in this country since the foundation of the State.</P>
    <P>The main purpose of our amendment was to maintain the spirit and purpose of that resolution passed by Dáil Éireann in 1949 and repeated here by Deputy Blaney.  We can endorse, too, the Government's amendment except, of course, that part which seeks to delete the motion passed in 1949.  We were prepared to see substitution of certain words by way of addition to the basic motion, not by way of their deletion and substitution by the words in the Taoiseach's amendment.  We have accepted without any question the first sentence of the Taoiseach's motion: &ldquo;That Dáil Éireann recognises that the Irish people comprise different elements all of which contribute to Irish life and culture, and each of which has a right to pursue its legitimate aspirations.&rdquo;  In one of my earlier speeches when the troubles in the North of Ireland first broke out, I referred to that in a speech I made in Tralee on 20th September, 1969:</P>
    <P>Differences in political outlook or religious belief need not set people apart.  They exist in most countries and are no barrier to effecting a constructive co-operation of the various elements in the community in national development; indeed, diversity of cultural backgrounds can exert a stimulating influence. The real barriers are those created by fear, suspicion, and intolerance.</P>
    <P>In a later speech which I made over Radio Éireann on the eve of 12th July, 1970, I referred to the two main traditions in our country.  I referred, first, to the majority position which was reflected in the minority in the North, and then I spoke of the other great tradition in Ireland, that of the majority in the North.  I said we have had invasions piled upon invasions&mdash; the Danes, the Normans, Scots and English, who followed into Ireland our earlier migration and became part of our soil and the blood and bone of the green fields we cultivated.</P>
    <P>I accept entirely the wording of the first part of the Taoiseach's amendment. <Col N="1550" /> There is nothing we cannot accept in the second paragraph:</P>
    <P>&mdash;recalls the efforts of successive Governments over the past 25 years to bring about a spirit of harmony, understanding and co-operation between these different elements in the interest of the common welfare,</P>
    <P>&mdash;declares that the use or advocacy of violence to secure unity is abhorrent to it, and</P>
    <P>&mdash;affirms that the aspiration towards a united Ireland can be achieved only by peaceful means and with the consent of a majority of the people of Northern Ireland.</P>
    <P>We think the final paragraph can be better expressed by the amendment we propose.</P>
    <P>This is an affirmation which can be interpreted as giving a <i>de jure</i> right to the majority in Northern Ireland to permit, if they so wished, the re-unification of our country.  We have accepted for many years, for practical reasons and for practical purposes, the institutions in the North of Ireland. This was repeated again in some of the Taoiseach's speeches.  We accept in furtherance of our desire for re-unification by peaceful means that peaceful means are to be used in its pursuit and then, practically speaking and for practical purposes, we need the agreement of the people of the North of Ireland.</P>
    <P>I do not accept that proposition if there is any inference or any implication in the form of the Taoiseach's amendment that they are given a <i>de jure</i> right to maintain the Partition of Ireland by opting out at all times of a United Ireland.  The Sunningdale Agreement, as I indicated in my speech at the Fianna Fáil Árd-Fheis, has in paragraph 5 two declarations which are startlingly different.  For the purpose of my speech here tonight, I need only refer to the British Government's declaration which was:</P>
    <P>The British Government solemnly declared that it was and would remain their policy to support the wishes of the majority of the people of Northern Ireland.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1551" /> That was a long way from the second subsection of Section 1 of the Ireland Act of 1949 in which it was declared that</P>
    <P>Northern Ireland remains part of His Majesty's Dominions and of the United Kingdom and it is hereby affirmed that in no event will Northern Ireland or any part thereof cease to be part of His Majesty's Dominions and of the United Kingdom without the consent of the Parliament of Northern Ireland.</P>
    <P>This would appear to be the watering-down of that claim.  I think there was something in the new Constitution Act passed by the British Parliament to that effect as well.  The communique goes on to say that the present status of Northern Ireland is that it is part of the United Kingdom but that in the future if the majority of the people should indicate the wish to become part of the United Ireland the British Government would support that wish. That is quite acceptable and is an advance on the position, but there still remains the fact that the present status of Northern Ireland is that it is part of the United Kingdom.</P>
    <P>If we read in with that the final paragraph of the Taoiseach's amendment, there are grounds for believing that this would cement the continuation of that constitutional position as contained in the British declaration.  It would appear that this Parliament accepted that position.  Therefore, it was for that reason that we put our amendment in its present form.  Instead of deleting the substantive motion we sought to maintain it because we believe it represents the fundamental desires and aims of the Irish people.  Instead of deleting it, we add the paragraphs which I have quoted at length from the Taoiseach's amendment and which, we believe, take account fairly well of the current situation with the exception that in the last paragraph we want to substitute these sentences:</P>
    <P>Re-affirms the inalienable right of the people of Ireland to a united Ireland.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1552" /> That is accepted and unquestionable.</P>
    <P>Also:</P>
    <P>Re-affirms their aspiration to achieve this by peaceful means, and</P>
    <P>That may be repetitive, but I want to make sure that our amendment will be clearly understood.  Finally:</P>
    <P>Accepts that for practical purposes this involves the agreement of the people of Northern Ireland.</P>
    <P>We have to accept this as a situation for the reasons I have already stated. By putting our amendment down in that form&mdash;it was the only form in which we could get an amendment&mdash; we believed that it would be relevant and admissible under the rules of order.  We want to maintain the substance and principle of the original motion passed in 1949 and to maintain the statement of the current situation in paragraphs 1, 2 and 3 of the Taoiseach's motion but to put the position in more realistic and acceptable terms at the present time.</P>
    <P>Time is difficult in a discussion on a motion like this, but I wish to deal with other aspects of the Taoiseach's statements.  I have referred to the short reference he made to his inability to deal with paragraph 5 of the Sunningdale Agreement.  The Taoiseach went on to speak about the Commission to deal with legal matters arising out of Sunningdale because the proposition which the Taoiseach says the Irish Government made at Sunningdale was not acceptable, that is, the establishment of a common court of law.  We, too, support that.  I doubt whether the selection by the Taoiseach of two members of the Supreme Court was wise and proper in this respect.  Ultimately, as we have seen, the Supreme Court has already been summoned to adjudicate on a challenge to part of the Sunningdale communiqué. In time to come we will find that two members of our Supreme Court would be rendered ineffective because of whatever part they would play in promoting legislation to deal with the setting-up of a common court to deal with the prosecution of criminal offences on both sides of the Border.  That was inappropriate, to put it no stronger than that, and certainly it was unwise.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1553" /> The Taoiseach also mentioned that the Sunningdale communiqué must be accepted as a package&mdash;take it or leave it&mdash;and at the same time later on he talked about taking account of other people's point of view.  The Minister for Posts and Telegraphs has said that, too, commending only Deputy Blaney's outright rejection of Sunningdale, but taking no account at all of the fact that there are features in the Sunningdale communiqué that disturb many people in this country and in particular the implications and the possible interpretations of paragraph 5.</P>
    <P>We have not been given any clarification by those present.  The Taoiseach mentioned that it was a great pity that all the elected representatives in Northern Ireland were not present at Sunningdale.  It probably was a pity, but that would still have excluded the elected representatives of the biggest number of people on the island of Ireland, and that is the Fianna Fáil Party.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MylesStaunton" hpid="Mr. Staunton Mr. Staunton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Staunton</NameTxt>
      <P>When I reported progress I was referring to the fact that during the debate on the EEC at the time we joined the European Economic Community there were certain aspects of EEC policy which we pointed to as being of the utmost importance to this country.  I pointed out that at the level of the lowest common denominator we suggested we did not have any choice in regard to the matter in the sense that our markets were in joining the EEC and it seemed there might have been dire consequences for this country if we decided to opt out and stay alone on the fringes of Europe.  We also pointed out, pragmatically, that there were two <Col N="1554" /> other items of major significance which it seemed to us should be of value to our country.  These were the common agricultural policy, which has been implemented and which we have availed of to a very considerable extent in terms of finance during the past 12 months, and the regional policy.</P>
      <P>We must, in general, be reasonably pleased with the situation where agriculture is concerned and especially when we see the extent to which the Exchequer has benefited from a common agricultural policy.  The regional question and the inconclusiveness within the EEC in regard to formulating and finally deciding on regional policy, has led to quite a lot of cynicism in the country.  I believe this will be resolved very shortly and it is probable that the fact that a British general election is taking place at this time is one of the principal reasons why a meeting has not taken place within the past two weeks in an attempt to conclude that particular issue.</P>
      <P>I would like to re-echo to an extent one or two remarks made by Deputy Herbert who spoke just before me.  I read at a distance certain remarks which he made a few months ago in the European Parliament in regard to a regional policy and the reasons why, if Europe had a true regional philosophy, Ireland must benfit from such a policy.  I compliment him for those remarks, although there are other items to which he referred on which I will join issue with him shortly.  I agree with Deputy Herbert to the extent that there is an issue looming, apart altogether from the international question and the national issue of Ireland's benefiting from a regional fund and our argument to Europe that we are one of the lesser developed countries, and as the least developed country within the EEC we would suggest that proportionately we must get a very large slice of that fund, a sentiment which we re-echo completely.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is a problem in so far as regional development is concerned because within the country there are great imbalances of development between <Col N="1555" /> east and west.  I believe it will be necessary when a decision has been reached in Europe about Ireland's position, when we know to an extent the amount of funds we will get in a given year, and when we see the criteria which will be available, to look within this country and to see how we will spend that fund within Ireland. In that context I want to revert briefly to the agricultural picture because there is a major problem in the EEC agricultural policy where the west of Ireland is concerned.  We know that as a nation we have benefited to the tune of £40 million or £50 million.  We know that is a good thing.  At the same time when we see the areas of the country to which the massive injection of funds from Europe has gone we see that to a very great extent the regions which have benefited have been the east, parts of the south and the south-east.  We see a major problem in agricultural policies where the western counties are concerned.  When we look at counties like Mayo we see that the average size of a holding is in the region of 20 acres, a situation which is not very different from that which applies in many parts of Galway, all of Leitrim, Roscommon, Sligo, Donegal and other western counties.</P>
    <P>In these areas they are finding that there will be area of EEC support policy in the form of grants for agricultural production and for farmers who will come under the umbrella of the development schemes in agriculture but they are finding also that due to the farm structure in the west and the small size of the farms compared with any national statistic within this country, or international comparison within the EEC, many of these farmers on these very small holdings will not be in a position to get State aid to support their development.</P>
    <P>We should try to see if something can be done about this matter.  It pertains to the regional fund directly in the sense that Europe takes cognisance of this fact and the lesser level of development in certain areas by arranging special policies of aid for the areas they believe to be the most depressed <Col N="1556" /> and the most underdeveloped in the community.  It is in this context that the west would hope to gain from the regional policy and from spending the regional fund within the country.  In the referendum this was one of the major selling points in that part of the country just as, internationally, we have argued that if there is an undue dilution of the regional fund through areas we would not call depressed by a European definition in comparison with certain regions of Germany, France, Belgium and Holland, and where we argue that that is not a true regional philosophy, it would seem that we should apply this same yardstick when we seek to spend the fund in this country.  There will never be any redress of the boundaries within this country or of the levels of development between east and west if that fund is to be diluted through the Twenty-six Counties.  No attempt can be made to redress that imbalance unless in the expenditure of the regional EEC fund very special consideration is given to western priorities.</P>
    <P>I hope in this regard that we will have the sympathy of legislators from other parts of the country because of the very severe problems we have in the western regions.  The criteria which were mentioned a few months ago in regard to the regional policy are not altogether satisfactory.  I am not certain of the present state of that particular ball game because it seems to have been going back and forth for months.  Certainly a situation where a member state was limited to using a maximum of 50 per cent of the total investment of the project from the regional source for industry would not be satisfactory in a country as little developed as we are.  Sometimes we do not have the resources to the extent we would require them within the State to fund the type of operations that are necessary.  Traditionally, in the infrastructural area a limiting of a member state to 30 per cent of the regional fund relative to the national input would not, in my view, be satisfactory.  I believe that so far as our country is concerned there should be a fairly unlimited opportunity <Col N="1557" /> to use that fund proportionate to the extent that we believe it to be necessary.</P>
    <P>I want to take Deputy Herbert to task on one or two remarks of his.  He spoke of the present Government's position and tended to criticise them for what he believed was not satisfactory regional policy and for dilatoriness, if you like, in suggesting to Europe the areas in which we want to see developments.  I think I am quoting him when I say that he said that the Fianna Fáil policy was well balanced for the past 16 years and had been meeting with great success between the east coast and the rest of the country.  He spoke about Fianna Fáil's pursuit of a regional policy for the past 16 years to correct the imbalance. I am not attempting to speak in a contentious way but, obviously, if I follow somebody who has spoken in this vein and if I disagree with his sentiments, I may be forgiven if I take him to task in that area.</P>
    <P>It is possible that, living in the Limerick region, when he looks at the level of development that has taken place in the greater Limerick-Shannon region one could suggest that there has been striking success in redressing the development between east and west.  That, in fairness would be true if the discussion related to the mid-west region but one of the big mistakes of the previous Government was that while they developed a successful venture in the mid-west region in the SFADCO organisation which was an autonomous company with decision-making within the region, liberally financed from the Exchequer in a region where the grant per head of the population in terms of IDA statistics was many times greater than the rest of the entire western seaboard from north Clare to Donegal, this posed certain questions for regional development in the rest of the country and it was sad that the lesson was not learned and that, to an extent, similar models were not developed in western areas.  Instead, we saw a proliferation of regional branch offices of national organisations but no regional policy, no decentralisation and no effective <Col N="1558" /> decision making in any region other than the Shannon region.</P>
    <P>If I talk of the past 15 years in relation to Mayo it is a county that lost about 15,000 people in that time.  You can, in relative terms, say the same about the population of Leitrim, Roscommon, parts of Sligo and Donegal and other midland counties.  To talk of meeting this problem as between east and west is nonsense if we refer to the past 15 years: it is valid if it refers to the mid-west region.  I do not have to cite any biased statistics to prove this.  The statistics are available in our population figures and if anybody wants to read last year's OECD report on Ireland he would find that despite what we tend to learn from the media of our own country, about developments in western areas, the OECD report stated that in its opinion, rather than getting closer together in levels of development, the gap at this time is widening between east and west and that the massive development in Dublin city is simply walking away from the rest of the country.  There is an objective, responsible, international organisation discussing this particular problem and in context it tends to make Deputy Herbert's remarks untenable.</P>
    <P>Deputy Herbert also spoke of the regional development organisations and their plans and asked if they had been consulted and if there was coordination. I am aware that the RDO in my region, Mayo-Galway, has prepared plans or is in the course of doing so.  I also know that many local authorities and national bodies have prepared plans seeking funds from the regional fund and that at present these plans are being examined within the Department of Finance.  So far as Government policy is concerned in regard to this fundamental issue of regional development I should like to point out that Deputy Ryan, speaking as Minister for the Public Service in Cork about two weeks ago stated that one of the principal aims being pursued vigorously at this time by the Department of the Public Service is this question of regional development and the anomaly of this multiplicity of extensions of central organisations <Col N="1559" /> throughout the country.  He said that the Department were seeking ways to reduce this type of thing so as to evolve structures within regions which were satisfactory for the regions' development. In addition.  I know that priority is being given to a study of the western position at this time when we speak of regional development.</P>
    <P>It would be my hope that if the structure, as a result of these studies, was to develop in western areas it would take the form of some type of development board and that the development of such a structure would point within Europe to the particular area within Europe which has the greatest need of development.  I would hope development of such a structure would act as a sort of catalyst in Europe to make people within the EEC aware of the fact that within our country there is this part of the country which requires very special aid.  Statistics were produced some time ago of what were termed the peripheral regions of the EEC which tended to compare by various denominators the situation that exists in the Mezzogiorno, with the west of Ireland, with Schleswig-Holstein in Germany, with parts of Brittany and France and with Jutland, off Denmark, and such regions.  One frightening result of this at a conference at which all of these so called peripheral regions were lobbying for support and for special EEC considerations was that of all the regions which took part in that conference, even including the Mezzogiorno in Southern Italy&mdash;about the poverty of which we read so much&mdash; the statistics of the west of Ireland were the worst and most depressing. There was a situation in which people from Schleswig-Holstein were complaining that their major problem was that they had too many people still working on the land.  The percentage of people living on the land there is about 11 or 12 and when we equated this with the west of Ireland situation where our statistics show today that we still have between 40 per cent or 50 per cent of our people engaged in this primary employment on these small farms, we can begin to see the extent of that problem.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1560" /> In that context we would like to see a strong regional fund developing from Europe and consideration being given within this country to ensuring that the fund is proportionately spent where the need is greatest in this country just as we would say within Europe where it should largely be spent.</P>
    <P>We have certain problems regarding involvement in the EEC.  Intense interest was taken in the debate here before our entry.  At that time we were all stimulated by what we believed would be the fruits of entry. There was debate in which the leading figures in the country took part and many people throughout the country knew a great deal about the European situation.  I do not know that the position is as happy in that sense today.  It seems there is a great deal of ignorance in the country as to what Europe is about and what its institutions are about.  The attitude of some people seems to be that they stopped at that time; we joined the EEC and Europe will sort out the problems from here on.  In my view which must be the view of all Deputies it is an ongoing business and as such while the Dáil and the Legislature are important within the country, equally if we are to be involved in Europe the European Parliament and the institutions in Brussels and Strasbourg are possibly not equally important but are nearly equally important to us.  It is all the more serious today when so much of our sources of finance are in Europe and so many of the regulations, down to the most mundane nuts and bolts activity within the country, is decided in Brussels.</P>
    <P>It is very important that the people throughout the country are <i>au fait</i> with what is happening.  In that regard I would welcome much more direct contact from the provinces with Europe.  It is necessary that our senior civil servants, Government Ministers should go to Brussels and the members of the European Parliament should attend its meetings.  These should be backed up with fairly frequent visits from community leaders, members of local authorities from the provinces as well as people from <Col N="1561" /> Dublin, so that there will not be a slanted debate in which the &ldquo;elitist&rdquo; people&mdash;for want of a better word&mdash; have all the information available.</P>
    <P>I would welcome also the funding of modest trips for the right type of people from different parts of the country so that they, too, begin to live in the European context.  My first visit to Brussels was an experience in that it seemed to be an entirely different institution to that which I had been reading about.  To visit these places is enlightening, stimulating and, I think, necessary.  I do not seek to be contentious but I would hope that reason would prevail so far as pairing arrangements are concerned.  Individual Deputies should have the opportunity to go to Europe as frequently as they think necessary for their own enlightenment, for the benefit of their constituencies or for what they think their contribution might be in the area of national policy.</P>
    <P>The European Report is a biweekly journal.  It gives an excellent synopsis of the activities within the EEC.  It is taken by many Departments of State.  Yet we find it is not in the Oireachtas Library, probably due to the constraints of funds.  If we are to have the primacy of politics here, if our legislators are to be concerned with the running of the country and if their opinions are to be weighed and valued, support, back-up services and knowledge are available.</P>
    <P>I was very glad to see that the European Investment Bank has lent a considerable sum of money to the Department of Posts and Telegraphs for telecommunications development. This is a top priority matter.  One of the things which has stunned me since I became a Deputy is this.  I thought that the telephone problem in Mayo was serious.  It has been a revelation to realise that it is even worse in Dublin city.  Obviously this money is extremely necessary.</P>
    <P>Deputy Herbert took the Minister for Foreign Affairs to task.  He claimed that the IDA should be advertising the fact that 50 per cent grants are available in the industrial arena from the Regional Fund.  He <Col N="1562" /> suggested that the Minister was concealing this information.  I respectfully submit that this is totally unacceptable. The Regional Fund has not yet been set up.  When it is, the message with regard to the availability of funds will be loud and clear. Before there is a decision in Europe as to whether there will be a fund, apart from the extent to which we will benefit from it, it would seem to me to be foolhardy in the extreme to advertise anything specific in relation to that fund.</P>
    <P>The recent energy crisis has rent the Community.  Mr. Simonet, Vice-President of the Energy Commission, made a speech to the European Parliament on the energy crisis.  He said:</P>
    <P>Action must be taken to ensure the full development of any energy source, which in economically and socially acceptable conditions could replace the utilisation of petroleum.</P>
    <P>We should give some consideration to the development of the turf industry. Machinery has developed to a greater extent that previously.  Technology is better than it has been.  Machines are available which can be used to develop bogs which would previously have been very difficult to develop.  Some time ago the priorities were to develop certain bogs because of their ease of access and flat land.  There are many other marginal areas which could be developed at minimal cost to the nation at the present time.  In these areas machines are not very expensive.  Turf is a native resource. Its use will be of direct benefit to the country in that it will mean a lesser usage of petroleum products.</P>
    <P>If horticulture is to develop, it will be necessary to skim the top off these bogs.  Within the European context this is a matter which should be considered with particular urgency.  I am not certain if EEC grants are available for such work.  Simple as this product is, it is worth pursuing in the national interest.</P>
    <P>I want to compliment the Minister on the work he has done in his Department, particularly in relation to the EEC.  My view, and the view <Col N="1563" /> of a great many unprejudiced people in the country, is that he is doing a very good job.  It has been suggested from political sources that he has been less than diligent in the area of the regional policy.  The record shows that he has been very interested in getting for this country the highest possible level of support from the EEC and he has stressed at all times the falseness in some of the arguments which were propounded.  I hope he continues to do this until the fund emerges.  I wish him success.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasNolan" hpid="Mr. Nolan Mr. Nolan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Nolan</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Thornley spoke earlier this evening.  I always admired him as a good orator, either in this Parliament or in the European Parliament. As usual he criticised Fianna Fáil and the decisions of the Irish people to join the European Economic Community.  He said that he, Deputy Kavanagh and Deputy Keating campaigned against our entry into Europe. In my view when Deputy Keating was in Telefís Éireann no man put a better case across than he as to why we should enter Europe.  Subsequently, when he joined the Labour Party&mdash;at this stage he may have been under the Whip&mdash;he encouraged people to vote &ldquo;No&rdquo; but he did not have the same sincerity he had when he was in the television service.  I presume that if the truth was known, or if we could see his vote, he voted &ldquo;Yes&rdquo; to go into Europe.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When Deputy Thornley mentioned this he seemed to imply that if the same situation arose again and we had another referendum he would ask the Irish people not to vote to go into Europe.  However, he did not qualify it by stating what would happen if we pulled out of Europe.  The first problem we would have to face in that event would be a financial one.  The net gain to the Exchequer as a result of our joining the EEC last year was £36 million.  What would the Minister for Finance do if we had to find an extra £36 million for agricultural subsidies in the next budget? The Minister for Finance has enough problems preparing the next <Col N="1564" /> budget without having to face that one.</P>
    <P>I should now like to refer to certain experiences I have had as a Member of the European Parliament.  I was glad to see the interest the Confederation of Irish Industries had following our entry into Europe.  This group, in combination with the trade union movement, has done great work to increase our exports to the European Market.  The Minister for Foreign Affairs, Dr. FitzGerald, on a television programme, stated that our exports to Europe increased 100 per cent in our first year of membership. That is a great tribute to those involved in that drive.</P>
    <P>I met the representative in Europe of the confederation, Mr. Patrick Jordan, with the other members of the European Parliament and we had a discussion.  We were all impressed by his interest in Europe, the hard work he is doing there and the information he gave to us when requested.  Every Member of this House receives the newsletter which is published by the Confederation periodically.  In my view that document gives a concise and simple synopsis of activities in Europe.  When people come to me seeking information I refer them to it. That document clearly points out what the regional policy is all about and how it affects us.</P>
    <P>Deputy Thornley, in an amusing way, referred to what he described as the &ldquo;marriage&rdquo; we have with the French Gaullists.  As the House is aware, there are 11 members of the Gaullist Party and five members of the Fianna Fáil Party.  These members within the groupings of the European Parliament, form the European Progressive Democrats.  Deputy Thornley feels we have not the same strength as he and his colleague, Deputy Kavanagh, have in the Socialists group.  They are two out of 51 and in that 51 there are Socialists from Italy, Germany and France.  They have many different languages to contend with as well as different views.  In our group we have only two languages to contend with as against the six the Socialists must deal with.</P>
    <P>It should also be considered that <Col N="1565" /> France, an agricultural country, has far more in common with Ireland than any other country in the Community. France played a big part in the formation of the Common Agricultural Policy.  Deputy Herbert referred to a mistake in the Seanad Report on Development in the European Communities: when he said the Irish Delegation to the Parliament proposed an amendment.  Deputy Herbert did not say that and for that reason it is no harm for me to explain the position again.</P>
    <P>This was a decision moved by the five Irish members at a meeting of the European Progressive Democrats. That amendment was unanimously accepted by the European Progressive Democrats.  For the record it read:</P>
    <P>In the allocation of regional aid account must be taken of the unique character of the regional problem in countries which have no developed region within their borders on which they draw internally for a transfer of resources.</P>
    <P>In Germany, which has big industrial areas, if they wish to give aid to places like Bavaria they can draw from their own internal resources.  However, because Ireland has no large industrial area on which to draw resources for the development of the west or other areas, we will be designated&mdash;the whole of the country including Dublin &mdash;an area to qualify for regional aid.</P>
    <P>The amount of capital we would require for the proper development of this nation and the use of all of its resources could not be obtained from Dublin or anywhere else or from agriculture. Therefore we have to depend on the regional fund and that is one of the reasons apart from agriculture and other matters why we went into Europe.</P>
    <P>There is some pessimism being expressed at present but, as a member of the European Parliament, I am not pessimistic.  I am as sure as I am standing here that the regional fund will be adopted.  There are problems in getting the fund off the ground. Originally the regional fund was mentioned as 500 million units of account, which represents about <Col N="1566" /> £250,000, and was to include parts of all the nine member countries.  This problem came up in Parliament because we pointed out that there was no reason why some of the richer areas of Europe should get money from what was considered, in the context of Europe, a small fund.  We pointed out that the areas most in need of assistance should be picked out and that the Community should do away with the imbalance that existed in the Community.</P>
    <P>We were happy that the Commission, and the Council of Ministers, agreed that the fund should apply only to Southern Italy, the whole of Ireland, Great Britain and Greenland. If we can get the fund off the ground it will benefit this country.  When a new policy has to be got off the ground it is very difficult for parliamentarians to sell it to their constituents. We all remember the position that arose in regard to turnover tax and VAT.</P>
    <P>We should bear in mind the position of Germany in this regard.  That country will have to pay most of that fund but will get nothing from it.  The German parliamentarians will have difficulty in explaining to their constituents why such an amount of money is being taken out of their pockets and used to develop areas like Ireland. These are the realities of the situation.</P>
    <P>Irrespective of all the pessimism I am satisfied that the European Community will survive and that the Regional Fund will become a reality in the not too distant future and that we will get our share of it.</P>
    <P>One of the major reasons why 83 per cent of the people of this country voted to go into Europe was because we are basically an agricultural country.  It can be said that half of the population of the city of Dublin come from a rural community.  They are sons and daughters of agricultural labourers, or road workers, or farmers, or small business people.  I am not saying that half of them got a one-way ticket from Cork, but they have an agricultural background.</P>
    <P>We were getting to the stage where <Col N="1567" /> we were not able to pay the agricultural subsidies and £36 million pounds was a lot of money to have to pay out in a year.  It was a growing sum.  This is one of the reasons why the Irish people voted to go into Europe where farmers would get better prices, where we would have a market of 150 million people instead of a market of 50 million people in Britain.  As far as I know, and as far as my constituents tell me, all Britain ever wanted from this country was cheap food and cheap labour.  That is why I was so enthusiastic in my efforts to influence people to vote &ldquo;Yes&rdquo; to go into Europe.</P>
    <P>Reference was made here today to the problem of workers, the problem of industry and the problem of languages.  Deputy Thornley said that the Minister for Education should have a look at the curriculum in our primary schools with a view to having one continental language taught. This is most important.  When our people emigrated they went to America or Britain because of the common language.  People from southern Italy emigrated to the big industrial areas in Germany.  They did not intermingle with the people as the Irish did in America and Britain. They went into colonies because of the language difficulty.  Like nomads or gypsies they remained there for a while, went back home in the winter and returned again the following summer.  One of the reasons why Irish industry did not break into the European market prior to our entry into the EEC was the language problem.  Men and women set up small industries in the backyard, perhaps, and expanded and got to the stage where they could export.  They and their salesmen had this language difficulty and they concentrated on areas with a common language such as Britain, America or Canada.</P>
    <P>I am very disappointed at the lack of a common agricultural policy on sheep.  There are many farmers in Wicklow, on the borders of Carlow-Wexford and in the mountainous areas in the west who have problems because <Col N="1568" /> there is no common agricultural policy on sheep.  The European market opens and closes and this is one of the problems.  In January or February of last year I asked Mr. Lardinois when he expected a proposal on this problem. He promised he would have a proposal about it in November or December. To date I have not seen it.  We must have it if our sheep industry is to survive.  I hope the Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries will pursue this matter.</P>
    <P>We know that at present there is chaos in the livestock industry and people say some of it can be blamed on the EEC.  There is a lack of information from the Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries and his Department explaining clearly what the position is as regards beef prices.  When there was a world beef shortage last year&mdash;and even before we went into Europe&mdash;beef prices went far above the intervention price in Europe.  When world prices of beef started to drop, farmers started to retain their cattle because they thought the price would rise again, but in Europe the intervention price is a fixed price.</P>
    <P>Once the beef cattle are not being sold the store cattle cannot be sold because the man of the beef cattle has not cleared them, and if the man with the store cattle has not sold them, the man with the calves cannot sell them. The sooner the beef cattle are sold off to make way for the stores and then for the calves, the sooner the cattle trade will come right again.  The Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries, not the Minister for Foreign Affairs, should clarify this position in a public statement because the farmers I talk to do not know whether they should switch back to tillage or continue in grass.  There is no doubt that there is a problem and I am not saying that to make a political point.</P>
    <P>VAT has not been mentioned in this debate.  In the recent Prices Commission document it is stated that the removal of VAT from food did not in any way affect the price of food.  At that time costs were going up so much that if you took off VAT you would have to add it on to other costs.  In the document 360/73, dated 14th February, <Col N="1569" /> 1974, which is a report drawn up on behalf of the Committee on Budgets by Mr. Notenboom it is stated at page 41 under the heading Abolition of Zero-Rating:</P>
    <P>The transitional provisions (Article 28 of the proposed directive) provide that zero-rates may be maintained temporarily if they do not conflict with the commitments of the own resources system.  They must, however, be abolished at the latest by the date on which the charging of tax on imports and the remitting of tax on exports in trade between the Member States is abolished.</P>
    <P>They seem to forget that we have no tax on food because they go on to mention the United Kingdom only. Whether we like it or not this Government will now have to turn turtle in a year or two&mdash;or maybe we will be in Government and they can blame it on us&mdash;and bring back VAT on food. The document I referred to is from the Commission of the European Communities to the Council, Document 144/73.</P>

      <P>Deputy Thornley referred at length to the dual mandate of the Parliamentarians of Europe.  Deputy McDonald, Senator Yeats and I are the three senior Members of the European Parliament. There were seven casualties, or changes, since we went out there. Deputy Thornley said that when we went out there we had no back-up service. I agree that we had not.  I am sure that Deputy McDonald found too in discussions with parliamentarians from other countries that they were rather amazed at the knowledge we had of the institutions of the Community, of how the Regional Fund, the Social Fund and the CAP work. The reason was a simple one which we subsequently discovered, namely, we had a referendum and we were involved. As a result of having a referendum we had to do our homework and, in fact, we were in Brussels long before it was held.  It surprised European parliamentarians that we had such a knowledge of the institutions. When Mr. Bourges, President of the European Progressive Democrats, referred to Irish parliamentarians in general he said words to the effect that we were a charming lot, that we talked a lot to other parliamentarians at committee meetings and so on but that before they were aware of it we had our hands in their pockets.</P>
      <P>The matter of education is one that the Minister should take up with the Minister for Education.  It is important that children in primary schools are taught an extra language so that, in addition to English and Irish, they might have French or German.  It is important for the future of our children now that we have such contacts with Europe&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>This nation did not go cap in hand to Europe, as some people seem to think.  For centuries Irish men and women and Irish soldiers have gone to Europe and America to play their part in building those nations.  In Paris there are many famous streets called after Irishmen, while in Brussels and elsewhere throughout the Continent there are many monuments to Irish people.  We are a small nation but these people played their part in Europe; Ireland is doing that today and will continue on that course.</P>

      <P>I should like to compliment the Department of Foreign Affairs on the way they have tackled the task of informing the Oireachtas and the people regarding the implications of membership of the Community.  The information before the House is extensive and the Department have imparted the data in a remarkable way.  It is invaluable to the Members to be able to follow the rapid changes that are taking place, to see the progress made and to know how we are faring in the new environment of Europe.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In our first year in the Community we have done extremely well.  Figures have been quoted stating we benefited to the extent of £54 million.  From my examination I think we benefited to the tune of £76 million and some two or three weeks ago the <i>Economist</i> quoted a figure in this region.  While that may seem a sizeable amount Denmark, one of the new entrants, did even better.  Nevertheless, our first year has been successful and our economy has come out of the general world depression exceptionally well. Even though we are only approximately one-fifth through the transitional period we were lucky to have <Col N="1572" /> taken the decision to enter the Community.</P>
    <P>In retrospect most people will agree it was a pity we did not go it alone in 1963.  At that time membership of the EEC was very much in the minds of the people and had we entered we would be a much wealthier nation now.</P>

I think I can speak for my nine colleagues in the European Parliament when I state we were glad to note the cordial and warm reception that Parliament gave him last November when he represented the President of the Council of Ministers at the plenary session of the European Parliament.  All of us were very impressed by his work and we look forward to his coming back there again.  Obviously his fame in Europe had preceded him and most of our European colleagues were waiting for him.</P>
      <P>Only a united Europe can fight inflation, rising prices, unemployment and the oil crisis.  The population must understand the situation, nationally and on the European and world plane. No country is capable of tackling these problems alone in the new environment of increased prices for raw materials from Third Counties. Some Governments have been losing credibility on many of these issues and they must correct this.</P>
      <P>I should like to call on the Council of Ministers to respect decisions taken by the heads of state or Government at the various summit meetings, especially the October summit meeting at Paris and the meeting last year at The Hague.  Until these decisions are implemented and pending European union from the economic, political and monetary point of view there should be respect for the Treaty of Rome.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Every effort must be made to revert to decisions at the Council of Ministers level by majority effort as enshrined in the Treaty of Rome.  If we could revert to that, there is a strong lobby <Col N="1573" /> which says that small countries such as ours should have this veto.  I put it to the House, however, that we are too weak in all respects to be able to wield that kind of power and that our best hope lies in having the strongest possible team at all levels in Europe to argue our case and to ensure that our country will get, through coherent argument, the best possible deal our negotiators can achieve.</P>
    <P>Especially now during this difficult period I submit there must be stringent respect for the Treaty of Rome on the part of all Governments.  European identity will be found only on the unshakeable solidarity of member states. I therefore appeal to all political forces, to all Governments and peoples of Europe to assist with the speedy democratisation of the European institutions. This is important because the European Government needs to take on a personality which will make itself manifest to all the peoples in Europe.  The great difficulty which was shown up during the oil crisis was that we did not have this unity of purpose, especially at ministerial level.</P>
    <P>I compliment the Minister for the efforts he has consistently made to reach consensus with his colleagues in the Council of Ministers.  We must press for some form of direct elections to the European Parliament.  The new mandate will be a problem.  Everybody elected to Dáil Éireann is anxious to represent the people who returned them here to the best possible advantage. The work that the Irish members of the European Parliament are doing is not readily appreciated here.  During the winter months we have to endure the disadvantage of the European new time.  The Europeans start rather earlier than us and we find ourselves beginning at 7.45 a.m. and, seeing that we are there only a few days each week, we are in a constant state of flux to readjust ourselves between our time and theirs.  We start very early in the morning, we must have working lunches which are not ideal for the digestion, and the Parliament endeavours to fit in as much work as possible into the week&mdash;they want to do a month's parliamentary work in a week and in a parliamentary week we can expect to work all night.  During <Col N="1574" /> the last year, on one occasion we did not conclude until 7 a.m. and we began again at 10 a.m.</P>
    <P>It is all very well to say that a person need not go there but there is no excuse for a member if he is not present when some item is debated which may be of interest to our country as a whole.  In other words, membership of the European Parliament has not been the holiday some people thought it might be.  I can speak for all my colleagues in Europe when I say we have done our best to represent the interests of our people. The fact that we are members of three different European groupings has been of tremendous benefit in getting the Irish viewpoint across.</P>
    <P>My Fine Gael colleagues and I joined the European Christian Democrat group, mainly because since the late 1940s when our people first went to the Council of Europe they have consistently sat with that group.  That group were the founding fathers of the European Community and at present they are the strongest group numerically.  We have colleagues in seven of the nine member countries and that gives the three Fine Gael members an opportunity of expressing a definite viewpoint on every item on the agenda.  There are many things such as wine, olives and citrus in which we may not have any great interest but we have to operate a system of <i>quid pro quo.</i></P>
    <P>It has taken me eleven months to get to grips with the new environment in which we find ourselves working.  Indeed, we seem to be head bottlewashers because although our Departments have done their best to brief us on many things, it is very difficult to find time to attend at the Departments for such briefings.  It takes me one and a half hours to come up from my home and the same time to return.  Therefore, if a briefing is for one hour it takes me four hours to do it.  When one spends from two to five days on the Continent it does not leave much time to attend to constituency chores, quite apart from giving some time to one's family and to one's profession.</P>
    <P>What many people fail to realise is <Col N="1575" /> that at every parliamentary committee meeting in Brussels the appropriate Commissioner is in attendance and this gives us an opportunity to express the Irish view.  The more often these Commissioners hear the way the various documents affect the Irish way of life the better.  It is very important we should be there at all times to do this.  On a couple of occasions during the year there may have been differences in voting as between our three groups but they were on technicalities and not on items affecting our policy.  I hope we will be able to continue in this spirit of co-operation because it is only in that way we can be of assistance to the team of Ministers whose job it is to serve on the Council of Ministers.</P>
    <P>As I have said, I suggest there must be direct election to the European Parliament because a community such as that cannot stagnate.  It cannot sit there&mdash;it must progress.  Most of us would hope to see that Parliament progress into a more democratic institution. This is very important because I think the EEC must be the most unpopular community in the world.  The Americans want to wreck it and the Russians on the other side stop just short of force to wreck it.</P>
    <P>It is surprising the number of people in all the countries within the Community who are against it themselves. I think the main reason for that is that there is not sufficient information flowing within the Community itself on the work and on the progress of the United Europe.  Even though we are there for a year, the Community itself is so vast&mdash;in the Parliament alone there are somewhere around 1,500 of staff to serve 208 Members&mdash;that it is very hard to find out what goes on everywhere in the short space of time.</P>
    <P>Recently, however, I came across a scheme whereby the parliamentary information section are only too happy to grant-aid groups of people, especially students, politicians, and councillors, who would like to see the Parliament in session and to learn more about the democratic process <Col N="1576" /> of Europe.  I have arranged to bring the first group of Irish citizens, the French classes of the Portlaoise Vocational School to the April session of the European Parliament.  I am also hoping they will be able to see the institutions in Brussels, and they will have a couple of days rest in Paris. The Parliament is prepared to pay £35 per head towards the cost of the trip, which is more than 50 per cent of the cost of the fares.  This is a rather generous contribution.  We would hope to see Irish groups at every single meeting of the European Parliament.  Aer Lingus, who are always looking for new business, should have seen this clause before.  If there was a charter run direct to Strasbourg or Luxembourg, it would be possible to fly a school out and back in one day, and the Parliament would probably pay the entire fare.  This is something that should be advertised. I would hope that teachers and others in charge of younger people, perhaps youth leaders, would investigate the possibility of availing of these facilities.</P>
    <P>Coming back to direct elections, I would ask the Minister to press the Council of Ministers for some system of direct election.  I have been looking at this problem for the past few weeks.  There are a number of reports coming before the European Parliament. There are the Schuljt Report, the Berthrand Report and the Petijn Report, all dealing with the development of the European structures, the Petijn Report dealing with direct elections.</P>
    <P>The Dutch system might be the most appropriate for us here in Ireland. It should be possible, without very much difficulty, to have the maximum number of members elected directly to the European Parliament on the same day as a general election. Unless we do that, it is going to be very difficult to have the country represented to the fullest advantage in Europe.  It is not fair to expect Members of this House to go indefinitely on a sort of suicide mission.  It is not possible to serve two masters.  The work in Europe is escalating so much and it is so important to the wellbeing <Col N="1577" /> of our country, that we just cannot afford to do a half-job.  The House here is being unfair to the members of the European Parliament, first, in not providing them with an adequate back-up service and secondly, in not looking after their interests.  Our German colleagues, for example, have the benefit of a political assistant, whose qualification has to be a doctorate in either law or economics, plus two private secretaries, one at home and one at the Parliament.</P>
    <P>It is very hard for Fianna Fáil, Labour and Fine Gael Deputies to compete with people like that without the same kind of back-up service. However, I must confess that at the many Commission meetings I have attended with our colleagues, they have always held their own with all these Europeans, and I should like to compliment them on their performance over the past year.  We have had the difficulty of trying to come to grips with the new committee system, with which we are not familiar in this House, and I would hope that the Government would proceed with all haste in bringing in whatever legislation is necessary to meet the new situation in which we find ourselves.  It is something that cannot be left on the long finger.</P>
    <P>As the Government members of the Parliament we are in the difficulty that we do not know whether it will be possible for us to attend our meeting this week, next week or the week after.  Apart from the fact that this is an inconvenience and a nuisance to the five members concerned, it is not an appropriate way to have the country represented.  We were recalled from the agricultural debate in Strasbourg two weeks ago, although three of us were down to speak in that all-important debate.  The Agricultural Estimate accounts for 83 per cent of the entire Community budget.  What we in Ireland fail to comprehend is the magnitude of the Community of which we are now members.  The agricultural guaranteed prices are worth 52,000 million units of account, which is over £21,000 million.</P>
    <P>Our interest in the retention of CAP is obvious when one considers <Col N="1578" /> the high percentage of the entire budget which is concerned with agriculture. It is a shame that the five Government members should have been pulled out of that debate.  I had been given the task of speaking in that debate on behalf of the Christian Democrat Group.  This is something that it would be difficult for an Irishman to get for another couple of years because there are seven different countries represented in that group.  If one of our Italian colleagues was assigned to speak in that debate he would be speaking on olive oil, wine or citrus fruits and not on pigs, beef and barley.  These would not be his priorities.  When such opportunities present themselves, I regret if we are not able to avail of them.</P>
    <P>We have got to get down to the problem of making provision for dovetailing the work of the Dáil with that of the European Parliament in as far as the ten Irish members of the European Parliament are concerned. At the end of January there was a meeting of the European Parliament and the Associated African States and Madagascar.  These meetings between parliamentarians from the EEC and the 19 Associated States, which are the 19 African countries with trading associations with the EEC, and also the 23 Associated States, are held twice a year and this meeting was in Rome.  That conference represented over one-fifth of the world's population. The main reason why both the Americans and the Russians dislike the European Community is because it is the biggest economic bloc.  The regrettable thing is that it does not have the political power that should go with its importance in world affairs. I hope that the Community will not only take on monetary union at the earliest possible date but that they will have a commitment to take on a political dimension as well.  This is important.</P>
    <P>The Government here should seek clarification on the policy of the defence of Europe.  We should have a look at our present situation <i>vis-a-vis</i> the defence of Europe.  Perhaps we might have some discussion on that later on.  Over the past few months <Col N="1579" /> many people in this country have been laying the blame for all our ills on the fact that we joined the EEC.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LiamCunningham" hpid="Mr. Cunningham Mr. Cunningham">

      <NameTxt>Mr. McDonald</NameTxt>
      <P>We are at the start of the transitional period.  We will not be full members of the Community until the end of the transitional period in 1977.  When agricultural prices are announced showing increases of 8 per cent in the price of the average pig in Europe it should be remembered that that is 8 per cent of a price of £50 and that it is a reasonable increase for the European farmer, but in our price structure, which has not reached European standards we must add the 8 per cent on to a price of £30.  People should be patient while working and trying to get the most out of the new situation in which we find ourselves.</P>
      <P>From my experience of the last 11 months in Europe our greatest handicap was our lack of preparedness for entry into Europe.  The last Administration failed to build up the European sections in our Departments of State to the extent we would have expected them to have done.  Our Mission in Brussels this time last year was very small.  In the last 11 months the staff there has been at least doubled.  My opinion is that it should have been doubled before the referendum. The last Government should have taken steps to prepare the country for entry, on the assumption of the people opting to join the EEC. I do not know whether that is a democratic thing to say, but at least the other countries did it.  Britain did not have a referendum so they did not have to worry about such arrangements. Our Government's failure to prepare for entry has affected us.  The Government had only six months to prepare for entry into Europe.</P>

I was amazed to find that so very little preparation was done in this respect.  I would have thought in the first week of January, 1973, after we had gone in, that the then Government would have had all these applications for the various grants ready to hand into the appropriate Commission office in Brussels. The present Government had only three or four months in which to muster up these applications.  By the closing date, towards the end of June last year, they had succeeded in having £13 million worth in.</P>

      <P>Fianna Fáil did not have their homework done.  They did not have the applications in. We should be able to avail of the maximum benefit under these grants because they exist to benefit the areas of the Community that need them. That is the whole philosophy behind the co-operation in Europe and behind the Community as a whole.  That is why I said that Fianna Fáil should have geared the nation for entry on the assumption that the electorate were going to vote for entry in the referendum on the 10th May, 1972.</P>

This will put extra work on his broad shoulders and also on his Department.

      <P>I would like to say to the progressive Irish industrial firms that they might consider briefing the ten Irish parliamentarians on the problems they have in complying with the provisions of the EEC.  One or two of the more progressive firms have been very helpful and enabled us to fight regulations which were discriminating against Irish products.  Too few of our Irish firms are awake to the fact that we can speak for them and that&mdash;I speak for my nine colleagues &mdash;we are only too anxious to fight their cause in Europe.  We cannot be expected to be experts in everything in the EEC without being briefed beforehand. The fact that we are in three separate groupings in the European Parliament gives us an opportunity of being able to tackle each Irish problem from three angles.  We have been striving at this, not without some success, over the past 11 months.  I would like to compliment the few Irish firms who have been awake to this situation and have given us the opportunity of working for them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It gives one a sense of satisfaction to be able to work in the European parliamentary commissions on behalf <Col N="1583" /> of Irish firms and workers and know that we can go out there and achieve something.  We can very often come back and report tangible results.  We have discussed documents on various matters.  Sir Anthony Esmonde did a report on aerosols some time last year and Deputy Thronley brought out a report on eels.  This shows a complete cross section of life in Europe.  If any Irish firms want to enter European markets, we should be only too happy to help out and provide whatever assistance we can.</P>
    <P>I would like to say to the Minister for Education that he should not only keep the Irish language alive but that he should step up the teaching of European languages in our schools. When one goes to the Benelux countries, Belgium, Holland and Denmark, one finds everybody speaks English as well as French and German.  You can inquire your way on the street from ordinary workers and you will be answered in English especially in Holland.  Children go through the ordinary second level education in at least two languages in those countries.  I see no reason why we could not do the same here.  I hope that new incentives will be provided for this.</P>
    <P>I hope that schools will avail of the European Parliament grants to go across to Europe.  I have discussed this with my colleagues at some length and if we could get around Aer Lingus it would be possible to run day trips for some of our schools.  The European Parliament insists on 17 years of age so it would only be our senior students who would be able to avail of this.  They should be able to avail of a day trip to the European Parliament at no cost to themselves.  I hope school managers will consider this.  If they require any more information on it, they should discuss the matter with one of my colleagues or myself or with the European Parliament information manager, Joe Fahey.  Our people should have a fuller appreciation of democratic institutions in Europe.</P>

The same generous grants would apply there and it would be possible to sample the hospitality not only of our Belgian friends but our French friends.  I am sure all Deputies would be very welcome. We should like to have 20 or 30 of our colleagues out at a time. When they come we hope that the weather is bad and that they are knocked about in the aircraft because sometimes it has taken us 16 hours to get from here to Strasbourg.  One would visualise being able to make that journey as fast in an old sail ship.  If Deputies visit the European Parliament they will appreciate the difficulties under which we work.  Perhaps we will then get greater support from them in the Dáil.  It is a great honour to work in the European Parliament but it is a lot of hard work.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnCallanan" hpid="Mr. Callanan Mr. Callanan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Callanan</NameTxt>
      <P>I sat here since 4 o'clock today and I am disappointed there are not more Deputies present. In this country we know very little about what is happening in Brussels and we know very little about the directives and legislation being sent over here.  Very little explanation is given to us.  This Parliament is very irrelevant as far as Brussels is concerned. That is why, in order to get all the information I possibly can for my particular region that I sat here since 4 o'clock and listened to the Deputies who are members of the European Parliament.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I read this document and it explains much of what is happening in Europe but personally I cannot understand some things about the Treaty of Rome because when I first studied the treaty, a good while ago, I understood that it was very democratic but as things are being run in Brussels now, there is not much democracy about it.  First, I think somebody should raise the question of the national parliament being relevant in some way and not just being told that such a decision has been made by the Council of Ministers on a take-it-or-importan <Col N="1585" /> leave-it basis.  You cannot even debate it.  In fact, I think this is the only chance we have to debate any of the directives from Europe and that is why I am joining in this debate.  I do not intend to make a political football of anything but I must make a joke about Deputy McDonald's remarks about the people not being allowed to come home.  Little as I know about Europe I think the people on the opposite side of the House when they last voted in Europe on agriculture voted the wrong way. They might have been as well off at home on that occasion.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnCallanan" hpid="Mr. Callanan Mr. Callanan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Callanan</NameTxt>
      <P>That is only a joke which I had to make because of the great regrets expressed that they were not in Europe for the debate on agriculture. Deputy Thornley spoke about not having a proper back-up service and about all the material they had to read.  That goes even for Members of this House.  People may vote irresponsibly because they do not know enough about an issue.  This can happen anywhere if you have not a proper back-up service or if you have not debated an issue before you debate it, say, at Council level, where a decision will be made.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As regards Europe, I should like there to be some way in which the agenda, say, for the European Parliament meeting in a month's time, could be placed before the national parliaments of participating countries and discussed so that members going to Europe would be briefed as to their national parliaments' views on some decision to be made in the near future.  We are all in this now and whether we have reservations or not we must make the best of it and politics should not be played with something so important to the life of our people.  I tried to raise a matter concerning certain directives issued recently and the Minister informed me that the decision had been made and that it could not be debated.  I am not blaming him but I intend to have my say on it this evening.  I am sorry to say, without any reflection on the Minister opposite me, I fear he may <Col N="1586" /> not know very much about agriculture and I should prefer to raise this with the Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries because it is relevant in my part of the country.</P>
    <P>I did my very best to sell the EEC originally and I sold it on the basis that we were to get a big regional fund and that directives on agriculture were aimed at bringing the nonviable holdings up to viable levels.  I regret that some of the directives recently issued have caused me much worry as far as the north-west region is concerned.  We have no regional fund so far and we have had two directives from Europe, one in particular which was very vague.  I have had two interpretations of it, one from the Department, which I assume I must accept, and the other from the news media, from people who are supposed to be experts, in Brussels.  I refer to directives 159 and 160 which are vital to the people in the west of Ireland.  I should like the Minister to clarify those two directives in his reply.</P>
    <P>The first deals with the farm modernisation scheme, No. 159, which we have had no chance to debate here.  Everybody asks what exactly does it mean.  Apparently, the farmers will be in three categories, development farmers, commercial farmers and transitional farmers' and from figures given by practically everybody who seems to know anything about it, it appears that 70 per cent of the farmers, particularly in the western area, will fall into the category of transitional farmers.  They are called &ldquo;others&rdquo; by the Department. I was worried at the beginning. I have now accepted the Department's explanation which I got as late as today that the transitional farmer can never become a development farmer but nowhere in the directive is it written that he cannot.  It is very vague.  In an article by Mr. Denis Maguire in <i>The Farmers Journal</i> of February 2nd, 1974 &mdash; the previous week he wrote on the development farmer &mdash; he stated what they are not entitled to.  They are entitled to certain grants.  He says they are not entitled to any grants for mobile <Col N="1587" /> equipment or for extra female staff&mdash; this is very important if you are to become a development farmer &mdash; and no priority as regards Government loans guaranteed if their own security is insufficient.</P>
    <P>These three things are worrying farmers in the west of Ireland.  I was also told today that, as far as I could gather, 45 adjustable acres is reckoned to be as near as you can get to being viable.  I know all the western region and if 45 adjustable acres means 45 acres of reasonably good land, you could have 100 acres of hills and you would not have 45 adjustable acres which seems to be the figure for viability.  That seems to be the farm which they think will yield a labour unit of 1,800.  Accepting the Department's figures, labour units only include males; there is nothing for females.  No figures will be put on the services of the farmer's wife or daughters.  That is all the better for a person who is becoming a development farmer because if his wife were taken into account and even half the labour unit put against her, it would be 2,700 for a man and his wife with no son working for them on the land. It would be harder for that farmer to come up to the standard for a development farm.</P>
    <P>This is the Department's opinion and not the opinion of experts.  About four or five weeks ago there was a debate between the vice-president of the IFA and the president of the Land League and some other experts and they agreed that 70 per cent of the farmers would fall into that category. They agreed also that there was not much future for that 70 per cent.  I would be delighted if the Department's view were correct but I should like to see it written in and spelled out. I should like to see it spelled out that some of the 70 per cent will get an opportunity to go into the development category.  There is an acreage grant to be given to the development farmer which the transitional farmer cannot get.  If he does not get it, how will he become a development farmer and step up into this category?</P>
    <P>If a transitional farmer is to get <Col N="1588" /> into the development farmer category he must reach the required amount within six years.  If the scheme were extended to ten years I would support it.  According to the directive the transitional farmer, or &ldquo;the others&rdquo; as the Department calls them, will get the support for four or six years. The Minister said that there was a chance that it would be continued but this is a very vague statement. This has annoyed people living along the west coast.  I am very worried about these matters.</P>
    <P>As reported in today's <i>Irish Press</i> the Minister for Lands, made an announcement last night:</P>
    <P>Such a farmer willing to sell would get:</P>
    <P>£600 annuity for life and if the husband died the widow would get an annuity of £400 for life;</P>
    <P>£12,000 for the sale of the land; plus a further £1,200 cash premium.</P>
    <P>There was another valuable second choice in the scheme:</P>
    <P>The same farmer may lease his land for a period of 12 years and will get the same income for the 12 years but will retain ownership of the land.</P>
    <P>I would like an explanation of this directive.  There are a number of farmers who would be prepared to let their land for 12 years but not at the current letting rates because of what happened in the past six years. Land almost doubled in value.  That cycle will not continue but no man will let his land for 12 years if he cannot let it at the current price prevailing for land per year.  This is a very important point.  This year land may not be worth anything like what it was worth last year.  These two directives are more important to the people of the west than any other directives which will come from Europe for some time.</P>
    <P>I had a letter asking me to go to the Land Commission to try to get an estate divided.  This man was worried for his wife and children.  He was told by the agricultural adviser <Col N="1589" /> yesterday that he would not qualify for any benefits.  He had 28 acres. How many farmers are there in County Mayo or County Galway with less?  Can our people in Europe use their influence when these directives are being drawn up?</P>
    <P>The Land Commission have thousands of acres but not money to divide them.  There is no money coming from the EEC for that purpose.  The west of Ireland needs drainage and there is no money for that either. This man is anxious to get the 500 or 600 acres divided.  The Land Commission have a certain budget and can only divide X number of acres per year.  In order to bring the number of farmers into the development category, hundreds of acres of land would need to be divided in one year, or else the farmers will be downgraded into the transitional farmer category. I am very worried about the future of these farmers.  I cannot overstress that point.</P>
    <P>Seventy per cent of the farmers along the west coast are small farmers. They are the plain people of Ireland. There is no point in saying we are not asking them to leave the land, but we are not giving them any money.  Some grants have already been discontinued since 1st February.  They will not get a number of the grants which the development farmer will get.  Any land got from the pension scheme will be available to the development farmer in preference to the man who has not got the required amount of land to become a development farmer.  The only land available for transitional farmers is land already held by the Land Commission.  Development farmers are so selective that it is held that they represent only 30 per cent of the farmers of Ireland.</P>
    <P>About 15 per cent of our farmers can go into the category of commercial farmers.  The development farmer is doing very well out of this deal.  He is getting very good acreage grants.  I am interested in the 70 per cent of the farmers.  I would have thought that if we had any kind of a democracy in Europe, that before such a directive was sent back to us to take it or leave it, there should be an <Col N="1590" /> opportunity in the national Parliament of debating such forthcoming decisions. I am not blaming any one man in the European Parliament for this.  I imagine that not many of them would understand the situation.  If they heard what the people who have lived with it in rural Ireland had to say and went back to their own national parliaments armed with that information, they would be better members of the international parliament.</P>
    <P>I am very worried about the European set-up.  I studied the Treaty of Rome when I was at a conference of agricultural producers 12 years ago. At that time we were told that the Treaty of Rome specified that there could be no subsidy pricewise but that there was no objection to a subsidy acre-wise or headage-wise.  I am endeavouring to see what can be done for the pig industry.  We cannot subsidise the price of feeding stuffs.  I asked an official of the Department if something could be done to stop people killing pigs.  Could a payment per sow be given to farmers to keep these pigs?  I was shocked and annoyed when Deputy Thornley also mentioned that some directive might issue shortly stating that we cannot subsidise agriculture.  Are these matters in the Treaty of Rome?  I do not believe that they can be tied up so tightly: one cannot do this and one cannot do that.  We should have as much influence in Europe to tell them what exactly we can and what we cannot subsidise.  I am looking for information on certain directives.</P>
    <P>I understand that the Treaty of Rome was used when An Bord Gráin was abolished.  An Bord Gráin bought all the unmillable wheat and barley. They resold it and subsidised the carriage of it to the west of Ireland and non-grain growing areas.  At that time we were told that An Bord Gráin could not exist as a State board but that it would be replaced by a co-operative or some other board.  The next thing that happened was that restrictions were withdrawn altogether and now we have a free for all.  Everyone is aware that corn is now sold at £40 per ton and barley is between £75 and £80 per ton.  There is no <Col N="1591" /> control whatsoever, something which is hitting the area I represent.</P>
    <P>That board has not been replaced, and no attempt has been made to control the sale of this grain.  The Minister, and the members of the European Parliament, should work to get a change in the system that exists at present.  I put this request to the Minister, and the members of the European Parliament, because in matters such as this this House is totally irrelevant.  On occasions I wonder if we are wasting our time because the vital matters affecting this country are decided in Brussels and we are not told of them until directives are issued.  Our way of living is being decided in Brussels.  There is something wrong with a treaty which stipulates that such matters must be decided in Brussels first before the member countries are made aware of them.  Our members of the European Parliament could do something about such directives if this House was in a position to have a discussion on them before they are implemented.</P>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesBMcDonald" hpid="Mr. McDonald Mr. McDonald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McDonald</NameTxt>
      <P>We can only try to amend such directives.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnCallanan" hpid="Mr. Callanan Mr. Callanan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Callanan</NameTxt>
      <P>I accept that, but this cannot be done unless our members of the European Parliament have the views of the Members of this House.</P>
      <P>It was stated earlier that agriculture may shortly become irrelevant in the Community and it was suggested that agriculture might not be subsidised any more.  I do not know how that could come about in a Community as large as the EEC.  If agriculture becomes irrelevant and farmers go out of production, the ordinary people who have to be fed will suffer.  For that reason agriculture will never become irrelevant.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Before we entered the Community we heard a lot of talk about the Six and the policies of the Six.  I was sick listening to people talking of these policies.  We all know that Britain's policy was always one of cheap food and that they were going to make their presence felt in the Community. <Col N="1592" /> In any company where three new directors are co-opted the policy of that company always changes.  The same was the position when the three new member states joined the EEC.</P>
    <P>In my view our members of the European Parliament are not being properly briefed.  I am not faulting them and I believe that we have brains on the European Parliament, but if they knew what they should talk about and had the background information they would be in a position to present Ireland's case in a better light.  I would not speak at any meeting discussing national policy if I was not aware of the feelings at grass roots level.  Because I would not be an authority on such matters I would do as the man did at the dinner dance long ago, stand up, speak up and shut up.</P>
    <P>I do not know what can be done to improve the briefing of our members on the European Parliament but it is wrong that they should be asked to take part in debates when they have not adequate information.  Are the members of the European Parliament told the type of directive to be issued in advance of its publication?  If this is the case, arrangements should be made to have them debated in this House before they are debated in the European Parliament.</P>
    <P>I was bitterly disappointed that we could not have a debate on these two directives because, as yet, I am as clear as mud about them.  I have received a certain amount of clearance from the Department of Agriculture and Fisheries on them but this is a complete contradiction to what has appeared in the Press and to what has been expressed by people in rural organisations.  If the Department of Agriculture and Fisheries are correct my mind is eased slightly but if the reports in the newspapers are correct it would mean the elimination of the finest type of people in this country, the underprivileged, the people I have spent my life fighting for.</P>
    <P>I am also disappointed that the regional fund has not been brought into operation.  If this country benefits from this fund the money should be spent in the west, in counties Mayo, <Col N="1593" /> Galway and Leitrim, because if those counties do not get some assistance from such a fund there is a poor future for them.  I hope the Minister will succeed in getting a substantial amount for this country from the fund.</P>
    <P>If I listened to a debate on city life, about which I know nothing, if I had any intelligence at all I would be able to discuss the city view point in Brussels.  These are the points I wanted to get across.  I waited since 4 o'clock to get in and I hope I will get some answers.  I wish the Minister well and all those who go to the European Parliament.  They have a tough job to do and they have my best wishes.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FintanCoogan" hpid="Mr. Coogan Mr. Coogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Coogan</NameTxt>
      <P>I know that our representatives in Europe have not got a bed of roses.  The European Parliament is a far cry from the parish pump.  We listen and we learn.  Reports like this bring us closer to Europe and inform us on what our interests there are.</P>
      <P>Tourism affects our economy.  When we get back to the standards we had prior to the strife in the North, there will be more scope for tourism.  I would like our representatives to change the image that has been created, not only in Europe but all over the world, that this part of the country is mixed up in that strife.  This image has affected one of the greatest arms of our economy, that is, tourism.  We do not want to see those problems spilling over and affecting us and I should like the image which has been created to be rebutted at every opportunity by our representatives.</P>
      <P>Some time ago I had Dutch visitors in this House at Question Time.  The House was fairly full and they asked me: &ldquo;Which side of the House is the Protestant side and which is the Catholic side?&rdquo; They were amazed when I told them there was none of that down here.  We must eradicate that impression at every opportunity.  I want to stress this as it affects the economy of the west.  People are not prepared to come to an area which they think is strife torn.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It was amazing to hear members of the Fianna Fáil party trying to say that our members were not in Europe. Quite recently they were the cause of <Col N="1594" /> their having to leave Europe to come back here and look after this House due to some very poor activities on the part of the Fianna Fáil Whip.</P>
    <P>I should like to take this opportunity to thank the Minister's staff for their co-operation with visitors who left my area and went to Brussels. Every effort was made to make their visit worthwhile.  I am deeply grateful to the Minister's staff.  I have always found them very co-operative.</P>
    <P>Deputy Callanan mentioned the regional fund.  I should like to reiterate the importance of the regional fund to the west.  Along the west coast where the land is poor and has nothing to offer, men give up hope and leave the area.  Some people stay on to mind the old people and, by the time they pass on, they themselves are too old to leave and you will have the pattern of old people being in the majority.  A regional fund would play a big part in helping the economy along the west coast and especially in west Galway and Mayo. I do not want it to be used as slush money.  There is a bit of thinking to be done on how it should be spent, unlike many other funds in the past, from which there was no come back. I should like to wish the Minister every success.  He is dynamic.  He is worthy of representing us there.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cunningham</NameTxt>
      <P>Before dealing with directives 159 and 160 on lands I should like to say to the Minister that it is a pity that Members of this House have not got the means of keeping themselves better informed. Speaking to some of the delegates who attend the European Parliament, I find that they, too, find it very difficult to keep abreast with movements there and with all the ramifications of the very many debates, discussions, directives, and so on.  It is fair to say that the amount of literature available in the Library to Members of the House <Col N="1595" /> is fairly voluminous.  I would prefer if, through the Minister's office, we could have a very brief precis of the different items which are of interest to this country.  These proposals are not directives until agreement is reached but, leading up to them, we should get a brief indication of the different proposals which are being put forward.  When directives are issued we should be much better informed on their content.</P>
      <P>I hope the regional fund will be very much to the advantage of this country. I wish the Minister well in his negotiations and in the various discussions which are taking place on the regional fund.  The Minister and the Government would be wise to bring all of Dáil Éireann into their confidence and seek the advice of the Opposition on some of the proposals.  I know that eventually these things are the Government's responsibility in the same way as all legislation is, but it is not good enough that neither the Opposition nor the public are aware of proposals being put forward.  There may be some good reason for it.  The views of the Opposition and of the various bodies throughout the country should be obtained before directives are made.  This would mean that the Opposition would be aware of the difficulties and, secondly, when the directives were issued we would be able to see they were the best.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I agree with what Deputy Callanan has said.  Even in the case of the two directives that have been issued for some time we are still at sea.  The public is not aware of the full ramifications of Directives Nos. 159 and 160.  The latter refers to lands, land tenure, pensions for farmers, for those who voluntarily sell their lands, and to leasing arrangements.  None of these matters is clear to the public.  In fact, I plead guilty to being ignorant of some of these matters not through my own fault.  With regard to Directive No. 159, which refers to the farm modernisation scheme, I took the trouble of trying to find out from a number of official sources when the directive would come into operation and some of the final details.  I was <Col N="1596" /> told the final details were not yet hammered out.  The Minister for Lands on several occasions in the last three months has spoken outside this House about this scheme and in his latest speech, a copy of which I have before me, he has gone to town in an effort to sell it.  The people have been making inquiries through their Deputies and have been writing directly to the Department but they have not been given any comprehensive information.</P>
    <P>The purpose of the Regional Fund is to assist the underdeveloped and the less developed peripheral areas of the Community.  In assessment of these areas Ireland is regarded as an underdeveloped area and, therefore, the whole island could qualify for benefit from the fund.  The Government should ensure that our peripheral areas are given special consideration; it would be unfair if the fund were used globally.  As a matter of policy, principle and practice, the Community are giving preference to their peripheral areas and we should establish that principle here.  I hope there will not be any objections from the Community if we apply Community principles to the distribution of the fund.</P>
    <P>If we do that we will be putting it to the best use because our peripheral areas would have first preference. Many Deputies have spoken about the western regions.  These regions need special consideration.  There would not be any advantage for this country joining the EEC if a regional fund could not be used for the benefit of the less developed and the peripheral areas.  I should like to hear the Minister's comments on this.</P>
    <P>The Opposition would like to have more information about the Regional Fund.  I know there are times when the Minister cannot show his hand at home because he may not want the cards to be known in Europe.  This is natural among nations as well as people but, nevertheless, he should give the House more information.  In fact, I should like to compliment the European Deputies who spoke here.  I got more detailed information from <Col N="1597" /> listening to their contributions today than I have obtained from any Minister who attended the European Parliament or the Council of Ministers. This should not be the case.  A Minister should be able to give more information to the Dáil than is being given.</P>
    <P>As a northern Deputy I hope there will be the closest and fullest co-operation in regional development within the territory of our island with the Northern Assembly and the authorities in the Six-County area.  I know members of local authorities in Donegal, Derry and Tyrone met the Minister for Finance and put certain broad principles before him for the recognition of these three counties as a development region.  Not alone would it serve the economic interests of the country but it would help that area where development is needed.</P>
    <P>Not alone did the officials and members of those local authorities have frequent meetings in their own areas, in Derry and Lifford, but other voluntary organisations such as chambers of commerce have met to discuss joint proposals.  Here we should have one of the best examples of cross-Border co-operation, when we see a company like Courtaulds setting up a £25 million factory in Derry and one of similar size and cost in Letterkenny. It shows that companies like that are ignoring the existence of the Border, and when it comes to the distribution of the Regional Fund this region should be considered favourably.</P>
    <P>Negotiations are proceeding on benefits from the Social Fund.  I have one crib in this respect.  It is that it is not and will not be distributed through Government agencies: I think it is a matter for application by individual organisations throughout the country, co-operatives and such like.  I am afraid that the opportunities to apply for benefits were not sufficiently publicised. Perhaps I am wrong but I do not think they received very much publicity in the Press.  Perhaps the Minister or some Department brought the fund's provisions to the notice of the organisations concerned but my understanding is there were not sufficient <Col N="1598" /> applications to the Social Fund, in other words, that information was not made available that all the applications would be met in full.  I am not sure and I should like the Minister to deal with this matter.</P>
    <P>I listened to Deputy Wilson speak on the educational aspect of the EEC. This is very important and I would urge that opportunities be given to all students, especially at second level, to learn some European languages. This is necessary from an economic point of view apart altogether from the cultural.  Of course, it is culturally necessary that we should do it and the economic aspect of the Community is always discussed to such an extent that we tend to lose sight of the fact that we have strong cultural ties with western Europe. Before other steps are taken I hope preparatory ones will be made leading towards the ultimate steps towards a united Europe.  Whatever the later steps will be, I suggest that we should recommend to the Council of Ministers, and I am recommending it now to the Minister for Foreign Affairs, that we should press on with an educational programme especially in the language field.</P>
    <P>Due to the policy of Governments here in the past in regard to education, most young people nowadays have as good an opportunity as most European children to advance educationally as far as language is concerned. However, there are problems and we are behind in language development. I have found that in most European countries pupils and, indeed, adults, can speak three, sometimes four and sometimes many more languages.  Therefore, I urge the Minister to see that any barriers there may be in Europe are not language barriers.</P>
    <P>Directive 159 deals with farm modernisation.  I am not a farmer but many of my constituents are, and they are worried.  I have a question on the Order Paper asking what percentage of Irish farmers will benefit from this scheme.  We know that in order to be entitled to the grants from the scheme our Department of Agriculture and Fisheries will have to <Col N="1599" /> contribute 75 per cent which means the EEC will pay 25 per cent.  Surely, with the money available&mdash;&mdash;</P>

In other words, the proposals are, I gather, that farmers of over £1,800 a year will qualify for certain grants, that those transitional up to that will qualify for less attractive grants; there may also be a large number of small farmers who will not qualify for grants at all.

      <P>As I was saying, it is time that clarification should be given on the provisions of the farm modernisation scheme and, in the first place, to allay the fears of those who think that, number one, no grants will be available to certain small farmers &mdash; no land projects grants, no grants to develop their farms &mdash; because it is significant that from the 1st February, the farm project people are accepting no applications.  Farmers are told not to apply and that if they apply they will not get any grants.</P>

      <P>The farm modernisation scheme is specifically mentioned in the document which we are debating.  Page 8 says:</P>
      <P>A Farm Modernisation Scheme is being introduced in Ireland as from 1st February, 1974.  The Council of Ministers has agreed in principle to the first part of the directive&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      <P>So it has only been agreed in principle as yet&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;for a special system of aids for farmers in mountain and other less favoured areas.</P>
      <P>Therefore, I think it is in order to discuss the farmers in mountainous and less favoured areas.</P>

      <P>He is the second Minister who is alleging, or has got into the habit of alleging, that on this side of the House we are dopes, we are confused, we are ignorant, we do not know what we are talking about. The Minister for Local Government gave us the same advice last week quite frequently.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LiamCunningham" hpid="Mr. Cunningham Mr. Cunningham">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cunningham</NameTxt>
      <P>I started off on that note, that I was confused and that the people of this country were confused, confused, first of all, by the lack of knowledge, secondly, by different statements at different times and from different Ministers.  I hope I am not confusing the Minister now. Yes, there is confusion; hence my request for more information.  I am not <i>au fait</i> with all the provisions, with all the directives.  I started off by asking the Minister to give us more information, to bring this side of the House along with him, to keep us informed about what is happening or what is going to happen in so far as he is allowed to do it.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Dr. FitzGerald Dr. FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>If you will allow me, Sir, I wish to explain that Nos. 159 and 160 are two directives laying down the general shape of possible farm modernisation schemes and limiting what could be done under these schemes two years before we joined.  Once we joined we accepted those &mdash; they are not open to amendments. A farm modernisation scheme does not and may not go outside those limits, and there is no point in suggesting that it should.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, both 159 and 160.  Thirdly the reference here which the Deputy mentioned is to a special system of aid for farmers in mountain and other less favoured areas.  That is quite a separate issue.  It is not part of the farm modernisation scheme.  If the Deputy is being misled because of the heading, I apologise for that.  It may be badly drafted, and I think, it is partly our fault.  I am sorry about that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LiamCunningham" hpid="Mr. Cunningham Mr. Cunningham">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cunningham</NameTxt>
      <P>In an earlier debate towards the end of last year, I did mention the less favoured farms. I am glad the Minister has clarified this for me.  There is a distinct difference between the farm modernisation scheme and any scheme which may be introduced for the less favoured farms.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Dr. FitzGerald Dr. FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LiamCunningham" hpid="Mr. Cunningham Mr. Cunningham">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cunningham</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LiamCunningham" hpid="Mr. Cunningham Mr. Cunningham">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cunningham</NameTxt>
      <P>I will now get on to proposed aids for the less favoured farms.  In a debate about six months ago I asked the Minister to tell us about some of the proposals he may be putting forward for the less favoured farms of this country. It is a pity we are not told about these things.  Would the Minister elaborate now?  We should not have to deal with something which is signed, sealed and delivered like the farm modernisation scheme and the pensions for retired farmers.  I refer particularly to the aids for the less favoured farms.  Negotiations are now going on.  Could the Minister tell us what they are, what proposals his Government or the Department of Lands are putting forward, what snags they are running into, what are the other countries trying to do and does that suit this country?  If it does not, <Col N="1604" /> what action does the Minister propose to take?  The Minister may not be allowed to give me answers to all of these questions but I would like to know something about this scheme.</P>
      <P>Is the gradient of the land a criterion for getting aid for the less favoured farms?  If the Minister for Lands does not fight for bad land which has no gradient at all such land will get no grant.  There are bad lands in this country which are less favoured and are flat.  The Minister's colleagues should not accept any proposals which would eliminate flat lands and only include lands with high gradient under the less favoured farm scheme.</P>
      <P>This scheme is tied up with farm modernisation and with pensions to farmers.  Some of the lands which may be relinquished under the less favoured farm grants may qualify for grants under this scheme.  Does this apply to land which carries cattle at the moment?  It is well known in the west that mountain farms and very badly favoured farms carry cattle and sheep. Is it only sheep farmers who will qualify for grants under this scheme?</P>
      <P>The Minister for Lands made announcements on a number of occasions, but he made one especially on 25th February.  There is some confusion about farmers under the pension scheme.  The Minister took one of the best possible examples when he indicated that a farm of 30 acres would realise £400 per acre, a total of £12,000 and that there would be a life annuity.  He said that the wife, if the farmer died would get a life annuity of £600.  Would it be in order for me to ask the Minister to clarify page 2, on the question of leasing?</P>

    <Speaker pid="LiamCunningham" hpid="Mr. Cunningham Mr. Cunningham">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cunningham</NameTxt>
      <P>It is the 25th February, 1974.  I would like to ask <Col N="1605" /> if there is any co-operation between the Minister and his counterpart in Northern Ireland in the EEC?  Does the Minister have discussions on matters of mutual interest to this island with his opposite number?  Do meetings take place here where there is full and frank discussions on matters affecting both sides of the Border?  Are any agreements made or plans of campaign carried to the ultimate in Europe?  Will the Minister give some examples of this?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is right and necessary that this should happen but, above all, the people should know it is happening and that we are working as representatives of one island which has common problems.  Many other countries have such problems but it is wise to show the member states of the Community that the Irish can work in <Col N="1606" /> unison.  This is important at the moment because we look forward to the European Community providing a mutual meeting ground away from the strifes of the present situation at home.  If it can be shown to the people, North and South, especially those in the North who are afraid, that these developments will eventually lead us into one nation, that Ministers from our Government and from the Assembly in the North can work together in the context of a European Parliament, then I think this would be a pointer to the fact that they could work together in a united Irish Parliament.</P>
