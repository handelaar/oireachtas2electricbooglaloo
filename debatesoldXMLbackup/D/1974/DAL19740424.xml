      <P>The future of the training school in St. Brigid's Hospital, Ardee will be considered shortly as part of a general review of training facilities for psychiatric nurses in the country as a whole.

    <Speaker pid="BrendanCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>As the Deputy is probably aware, there was a working party established some few years ago to decide what changes, if any, there might be in regard to the training of psychiatric nurses.  The report has been circulated to all the interested parties, including the health boards and the nurses' unions.  The various aspects of this report are now being discussed.  It is suggested that there might be a regional scheme for training but, in that context, every single psychiatric hospital will be considered.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Health if he is aware that there are 30 applications in County Kildare in respect of domiciliary allowances for the mentally handicapped awaiting decision by the Eastern Health Board; and if the question of the provision of further finance for this scheme has been discussed recently with officials of his Department.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>I am informed by the Eastern Health Board that in respect of County Kildare there are at present seven applications awaiting decision under the scheme in question.</P>
      <P>I indicated on 21st March, 1974, in reply to the Deputy's previous question regarding the scheme, that the position as to the availability of funds had been clarified with the health board.  The question of the provision of further finance has not since been raised by the board with my Department.</P>

      <P>The Minister is no doubt aware that the minutes of the last meeting of the local branch of the Eastern Health Board did convey that there were 30 applications.  Am I to understand that these have been reduced to seven in the meantime? Written into the minutes, too, is a clear indication that the Minister was <Col N="5" /> to be approached to provide extra funds to deal with these cases.</P>

As far as the numbers are concerned, as I have said, there are seven.  It is true that there are seven other applicants but they are under the prescribed age too.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>I am aware that difficulty occasionally arises in securing payment for hospital services from patients including those insured under the voluntary health insurance scheme.  I am also aware that in appropriate cases the hospital authorities take the usual steps to recover the amounts due for the services provided.</P>
      <P>The information available to me does not, however, indicate that this situation could be described as an abuse of the voluntary health insurance scheme.</P>
      <P>The detailed arrangements for payment of benefits under that scheme are made by the Voluntary Health Insurance Board, and the insurance cover has, since the inception of the scheme in 1957, been provided on the basis of a contract between the board and the individual subscriber.</P>

      <P>I assume the Deputy is referring to the medical care provisions of the Social Welfare (Occupational Injuries) Act, 1966, under which reimbursements are made, out of the occupational injuries funds, of costs of medical care incurred by insured persons as the result of occupational injuries and diseases.  I am not aware of any abuses of these arrangements on the part of insured persons.  Responsibility for settling accounts in respect of medical care expenses rests on the insured persons concerned and it is customary to bring this fact to their notice when payments are being made.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Defence (Mr. Donegan)</NameTxt>
      <P>Reports have been received in my Department regarding the alleged sighting of a submarine off the Cork coast recently.  The reports, while not claiming positive identification of the object seen as a submarine, seem to indicate that such a vessel was in our territorial waters on the night of 29th March, 1974.  There was no subsequent observation of it and the available information is not sufficient to sustain any particular line of inquiry.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I noted a Press report this morning of the possible sighting of another submarine off Clonakilty.  My information is that, by a coincidence, the Naval Service had patrolled the area before the event was reported and returned and patrolled it again.  It is unlikely that the object sighted was a submarine as the water in that particular area is shallow, too shallow for a submerged submarine of any size, and the sighting was alleged to be a sighting of a periscope trail, which would mean that the submarine would itself <Col N="8" /> be taking up even more water, or a greater depth of water, if it were submerged. However, the Naval Service will pursue the matter to the utmost.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Begley</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not sure what changes the Deputy has in mind.

The maximum densities specified may vary not only between different planning districts but also between areas within the same planning district.  My approval is not required for the making or variation of a development plan.</P>
      <P>As regards local authority housing, the densities adopted in individual schemes are decided by the local authorities.  I have made it known however that I expect that in the design of housing schemes environmental aspects will be given greater attention than in the past and that there will be adequate provision for open spaces, landscaping and community facilities generally.  This policy will no doubt involve a decrease generally in local authority housing densities.</P>

      <P>At the request of my Department An Foras Forbartha prepared recommendations for site development works for housing areas.  Their report has been circulated to housing authorities and will be published by An Foras shortly.  I have asked housing authorities generally to adopt these standards in their own schemes and to encourage their use in private housing developments.</P>

The review group adduced a number of logical reasons why the Departments should be amalgamated but also drew attention to the difficulties attendant on such an amalgamation if the ensuing volume of parliamentary business for the Minister in charge were not reduced by the group's general proposals for the separation of policy and execution.  Experiments are being initiated to test the practicality of these proposals in a number of Departments.

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>There are no duties as such on goods exported to Northern Ireland but goods produced in this country from materials obtained from sources outside the Community and its associated states and which were imported free of duty must in order to qualify for Community preference bear a compensatory levy on exportation to other member states of the Community.  The levy is based on the value of such imported materials used in manufacture.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The rate of compensatory levy for industrial goods for 1974 is generally 40 per cent of the common customs tariff duty and it will increase gradually over the transitional period to the full level of the common customs tariff; for goods processed from agricultural products in similar circumstances the compensatory <Col N="26" /> levy corresponds broadly to the amount of the agricultural levies and other charges applicable to the imported materials.</P>
    <P>Under the Anglo-Irish Free Trade Area Agreement, and with the concurrence of the EEC, an arrangement has been concluded with the United Kingdom whereby certain textile materials and made-up articles made from materials from specified countries, mainly low-cost, are allowed duty-free entry into the United Kingdom, including Northern Ireland, provided the imported materials have, before exportation from this country, borne duty at a level which is not less than that applicable thereto on entry direct to the United Kingdom.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>As the Deputy will appreciate, a great deal of the exemptions and special considerations which exist in customs and tariff laws exist for the benefit of the very people who I have no doubt Deputy Brennan is trying to help.  It is virtually impossible to produce an abridged version of the law, particularly when it comes down to customs and excise matters. Each article has to be separately assessed to consider what category it falls into and then one has to consider what is the EEC provision in relation thereto and, as a result of that, consider what must be the appropriate tariff.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JosephBrennan" hpid="Mr. Brennan Mr. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister will agree that this is not all decided on the spot.  There are conditions, rules and regulations laid down which should be available.  I am thinking particularly of the tourists.  They are <Col N="27" /> frequently asking what they may or may not bring on their journey.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I was not conscious that this was the matter the Deputy had in mind.  I took it the Deputy's question extended beyond tourism.  In respect of tourism the ordinary EEC provisions apply, that is to say, in broad terms, 300 cigarettes and 1½ litres of spirits.  That is for a person who is a genuine tourist.  There is separate treatment for people who are resident in Border areas which is, of course, a smaller quantity.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>In view of the wide range of products which are subject to duty on importation from Northern Ireland the Deputy will appreciate that it would not be possible to give details in this reply.  The customs and excise tariff, up-to-date copies of which are available in the Dáil Library, gives full particulars of the duties in force.  In addition, there are variable charges on certain agricultural products; the tariff indicates where such charges apply and particulars of current rates are available at Custom Houses and other places of importation.  I recognise that our tariff is now one of great complexity and if the Deputy lets me have particulars of any tariff problems he has in mind, I will undertake to pass them on to the Revenue Commissioners for their advice.</P>

      <P>I should like the Minister to give a more satisfactory answer than the has given, referring to what is in the Library.  Here again there is the same question being asked, in a much more forceful way, in Border counties and very few people can set out the answer.  Is the Minister aware that there is an arrangement whereby up to £50 worth of goods may be imported subject to the person living within a certain distance of the Border?  Can he tell me how often this amount may <Col N="28" /> be imported?  Can it be taken in 40 times a day or once a week or once a day?  What are the regulations governing it?  What type of goods are covered?</P>

      <P>Apart from those which are free irrespective of origin some products may be relieved from duty because they are of Northern Ireland or United Kingdom or Commonwealth origin or because they are free under Community obligations or because they are re-imported goods.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">

      <P>The estimated increases in revenue in respect of the items mentioned in the Deputy's question are £400,000 and £450,000, respectively, for the current financial <Col N="31" /> period April to December, 1974.  These figures do not take into account the possibility of a consequential diversion of expenditure from other consumer items, which if it took place would tend to keep the overall yield from VAT at the figure forecast for budgetary purposes.</P>

    <Speaker pid="EdwardCollins" hpid="Mr. E. Collins Mr. E. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Finance if he is aware of the decision of the Revenue Commissioners to seize a motor car belonging to a person (name supplied) from Northern Ireland who, while now resident in the Republic, commutes to Northern Ireland where he has a business interest; and if, in view of the special circumstances of this case, a review of this decision will be sought by him.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am aware that the person whose name was supplied by <Col N="32" /> the Deputy and who is resident in the State was observed using an uncustomed car and was warned in November last that he should have it exported.  The car cannot legally be imported except on production of an import authorisation from the Minister for Industry and Commerce and on payment of the customs charges. Its use by the person named constitutes a customs offence incurring liability to penalties and forfeiture of the car.  In February last he was informed that failure to re-export it would result in its seizure.</P>
      <P>The circumstances of this case have been carefully considered but there are no grounds for altering the decision already conveyed to the person concerned.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EdwardCollins" hpid="Mr. E. Collins Mr. E. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>While I appreciate that the person mentioned is in effect a resident of the Republic, would the Minister not consider amending the law to allow people who are either citizens of the Republic or who are from the North but are living in the Republic and commute to their businesses in the North from the Republic, to use Northern Ireland registered cars?  While I ask this question I feel that neither Revenue concerns nor legal principles are involved. It is the safety of the people who are travelling to the North that should be considered primarily.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>The principal reason for these tariffs is not one for collecting revenue but is a tariff which works for the protection of the motor assembly industry in Ireland.  Therefore, one has very carefully to consider relaxing the legal provisions or providing an exemption.  I understand, in fact, in this case the person in question had taken up residence in the Republic before he had purchased the car which is the subject of this question. Clearly one has very carefully to consider this matter.  I do not know what the British provisions are but of course the Deputy will be aware that it is possible for people with cars which have been acquired elsewhere in certain circumstances to get a Republic of Ireland registration.  It would appear that if there is a need, <Col N="33" /> for security reasons, on the lines indicated by the Deputy that the matter would primarily be one for the authorities of Northern Ireland rather than for ourselves.  I will certainly take a look at the matter but I do not think it will be one that can be easily dealt with under the customs and excise codes.</P>

    <Speaker pid="EdwardCollins" hpid="Mr. E. Collins Mr. E. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>I fully appreciate the Minister's position and accept that people who use Northern Ireland registered cars and who reside here and use them in the Republic should have them confiscated if the duty is not paid.  Would the Minister reconsider his attitude that where a car is used to commute between the Republic and Northern Ireland it is the question of safety that should be considered?  While the cars are being used in relation to Northern Ireland journeys special provision should be made in this respect.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am prepared to have a look at it.  As I said to the Deputy, it will not be one of easy solution particularly where, as in this case, the person does not live in the Border zone but the car is used for the purpose of completing a journey between the South and North and would in fact have most of the journey in the Republic.  I will certainly take a look at it.</P>

      <P>The Commissioners have, however, received a proposal from the Donegal County Council for coast protection works affecting an area of Kilmacreddan a few miles west of Inver village.

      <P>Without in any way entering on disorderly debate, would it be possible for the Chair to indicate what is required under this Private Notice Question rule?  We understand that the matter must be of urgent public importance.  I submit that violent attacks on gardaí repeated in quick succession by armed men are matters not only of crucial importance from the public point of view but also of extreme urgency in that because of the quick repetition of these incidents in the last few days, now that these <Col N="46" /> incidents have been perpetrated and these attempts have been successful there is a great danger of a repetition of them unless adequate steps are taken to prevent attacks on med gardaí in the meantime.</P>

      <P>While the Chair does not normally permit his decisions to be canvassed in the House in this way, in reply to the Deputy I may say that to satisfy the requirements for a Private Notice Question the matter must be deemed to be one of public importance.  The matter raised in Deputy Andrews's question meets this requirement but it does not have the required degree of urgency.  My ruling is in accordance with precedents.  The practice has been to disallow questions for Private Notice where the incident or incidents are over.  It is to be assumed that normal police precautions are taken against a recurrence of this kind.  I should also add that the incidents occurred on 17th, 20th and 21st April and that a question submitted following the first incident could, on ordinary notice, have been in time for today's Order Paper while a question on the remaining incidents could have been put down in time for tomorrow's Order Paper.  I understand, as I have already said, that the Minister for Justice has agreed to take the question tomorrow.  Had the Deputy put down the questions in time and conformed with Standing Orders he could have had some of them dealt with here today.</P>

    <Title>Trade Union (Amalgamations) Bill, 1974: Second Stage.</Title>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOLeary" hpid="Minister for Labour (Mr. M. O'Leary) Michael O'Leary">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Labour (Mr. M. O'Leary)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>There are something over 400,000 workers organised in almost 100 unions in Ireland.  In comparison, the West German Trade Union Federation, the DGB, represents 6,400,000 workers organised in 16 industrial unions.  In Denmark, 56 trade unions cater for nearly one million workers, while in Holland 64 unions represent 1½ million workers.  The multiplicity of trade unions in this country has created problems in industrial relations both for employers and trade unions.  First, where so many individual unions cater for workers, there is the likelihood that the service available to the ordinary member will not be up to the standard which he requires in today's conditions.  Certainly, it is difficult to see how the range of services to be provided on the basis of a number of smaller unions can be up to the sophisticated level provided for union members elsewhere workers are organised in larger units.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Secondly, there is the general problem met with in a negotiation or dispute situation that the communication gap between the negotiating representatives and union members is increased in the multi-union bargaining situation.  Also, where a number of unions are catering for the same category of workers, there is fertile ground for dissention between unions, what is often referred to as inter-union disputes.  The 1973 Report of the Irish Congress of Trade Unions shows that their disputes committee had to deal with 23 inter-union disputes and this <Col N="49" /> only relates to those which finally came before the congress dispute committee. It is obvious also that in the actual disputes situation the ground for misinterpretation of the motives of the negotiating representatives becomes more marked.</P>
    <P>Thirdly, the shortcomings of our trade union structure have been brought into sharper focus consequent on our entry to the European Economic Community.  Many of the smaller trade unions now find themselves at a disadvantage in endeavouring to keep abreast of the rather complex issues of interest to workers arising from our accession to the EEC.</P>
    <P>The incidence of inter-union disputes is hardly surprising when one considers the large number of unions catering for workers in many of our national companies, for example, there are 21 unions representing 11,000 workers in the ESB, 33 representing 21,000 in CIE, 18 representing 2,200 in Guinness and 12 representing 700 in Gouldings.  In this kind of situation, negotiations involving a number of different trade unions often prove difficult and complex and, indeed, may inhibit desirable initiatives in industrial relations because of the almost impossible negotiations which would be involved. A situation in which there is a large number of trade unions, with in many cases two or more in competition for the recruitment of the same categories of workers, must inevitably lead to a wasteful use of limited resources by both trade unions and employers.</P>
    <P>Undoubtedly, a factor in the prolongation of the recent Dublin Corporation craftmen's dispute in which 12 unions represented 800 craft workers was due in no small measure to the number of unions negotiating with the one employer.</P>
    <P>The trade unions themselves are aware of the need for a rationalisation of the present structure.  During the 1960s, the congress committee on trade union organisation did a lot of very useful work in this field. However, disappointingly, progress towards rationalisation has been slow.</P>
    <P>The function of Government in this matter of rationalisation of trade <Col N="50" /> union structure is to provide the legislation that will facilitate amalgamation where the will to come together between unions is evident.  I believe that the trade union movement is, itself, the best arbiter of its own re-organisation but that the need for such re-organisation exists, no one doubts.  Today, trade union members are demanding a range of service which the small isolated union is unable to give.  Of course, let it be said that the Irish trade unionist still wants his membership on the cheap as the average trade union contribution per week in Ireland is little more than the price of a packet of cigarettes.  However much re-organisation takes place, the Irish trade union movement will not be capable of providing the services and expertise required unless the trade unionist in Ireland is prepared to pay a realistic contribution to his union.</P>
    <P>I must emphasise that the provisions of the Bill will not in any way force amalgamation on any trade union which wishes to retain its separate identity.  It is my hope, however, that this measure will stimulate a movement towards amalgamations which otherwise might not take place.  The achievement of unity by coercive legislation requiring the goodwill of all concerned is as invalid in this area as in any other instance.</P>
    <P>The Trade Union Act, 1971, in providing certain requirements for the issue of new negotiation licences, aimed at preventing undesirable fragmentation of the trade union movement. However, the Act did not provide the facilities which induce rationalisation of the existing trade union structure.</P>
    <P>The purpose of the Bill now before the House is, briefly, to facilitate amalgamations in cases where trade unions feel that the interests of their members and of the movement would best be served by joining with one or more other trade unions.  The Bill will do this by providing clear-cut procedures for amalgamations and for the transfer of engagements.  It also provides for financial assistance from public funds towards the expenses involved.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="51" /> The existing legislation on the procedures for amalgamation is contained in a number of pre-1920 Acts. As might be expected, these procedures are inappropriate to the circumstances of today.  The absence of any clear-cut procedures has undoubtedly been a factor in the legal difficulties which have been experienced by some unions in their efforts towards amalgamation. The Bill before the House by providing for less onerous voting requirements for amalgamation purposes and by setting out clear-cut procedures designed to clarify areas of former doubt should be of considerable assistance in stimulating movement towards rationalisation through amalgamation.  The long legal battle which delayed the creation of the NEETU from an amalgamation of the NEU and IEI and ETU might well have been avoided had this legislation existed in 1968.</P>
    <P>The Bill provides, first of all, that an instrument of amalgamation must be prepared which will be examined and approved by the Registrar of Friendly Societies if he is satisfied that it contains adequate information on the terms of amalgamation.  A written ballot on the instrument of amalgamation, as approved by the registrar, must also be arranged and every member of the union will be entitled to vote at this ballot.  At least seven days before the ballot is held the members of the trade union must receive notice in writing of the ballot and this notice must, again, be in a form approved by the registrar.  If the instrument of amalgamation is approved as a result of the ballot, the next step is to have the instrument registered by the Registrar of Friendly Societies, before the amalgamation can take effect.</P>
    <P>At present there is no legislation in this country governing the procedure for the transfer of engagements. While the absence of a statutory provision does not make transfers impossible, it does make them more difficult to carry through and the effect is to discourage this form of rationalisation.  This Bill provides that, in the case of a transfer of engagements, <Col N="52" /> a procedure somewhat similar to that provided for amalgamations shall be followed.</P>
    <P>The new procedures, supervised by the Registrar of Friendly Societies, are aimed at eliminating grounds for dispute in regard to the validity of amalgamations or transfers.  In this way, the procedures will be more effective, less time consuming and will encourage those who see the need to proceed with rationalisation.  An added advantage is that the interests of trade union members will be protected through the intervention of the Registrar of Friendly Societies.</P>
    <P>Under existing legislation if two or more trade unions wish to amalgamate, at least 50 per cent of the members of each of the unions involved must vote on the proposal to amalgamate and the votes of those in favour must exceed those against by 20 per cent or more.  What I am proposing in the Bill is to replace this rather difficult requirement by providing that a simple majority of those voting in favour of amalgamation or transfer of engagements will be sufficient to allow an amalgamation or transfer to take place.  At the same time, the provisions in the Bill regarding the notice of the ballot and so on will ensure that an amalgamation or transfer of engagements cannot be rushed through without adequate advance information being given to all members.</P>
    <P>In order to simplify matters still further, the Bill contains a provision whereby a committee of management or governing body of a transferee union, that is the union accepting the engagements, will be given power to alter the rules of the union to enable a transfer of engagements to be negotiated.  However, this power to alter the rules would not apply where a union adopts a rule specifically to exclude the operation of this provision.</P>
    <P>Under existing trade union legislation, no time limit is specified within which a complaint against an amalgamation or transfer of engagements may be lodged by members of the trade unions involved.  This <Col N="53" /> omission is rectified in the Bill.  It provides that the registrar will have power to deal with complaints in regard to amalgamations or transfers based on certain specified grounds and any such complaints will have to be lodged with him within six weeks of the application for the registration of the instrument of amalgamation or transfer.  If the complaint is substantiated, the registrar must make an order stating what must be done before he will consider an application to register the instrument.  The registrar must furnish a statement of the reasons for any decision which he gives on a complaint under this heading.</P>
    <P>The Schedule to the Bill sets out, in some detail, the powers proposed for the Registrar of Friendly Societies in connection with the hearing of complaints. For instance, the registrar may require the attendance of the complainant, or of any trade union officer concerned or of witnesses; he may require the production of any documents and he may administer oaths and take affirmations.</P>
    <P>The registrar will also have power to award or withhold costs.  Witnesses will, of course, be entitled to sums in respect of loss of time, travelling expenses and so on.  The registrar may, in the course of proceedings, if he thinks fit, at the request of the complainant or of the trade union, state a case for the opinion of the High Court on any question of law arising in the proceedings. An appeal shall lie to the High Court, on a point of law, against a decision of the registrar on a complaint.</P>
    <P>Under existing arrangements, legal difficulties can arise in regard to the transfer of property held by amalgamating unions.  I have, therefore, made provision in this Bill whereby the property of amalgamating unions will pass without any conveyance or assignment to the new union.  The property would vest in the appropriate trustees.</P>
    <P>The procedure for changing the name of a trade union is contained in the Trade Union Act, 1876.  Under this Act, a union must obtain the consent of not less than two-thirds of its total membership before it may lawfully change its name.  For various reasons, <Col N="54" /> a change of name may be desirable, for example, a small trade union negotiating a transfer of its engagements to a larger union might like the larger union to change its name so as to reflect its new augmented membership. I propose that, in future, a union will be allowed to change its name in accordance with its rules.  Where a union's rules do not provide for a change of name, the union will be able to do so by adopting an alteration of the provisions in the rules which gave the union its name.  The change of name will not take effect until after it has been registered by the Registrar of Friendly Societies.</P>
    <P>The Bill makes provision whereby the Minister for Industry and Commerce may, with the consent of the Minister for Labour, make regulations for carrying the Act into effect&mdash;these regulations will cover such matters as applications to the registrar, registration of documents, and so on.</P>
    <P>I have had discussions with a number of trade unions who are at present contemplating amalgamations and some of these have taken steps in that direction.  I have, therefore, made provision in the Bill that, where steps have already been taken by trade unions with a view to amalgamation before the Bill becomes law, they may proceed as if the Act had not become law or alternatively, may be completed under the provisions of the new Act.</P>
    <P>Finally, there is the question of grants.  It is my intention that no trade union should be discouraged or prevented from considering amalgamation or transfer of engagements because of the costs involved which could be considerable and the Bill, therefore, includes a provision which will enable me, with the consent of the Minister for Finance, to make grants available towards exceptional expenditure necessarily incurred by trade unions.  These would include, for instance, the cost of engaging appropriate consultancy services.</P>
    <P>I am hopeful that the procedures provided for in this Bill in relation to amalgamations, transfers of engagements and changes of name will encourage <Col N="55" /> the trade unions to give the most serious consideration to the advantages, in greater efficiency and better service to members which would flow from a more compact, cohesive trade union movement.  I commend this Bill to the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JosephDowling" hpid="Mr. Dowling Mr. Dowling">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dowling</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to support this Bill and, in doing so, to say that there are quite a number of gaps in it which I hope will be sealed off during the course of its passage through the House.  I was a member of the union mentioned in relation to the merger, the Irish Engineering Industrial and Electrical Trade Union, and I am well aware of the difficulties which existed at that time and the problems created as a result of the ineffective measures available to the unions at the time the merger was taking place.</P>
      <P>I am also aware of the problems that arose among trade unionists themselves as a result of the ineffectiveness of the situation at that time, the expense involved, the waste of members' money, the uncertainty created, the division among trade unionists and the lasting differences which resulted and which will be carried on for quite a considerable time.  I am glad there is now legislation before the House which will endeavour to solve the problems which existed and created uncertainty and confusion in the past.  I wish the Minister well with the Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>However, in dealing with the Bill there are quite a number of comments I want to make and quite a number of suggestions I propose to make to the Minister.  I suppose it is important to go off the deep end first. When mergers take place institutional freedom is very important to our trade union movement and in a merger a major union should have a decision-making executive here in Ireland.  With the broad base that now exists it is important that we should retain here this element of authority.  We should not be dictated to and we should not be in a position where any outside group, whether it is in France or Germany or Britain <Col N="56" /> or elsewhere, could dictate to our workers here.  I know this is a thorny problem and one on which one could be misinterpreted.  Possibly the Minister may not like to reply on this aspect if he feels it would create an erroneous impression in the minds of some members.  Nevertheless, it is important that it should be mentioned.</P>
    <P>In many cases we have foreign-based unions with decision-making executives abroad who may accept one rate while the workers here are seeking another rate.  In many ways and at many times this can put the Irish workers at a great disadvantage.  The attitude of the trade unions on the Continent and elsewhere, following our entry into the EEC, if mergers take place with unions with decision-making executives outside Ireland, can cause quite a considerable problem because what is acceptable to Continental workers and others might not be acceptable to Irish workers.</P>
    <P>Therefore, it is necessary and desirable to have some attention paid to this problem.  Moneys are being voted in this House and we must ensure that, in the event of a merger, our trade union officials will not become redundant while officials will be planted in superior positions in Paris or in London or elsewhere.  It is most important that when we vote money for mergers or amalgamations some consideration should be given to this aspect.</P>
    <P>The Minister dealt with the number of trade unionists on the Continent and he dealt with the situation in our own country and with the number of trade unions representing workers in various firms such as CIE, Guinness, and others.  When we examine the position here as against the German system or the systems in the other Continental countries we find a marked difference.  It is desirable that the trade union movement as a whole should take a good hard look at this legislation. Those who felt in the past that they had reason to give thought to the question of mergers should now give comprehensive thought to this matter and take into consideration the various matters the Minister has outlined to ensure that a more effective organisation <Col N="57" /> is obtained, the utilisation of skilled negotiators whom some of the major unions have at their disposal and participation in some of the progressive educational schemes and the various other schemes operated by the larger unions which are not available to members of the smaller unions.  In the smaller unions we have many Irish workers who may wish to avail of the opportunities that are available in the larger unions.  On that basis it is certainly to their advantage to consider the Minister's comments.</P>
    <P>More effective bargaining power is another factor and I am quite positive it will weigh the balance from time to time in negotiations on amalgamations or mergers to ensure that they will have a say and that there will be continuity and a better service.  Since we have entered the EEC we will be operating on a much wider base than previously.  For that reason it is necessary and desirable to give thought to change at this time in a world in which there are changes in attitudes in relation to materials, trades, higher degrees of efficiency and specialisation.  The electronic and engineering fields particularly require highly skilled negotiators and a pooling of resources we have not had in the past. That is not in any way degrading the various councils and groups who have come together to negotiate. Some of them have negotiated in a very effective and sound way.  Nevertheless, something more is required.  I think this Bill will meet, in some way, the many problems existing and make way for a new and improved trade union organisation.</P>
    <P>We are well aware also that changes in motivations and materials mean that there are diminishing numbers in some of the smaller unions.  They are now giving consideration to an improved situation for their workers.  They have the problems of the worker and his future at heart.  They are considering burying their identity and moving into an area where they will have available to them facilities that some of the larger trade unions can offer.</P>
    <P>The position of the emigrant <Col N="58" /> workers has not been mentioned here, how they will fit into the new set-up, whether or not their unions will be acceptable in any way to those of continental countries, what way they can operate and if they can merge with those foreign unions. Perhaps the Minister could clarify this situation.  It may not be completely applicable to this Bill.  Nevertheless, from some discussions I have had with trade unionists recently, people believe that some clarification is necessary.</P>
    <P>The Minister has already said that under the previous Bill 50 per cent must vote and that there must be a 20 per cent majority.  I am not entirely satisfied with some sections of the present Bill.  In relation to section 3 of the Bill, I feel that the voting procedure should be supervised by an independent body or an officer from the registrar's department.  As we know, officers of unions can influence votes to a large extent.  We know from experience what has happened throughout the country from time to time in relation to voting procedures and important decisions made when one officer could influence voting.  It is the feeling of trade unionists that possibly a postal vote, with an outside auditor or official supervising, might improve the situation.  In addition to the requirements set out in relation to voting, I would suggest that, where an amalgamation or merger is about to take place, a notice should appear in the Press to improve on the vague references in the Bill, such as &ldquo;shall be afforded a fair opportunity of voting&rdquo;. It might well happen that members travelling on maintenance could be a considerable distance away from base and correspondence sent out by the union might not reach them for some time.  For that reason I feel an additional safeguard would be the insertion of a notice in the Press and it would improve the conduct of a ballot on a secret basis.</P>
    <P>The Minister has dealt at some length in his brief with the question of voting procedure which is referred to in section 5 of the Bill.  I feel this section is far too lax.  Section 5 reads:</P>
    <P>Where a vote is taken by a trade <Col N="59" /> union on a resolution to approve an instrument of amalgamation or transfer, a simple majority of the votes recorded shall be sufficient to pass the resolution notwithstanding anything in the rules of the union.</P>
    <P>&ldquo;A simple majority&rdquo; can mean that three out of five people can vote and carry an issue.  I feel this particular rule is far too lax.  Were I to make a decision between that and the previous rule, I would be in favour of the previous one.  I have felt though that the rule governing the voting procedure in the past was far too rigid and tied the unions to a great extent. Somewhere along the line they should be able to handle the situation in which there would be a simple majority of votes recorded.  We know meetings can be called from time to time for voting purposes which will not be convenient to members.  The simple majority can be a very dangerous situation if there is no other requirement. This is another point the Minister should investigate and see whether or not it can be changed and made into something realistic.  I am quite certain that, when the Minister re-examines it, he will see the defect which needs rectification.</P>
    <P>In relation to amalgamation or transfer, I think in the future there should be some insistence that every union have a rule one way or the other.  The registrars should insist that there be a rule of some kind in the rule book in relation to amalgamation to ensure that, prior to any discussion that might take place, members would be fully aware of the situation within their own union.  Some unions have rules dealing with amalgamation. Others have not.  Some have them in great detail.  Were that provision made, members, if they read their rule books, would be fully aware of the problems and demands involved when an amalgamation takes place.  Sometimes it might well happen that a merger or amalgamation would be sprung on members in particular circumstances which would cause people to panic or cause a group of people to accept what is said by one or two individuals.  If it is possible to make a provision in the <Col N="60" /> Bill for amalgamation it will help the situation considerably.  If it is not possible to do it in this Bill, then perhaps it could be done somewhere else; perhaps word can be passed along to the appropriate authority.</P>
    <P>In section 8 certain clarification is necessary.  This is the one mentioned by the Minister in his brief.  In section 8 it says: &ldquo;...the committee of management or other governing body of the transferee union shall, notwithstanding anything in the rules, ...&rdquo; I feel the committee of management should not have absolute power to change the rules.  The Minister will have to give his interpretation of &ldquo;other governing body&rdquo; in order that we may consider this section more fully.  I am not sure what is meant by &ldquo;other governing body&rdquo; or, indeed, to what body it refers.  I am not sure whether it is a special body set up to deal with the matter or one in existence already.  It is very vague and the Minister might clarify the situation so that we can examine this particular section in greater depth and detail.  I feel the alteration of the rules should be the subject of a delegate conference.  Otherwise, a few members can decide on a rule change and this, in itself, is a weakness.  The Minister must take a second look at this matter before Committee Stage.</P>
    <P>Section 9 deals with complaints to the registrar regarding resolutions.  An appeal will lie to the High Court under this section.  Who will pay the costs of such an appeal?  Will it be the person who appeals against the decision, if the appeal goes against him, or will money be made available from some departmental fund?</P>
    <P>In clause (f) of the Schedule it is provided that, on a complaint made under section 9, the registrar may:</P>
    <P>order the trade union to pay to the complainant out of the funds of the union, or the complainant to pay to the union, either a specified sum in respect of the costs incurred by the complainant or the union (as the case may be) or the taxed amount of these costs.</P>
    <P>Does this mean that the complainant will be called upon to pay the costs? Suppose the complainant is unable <Col N="61" /> to pay, how will the matter be treated by the law?</P>
    <P>In section 12 there is a reference to the Minister for Industry and Commerce, with the consent of the Minister for Labour, making regulations. I should have thought we had at last reached the stage at which the Minister for Industry and Commerce should have no function in a matter like this.  Instead of involving the Registrar of Friendly Societies in this &mdash;he is, after all, a very busy man&mdash; a separate organisation should be set up, possibly under the aegis of the Labour Court, to deal with matters appertaining to this legislation.  Such a body as I suggest would make the situation much more flexible for the Minister.  It would be a very desirable departure in my opinion.</P>
    <P>I would ask the Minister to have another look at this to see if it is possible to set up a specific body, a body which could assist in many ways in expediting mergers and assisting trade unions in a general way, particularly from the point of view of obtaining legal advice, and so on.  Competent personnel to advise would be of paramount importance, personnel to whom trade unions would have free access. Such personnel would deal with trade union affairs in a general way in relation to the European Communities and allied matters.  I do not think section 12 as it stands deals adequately with the situation.</P>
    <P>Section 14 deals with grants towards exceptional expenses of amalgamation or transfer.  Some clarification is needed here.  What is meant by &ldquo;exceptional expenses&rdquo;?  Would these be legal expenses, expenses to delegate conferences, travelling expenses, expenses incurred in seeking senior counsel's advice?  Would not &ldquo;reasonable expenses&rdquo; be more appropriate phrasing?  Where mergers are taking place it should surely be &ldquo;reasonable expenses&rdquo;.  That would be less rigid and one would not have to make a case to substantiate &ldquo;exceptional expenses&rdquo;. There is nothing exceptional in the procedure leading up to the amalgamation of trade unions.  &ldquo;Exceptional&rdquo; would connote to me court costs in long drawn-out legal <Col N="62" /> battles.  On the other hand, &ldquo;reasonable expenses&rdquo; would ensure every possible assistance would be there to help mergers to take place.  I would again ask the Minister to consider the wording here.  Is there any reason why it should not be &ldquo;reasonable expenses&rdquo; instead of &ldquo;exceptional expenses&rdquo;?</P>
    <P>Where mergers take place guarantees should be written into the Bill to safeguard officials.  In the event of a merger officials would be prepared to sink their years of membership of another union on the understanding that they would be safeguarded in any merger.  These officials must be fully protected.  There is, too, nothing in the Bill to safeguard officials who may become redundant or lose their employment as a result of amalgamation. This is a very important factor to which the Minister must give consideration. Officials who have given outstanding service in smaller unions, in difficult circumstances and in difficult times and with small resources, must be fully safeguarded and fully compensated.  I can visualise a situation in which an official would be tolerated for a while and then find himself pushed aside into a job to which he did not feel suited or in which he would not be happy.  Safeguarding these officials is of paramount importance.</P>
    <P>I come now to a very important aspect, namely, the merger of two groups or the amalgamation of two or more unions.  In that event if the smaller union entered into the larger body that union, if they have not a political fund, should be regarded as having opted out.  If they decide to opt in as individuals it is an individual choice.  In many cases over the years unions without a political fund have found themselves submerged and in a situation where they would become part and parcel of a larger union with a political fund.  The members of the smaller union should not have to expose themselves when they enter a union by having individually to opt out.</P>
    <P>Smaller unions about to amalgamate should be afforded this opportunity. It may be a problem with some <Col N="63" /> unions; it may mean that some of them might not give the consideration desirable and necessary for the greater effectiveness of the members on the basis that political funds and alignments exist.  If this particular aspect was one of the points to entice some smaller unions to amalgamate a good day's work would have been done.  This matter should be considered seriously by the Minister.  It is a disturbing factor from the point of view of some trade unionists and it may be one of the matters that would impede amalgamation.</P>
    <P>I do not intend to deal with the particular unions or groups of workers that may amalgamate but we have small unions in the city who would be willing, but for small impediments such as I have outlined, to amalgamate.  The opinion has been expressed to me that this is a factor in some cases.  I hope that the rationalisation which the Minister has spoken of will take place as a result of this Bill, which has been delayed for some time.  I hope this Bill will bring about the desired result and that our trade unionists and our work force will be the better of such amalgamations and mergers.  I hope they will have at their disposal highly skilled negotiators and the facilities which are available to the greater power blocs in the trade union movement. In that way I feel sure we can arrive at a situation where the worker will have carved for himself a desirable situation within the trade union structure on a more extensive basis.</P>
    <P>It should be remembered that what is acceptable to German, British or French trade unionists may not be acceptable to their Irish counterparts. The Minister should safeguard Irish trade union officials where mergers take place and where money is voted by this House.  He should do so to ensure that the moneys made available will go to the unions concerned, thereby ensuring that foreign trade unionists would not be able to avail of moneys voted in this House for the purpose of maintaining themselves in superior positions and dictating to our trade unions and industrialists <Col N="64" /> through a back door.  I do not intend this to mean that there should be any division within our trade union organisations.  It is desirable that they work together and proceed together as they have always done.  On this particular aspect the Minister should give some consideration if he sees there is a valid point or a loophole here.</P>
    <P>If the Minister does not wish to comment on this aspect now I will not force him to do so.  I would not like to see a Minister being embarrassed by people outside of this House who would try to interpret, or misinterpret, in their own way statements made by a Minister.  I have no doubt that the statements I have made may be misinterpreted but my contribution is an honest endeavour to ensure that Irish trade unionists will have a reliable institution, an institution of understanding for Irish workers, officials and of the problems that exist.  I am not necessarily referring to British trade unions.  In fact, I have dealt with trade unions on the much wider field now that we have entered the EEC.  There are many factors in relation to the position of our trade unions in the EEC which have not been cleared up.  It may be that foreign unions will come in and that some of our unions will align themselves with such groups.  In that way an undue influence can be forced by certain approaches in order to get a foothold.</P>
    <P>Our trade union officials and workers are to be congratulated on their behaviour and their ability to perform under very difficult circumstances over the years.  They have helped in the development of this nation which has taken place since the early thirties.  The massive progress which has taken place is a credit to our trade unionists.  I trust that when this Bill is passed we will see, with the availability of the services provided by the Minister and the financial assistance provided, that unions will be encouraged to amalgamate. I agree that there is no desire to pressure groups into amalgamation and that this should be a free choice.  I hope this Bill will meet the wishes of Irish trade unionists.</P>

    <Speaker pid="FergusOBrien" hpid="Mr. O'Brien Mr. O'Brien">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Brien</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to support this Bill which is a long time overdue. When we look at the position we see that 400,000 are represented by 100 unions.  Great credit is due to our unions that we have not had more problems when we have this kind of fragmentation.  It is obvious that this Bill is to streamline the trade unions and to ensure that the workers get the maximum benefit from their trade unions.  With this type of fragmentation at present this is not possible.  In the business world we have amalgamation and streamlining so as to obtain the best from the resources.  When that is done the best is also obtained from the workers' resources without necessarily the worker receiving his just reward.  This is possible because the worker is not as well represented as he might be in this highly competitive world.</P>
      <P>With the amalgamation of unions there is no doubt that they will be able to afford the expertise, training and professional services in negotiations on behalf of their workers.  Anything less than that today and the trade unionist is suffering.  It would also result in having more workers' democracy.  At the moment the trade unions may be a little nervous about it and think the time is not ripe.  Possibly the reason the time is not ripe is because of the multiplicity of unions who might be vieing for their own positions on boards.  A smaller number would take care of that.  The introduction of workers' democracy is important and we should continue to do all we can to achieve it.  With greater numbers in unions I can visualise a trade union movement training and educating workers to meet the challenge on the boards.  Possibly the fear might exist that workers on boards might not fulfil their role but proper training would help in this matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Now that we are in the Common Market it is important for a person holding an Irish trade union card that the card should have validity throughout the Community.  There might be greater respect for the card if Continental unions and employers saw a more cohesive unit here.  As years go by there will be greater inter-changeability <Col N="66" /> of workers in the Community and it is important that our trade unionists do not suffer in any way. Amalgamation would help in this area.</P>
    <P>In many cases there are disputes on the basis of lines of demarcation, with one union claiming something to be their right against another union.  In the present highly competitive market we cannot afford this kind of luxury. We must examine our attitudes and ensure there are no impediments so far as production is concerned.  If there were a greater degree of amalgamation in the craft unions it might be a solution, and it would give us a better attitude towards crafts.</P>
    <P>The Minister has spoken about the low rate of contribution paid by the worker for his trade union subscription and I agree with this.  If one pays a very small subscription one cannot hope to get the kind of service needed today.  In the larger firms who have computerised payments they have contributions stopped at source&mdash;in fact, some unions are doing this and it is a considerable help in the collection of funds.  If this were done shop stewards would not be involved in trying to collect contributions and could be more gainfully employed in discussing with management what is happening in firms and ensuring they are kept up-to-date with the affairs of the firms.</P>
    <P>We must have more participation in workers' councils which will play an increasingly greater part in our industries.  If there were fewer unions this could be done with greater efficiency. It is important to have closer liaison between management and workers and this is best done on the shop floor.  The trade unionist must be trained sufficiently to ensure that he is <i>au fait</i> with management and with the economic situation, and that he is able to discuss matters with his employer.  By having this kind of dialogue the trade union movement can play a greater role in wage agreements and in ensuring that the wage agreements are not necessarily based on the cost of living but on productivity agreements.  Managements amalgamate and streamline their operations to ensure greater productivity. If trade unions amalgamate <Col N="67" /> they can come to terms with employers on the basis of productivity deals, ensuring real wage increases for their members.  This is the basis of a real wage increase and it can be done with the sophisticated, modern and forward-looking trade union movement I see in this country in the future.</P>
    <P>Deputy Dowling expressed some fears regarding outside influences in the unions and this point of view is valid.  However, when we consider our trade union movement it is very national and personally I have no fears on that score.  The movement is able to look after itself; it is a question of getting legislation so that the necessary streamlining can be carried out.</P>
    <P>An important point is the incentive that can be offered to the unions and I agree with Deputy Dowling that the charges should be reasonable.  We should give every financial assistance to unions if they want to amalgamate and it should be given in a magnanimous rather than in a tight-fisted way. We are trying to achieve good industrial relations which are even more important now that we are in Europe. They will be vital for our economic development.  We should be concerned not only with the development of a specific industry or with self-interest but with the interests of the nation and the entire trade union movement.</P>
    <P>We have spoken about 400,000 workers and the fact that 100 trade unions represent them.  It is a great tribute to the trade union movement that there have been so few trade disputes when one considers all the negotiations involved.  Amalgamation would mean a reduction in the amount of time spent in negotiations by the various unions.  They could come to the table and hammer out good agreements which could be kept easily.  The national wage agreements have been adhered to very effectively by the trade union movement and great credit is due to the trade union movement but it is important that in future negotiations are carried out at a very high level, that the trade unionist is represented at the table by the best possible people, thereby ensuring <Col N="68" /> that he will get the best possible deal.  Anything less is unworthy of him and would not be doing him justice.  This would cut out much suspicion.  The trade union member would participate more in the trade union movement.  As in most other organisations the few tend to carry the majority.  The provision of training officers, education, the encouraging of members to participate in workers' councils with a view to putting people on boards would make the trade union movement a very lively unit of our society.  It has played a very important role.  It has gone a long way towards ensuring that the industrial arm of our country has come up pretty quickly.</P>
    <P>However, times are changing rapidly and we must move with them. What was good ten years ago is not good any longer.  The trade union movement now must look to its laurels.  There must be a proper organisations and the delegation of authority down to the shop floor.  The trade union movement is a little slow in doing this.  They tend to want to hold the authority at the top.  I suppose this is a natural and human thing but it is a cumbersome thing. They must learn to delegate right down.  By doing this the people at the top will be able to devote much more time to ensuring that the trade union movement becomes progressive.  It tends to be a little on the conservative side at the moment.  It is important that it should break out into a progressive body.  I see this Bill as a first step.  Trade union legislation will obviously require up-dating from time to time to meet the needs of members and of the community.</P>
    <P>I commend the Bill.  I wish to thank the Minister for introducing it.  To date he has proved very efficient and effective, concerned about the Department in which he operates and about the trade union movement, a movement to which we all owe a debt of gratitude. I wish the Minister every success in the future.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMoore" hpid="Mr. Moore Mr. Moore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moore</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Bill.  The Minister in his brief and in the Bill has given a good basis for an examination <Col N="69" /> in a small way of the trade union movement in so far as this House should do so.  It is essentially a matter for the trade union members themselves to perfect their organisation so that they can become a more effective part of our society.  There are many people alive in this country who remember when there had to be a six months strike for people to establish their right to join a trade union.  After that there was a period of agitation and then, perhaps, a period of consolidation. The trade unions are now on the threshold of a new era.  The Minister in this Bill, small as it is, gives some opportunity for the trade union movement to set itself up as a greater instrument for the benefit of their own members, for the economy and for society generally.</P>
      <P>Sixty years after 1913 we still have in some sections of the trade union movement a spirit of protest.  While it is good that it should protest against inequalities, the movement must become much more sophisticated now to play its part in the European concept of trade unionism.  I know the Minister will not suggest that this is a Bill of Rights which Tom Paine, Keir Hardie, James Connolly or Jim Larkin would regard as a major work. It is, however, a most important link between the Government of today and the trade union movement.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am a bit perturbed about trade unions whose bases are not in this country.  I am not being insular.  We cannot afford to be insular now that we are part of the nine nation European Community.  We should try to rationalise our trade union movement so that any union operating here would at least have its headquarters here. When we go abroad to speak with the Germans, the French or the British, we should be able to speak as a purely Irish organisation but a branch of the greater European trade union movement. This would lead to a greater strength for the unions here.  If they were in Brussels or in Strasbourg they would not have to say: &ldquo;We cannot give an answer here because we must go back to our headquarters in London to check on what the next step will be.&rdquo; I am aware that when one joins a community such as the <Col N="70" /> EEC one surrenders some slight part of one's sovereignty.  The same applies to trade union movements.  Because of our membership of the EEC we must look afresh at our whole approach. I know this is not a Bill of rationalisation but one of amalgamation. The Minister, in the major piece of legislation we are promised, should examine this matter very carefully to see to the home bases of the trade union movement and how that can be perfected in the interests of the Irish workers and the people in general.</P>
    <P>The Minister is quite right when he says that the trade union movement is aware that the fact that there are so many unions is a fault in the organisation.  If one wants an object lesson one has only to go back to last week and the corporation strike and put oneself in the position of a housewife in Ballymun with no heat and no cleansing service.  I will not take sides and say whose fault that was but the woman there, trying to rear a family, sees that there are nine trade unions involved.  Six unions agree and then another two unions agree but that woman still has not got heat or a-cleansing service.  Eventually all the unions agree.  We could get around something like this by saying: &ldquo;We have got differences in the unions but let us sort those things out and make sure we do not inflict suffering on people who are in no way involved.&rdquo; Employers must also perfect their organisations so that they will not be found wanting, as they often have been, when they have caused the public suffering.</P>
    <P>The trade unions have made marvellous progress in recent years.  I should like to refer particularly to two of them.  The Transport &amp; General Workers' Union are a magnificent organisation doing work apart from trade unionism.  They are making great efforts to introduce greater expertise into every facet of their organisation. The Workers' Union, a smaller union, in the spirit of their founder Jim Larkin, have succeeded in making themselves into a competent organisation of workers.</P>
    <P>Trade unions will have to be the <Col N="71" /> instrument for ensuring that employers, employers' organisations, industrial and commercial management are efficient.  If we want to ensure that the standard of living of all our people is raised the trade unions have a great role to play.  We must ensure that we have not inefficient management holding back national progress. People are becoming more trade union minded today and they will join trade unions to obtain protection.  I have the greatest respect for the trade union leaders.  I support the Minister wholeheartedly in any efforts he makes to ensure that the trade unions have the necessary wherewithal, whether by Government goodwill or grants, to ensure that their organisation is not split up into a hundred unions.  We should have fewer unions. I am well aware that the Minister cannot force any of the unions to amalgamate.  It would not be wise to try that.  The Minister has shown the goodwill of the Government by this Bill.  Deputy Dowling has shown that the Fianna Fáil Party are behind it, although we may have criticism later in relation to certain aspects of it.</P>
    <P>Every week we see what can happen when there are too many unions.  We had a recent example where some members wanted to leave the particular union they were in and join another one which was not agreed to.  The matter was referred to the Congress of Trade Unions but before they could act on it somebody caused an unofficial strike.  The public would have suffered because a big organisation was on strike.  However, the strike did not last too long.  We will find a more efficient trade union organisation if there is a lesser number of unions.  The onus is on the unions to come together and say that they believe in one big union.  It would be ideal if we had one big union divided into various sectors of craftsmen, semi-skilled, but all members of the one union and holding on to the principles of Larkin and Connolly. Trade unions today are as much a part of the establishment as our political parties.  The era of the trade unions having to fight every inch of <Col N="72" /> the way in order to make any progress has long since gone.  They need no longer have any inferiority complex in regard to their powers or efficiency.</P>
    <P>Sometimes we find unions acting against the common good but one must be careful not to castigate any union before one has all the facts. The Minister might also look at what happens on the amalgamation of unions.  After they have amalgamated we should set other targets and say: &ldquo;Three or four have amalgamated, why not 20 or 30?&rdquo; Let us strive towards amalgamation all the time. Attempts have been made over the years to rationalise the trade union movement.  The Oireachtas can only help by passing certain laws to attract the trade union movement to follow those paths.  The trade unions must be the vanguard of the march towards a greater trade union organisation. We want to show to Europe that the Irish trade union movement is as strong and efficient as it is on the Continent.</P>
    <P>I believe there is a greater spirit of humanity among the trade unions here than one finds elsewhere.  It may be that the background of the people on the Continent is different to ours. Trade unions here strive to protect their workers but on the Continent they may have had more political upheavals. We had to fight here for the right to organise trade unions.  Many days have passed since then and the trade union organisation in this country is a fine organisation with the right ideals.</P>
    <P>The Minister should seek the backing of the trade unions in relation to the scheme of amalgamation and rationalisation.  Before the Bill passes from this House he might have another look at it to see where he could enlarge it.  I do not know what the grants will be to the unions for amalgamation purposes.  I hope the Minister will be generous with them and will examine the possibility of ensuring that any trade union which shows the least sign of wanting to amalgamate will be encouraged to do so.  The Minister will recall that the union of which he was a member, and the one of which I am a member, thought of amalgamating <Col N="73" /> some years ago but nothing happened. It takes a long time to do something like this.  Today the trade unions are aware of the part they played in our history and of the part they have yet to play.  They are also conscious of the part that the European concept will call upon them to play.  I feel they will not be found wanting.</P>
    <P>Deputy Dowling mentioned section 5 which says:</P>
    <P>Where a vote is taken by a trade union on a resolution to approve an instrument of amalgamation or transfer, a simple majority of the votes recorded shall be sufficient to pass the resolution notwithstanding anything in the rules of the union.</P>
    <P>This could be a safeguard to ensure having a more orderly scheme of things in trade union negotiations and decisions. I recall that very often at a trade union meeting when I was a young man&mdash;trade unions were more radical in those days&mdash;there were several ways of defeating something the majority wanted but I feel that at heart every trade unionist wants democracy safeguarded and that is done by the secret ballot on any issue. We must insist that any trade union ballot is a secret one as in the case of our elections.  This is the bulwark of democracy and I think every trade unionist will agree with this.</P>
    <P>In the new scheme of things the trade unions are no longer the rebels that they were.  They have gone beyond that and have emerged with a magnificent organisation and are able to cope with any problems which may arise.  I hope that in the 1970's the trade unions will assume the role of watchdog ensuring by their activities and their criticism that management and captains of industry are efficient and that concerns are run as a medium of sharing the national wealth and distributing it more equitably than at present.  Those who work in offices and factories may well have to assume that role to ensure that management is efficient; otherwise there may be no jobs left in these concerns.</P>
    <P>Broadly speaking, I assure the Minister that the Bill has my support and I welcome it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Labour (Mr. M. O'Leary)</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Deputies for their support of this measure and assure them that any constructive and useful amendments will be seriously considered by me.  Consultations are still continuing with some of the interests involved.  One of the anticipated results of legislation of this kind is that it will at least remove legal impediments in the way of unions which organise similar categories of workers coming together.  It will be for the amalgamating unions to provide the structure that will protect the freedom of the individual within the larger unit.  While the larger unit may give greater efficiency the fear has been expressed that individual freedom might suffer, this freedom which it is said individuals have where a large number of unions cater for a specific category of workers, freedom to move from one union to another.  I think that is a specious form of freedom and that the real interests of union members are better served when proper structures are installed in the larger unit.</P>
      <P>The figures are given of the number of members covered by one union in CIE and the other companies, Gouldings and so on, where you have 21,000 workers in 33 unions in CIE and 11,000 workers in 21 unions in the ESB.  The illustration is far more telling on the craft side because if you take the ESB the majority of general workers are organised in one or two unions but the craftworkers are in a great variety of unions.  The same applies to Gouldings and CIE and all the larger companies and you have the problem of a large number of unions organising a small number of workers in a similar category.  This is particularly marked in the craft area.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Dowling mentioned the question of cross-Channel unions and spoke of the possible embarrassment that could be caused by observations in this area.  As he knows, this is an area of great controversy and represents a great deal of difficulty for the trade union movement in this country. In common with the Canadian trade union movement and a few other territories abroad, we have the problem <Col N="75" /> of our workers being organised in head offices situated abroad.  It is fair to say that a great deal of authority remains with the Irish members of a union which has its national executive authority in Britain, but any changes of the kind mentioned by Deputy Dowling in this area would involve great difficulty for the trade union organisation in this country, organised as it now is on a 32-county basis.  If a great number of union members in Northern Ireland are in unions with head offices in Britain there are obvious difficulties in the way of changing that state of affairs by any legislation on this side of the Border.  This and any other legislation, if it is to be helpful to trade unionists, must be on a free and voluntary basis without being imposed.  Any thought on the matter will show the difficulties that lie in the way of any legal changes that are not sought by the trade union movement.</P>
    <P>Deputy Dowling also spoke about reasonable expenses and mentioned that section 14 referred to exceptional expenses.  The reference to &ldquo;exceptional&rdquo; here relates to expenses arising out of amalgamation of unions and reasonable expenses are what is intended by &ldquo;exceptional&rdquo; in this case. That is the legal description of the kind of work involved in amalgamation.</P>
    <P>I think it was also Deputy Dowling who spoke of the Department of Industry and Commerce being involved with the registrar but, fortunately or otherwise, the registrar in a creature of the Department of Industry and Commerce and he is the person who works with friendly societies and that is how the connection with Industry and Commerce arises in this legislation.</P>
    <P>The Deputy also mentioned wrong result arising in trade union ballots and spoke of the necessity for supervision by the Registrar of Friendly Societies or his office in the actual ballot.  But there is a clearly set out complaints procedure in this legislation whereby anybody can raise questions relating to the propriety of the ballot with the Registrar of <Col N="76" /> Friendly Societies and to me this would seem to be ample to ensure that any injustice that could possibly occur could be avoided.  We could look into the matter but, as drafted, it seems to me the procedure is there to avoid the kind of situation the Deputy fears might arise.</P>
    <P>As regards the political levy on amalgamation, I often feel this matter is exaggerated, understandingly enough.  Some Deputies might feel that it is an area which should have nothing to do with union activities.  In defence, one must record that the amounts of money spent by trade unions on political affairs are published. The most worrying aspect about this political expenditure is the secret funds which are available to people fighting elections.  One of the greatest tragedies in terms of running elections in the 1960s was the lifting of the ceiling of expenses.  This is by way of an aside because Deputy Dowling raised the question of political levies paid for by trade unions.  In some cases these levies do not amount to a great deal, certainly nothing, one suspects, by contrast with what is available from private business to candidates representing their particular business viewpoints.</P>
    <P>Deputy O'Brien raised the question of education and training.  It is very much in the interests of the members concerned that there be adequate education and training programmes. This is not possible where a union is too small.  These services cannot be available because the union is not wealthy enough and does not have the staff to give the appropriate education services to its members.  I am anxious to help the Irish Congress of Trade Unions in any way I can by financing an adequate education programme for their members.  I should like to see a comprehensive programme devised for the entire trade union movement rather than have it given out in bits and pieces to this limited programme or that limited programme. Size is one of the necessary elements in running any decent service for trade union members in today's conditions.</P>
    <P>The Bill does not refer to the question of members of European unions. To my knowledge, there is not any <Col N="77" /> great agreement between unions whose countries are members of the EEC on this matter.  There is a growing tendency for unions to gather into trade federations.  They have not yet reached the point of development whereby there is membership transfer in different countries.  That is one of the advantages of membership of a union which has the majority of its members in Britain.  There is transferability in certain trades between here and Britain.  This does not apply between other member countries of the EEC.</P>
    <P>Deputy Dowling referred to the cost of appeals to the High Court under section 9 (12).  It is not envisaged that there will be many complaints to the registrar under this section because the Bill, as I said previously in relation to complaints about fears of voting procedures, lays down clearly defined procedures.  There would be very few occasions when there would be an appeal on a point of law to the High Court arising from a decision of the registrar.  The provisions in this Bill relating to the appeal to the High Court are more or less similar to the provisions in other legislation of this kind.</P>
    <P>The reference to &ldquo;simple majority&rdquo; in section 5 was regarded as too loose.  The purpose of the Bill is to simplify what were formerly very cumbersome procedures.  If these procedures did not take away the will to amalgamate on the part of the unions interested in this step, they at least made it very difficult.  Our intention was to make this more simple and the expression &ldquo;simple majority&rdquo; appears to fulfil that purpose.  It is up to the trade unions concerned to see that there is no laxity in the implementation of section 5.</P>
    <P>On Committee Stage we will be able to see what could be done to improve this Bill.  This legislation relates to industrial relations.  It does not attract great interest and yet it is this type of legislation which represents the most important things we can do to improve industrial relations today.  It is based on the idea that unless there is a will on the part of the unions to come together, little <Col N="78" /> progress can be made.  The law should encourage those who are willing to amalgamate to do so.  The State should provide any funds necessary to take steps towards this end.  We have a great many unions covering too few workers in particular areas. This requires on their part a coming together to ensure that there is full communication which is very important in any case of dispute.  Every union member should know what is going on.  The basis of any union amalgamation is this: whatever about difficulties in the craft or skilled area, which is the area of most acute difficulty, it could be said that little advance will be made until the unions come together.  We cannot claim there are any problems from abroad.  Our problems are at home and they are historic and traditional.  It is very important that the unions should be able to come together.  The number of the unions involved is relatively large.  The problems of lack of communication are not as acute in the smaller unions catering for fewer workers in the craft area.  Nevertheless, this legislation has been considered necessary and will, I trust, help those who are thinking of amalagamation.</P>

    <Title>Food Standards Bill, 1974: Second Stage.</Title>
    <Speaker pid="MarkAClinton" hpid="Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries (Mr. Clinton) Mark A. Clinton">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries (Mr. Clinton)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>This Bill is designed primarily to enable this country to accept, where appropriate, international food standards drawn up by the Codex Alimentarius Commission.  It will also provide an appropriate means of implementing EEC directives in the food sector and, where occasion requires, of prescribing mandatory national food standards for certain products.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should like to begin by saying something about the Codex Alimentarius Commission and its work.  This body was established in 1962, under the auspices of the United Nations, to <Col N="79" /> draw up international food standards with the objectives of protecting the health of consumers and ensuring fair practices in the food trade.  Over 100 countries, including all the members of the EEC, are members of the commission. The codex ailmentarius will eventually include standards for all the principal foods, whether processed or raw, and will also provide for related matters such as food hygiene, food additives, pesticide residues and the labelling and presentation of food. Already more than 60 standards covering a wide range of foods have been adopted by the commission as recommended international standards and submitted to member Governments for acceptance.  Over 100 more are at various stages of drafting.</P>
    <P>These standards are drawn up according to a 10-step procedure and Governments are given the opportunity of making comments and proposing amendments at several stages. With this in view a national codex committee was established in 1969 to advise the Government on all matters relating to food standards drawn up by the commission.  The committee includes representatives of Government Departments, the State Laboratory, the Institute for Industrial Research and Standards, An Foras Talúntais, consumer interests and the various sectors of the food industry, under the chairmanship of an officer of my Department. The committee are operating very effectively and devote particular care to standards at an advanced stage of preparation.  A number of standards adopted by the Codex Alimentarius Commission incorporate amendments proposed by the Irish delegation on the advice of the national codex committee. I should remark at this stage that the committee saw, and agreed with, the draft heads of this Bill before their submission to the Government.</P>
    <P>Standards adopted by the commission are circulated to Governments for acceptance.  A Government which accepts a standard in full undertakes that&mdash;subject to normal economic controls&mdash;a product which conforms to the standard will be permitted to be distributed freely within its territory <Col N="80" /> under the name and description laid down in the standard and that products not complying with the standard will not be permitted to be so distributed.  There is also provision for limited forms of acceptance.</P>
    <P>The Government regard it as essential that Ireland should be in a position to accept and implement codex standards where appropriate, but no statutory framework for such acceptance at present exists.  There is world-wide interest in the commission's work and the non-acceptance by this country of standards which had gained wide acceptance internationally could suggest, however erroneously, that our food products were inferior to those of other countries.  This could have a detrimental effect on our export trade. In addition, we might come to be regarded internationally as a convenient dumping-ground for sub-standard products, a development which could have serious consequences for our trade and for public health.</P>
    <P>We and other EEC member nations are adopting a co-ordinated approach to the acceptance of these standards. The Community itself is engaged in framing standards for food products and is concerned to see that these coincide as far as possible with the worldwide codex standards which will govern trade with third countries.  I, therefore, envisage that any EEC directives in the food sector will be implemented by regulations under this Act, so that the whole body of our food standards laws will be found within the one framework.  Such regulations will, of course, fall to be reviewed in the normal way by the Joint Parliamentary Committee on the Secondary Legislation of the European Communities.</P>
    <P>Having outlined the background, I now turn to the text of the Bill.  Deputies will observe that this is basically an enabling measure which would allow any one of three Ministers to prescribe food standards and to provide for their enforcement.  The reason for the involvement of three Ministers is that some commodities fall within the competence of my Department and others within that of the Minister for Industry and Commerce, <Col N="81" /> while the Minister for Health is concerned with some special aspects, and especially with food hygiene and food additives.</P>
    <P>Section 1 contains definitions and does not call for any special comment. Section 2 provides power for the making of food standards regulations by the Minister concerned.  It also sets out the principal matters which will usually be provided for in a standard and the restrictions on the manufacture, distribution and sale of food which regulations may contain.  It further provides for consultation with interested organisations before regulations are made.</P>
    <P>Section 3 provides for notice in a national daily newspaper not less than two months before the making of any regulations.  Section 4, which is similar to a provision of the Health Act, 1947, would empower the Ministers by regulation, as appropriate, to bring food supplied in various classes of establishments&mdash;schools, hospitals, hotels and so forth&mdash;within the scope of the legislation.</P>
    <P>Section 5 deals with the enforcement of regulations made under section 2.  It lists the categories of officers who may be empowered to enforce the regulations and sets out the powers they may be given, including powers of entry on and inspection of premises, sampling and seizure of food, and so on.  It provides for the analysis of samples taken and for the certificate resulting from such analysis being evidence in court proceedings under the Act.  An important provision designed to protect confidential trade information is contained in subsection (4).</P>
    <P>Section 6 provides for the disposal of food seized by officers enforcing the regulations.  It is relevant to remark here that by no means all food which infringes regulations under the Act is likely to be seized.  The more usual course for minor infringements of the regulations would be a prosecution for an offence under subsection (5) of section 2.  In cases where food is seized it may be destroyed only if the owner agrees or if the District Court so orders.  There is provision for compensation where the court is not satisfied that the food should have <Col N="82" /> been seized and where the owner has suffered expense or loss as a result of the seizure.</P>
    <P>Section 7 introduces certain presumptions designed to simplify legal proceedings arising out of the regulations. It also provides a defence for a person who has in good faith dealt in sub-standard food if he can show that he had a warranty from some other person that the food complied with the regulations.</P>
    <P>This warranty may take various forms, such as a statement in an invoice or on the label of a carton of food.  I have felt it necessary to limit this defence in the case of imported food so that the importer becomes liable for the manufacturer's warranty. This is to ensure that where an offence is committed there will be a defendant within the jurisdiction.  If sub-standard food could be imported under the warranty of a person outside the jurisdiction, home manufacturers would obviously be at a disadvantage.</P>
    <P>The remaining sections, dealing with offences, penalties, consultation, annulling of regulations, expenses and short title are in standard form and do not call for any special comment. I shall be glad to hear any comments that Deputies may wish to offer and I shall consider on Committee Stage any amendments they may have to put forward.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GerardCollins" hpid="Mr. G. Collins Mr. G. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the introduction of the Second Stage of this Bill by the Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries.  If it could be termed a fair criticism by me, I would have welcomed it 12 months or so ago had it been introduced in the House then.  I do not think it necessary for me to comment at any length on the codex alimentarius or, indeed, the national codex committee.  Everybody who has read the Bill and who will have had an opportunity now of reading the Minister's introductory statement will see that this piece of legislation we are enacting is very necessary.  If this country did not agree with the standards of the commission which are accepted internationally, <Col N="83" /> as the Minister very rightly pointed out the opinion could be wrongly held that our food products were inferior to those of other countries. If this opinion were held certainly it would have a bad effect on our export trade.  This is something against which we must safeguard at all times.</P>
      <P>With regard to the text of the Bill itself, section 1 does not call for any real comment.  In referring to section 2 the Minister said that provisions were made for regulations governing composition and quality of food.  But no mention is made of nutritional value.  Composition and quality may or may not include nutritional value. By that I mean that a food label could show a list of ingredients with no bearing on nutritional value whatsoever. I feel provision should be made in the Bill for nutritional value, especially as this is becoming a fairly hot topic amongst consumers in other countries.  I am sure it will be a matter of time only before Irish housewives scan labels for a declaration of nutritional value.  I would ask the Minister to take a look at this question between now and Committee Stage.  I feel there is something to be said for its strengthening this legislation.</P>
      <P>Section 3&mdash;again according to the Minister's speech&mdash;provides for notice in the national daily newspaper not less than two months before the making of any regulations.  With regard to the phrase &ldquo;not less than&rdquo; could the Minister say that two months' notice would be given or, perhaps, in cases where it might be necessary, that four months or, indeed, six months notice be given? Perhaps the Minister would consider that point.  Two months might not be sufficient.  As I have said, four months, or, indeed, six months' notice would be required for specific reasons.</P>
      <P>In his brief the Minister said:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Section 4, which is similar to a provision of the Health Act, 1947, would empower the Ministers by regulation, as appropriate, to bring food supplied in various classes of <Col N="84" /> establishments&mdash;schools, hospitals, hotels and so forth&mdash;within the scope of the legislation.</P>
    <P>On reading section 4 of the Bill, as circulated, I must confess I found it confusing and a bit hazy.  I should like to know why hospitals, schools and so on are singled out for special regulation while there is no mention of other eating places, such as factory canteens and the like.  Is this whole section aimed at tightening up institutional feeding?  Perhaps the Minister could tell us what type of regulations will be made under this section? Food in the true sense is not sold in many schools.  For example, in boarding schools it is part of the overall package.  Food, education, heating, shelter are all covered by a blanket fee.  Perhaps the Minister, in replying&mdash;or anybody else offering in this debate&mdash;could enlarge on that particular matter.</P>
    <P>Again, the Minister said:</P>
    <P>Section 7 introduces certain presumptions designed to simplify legal proceedings arising out of the regulations.  It also provides a defence for a person who has in good faith dealt in sub-standard food if he can show that he had a warranty from some other person that the food complied with the regulations.</P>
    <P>I am glad it is felt necessary to limit this defence in the case of imported food so that the importer is liable for the warranty.  I think the Minister is very wise in having somebody within the jurisdiction of the courts answerable to the courts for any defect there might be on labels or anything else that might be wrong.</P>
    <P>Those are a few points I wanted to make and I should be grateful if the Minister would enlarge on them when replying.  I would hope that we might have an amendment on Committee Stage on the question of the two months' period if possible to have that extended to four months.  It may or may not be necessary for the time being.</P>
    <P>The Bill itself is a good one.  In fairness, everything that should be done to protect the consumer, the general <Col N="85" /> public and particularly the housewife from much of the present day high pressure sales gimmickry with which, unfortunately, we have to live must be done.  Anything that can be done to outline, in very plain language and in great detail, the content of whatever a person is buying, whatever is wrapped up or packaged with regard to quality and quantity is very desirable. We have to be very careful, indeed, particularly in the food industry, to do everything possible to protect the consumer.</P>
    <P>There has been tremendous development in food technology in recent years.  This very big industry, always seeking to put before the general public a multiplicity of foods, whether in jars, tins or containers of one kind or another, is serving an extremely useful purpose.  It enables those who live in urban areas particularly to enjoy a variety of foods.  The food industry, with its great complexity; with its research and experiments of various kinds inevitably brings problems in both advantages and disadvantages.</P>
    <P>I shall leave the subject of chemical substances added to food to subsequent speakers but additives are something about which we have to be very careful.  The nutritive values of foods should be clearly stated in terms of protein, fat content, calorific value, mineral value and carbohydrate content. Consumers are now anxious to know the various values of the foods they eat.  Jams are high in calorific value, though they may contain small quantities of sulphur dioxide depending on the method of fruit preservation used.  Cheese is a very valuable food.  It has a high calorific value as well as a protein value.  Tomatoes contain numerous vitamins and minerals. Consumers like to know the various values of the foods they eat so that they may enjoy a more balanced diet. Frozen peas have a higher vitamin and protein content than canned peas. In the United States it is common practice now to serve vitamin fortified foods.</P>
    <P>We are all anxious to ensure that the consumer is protected to the fullest extent possible; it is a difficult job in <Col N="86" /> this modern technological age, but everything possible must be done to provide full consumer protection.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JustinKeating" hpid="Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. Keating) Justin Keating">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. Keating)</NameTxt>
      <P>I intervene in this debate for a number of reasons; in terms of my own interest and feelings&mdash;less important&mdash;and as one of the other Ministers of the three involved in the application of this legislation, if it passes, as it seems from the expression of welcome it has had from the Opposition, it will pass without too much contention, I have an involvement.  I must also declare an interest both as a veterinary surgeon and as someone with a training in physiology and biochemistry because, of course, some of the maintenance of food standards in regard to meat and livestock in the past has been the responsibility of my profession and I am proud of my profession's role in this area.  Also, I admit to a very considerable interest of a personal kind in the matter of food quality.</P>
      <P>To begin with, we have, I think, to recognise that with every passing year the need for legislation of this type increases precisely because the complexity of the food industry increases.</P>
      <P>At a time when all of the food consumed in a particular home was produced within a few miles of that home, whether it was meat or whether it was vegetables, and there was no elaborate processing, apart from smoking, salting or pickling there were no problems.  There was no deep-freeze.  There was no method of prolonged storage.  We were not getting things from the opposite ends of the world.  It was not a question of colour.  It was not a question of shelf life.  There was not an immensely complex marketing pool which now embraces the whole world.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>At that particular time the need for protection was much less because the commercial pressures producing inferior quality were much less but, as the food processing industry becomes world-wide, the need for increasing consumer protection legislation becomes every day a greater need.  We ought to pause for a <Col N="87" /> moment in thinking of legislation of this kind to ponder on just how world-wide the food industry is. There is not a continent whose food we do not expect routinely to get, even in relatively small areas of habitation, even in villages, and there is hardly a country whose specialist products we do not expect to get; from the original pickling, salting and smoking, the range of mechanisms for preservation which now exist is enormous and increasing all the time even with radio-active treated food possibly becoming an article of consumption. Add that to freeze drying, deep freezing, bottling, canning and the whole gamut of preservation techniques. Then we have the phenomenon that foods are not sold now entirely as a pure piece of meat, or a pure piece of wheat, or a pure piece of cabbage but as mixtures of all these things in very complex packs, even in packs that consist of whole meal with bits of this and that, from the beginning through the different courses to the end, sold as a single industrial product.  So we have this ever-continuing complexity and we have extremely great commercial pressures of all kinds.</P>
    <P>I want to say a word now about the question of additives because to some extent, I regret to say&mdash;I will amplify this&mdash;one sees a systematic debasing of natural human taste in food by commercial pressures.  I will give some examples.  It is well that the public should be aware of this process and know what is going on. In the different categories of things which may contaminate food there is a category of things which are deliberately added somewhere along the production chain in order to increase the commercial attractiveness of the product.  Many sorts of colouring would fall into this category because the public think, if the thing is pure white, or bright green, or bright red, it is somehow better and we need education, which we have in the basic sciences, to convince people that this sort of prettying-up is very often not alone not producing an improvement but is actually producing a disimprovement. <Col N="88" /> There are, of course, careful regulations in regard to what colours may be used.</P>
    <P>Deputy Collins gave the example of sulphur-dioxide which is very widely used, not as a colourant but as a preservative.  At certain levels it is quite all right but at certain levels it is not all right.  Some of the nitrates used in meat preservation can be changed into nitrites <i>et cetera.</i> There are all sorts of complex chemical changes taking place in food and things that start off perfectly safe may end up as being unsafe.  Things like sulphur-dioxide which at certain levels are perfectly safe, correct and normal to use, at other levels may be unsafe.</P>
    <P>Indeed, the unscrupulous manufacturers may use either preservatives or anti-oxygenant or colours or various products which have not been checked out for their long term effects.  In the past and this was world-wide, we biochemists and psychologists, and people concerned with the actual chemical workings of the body, have been much too light-hearted.  They have carried out tests on a few hundred mice for a year or two years but we do not live for a year or two years.  Things are going into children which may have effects 50, 60 or 70 years later.  We have been much too optimistic in the past on the basis of short-term tests and small numbers of animals and a vastly greater amount of caution is used on the part of those carrying out biological tests than there was a decade ago.  They are much more reluctant to say with certainty that such-and-such a thing is perfectly safe.</P>
    <P>We have had all sorts of examples of things that turned out not to be safe.  I am not trying to spread alarm because the standards, world-wide, are rising continuously.  The extent of the danger is being recognised ever more and a Bill of this kind is an important step although it is by no means the end of the road in the question of food quality control.  There have been mistakes, there have been errors of judgment and worse than that.  We have also got the circumstances not just of the food industry becoming <Col N="89" /> more complex but the effect of the increasing complexity of the economy of the whole world has a bearing on food in ways that do not seem obvious to us.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries and Deputy Collins, mentioned the question of farm chemicals for treating seeds, killing weeds and killing insects.  The farm chemical industry is now a huge industry with immense research but all of these things can get into foodstuffs and can do damage.  Again, in the fairly recent past, we have been too lighthearted as to what was safe.  Thalidomide is a long way from food and I do not wish to spread alarm.  I recognise that there are ever more rigorous standards and it is right that this should be so, because the mistake of thalidomide was with a drug for human use and it is a mistake that will echo down the decades.</P>
    <P>As a biochemist and one who has been involved in organising trials for veterinary products I am aware that in the past there has been the attitude: &ldquo;Sure it is not for human beings; it is for animals, or for plants or for killing insects so it is not quite so dangerous.&rdquo; We have this process of accumulation.  We have seen people recently killed in Japan from mercury poisoning, mercury coming from the environment.  We see the pollution of the oceans with all sorts of heavy metals.  We see the pollution of bits of the environment with radioactive products as a result of nuclear tests.</P>
    <P>We have had the situation that a person putting pesticide on a field feels that by the time the plants grow, and by the time all these processes go on, it will be so diluted that it could not possibly do any harm.  There is the same argument in regard to radio-active products and heavy metals, like mercury, which can be poisonous. What people forget is that living systems, and what we eat are living systems&mdash;we have not got to the stage of having synthetic foods yet&mdash;concentrate the products.  There are plants, shellfish and fish of all kinds. We have a food chain and we may see enormous concentrations in certain areas.  Fish in US rivers were producing <Col N="90" /> high levels of some of the weed killers.  The water which flowed from the weed killer-treated land or the insecticide-treated land into the river had a very low level but the fish gathered this stuff up and the people who ate the fish received quite a blast out of it.</P>
    <P>One has to remember the whole complexity of the economy, whether it is industry or agriculture, the whole barrage of the powers in the chemical industry, and they are very beneficial powers because we could not carry the world's population at its present level without these products, and I am not decrying them, but because they exist and are used so widely we have to have an ever-growing public awareness. We have to have the sort of regulations produced by the codex alimentarius and the sort of standards of which this Bill will permit the introduction.</P>
    <P>We have also to make reference to the business of advertising in the food area.  I regret to say that we have a small number of people promoting food by saying things that are not true.  While more and more of our young people will have sufficient scientific knowledge to know that they are not true and, therefore, the advertising, far from causing people to buy the product will turn them off it, we still have a large number of people who can be hoodwinked.</P>
    <P>As a veterinarian and a dairy farmer I am disposed to be pro-butter and anti-margarine.  That is my prejudice and I am declaring it.  Margarine is produced by very big combines which are very rich while butter is produced by the products of separate farmers going into the co-operative creameries throughout the world who do not have the big budgets.  We have had a huge world-wide campaign to suggest that in some mysterious way that if you eat margarine you did not get heart dissease in the same way as you would if you eat butter.  We have been told that margarine is better for us from a health point of view.  There is a great deal of evidence that butter is better but it is produced by scientists working in universities who do not get the publicity.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="91" /> The margarine lobby has been less than frank.  There is some evidence to show that one who eats some of the margarines has a lower cholesterol level and one will not have heart disease but there is also evidence the other way.  It is not a simple question and there is the distortion of the truth about food quality often in semiexplicit ways as has been done by the margarine lobby.  They have been rich enough to pay reputable scientists but it is possible to get the arguments on both sides and these arguments should be stated.</P>
    <P>There is a product widely advertised which suggests that if one gets some glucose quickly into the body in some mysterious way one's recovery after illness is hastened but if one eats a piece of potato or a piece of bread it is very rapidly broken down into glucose anyway.  In some cases this happens within seconds.  This is misleading the public in the special value of a food product which comes as the end product in digestion anyway when one eats carbohydrates.  That is misleading people and is not quite honest. Twenty years ago we had the weight of advertising telling people about the mysterious health-giving qualities of whiteness.  Somehow or other if a thing was made very white or clear or pure it was better for the individual but this stopped when it was discovered that the bleaching of flour with agene produced a poison.  That was found and stopped but not by the people bleaching the flour.  It was found by animal experiments to discover why these forms of hysteria occurred.</P>
    <P>There are many examples in the history of the food industry of people light heartedly going in because a thing looked whiter, cleaner or purer. We have to stop the type of advertising which says that whiter is healthier or clearer is healthier.  We have to get people to accept that quality often means a minimum of treatment and not a maximum of treatment.  It should be left alone as much as possible, not coloured, bleached or whitened.  The less natural the product the worse it is but <Col N="92" /> there has been a brainwashing of the public.</P>
    <P>There has also been a brainwashing of the public in some obscure way about super-cleanliness.  For example, we have had the phenomenon which permitted the widespread use of antibiotics in animals and humans. Using antibiotics on new-born babies was simply a mechanism for producing antibiotic-resistant strains of organisms which were then dangerous contaminants of the environment.  In recent decades we have seen the widespread and uncontrolled use of antibiotics on farm animals, often not to cure disease but, if one could believe the advertising, to prevent it.  It did not prevent it but it produced a widespread occurrence of drug-resistant strains of organisms which are a potential health hazard to humans.  Salmonella organisms which cause food poisoning are an example.</P>
    <P>The commercial pressures which tend to debase quality are enormous. I do not suggest this Bill is the end of the process&mdash;it is an early part of it.  There is the dreadful, dishonest approach used with regard to slimming foods.  If a person consumes more calories than he uses he puts on weight but there are people advertising all kinds of foods which suggest a person can eat them without getting fat no matter how much he eats. That is not true.  This kind of approach confuses the public.  We must get around to the question of honest advertising of food as well as the matter of guaranteeing quality.</P>
    <P>We see as a worldwide phenomenon, but most of all in the developed countries, the health food movement. Often this is based on mysticism without scientific basis but at least those concerned with the movement are telling people where they can get simple, pure foods that are not messed up, with some guarantee as to the quality.  That part of the health food movement is a benevolent and necessary one but, generally, the movement is for a small number of people who are already interested in food and the products cost a little more.  The task of a Government is not to look out for those who can <Col N="93" /> spend a little more on expensive foods but to protect the wider sections of the community because they are the people who are most susceptible to brainwashing by advertising that is not honest and are most in need of protection.  I am not suggesting all advertising is dishonest.  I have given some examples where there was dishonest advertising but there is plenty that is not.</P>
    <P>We are moving towards highly processed foods, with complete meals at one end of the spectrum.  Through advertising immense pressures are brought to bear on human taste.  It looks as if people can be manipulated as to the kind of foods they should enjoy eating, which is rather depressing. We must remember that since we live the three score years and ten and, to some extent, that we are what we eat, and especially what we eat when we are little when our metabolism is rapid, there is a tremendous need as a matter of basic public welfare for the protection of the consumer.  It is a human right to have food that is clean, healthy and not polluted or contaminated or altered unnecessarily.  It is a human right to have food to a standard that will guarantee not alone the absence of disease but the best possible development of the individual.  It is a right that must be protected both by public consciousness and by the law.</P>
    <P>I should like to say a word to three sectors of our food industry because they concern my Department.  They are the manufacturing, the distributing and the retailing sectors.  They could well feel that this is a kind of busybody Bill produced by do-gooders which makes their task more difficult by introducing unnecessary controls and regulations.  I should like to tell all these sectors that not only is this legislation in the interest of the consumer for whom it is primarily intended but it is also in the interests of the three sectors of the food industry.</P>
    <P>If we consider the countries that have developed remarkable specialist food exports, they are the countries that have very high standards on the domestic front.  When there is a highly critical home consumer market there is this tremendous quality.  I shall give two examples of this.  In Scandinavia <Col N="94" /> meat products and crispbreads are exported throughout the world, even though one might think it would be difficult to export crispbreads economically. In France there is the great cultivation of the people with regard to food quality and they have large specialist food exports.  In fact, with cheeses they are able to get three or four times the price obtainable for ordinary, run-of-the-mill cheese.  The amount of milk in unit weight of an ordinary cheese and a highly specialist cheese is the same but one is much dearer than the other because it is a special product. The more cultivated the public taste, the more difficult the legislation, the more the food industry of a country has high standards forced on it, the more it is competitive and able to make its way on the market-place of the world on quality and diversity.</P>
    <P>Far from injuring our food industry legislation will help it.  It will not be applied without ordinary compassion and commonsense.  It will be applied by the three Ministers involved in a reasonable way and in the recognition that one cannot do things overnight. Proceeding with the application of the present <i>codex alimentarius</i> conditions and future conditions in the pipeline is not protecting the consumer at the expense of the manufacturer. I want to emphasise that it is in the interests of the manufacturer also.</P>
    <P>We might consider the shopkeeper who may think that some of these measures are just tiresome rules; the question of inspecting, the potential question of seizing, the investigations to ensure standards are maintained. For an individual on a given day that may be a nuisance but for retailing as a whole, for satisfying the needs of a more sophisticated public, those who welcome this and apply it wholeheartedly are those who will benefit. It is not in conflict with the interests of the distributing or retailing sectors, which is to satisfy to the highest level the wishes and needs of the customers.</P>
    <P>I wish to emphasise again that there will be reasonable understanding in application and implementation&mdash;not latitude or laxity.  There is the recognition <Col N="95" /> that we cannot have enormous changes suddenly or behave in an arbitary or unreasonable way.  However, applying these rules is, beyond doubt or argument, good for the consumer, which in the end means everyone. The producer and the retailer must eat also.  It is also for the producer, the distributor and the retailer who are concerned to ensure that they honourably satisfy the consumer and, secondly, to ensure that in Ireland we have a strong food industry, able to compete in the market-place of the world as well as on the home market. We must be able with truth&mdash;in the long run it is the only real way&mdash;to say to any other nation in the world that our food is as good, and in the vast majority of cases it is better.  We must welcome the most rigorous controls. Otherwise we cannot attain for our food industry the place that, due to the natural quality of our materials, rightly belongs to it.  That is the place of being absolutely in the forefront of the world, being the very best in the world.</P>
    <P>I have dealt with matters that are not related to the small print of the Bill and I have not tried to deal with matters raised by Deputy Collins which are primarily matters to be replied to by the Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries.  I wanted to make some of the points I have made because the wholehearted acceptance and implementation of both the detail and the intention of this Bill is a condition of the health of our food industry.  In the long run our food industry will always be one of the most important strands of our whole economic and industrial growth.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JosephBrennan" hpid="Mr. Brennan Mr. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>Everybody will welcome enthusiastically what is contained in this Bill in so far as it provides the standards to protect the consumer.  Anything the consumer gets by way of protection these days is more than welcome because he does not feel he is getting much protection in the matter of prices.  Quality and quantity are things to which we should certainly turn our minds.  Perhaps the consumer will look on it cynically but as time goes on the effects of the <Col N="96" /> Bill, properly administered, will be seen by him and he will appreciate that it is generally intended to be in his interests.</P>
      <P>The Minister for Industry and Commerce tried to anticipate some of the points that would be made.  While welcoming the legislation and saying that it makes provisions that are necessary it is the duty of an Opposition to point out the dangers inherent in legislation which gives a Minister such wide powers.  On the other side of the House I had occasion a few times to produce legislation that did give the Minister powers which would appear to encroach on the liberty of the individual.  I always had to listen to the most stern warnings from this side of the House and sometimes on Committee Stage to accept amendments which provided certain safeguards. This Bill provides wide powers for all Ministers, not merely the three referred to in the Bill.  Any Minister may appoint inspectors which will mean that there will be a host of inspectors or could be, depending on the commonsense that may be used. So far in this country we have had a fair measure of commonsense applied to the administration of any of the legislation which gave extreme powers if they were to be used in the wrong manner.  Gardaí, customs officers, health inspectors, all types of individuals may become inspectors under the Bill if the Minister so wishes.  All they need is their authority to go in and search premises, see if records are kept, seize food and take it with them, have it brought for analysis, have the culprits brought to court.  I am now taking the extreme view which I am sure will never apply but on Committee Stage we should take a sharp look at all the provisions which give these extreme powers and ensure that there is an equal number of safeguards.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is a provision whereby a person involved in the sale, production, distribution and so on of food for human consumption may find himself in court although it is not his own fault.  The food may be as he found it.  To prove that he bought the food in good faith will be a suitable defence but he will still have <Col N="97" /> been subjected to the embarrassment of being brought into court.  That is only one example.  In the case of a premises which is an establishment prescribed under the legislation, a prosecution may be brought and the food will be held to have been there for human consumption until it is proved otherwise.  For instance, if somebody visiting a hospital brought in sandwiches which were not up to the proper standard the hospital would be held responsible.  If somebody brought into a restaurant ingredients which he used in his tea the restaurant could be held responsible. I only point out those details to emphasise that it is the duty of an Opposition to ensure that the necessary safeguards are included in legislation of this kind and that it is not allowed to pass in such a way that an unscrupulous administration could apply it in a manner which was never intended.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Industry and Commerce made a sort of pedantic speech and referred to many matters which lie within the sphere of dieticians and those qualified in medicine. The Bill, unless it does so by regulation, does not emphasise the importance of having the nutritional and dietary qualities of food marked and certified on packages.  I believe the Bill does provide that that may be done by regulation.  This is one of the things the consumer most needs.  In these days of escalating prices there is a tendency on the part of highly organised producers of food, particularly imported food, to drop quality in order to sustain profits and compete with each other.  This is one of the drawbacks in modern times when production has become so scientific.  I agree that when applied generally this safeguard would not react to the detriment of any producer.  Modern science has provided a great many complexities in distribution, production, packaging and handling of food but it has also provided a great many safeguards. We now have plastic and cellophane packaging which are a great improvement on many types of packaging we had in the past.</P>
    <P>I am not prepared to agree with <Col N="98" /> the Minister for Industry and Commerce when he says that all the changes which have taken place in recent times in relation to food have been on the bad side.  There have been very many improvements. We have beautiful presentation of many goods now but the temptation is always there to overadvertise. The public do not always fall for the over-advertised article.  A little more sanity could be introduced into the type of advertising which strives to show that water made into some type of orange squash will enable you to jump over a nine-bar gate.  I do not believe that people generally take these things too seriously. Some sense could be introduced into the claims that are made on the media, particularly on television. There is competition between two products, one trying to wash whiter than the other.  The result is that people become disillusioned.  Those who are advertising and paying highly skilled agencies to carry out the advertising for them would be well advised to introduce a note of responsibility into their advertising.  The public would then accept their products much more readily.</P>
    <P>Certain advertising creates a resistance in me.  Sometimes in the morning I have to switch off the radio when I hear certain repetitive advertisements coming on, which certainly irk a person trying to shave with a bad blade.  A lot could be done in regard to regulating advertising.  If people took the slightest notice of the exaggerated claims made you would have a serious problem.  People nowadays take many of these advertisements for granted and are not enamoured of the claims made.  Most housewives apply the test of their own experience of the quality of the different products advertised.</P>
    <P>The Bill is most necessary from the hygienic point of view.  We have heard a lot of talk over the years regarding the handling of meat.  Many of us have seen van attendants carrying on their shoulders meat without any wrapping whatever on it.  They just dump it in the butchers' shops.  When the product finally comes on the table it is beautifully cooked and served. <Col N="99" /> The Bill needs to get at the root of hygiene in relation to foods.  I hope I am not becoming irrelevant by referring to a recent Bord Fáilte announcement regarding hotels which are not up to standard in cleanliness. The most unwise thing was to publicise that because it put all the hotels in the same category.  The vast majority of the hotels are very clean. Bord Fáilte should have taken the necessary action to ensure that the few hotels which were at fault improved their premises.  One does not meet the unhygienic things in the diningroom or on the shelves of shops. It is at the source of production or very often in transportation where one meets them.</P>
    <P>This Bill should be able to ensure that the food offered for human consumption is properly handled from the time it is produced to the time it is served on the table.  This requires exceptional powers.  We should try to awaken producers to what should be their duty in relation to hygiene in the production of food.  Some people in this country get very annoyed when foreign journalists come here and write about the things we do but they ignore the fact that we require a little proding to do some things.  In the early days of this State many people were annoyed when legislation had to be brought in to compel egg producers to sell their eggs clean and fresh.  The egg producers felt the legislation interfered with them because it compelled them to sell their eggs clean.  Legislation should really not have been necessary in this case.</P>
    <P>The same also applies to farmers in relation to animal hygiene.  Legislation had to be brought in to compel farmers to treat their animals for warble fly.  Any good farmer should not need to be compelled to do such an essential thing.  We have to legislate to compel the few who will not fall into line to do something which they should do.</P>
    <P>I hope the Minister will ensure that the persons affected in the establishments that will be prescribed by legislation will not have their liberty encroached upon too much.  We should not find them unjustifiably in court <Col N="100" /> defending the sale of food which, as the Bill points out, was sold as the person bought it without being properly certified.  If a shopkeeper sells such goods he can find himself in court.  It is difficult to be able to prove that he received it in that particular manner.  That person's business could be endangered.</P>
    <P>One of the most common sources of deterioration in relation to food is when it is in transit.  If the transport system during the hot, busy season of summer is taking consumable food from A to B and it is supposed to take six to eight hours but takes three days and the food arrives in a deteriorated condition the receiver should not be held responsible.  There should be some means by which, before taking delivery, he can ensure that the goods he receives are fresh.  One can visualise an old people's home, where they are short of staff, and goods are delivered in a back kitchen where some junior takes charge of it.  It may not be up to the standard, which it should have been or was, when first consigned.  In the old days&mdash;and I have painful memories of this from my neighbours in the fish export industry&mdash;whenever the price of fish fell suddenly the consignee refused to collect it until it deteriorated and then reported it as unfit so that he did not have to pay for it.  Often the matter finished up in court.  This was a matter of transport, how long it took to travel, whether it was in good condition when consigned and whether it was collected in time.  A provision in the Bill to protect those handling food and provide a safeguard in that respect would be very useful.</P>
    <P>Our Civil Service, as the law is administered at present, give no cause for worry as regards the power given to them.  These powers are always used with great circumspection and all necessary consideration but there is no guarantee that will always be so. When I was bringing in the Dangerous Substances Act one of the main themes of the Opposition was the excessive powers given to inspectors to descend on premises and examine the property of private individuals and their storage, take records and check <Col N="101" /> books.  That Act has now been two or three years in operation.  It is very good and, indeed, essential and I suggest there has been no single complaint about the powers of officials being abused.  I imagine that could also be said of this legislation but it is necessary to have safeguards to ensure that some Administration would not use the powers unfairly or that there could be even one isolated case where an inspector might act, as has been known to happen, for vindictive reasons and abuse his power by unnecessarily dragging into court some decent citizen for a trivial offence or for something that could not be proved to be an offence at all.  I know the Bill provides for all expenses to be paid by the prosecution where one is wrongly brought to court but that does not take away the humiliation and embarrassment and damage to business that may be caused by a person being brought to court.</P>
    <P>While we must look at the Bill more closely on Committee Stage our duty would be while agreeing in principle with the Bill's provisions and the necessity for it as part of the continuing process of legislation to keep abreast of modern developments, to ensure that legislation does not go too far in interfering with individual rights and encroach unduly on people's privacy.  Many believe that nutritional and dietary qualities of foodstuffs should be honestly indicated as far as possible on the package.  This must be done in respect of many things we export.  You can now buy fishmeal of different protein strength and it is priced accordingly and the specification must be set out on the containers.  This applies also to other foods.  I believe this is necessitated by laws in other countries in the case of exports; I think that if the product were sold within this country it would not be strictly necessary.  There is an inclination now to produce something cheaper.  Perhaps there is too much emphasis on attractive presentation rather than on safe and hygenic presentation. Modern packaging is a considerable improvement.  If the price of bread were not so high at present I wonder if it would not be a <Col N="102" /> good thing to have all bread wrapped as some of it is.  This is not compulsory. I know it would add to the price and perhaps it is dear enough as it is but it is a food that is very much handled from the time it leaves the oven until it reaches the table. A medical practitioner told me recently that if one looked at most food through a very strong microscope one would not eat it.  I am not suggesting that every household should be provided with a microscope but I support the provisions of the Bill in so far as they may extend to ensuring quality of food and hygiene.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Industry and Commerce made a statement which if he can prove it should be of tremendous help to the Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries, that butter and milk do not raise the cholesterol level in the blood.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MarkAClinton" hpid="Mr. Clinton Mr. Clinton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Clinton</NameTxt>
      <P>I was already aware of this.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JosephBrennan" hpid="Mr. Brennan Mr. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>If the Minister can prove that, he will have done a great thing to promote the sale of butter. The Minister now has an advertisement saying &ldquo;butter is the cream&rdquo; but people are aware that too much cream is not very good and I doubt if it will have the desired effect. Cheese is a high protein food.  I do not want to be involved in the question of diet but cheese has some of the fat content already extracted and is a suitable food and is one on which the Minister should concentrate.  I think, although the Minister for Industry and Commerce did not spell this out, what he meant was that every kind of food is bad if taken in excess and I think most of us eat too much.  When the late President Kennedy addressed this House one of the first things he said and which he felt was pleasing was that world statistics showed that we were one of the best fed countries in the world.  I would say a large percentage of us are overfed. This, perhaps, is a matter more for the Minister for Health and is completely irrelevant to the Bill but I am coming to the end of my speech and trust the Chair will be indulgent. I often mentioned to the previous <Col N="103" /> Minister for Health that I thought that if doctors generally throughout the country were obliged on one day in the month in their own dispensary area or parish to give a lecture in regard to dietary behaviour and the nutritional qualities of different foods indicating the type of food to avoid or use sparingly, many of the illeffects blamed on food would never materialise.</P>
      <P>To drink too much water is bad. To do anything in excess is bad.  If the Minister can now advertise that the more milk, butter and cream one consumes the better it is for one's health, then he will be doing a great job for agriculture.  I think the Minister for Industry and Commerce went so far as to say that that was so.  I should like to hear what the medical profession have to say about that.  I hope they agree, but I know many people whom they have advised otherwise.</P>
      <P>Deputy O'Malley will speak about the health aspect of this subject about which I know very little.  This is very necessary legislation.  It deals with the most important thing in our lives, food for human consumption.  It gives far-reaching powers to Ministers to make orders dealing with quality, distribution, advertising, production, transport, sales and storage of food, everything from the time it is produced until it appears on the table. To that extent, this legislation must lean towards the extreme side.  We, as an Opposition, should ensure that there are ample safeguards to prevent abuses of the powers which are provided for the inspectorate to be appointed under the Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>The first thing that strikes one on reading this Bill is that almost all of it relates to the provisions for the making of regulations. In principle, of course, this is undesirable but I can understand in a field such as this that it would be futile to try to legislate for standards by writing them into an Act.  These standards, hopefully at least, will change fairly rapidly from year to year as standards improve.  As the Minister <Col N="104" /> pointed out, we have the requirements of applying EEC and other world standards to our food standards.  It would be impossible to do that if the Minister had to come back to the Oireachtas every time a change of this kind was made.  In this particular case, therefore, I do not disagree with the principle of giving these enormous powers to make regulations.</P>
      <P>So far as this Bill is concerned, I disagree with the fact that not alone are there no safeguards against possible abuses of that power of regulation but the contrary is the case.  If one reads sections 6 and 7, which might be described as the legal part of the Bill, one will find that the defendant has no chance whatever. He is a loser from the start.</P>
      <P>I wish to draw the attention of the House to subsection (4) of section 7. Members will see there a most extraordinary situation.  I hope that this is not repeated anywhere in Irish law. Where a defendant successfully defends himself but because he did not tell the prosecution in advance what he was going to say he has to pay the prosecution's costs.  That is really something.  A man actually wins his case, is wrongly and improperly prosecuted by an officer of the Minister but because he did not tell them before he went to court what he was going to say in court he has to pay their costs.  People should read that subsection because in my view it brings things to a very fine pass indeed.  If a defendant can prove certain things he will not be found guilty but unless he has told the prosecutor beforehand he will have to pay the prosecutor's costs.  There is no justification for such a monstrous provision.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I could use a number of the phrases which were used about my legislation when I was on that side of the House and which were not appropriate but would be appropriate to such an incredible proposal as this. A man is found not guilty, and is not guilty as is clear from section 4, but unless he told the man who was prosecuting him what he was going to say he would still have to pay the costs.  Costs could run to 100 or 200 guineas if the prosecutor calls a number <Col N="105" /> of witnesses.  It is bad enough that even if a man can establish his innocence under section 7 he has to pay the prosecutor's costs.</P>
    <P>Subsections (1), (2) and (3) happily have not the terrible provision that a successful defendant has to pay a prosecutor's costs.  In each case the onus of proof is put on the defendant. Certain things are presumed until he proves the contrary.  As I have already said, there are many quotations in the Official Report over the last few years which could profitably and more appropriately be quoted in relation to this Bill.</P>
    <P>For the most part people are not interested in food standards.  This is proved by the fact that at 7.20 this evening there is not one person in the public gallery and only two Members on the other side of the House.  Nobody cares about food standards although we in this House say they are important.  We still should not let section 7 of this Bill through without trying to draw the attenion of the public to what is in it.  There is a long list of subsections saying that such a thing shall be presumed against the defendant unless he can prove to the contrary.  It would not be an unfair summary to say that the net position which exists at the end of all these presumptions against the defendant which he has to disprove is that once a man is prosecuted he is guilty.  He has to start disproving all these various presumptions which are assumed against him under this Bill.  If he can disprove enough of them he may get off but, even if he does, he may still have to pay the prosecutor's costs.</P>
    <P>The fact that many people, unfortunately, do not seem to worry about a thing like food standards should not stop them from worrying about provisions like this in our law because, if they are brought in here as they are in a comparatively unimportant Bill like this, there is a precedent.  They can be referred to or called in aid in much more important matters.  This Bill is unimportant only in the sense that very few people have any interest in it.  It is not unimportant in the subject matter with which it deals. <Col N="106" /> Many people may find after it is enacted, if it is enacted as it stands now, that they can be put in a most invidious and onerous situation through no fault of their own.</P>
    <P>In section 6 the procedure is set out at some length for the disposal of food which is seized.  It can be disposed of by the person seizing it, if the owner of the food consents. There is no great problem about that because presumably if it is clearly rotten or unfit the owner will consent because he will have to throw it out himself.  What does matter is the instance where the owner does not consent and where there is a <i>bona fide</i> dispute.  It may be food that is unfit in a technical sense only.  It may not live up to its warranty, for example. It may not be in accordance with the label on it although otherwise it may be fit for human consumption.</P>
    <P>Assuming that it is seized for unfitness and the owner does not consent to its destruction, the prosecutor or the person seizing it has to apply to the District Court for an order to have it destroyed, or to allow him to destroy it.  That is all right in the city of Dublin or the city of Cork.  The District Court sits six days in Dublin and five days in Cork, per week, but nowhere else does it sit every day. In the great majority of the District Court areas, it sits only on one day a month.  In many cases it sits only on one day every two months.</P>
    <P>If it is envisaged that the food should be retained until the District Court has had an opportunity to adjudicate on the case, the food, whatever its quality or fitness on the first day, clearly must be unfit by the time it comes up for a decision.  In fairness to it, the section does envisage that because it does not envisage an order that the food be given back.  It envisages the District Court making an order that the Minister, or whoever it is, should compensate the man whose food was improperly seized.  Nonetheless, if a quantity of food is seized under this Bill, and its seizure is disputed by the owner and it is necessary to go to the District Court, you will find in practice that there will be a wait of anything from a week to three or four months <Col N="107" /> before it is adjudicated on by the District Court.  In the meantime, while the value of the food or the commodity in question may be safe enough in the sense that if the man wins his case the Minister will have to pay him anyway, if the seizure of the commodity concerned was a very large one, money will not compensate for its loss.</P>
    <P>For the past six months or so there has been an actual shortage of many different kinds of commodities.  We did not have that situation since shortly after the last world war.  At the moment money will not buy certain things because they are not there.  Their price has gone up greatly but they are still not there.  If there was a seizure&mdash;perhaps the Minister would be glad to have ten tons of butter or meat seized and destroyed&mdash;of some commodity, other than meat or butter, of which there is a shortage, the fact that somebody will be compensated afterwards for a wrongful seizure is no consolation to the many people in the country who will have to do without that commodity.</P>
    <P>There is provision that if either party is not satisfied with the decision of the District Court he can appeal to the Circuit Court.  In Dublin, the average waiting time for an appeal to the Circuit Court is between six and nine months and that will be on top of whatever time you waited to get the case on in the District Court originally.  The delay is not as long in provincial areas but it would usually be three months or so.  I am not certain that the District and Circuit Court, under the procedure as envisaged here, are the best forums for trying to decide appeals of this kind.  I am glad, of course, that there is a right of appeal but the section should be amended in some way to allow of a more expeditious deciding of these matters.</P>
    <P>It is only in this Bill that the limitations on the various Ministers' powers &mdash;because at least three of them can make these regulations&mdash;can be set out.  What is not set out here is that a limitation on the right to make a regulation will no longer exist as a limitation.  We have to spell it out here.  Unfortunately, apart from <Col N="108" /> the sections giving powers to make regulations, basically the only other sections are ones which say, in effect, that in most cases the defendant will have to prove himself innocent.  That is the wrong approach.  The limitations in legislation on these regulations should be the other way round.  The limitations on what Ministers can do should be clearly set out.</P>
    <P>I know there is provision in section 10 for laying these regulations before the Oireachtas for the purpose of having them annulled.  I do not recall that regulations made by a Minister were ever annulled.  I can recall myself as a Minister getting this House and the other House to annul regulations made by the Incorporated Law Society increasing solicitors' fees by some large sum.  It was the law society who made those regulations; it was not a Minister.  In effect, we have to face the fact that, if a Minister makes regulations, they will never be annulled in this House while the particular Dáil of which he is a Minister remains. By the time the next Dáil comes along it is too late.  The 21 sitting days have elapsed and you cannot annul them.  You can, of course, repeal them in the ordinary way but that, again, is within the prerogative of the Minister, and the Minister only. It is not within the prerogative of either House of the Oireachtas.</P>
    <P>While subsection (2) of section 10 is a common subsection now in legislation of this kind giving power of regulation, and while it is commendable on the face of it at least to have it there&mdash;it reads very well&mdash;technically it seems to flatter each House of the Oireachtas, but in practice we all know it means nothing because one could not get anything annulled unless by some freak or piece of good law.  One will not get it annulled no matter how bad a regulation it is.  I do not believe that any officer of any of these Ministers under this Bill would go out to persecute anyone or set out to do it.  Nonetheless, if you look at section 5, you will see there is a vast number of people who are entitled to prosecute offences.</P>
    <P>Not alone is it any officer of each of the three Departments, Agriculture <Col N="109" /> and Fisheries, Industry and Commerce and Health&mdash;and they are all big Departments&mdash;but it is also any officer of any health board, or any officer of any local authority, or any officer of customs and excise.  I do not know what is the total number of potential prosecutors but it could be as high, perhaps as, 8,000 or 10,000 people altogether and even more.  If it is, one has no guarantee that there will not be at least one or two deliberately awkward people who will set out, perhaps in the context of a small local community, to persecute some shopkeeper or other person for their own good reasons.</P>
    <P>In a prosecution about matters such as those contained in this Bill, unfortunately, it matters very little whether or not a man is convicted. The real damage is done by the fact that he is up for some offence relating to food, hygiene, standards, packaging, one thing or another of this kind. Unfortunately, in the eyes of a lot of the public the very fact that he is up is enough to condemn him.  Of course, as I have said already, under this Bill the very fact that he is up means that he is almost certain to be convicted anyway because everything is loaded against him.  I do think it necessary to draw attention to the fact that there is an abnormally large number of potential prosecutors.  In each case I think the consent of some responsible person should be necessary before a prosecution could be undertaken because a prosecution can do enormous damage to someone and can do that damage without any <i>mala fides</i> at all on the part of the defendant, without what we call <i>mens rea</i>, without his even being aware that what he was doing was wrong.</P>
    <P>One of the things that strikes me about subsection (2) is that all these regulations will apply to food which is being transported.  I wonder is it wise to make such enormously wide regulations because you can have a situation where a licensed haulier is rung up by someone and asked: &ldquo;Will you take a load to Limerick when you are up tomorrow?&rdquo; It might not even be specified what the load was.  He says: &ldquo;I will&rdquo; and he is told: <Col N="110" />&ldquo;call at such a place&rdquo;.  He is loaded with a number of containers, packages or cartons of some kind and he does not even know what is in them. If he is stopped, these are examined and it is found that the packaging, labelling or manufacture in some way contravenes regulations made under this Bill.  That man, because he is transporting the goods, is guilty.  It is not a question of a prosecution proving that he transported them and all the rest of it.  There is a presumption of everything against him.  Even though he is a perfectly innocent man, the only thing open to him to do is to avail of subsection (4) of section 7 and prove that he knew nothing about it; that he had no reason to believe that the Act or regulation was contravened and that he handed over the food in the same state as that in which he found it.  If he does that, proves all those things and if he tells the prosecution this before they went to court so that the prosecutor did not bring his witnesses to court, then and only then will he get a dismissal without having to pay all the costs of the prosecutor.</P>
    <P>Some years ago I took objection to people making up&mdash;and I used the words advisedly&mdash;all kinds of unlikely situations where all kinds of unlikely prosecutions might, most inconceivably, take place.  I do not want to do now the very sort of thing that I rightly, I think, accused others in this House of doing some years ago.  Nonetheless, when you have a potential 10,000 prosecutors&mdash;as you have under section 5 (1) of this Bill&mdash;one cannot rule out the possibility of some very unfair prosecutions being brought&mdash; what any normal person would regard as being very unfair.  One cannot rule out that possibility.  For that reason, in this piece of legislation, some sort of controls should be spelled out.  It is the only opportunity we are going to get to try to keep some control over these regulations that will be made afterwards.</P>
    <P>One of the negative controls, if you like, that I would advocate to the Minister now is that he drops most, if not all, of section 7 because this kind of legislation and the regulations <Col N="111" /> made under it, God knows, are going to cause enough problems for enough people anyway without setting out one, two, three, four, five cases where there is a presumption against the defendant unless he proves the contrary. Apart from the one where I mentioned he has to pay the costs even if he does win, another very serious one is in subsection (3) where it says:</P>
    <P>Where it is proved in any prosecution for an offence under this Act that anything was found on premises used for the manufacture or preparation of food and that the thing was capable of use in or for the purposes of such manufacture or preparation, it shall be presumed, until the contrary is proved, that it was being used in or for the purposes of the manufacture or preparation of food intended for sale for human consumption.</P>
    <P>The gist of that is that, for example, in a restaurant where food is being prepared, if the owner of the restaurant had cat food or dog food in stock for his own cat or dog, and for their consumption only, nonetheless there would be a presumption that because it was possible to put that cat food into food for human consumption, there was a presumption that it was, in fact, put in.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister is smiling but that is what is there. It is described here by those celebrated words &ldquo;the thing&rdquo; about which we heard so much on another Bill.  It is funny to see it come up here again in this context.  If the Minister reads subsection (3) of section 7 he will find a situation where some &ldquo;thing&rdquo; which could go into food and which is found on premises used for the preparation or manufacture of food will be presumed to have been used in such food unless the defendant proves the contrary.  I am not going to make a big song and dance about it.  I merely want to say I think that is very unfair.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I can sympathise with situations in <Col N="112" /> which there have to be from time to time certain presumptions but I do not think one needs the long series of presumptions listed in the Bill.  I do not think also that these things should be presumed and be accepted as facts unless the defendant proves the contrary. There is a significant difference in this Bill.  The defendant has to prove the contrary rather than, as one finds normally in Bills of this kind where there has to be presumption of some kind, that it will be presumed to be so unless the defendant can raise some reasonable doubt about it.  It is not enough for the defendant here simply to raise a reasonable doubt.  The thing will continue to be presumed against him as a fact, whether or not it is a fact, unless he can prove&mdash;and the word is used continuously in that section&mdash;the contrary.  I think that is wrong.</P>
    <P>Although this is an important Bill in the matters with which it deals, unfortunately, it is unimportant in so far as the public are concerned because they are not interested.  For that reason the sort of things in this Bill would not pass this House and the Seanad if this were a Bill that aroused greater public interest.  The fact that this Bill does not arouse greater public interest does not in any way lessen the validity of the things to which I have referred and that is why I think the Minister should think again about the necessity for having such excessively wide powers as are contained in this Bill against the ordinary citizen.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries (Mr. Clinton)</NameTxt>
      <P>I have listened with considerable interest to what Deputies have had to say and I can assure them that between now and Committee Stage their contributions will be borne in mind when having a second look at this measure. I was surprised to find Deputy O'Malley apparently much more concerned about the legal aspects of the Bill rather than the health aspects.  I expected him to deal with the Bill in a different way.  However, I appreciate the matters he raised and I can assure him they will be carefully studied before the Bill comes back to the House on Committee Stage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="113" /> I was pleased that Deputies realised the necessity for this Bill.  I think it was Deputy Brennan who said that food is an extremely important thing in the lives of our people and the greatest care must be exercised in the preparation, handling and packaging of food for human consumption and that we are not always careful enough.</P>
    <P>There have been some criticisms but, on the whole, the Bill has been accepted as a necessary measure, as a desirable measure, and as a measure in line with legislation in other countries which have already introduced these standards essential not only for the health of the people but for the good of the country and for the sale of the produce of the country generally either when it is exported or consumed at home.</P>
    <P>Deputy Collins was concerned because there seemed to be no reference to the need for stipulating the nutritive value of food.  That is actually included because quality is included. At any time any one of the Ministers concerned can make an order prescribing quality and the various nutritives so that the purchaser will know exactly what he or she is getting. If Deputy Collins feels this is not adequately covered&mdash;I believe it is &mdash;perhaps he would put down an amendment designed to cover it more adequately.  The Deputy seems to think there is a shortcoming in section 2, but actually there is a reference to quality in that section.</P>
    <P>In section 3, he objects to two months being prescribed as a minimum. He thinks four months should be the minimum.  There is no maximum prescribed and, in implementing legislation of this kind, it has always been the practice for those responsible for implementation and supervision to be reasonable.  I think it would be unreasonable to give only two months. I imagine normal discretion is exercised and a longer period permitted. For that reason I do not think it is necessary to amend the section.</P>
    <P>Deputy Collins believes section 4 is not sufficiently comprehensive.  I do not know in what respect it falls short, but I shall have a look at it.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="114" /> A number of Deputies spoke about the importance of protecting the housewife and the way in which advertising is often designed to deceive or to over-impress.  This Bill does not cover advertising.  More than one Deputy referred to the importance of advertising and how advertising should be treated.  We have all sorts of foods being advertised every day and people being induced to buy them.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GerardCollins" hpid="Mr. G. Collins Mr. G. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>Might I ask the Minister a question?  Does this cover advertising on packages?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MarkAClinton" hpid="Mr. Clinton Mr. Clinton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Clinton</NameTxt>
      <P>The section provides that the food must contain what is written on the package.  I suppose one could describe that as advertising, but I got the impression that we were talking about advertising in the various communications media.  That is not covered.  The purpose of the Bill is to ensure that the quality of the food is good and that the food is safe.  It is not to ensure that people buy it because someone impresses on them that it is the right thing to buy because it is a bright red colour.  The important thing is to ensure the safety of the food.  It is the safe levels that are really important.  While we had what might be described as straight food, food not tampered with in any way, the dangers were very much less. This is the age of the ready-mix and the cure-all.  This is what we have to provide against.  Everything is now ready to put on the plate, as it were, and it will do all sorts of things for all sorts of people.  The important thing is to ensure that the food is safe and does not contain dangerous residues.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The levels of the various residues were covered very well by the Minister for Industry and Commerce. Indeed, his contribution was very useful, the more so as he is one who has a responsibility in the matter.  He is one of the three Ministers involved. He is also a veterinary surgeon and, therefore, well qualified to speak on the Bill before us.  He spoke about the fact that dangers have increased enormously because of the variety of foods we now have containing very many ingredients, coming from all <Col N="115" /> parts of the world, being packaged in a variety of ways and possibly handled over a considerable period of time.</P>
    <P>Deputy Brennan made a very useful point when he spoke about the importance of transport.  One can easily see where difficulties could arise here. Certain perishable goods, in perfect order when purchased and which would answer all the standards indicated on the labels of packets, if they had to be transported a distance in certain conditions might not be in a safe condition by the time they arrived at their destination.  This is a very important consideration and one must look very carefully at the responsibility of the receiver in such cases.  Deputy Brennan indicated that food arriving at certain institutions was being received by people who were not particularly well qualified to judge the effects of this type of handling.  He mentioned that such people might take in this food and serve it up believing it was right because it was bought from a certain person, one who was known to be reliable.  I believe the Deputy was referring particularly to institutions such as hospitals.</P>
    <P>Deputy Collins thought it was unfair to include institutions of this kind. He felt that there were other types of places where food was served which did not seem to be covered by the Bill but I feel that there is a general cover given in the Bill.  The Bill deals with a number of places where food is normally sold and dispensed and then it refers to institutions.  The point raised by Deputy Collins is covered under that.</P>
    <P>The dangers that arise from additives of all descriptions which are used to add colour and a certain magic from the point of view of sales was referred to by the Minister for Industry and Commerce, Deputy Keating. He pointed out that these additives used at certain levels are safe but when one goes beyond those levels are very unsafe.  Sulphur dioxide was one of the substances referred to.  The Minister for Industry and Commerce also referred to the fact that tests, <Col N="116" /> generally speaking, were much too short and to the fact that there was too little knowledge about the long-term effects.  Humans live longer than the mice on which these tests are carried out and it could be 30 to 40 years before the accumulated effects of certain additives and undesirable substances in foods might become known.  It is hard to know exactly how to safeguard against this sort of thing but a considerable amount of commonsense has to be used when we are deciding what is permissible.</P>
    <P>There is no doubt but that a lot of the insecticides and antibiotics in one part of the world can be used safely but in other parts they cannot. We have to have these standards on a common basis and over a very wide area and it is obvious from what we have heard from codex alimentarius that many countries have agreed to these standards and are carrying them out.  These countries see the importance, and the dangers, attaching to additives and residues of all sorts.</P>
    <P>One of the things that makes me feel happy about this Bill is the constitution of the committee that has been set up to advise the Government. It is unlikely that people of their qualifications and experience would allow legislation of this kind to come before the House unless they were reasonably satisfied that this legislation was needed in the circumstances in which we find ourselves.  It is a very widely-based committee and one for which we would always have a great deal of respect.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Industry and Commerce covered all the dangers that arise from pollution, from the use of chemicals on various types of land and the results when these flow into lakes and rivers.  He told us of the various troubles that can arise from eating the fish from such rivers, and from residues in meat and other sources. One of the things we can be fairly happy about is that An Foras Talúntais have done research on the levels of these residues in our meat and in our food products and this has shown, beyond all doubt, that we have the lowest level in Europe.  This is something we ought to be very proud of.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="117" /> I believe this legislation will be implemented in a reasonable way. The existence of it is what is really important.  People will become aware that standards are expected from them and that they are liable to get into trouble if they do not make an effort to maintain reasonable standards. A minority of our people are extremely careless and they must be reminded that anything is just not good enough for people and that they have to be more careful about their standards.  I do not see the wide powers that are undoubtedly given in this legislation, and which are undoubtedly necessary, being abused in any way.  These wide powers are necessary because one could not possibly conceive the variety of situations that will have to be met in the course of time to reach certain standards.  We are all anxious to have these standards.</P>
    <P>Deputy O'Malley referred to the fact that while these regulations will come before the House it is inconceivable that the House would decide against a regulation made by a Minister. One of the things that Governments have to be careful about is public opinion arising from these things.  The fact that these regulations can be discussed in detail in this House is a safeguard.  It will also mean that Ministers will have to be careful when making regulations so as to ensure that they will not be open to criticism of a kind that is undesirable for any legislator.</P>
    <P>I was delighted to hear a professional man say that this question of margarine being less dangerous than butter was all nonsense.  I agree with that and I am glad to say that more and more people are coming around to the same belief.  I am glad that all this nonsense about the level of cholesterol arising as a result of eating butter or drinking cream is pretty well debunked.  I hope the people will realise that they could not eat better foods.  It is right to say that all sorts of people set themselves up as authorities with very little backing and it is amazing the way they can mislead the people.</P>
    <P>While advertising is not covered in <Col N="118" /> this, other Ministers have responsibility for advertising.  The brainwashing efforts were described; they can be dangerous and overdone. Another danger is the over-prescribing of drugs generally but the long-term effects have not been measured.  That matter does not come within the scope of this Bill but is covered in other legislation. It has been pointed out that it is a human right to have good food and that is what we are trying to do. We want to ensure that the various aspects involved, the production, packaging and transportation, are carefully considered and done in such a way so that at the very least they will not upset the health of people but, in fact, will be of benefit to those who must eat the food.</P>
    <P>I have covered most of the points raised by the various speakers and if there are any other aspects that need examination before the next Stage I shall do so.  I do not agree with Deputy O'Malley's criticism, mainly in connection with section 7.  It is normal practice that a person is considered innocent until he is proved guilty. Deputy O'Malley is a lawyer and I shall certainly give careful consideration to section 7 to see if changes are required or if it is considered there are sufficient safeguards in the Bill.</P>
    <P>I should like to thank the Deputies who have contributed in the debate. The comments have been very helpful.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Brien</NameTxt>
      <P>The budget was one of concern for the less well-off and the figures are there for all to see.  Of the last ten budgets eight were formulated <Col N="119" /> by Fianna Fáil and two by the National Coalition Government.  In eight years under Fianna Fáil the social welfare provision amounted to £54 million whereas in two years of National Coalition Government the amount was £88 million.  That indicates clearly the difference between the parties; it highlights our concern and the lack of concern by the Opposition.</P>
      <P>Increases were granted to old age pensioners, to widows, deserted wives, unmarried mothers and to others.  This year there was an innovation in that single women were given an allowance. Up to now young women who were obliged to give up work to look after their parents found themselves on the scrapheap when their parents died, when many of them were in their late fifties and found it impossible to get work.  They had to eke out a miserable existence but now, for the first time, they come into a social welfare category and they have an allowance in their own right.  This should have been done a long time ago.</P>
      <P>Another important innovation is the provision made for wives of prisoners. Through no fault of their own they were frequently victimised; the husbands were guaranteed their meals but that could not be said for the wives and families.  Society is hard on such people but the Government saw the great social need and ensured that the wives of prisoners had allowances that are reasonably generous.</P>
      <P>The Opposition criticised the increase in the children's allowances but this is another problem we have tackled. We have lived up to another of our promises in the 14-point programme and have reduced the qualifying age for old age pensions.  Until we came into office the age limit had not been changed since 1908.  The Opposition were on this side of the House for 16 years but they did nothing about it.  Now people aged 68 qualify for the old age pension and we intend to bring it down to 65 years.  This was one of our promises and we shall carry it out.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>These are some of the facets of the budget.  Deputy Haughey mentioned <Col N="120" /> that Fianna Fáil were concerned about an equitable form of tax.  Again, they had an opportunity of formulating such a tax but they did nothing except to ensure that those in the lower income group were caught.  In the last 16 years the number of people in the PAYE system jumped astronomically while the number in the surtax bracket decreased.  Those making vast fortunes in speculating were allowed to do so without paying one penny tax.</P>
    <P>The Fianna Fáil Ard-Fheis this year rejected a capital gains tax system. So much for an equitable form of tax.  It is lip-service.  They were here, they had the opportunity and they did not take it.  We have been a little more than a year in office.  We have brought out a White Paper on capital taxation.</P>

You have made no contribution because you are devoid of a social conscience, because you wanted to let your pals carry on making their millions and let the less well-off in our society pay because they are easy to get at by way of PAYE.

      <P>It is a discussion document and when it is fully discussed proposals will be finalised and brought before the House.  I am happy that a lot of the anomalies in our tax system are being looked at and are being faced up to squarely and discussed. The farmers in certain brackets are coming under the tax code.  I do <Col N="121" /> not think anybody can quibble with that.  If we want an equitable society we cannot have a farm labourer paying tax while his master does not.  It is not a question of urban versus rural. There is nothing like that.  I believe we are one society.  They make their contribution in their way and we make it our way.  It is important that we all play our role by paying our way, by ensuring that we pay a fair contribution through the tax system in a well-ordered and just society.  We tackled this.  We did not run away from it.</P>
      <P>These are some of the aspects which I consider make this a great budget. A contribution of £88 million to social welfare in two years is very good.  We had people complaining that last year's budget would ruin the economy, would slow it up and cause unemployment. On the contrary, there was a big increase in our economic growth and an increase in employment.  We weathered an international crisis in oil and monetary inflation and we came through in a reasonably healthy state.  We were able to maintain a five-day working week while our neighbours across the way were not.  We did so because we made the right moves at the right time.  We are again going for a deficit. We believe it is the thing to do to ensure expansion in employment and in our economy.  It is easy to sit and say: &ldquo;Things are bad internationally and we will not take the chance&rdquo;. That would be a very unwise thing to do.  We must take the chances, we must be progressive and we must project ourselves through an expansion situation.  I am happy enough that the Minister for Finance has done this.  We have had people on the opposite side of the House saying that money might flow out because of our tax reforms.  That is a most irresponsible thing for any member of the Opposition to say and it is dishonest. They did not make their contribution by way of reform and all they can do is scaremonger.  That does not help our economy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am happy that we are taking the right course.  We have got through the first year.  It was not the easiest of years but we have come through it well.  It is recognised in most reports <Col N="122" /> that in the coming year growth will be slow.  The important thing is that we are expanding, that our economic situation is rising.  We must ensure that our employment situation expands, that our farm income levels rise, that our exports expand.  I would look to the second half of the coming year as a new dawn rising with the EEC situation stabilising and our produce, particularly our agricultural produce, being in great demand again and bringing us back to a high level of growth.  This time next year I hope to be speaking on the budget and being able to look back and say that it was a satisfactory year because we did the right things in the budget of 1974.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasHussey" hpid="Mr. Hussey Mr. Hussey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hussey</NameTxt>
      <P>It is important that every Deputy should make his contribution to the budget debate because it is one of the most important debates in the House during the year. Whether one represents a rural or an urban constituency there is in this and in every budget something for all of us.  There are many matters in the budget with which we can be very pleased but there are also many matters which are not in the budget and which we, as an Opposition, have the right to bring to the notice of the Minister and the Government.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I was amused listening to Deputy O'Brien trying to bolster up the budget and present it as something that is perfect in every way, saying that there is something in it for every member of the community and that we will all benefit to a greater or lesser degree.  This is the opportunity of the Government parties to bolster up the Government and to bolster up their own Minister and the budget he introduced.  This budget which we are debating today and which was debated before the Easter recess was described in many ways by the media, the political correspondents and the general public.  I would describe it as the gambler's budget because the Minister for Finance is taking so many gambles in the hope that eventually things will turn out right and that he will be able to balance his accounts.  He has tried desperately to grasp at any straw and to use any <Col N="123" /> gimmick which would convince the public that he is the most enlightened and concerned Minister for Finance to introduce a budget in this House.</P>
    <P>At first glance one might be inclined to believe it but when one reads through the small print and analyses the contents an entirely different picture emerges.  No matter how small an enterprise is good book-keeping is essential to ensure that the enterprise is maintained in a strong and viable position.  Every effort is made at the end of the financial year to ensure that the accounts are balanced. Even in the home, the housewife endeavours to pay her bills and to balance her books even though at times she is put to the pin of her collar because of rapidly increasing prices.  However, when it comes to the nation's book-keeping, we find an entirely different situation obtains.  We find the worst possible example of bad housekeeping.  The Minister, instead of trying to balance his books and pay as he goes, decides to take everything he can lay his hands on. Consequently, he has budgeted for a deficit of £66 million.  I consider this to be a rather dangerous situation because it is important that at the end of a financial year books should be balanced and bills should be paid as we go along.</P>
    <P>The twin evils afflicting this country at the present time are inflation and rising prices.  Those two evils have made life very miserable particularly for people on fixed incomes.  They have completely eroded any increases given in salaries and pensions over the past 12 months.  The budget presented to this House this year does nothing to eliminate those two evils. The case for running a deficit budget and for raising Government borrowing is that it is necessary to boost the growth rate from the low level of 3 per cent or 4 per cent, which is currently predicted.  A rise of £90 million in borrowing will not do this.</P>
    <P>Last year's deficit budget does not appear to have had any beneficial effect in increasing output.  The Economic and Social Institute in their latest <Col N="124" /> quarterly bulletin point out that the rapid growth in 1973 took place in the first half of the year with little or no growth in the last half.  It should be noted that this was before any oil shortage affected the situation.</P>
    <P>This is a further indication of the sound position in which the Fianna Fáil Government left this country when they left office.  When in Government Fianna Fáil established machinery for dealing with inflation. They set up the employer-labour conference, which as we know, played a very important role in helping to bring about national wage agreements, the third of which has been negotiated recently.  They also set up the National Prices Commission.  Both of these bodies were essential because there was little point in tackling prices directly if there was no mechanism for regulating pay and other incomes. Similarly, there would be little prospect of any pay restraint operating if there was not some way of limiting price rises also.</P>
    <P>We remember that at the time these measures were introduced they were opposed by the Fine Gael and Labour Parties, even though they were introduced to bring some restraint into pay rises but Fianna Fáil did not hesitate because they considered it essential in the national interest that they be introduced. We all recall before the last general election one of the main planks in the National Coalition programme was their promise that when they were elected they would immediately introduce strict price control.  I have no doubt that this promise succeeded in securing a great many votes for the candidates put forward by Fine Gael and Labour.  The electorate cannot be blamed for believing that if they gave their votes to these gentlemen they would honour the promise they made.  I realise that possibly they could not have done the things they promised but I think the Government parties will be condemned for all time for having made a promise they knew they could not fulfil if they were elected.</P>
    <P>In their manifesto they stated that the immediate economic aims of the <Col N="125" /> new Government would be to stabilise prices, halt redundancies, reduce unemployment under a programme of planned economic development.  They stated that Fine Gael in government would immediately introduce strict price control and would remove value-added tax from food.  Now, looking back over the past 12 months, we realise how hollow that promise has proved to be.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasHussey" hpid="Mr. Hussey Mr. Hussey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hussey</NameTxt>
      <P>I have dealt with the Government's promise in regard to price rises and the promise to introduce price control.  When they got into office they sat back and allowed prices to escalate at a tremendous rate. <Col N="127" /> In July the Government, for the first time ever, I believe, decided to override the recommendation of the Prices Commission and award a price greater than that suggested by the commission.  This was not a serious way of tackling spiralling prices and trying to carry out the promises made in the election campaign.</P>
      <P>The policies which we, when on that side of the House, initiated have helped considerably to moderate inflation but much remains to be done. I shall now look briefly at some of the benefits of the budget.  First, in regard to income tax relief for workers, I believe this promise contributed largely towards the successful conclusion of the national pay agreement. The workers were told they would get considerable tax concessions in this budget but if they had known then the actual relief they would get we would not have had a third national wage agreement.  This would be a great disaster because a national wage agreement is the only way to avoid strikes which eventually cost the country dearly.  I think the workers were hoodwinked into accepting this national wage agreement in the hope of considerable savings in income tax.</P>
      <P>A single worker earning approximately £1,000 per annum will, under the budget proposals, save about £27.85 per annum, which is a very small sum in the light of the present inflation and rate of rising prices.  If he were travelling by car to work it would scarcely buy one gallon of petrol per week.  A married man with three children who earns £2,500 will save £23.20 per annum, not enough to buy groceries for the family for one week.  There are no real incentives to saving in this budget.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I had hoped that the Minister would do something about bank savings.  For many years if one has money in the bank, in the case of a single person, if the interest exceeds £70 per annum, it is taxable.  At present interest rates this is a very small concession.  The current rate of interest is about 8 per cent so that if a boy or girl had £1,000 in the bank <Col N="128" /> earning £80 in interest he or she would be liable to tax on £10 of that sum.  If the Minister were serious in encouraging young people to save he would have done something about this because the £70 limit has been there for many years and it is beyond the time when it should have been raised.</P>
    <P>There is very little in the budget for the young couple trying to buy or build their own home.  Previously they were allowed 35 per cent on mortgages.  Now they will get only 26 per cent.  This is a step backwards in the case of people with whom the Minister and the Government should be concerned because we all know the terrible problems confronting couples thinking of marrying and setting up a home.  We know their problems in regard to loans and high interest rates.  In the budget we find the Minister does not even increase the grants for those houses.  The cost of building material has increased very considerably.  Even since January of this year the price of timber has increased by about 120 per cent.  The cost of bathroom fittings has increased even more.  A fact very often forgotten is that a person building his own home pays about £500 in value-added tax and gets a grant of about £325.  In effect, the Government make a profit out of that man of about £175.  That is a desperate situation at a time when we are trying to encourage young people to stay and build homes and rear families here.  Surely the Government have a responsibility to help those people build their homes by giving them loans at attractive interest rates.</P>
    <P>Social welfare increases were not adequate when we take into account the rising prices and the raging inflation at the present time.  To keep ahead of inflation, those increases should have been in the region of 25 per cent to compensate those who are living on fixed incomes.  The Fianna Fáil Government in its last budget gave increases across the board of £1. As everybody will agree, this was far in excess of the present increases taking into consideration the cost of living and inflationary trends.</P>
    <P>Last year I spoke about the dependants <Col N="129" /> of recipients of disabled persons' maintenance allowances.  For some unknown reason, those dependants are not entitled to benefits.  In a country which is supposed to be concerned about the less well-off section of the community, this is a disgraceful situation.  A man in receipt of unemployment benefit with a wife and three or four children is given benefit for them.  A man in receipt of a disabled person's maintenance allowance with a wife and children is not given benefit for them.  To qualify for this allowance he must be disabled. Therefore, he is unable to provide for his wife and children.  Yet when it comes to budget time and the Minister has an opportunity of rectifying this imbalance, these people are forgotten. This is a shame.  Will the Minister take a look at this position and see if anything can be done?  A person in receipt of unemployment assistance is capable of going to work if work is available.  This is one of the conditions under which he receives unemployment assistance.  Here we have an unfortunate person who is not capable of going to work and he is not entitled to any allowance for his dependants.</P>
    <P>There is an anomaly which I should like to see abolished or changed, particularly as it militates against small farmers who apply for but do not qualify for unemployment benefit because they have gone to work for six months and have not sufficient stamps. There is a means test.  If a man has not 78 stamps on his cards and if his income from the farm exceeds 50p per day, he is disqualified.  In this day and age, this figure should be increased. The Parliamentary Secretary responsible for Social Welfare, who is a very reasonable man, should turn a sympathetic eye towards this section of the community.</P>
    <P>Many small farmers in the west of Ireland because of the size of their farms are unable to eke out a living for themselves and their families.  They go out to work on the roads or in industry when work is available. When that job is finished they return to their farms and sign on for unemployment benefit.  The investigation <Col N="130" /> officer should be much more lenient. This section of the community seems to be persecuted at all times.</P>
    <P>There is another anomaly which I should like to see rectified, that is, young men who have the benefit of free board and lodgings in their parents houses.  There is a value put against this.  In some cases I have seen their means assessed at £5 or £6 per week.  I cannot understand how this happens.  Why are these people not entitled to the same benefit as a single person living in an urban area? This question should be looked into because it is very unfair that those people should be treated in this way. In the last 12 months I have had more complaints from people in this sector than previously.</P>
    <P>Another aspect of the budget which has drawn criticism from the farming community is the proposed tax on farmers.  Indeed, this will not affect many farmers in the west of Ireland. I am convinced that this is only the thin end of the wedge.  Eventually more farmers will be caught in the tax net.  In the past year or two we have heard a lot particularly from urban dwellers about the profits the farming community are making.  It is only in the past few years that farmers' incomes began to rise.  Immediately the cry went out to tax them.  This cry came especially from the Labour Party.  Their campaign seemed to be led by Deputy B. Desmond who was very outspoken. If the Deputy or some of the socialists of the Labour Party were to examine closely the hardships which farmers endure, the frustrations they meet every day of their lives, the uncertainty of their markets, would they be so outspoken?  I wonder would the Labour Party be so outspoken about taxing them.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasHussey" hpid="Mr. Hussey Mr. Hussey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hussey</NameTxt>
      <P>It is completely overrated. I am sure the Minister is aware <Col N="131" /> of the problems which face all farmers wealthy or poor: the uncertainty of their markets, the falling prices for their livestock, the price they have to pay for land, the price they have to pay for labour and the price they have to pay for farm machinery. These are only a few items.  I could list many others.  It is unfair to jump on their backs immediately we see any sign of prosperity.  Perhaps if there were a commitment by the Government to abolish rates on agricultural land we could agree to substitute the tax and most farmers would be satisfied.</P>
      <P>I am not trying to make a case for big farmers because there are no big farmers in my constituency.  I would not say there is one farmer in my constituency who will be affected by this but I am convinced that this is only the thin edge of the wedge and that next year, or possibly the year after, the £100 valuation will be reduced to £80 and then we will be catching many more of our farmers in this net.</P>
      <P>There is another aspect of this matter to which I should like to draw attention. This really affects my constituency and every constituency in the west.  In his budget speech the Minister suggested that the changes we were making would involve 9,000 farmers only out of a total of 170,000.  I would say that a far greater number will be involved.  What is bugging me is the fact that the Minister intends to make new provisions in regard to the income tax allowances to which farmers are entitled.  The Minister said:</P>
      <P>The same issue arises where the farmer, whether married or single, has non-farming income of his own. To deal with such cases, it is proposed that, in the case of farmers not now being brought within the scope of income taxation, only one-half of the appropriate personal allowances will be set off against non-farming income, whether of the farmer or of his wife.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ThomasHussey" hpid="Mr. Hussey Mr. Hussey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hussey</NameTxt>
      <P>This is a very serious proposal.  I doubt very much that the farming community have yet realised fully what is involved in it.  I want to state categorically that I am totally opposed to it because, whether or not the figure of 9,000 farmers is correct, I believe that under the proposals which I have quoted anything from 40,000 to 50,000 farmers, or perhaps more, will be affected.  What is involved here is simply this.  If a farmer or his wife has an income other than that derived from farming, he will be allowed to claim only one half of the personal allowance against the non-farming income.  This is very serious for the west of Ireland.  Those of us who are living there and making our living there know that small farmers cannot make a living for themselves, their wives and their children.  They have to go out to work.  Many of the farmers in my area have to travel 35 or 40 miles to Galway city for employment. Under this new proposal these people will be victimised because of their circumstances and because of the fact that they are not able to make a living for themselves and their families from the farm.  This is a very cruel decision and I see no justification for it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We talk about bringing industries to the west and, unless we bring industries to the west, I shudder to think what will happen to the farming community. Many of them can never hope to become developing farmers, through no fault of their own.  If they do not become development farmers they cannot qualify for any additional land that becomes available in the locality. They will not qualify for the higher rate of grants or for the reduced interest rates on loans.  If they go out to work, according to the Minister's proposal they will be victimised again, because they will be allowed to claim only one half of the personal allowance against the non-farming income.  This is disgraceful.  I hope the small farmers of the west who, I am quite sure, are still unaware of this, will read this and <Col N="133" /> make their indignation known to the Minister and his Government.</P>
    <P>Recently we saw the White Paper on Capital Taxation issued by the Government.  This has caused a lot of confusion in the minds of the people. I understand that it has caused a lot of money which is badly needed in this country to be taken away and invested in foreign banks.  This is a terrible situation.</P>

      <P>The Minister need only ask any bank manager.  I am sure he has a bigger account than I have.  If he asks the bank managers in Dublin, I am sure they will be able to brief him on this.  It seems to be the general opinion that this has frightened investment away.  At a time when we need money and need to attract industrialists to invest here, it is unfortunate that this situation should arise.  If the Government do not intend to implement those proposals, they should say so.  If they do not intend to implement them, they should withdraw them <i>in toto.</i></P>
      <P>At this time we must encourage people to invest here.  We must encourage our people who emigrated and did well for themselves in foreign lands to come back and invest here and create employment and boost the economy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I submit that the proposals outlined in this White Paper will not achieve those very desirable things which I have spoken about.  When Fianna Fáil were in Government they gave very attractive incentives to foreign industrialists to set up in this country and create employment.  By so doing they succeeded in stopping the tide of emigration; they succeeded in keeping our people at home and giving them jobs in their own country.  I am sure in years to come the people will thank Fianna Fáil for this because, in the sixties, they laid the foundation for the economic development of our country.  They introduced programmes for economic <Col N="134" /> expansion.  In those programmes they set out targets they hoped to achieve and everybody knew where they were going.  It is time the Government did something like that: that they introduced a programme, not just for one year but for four, five or ten years and that they stated clearly in what direction they are going and how they hope to achieve those targets.</P>
    <P>The national loan has always been a great guide as to the popularity of a Government.  In the national loan floated last year by the Government we found that it was undersubscribed; that, in fact, it was subscribed some £19 million less than was the Fianna Fáil one.  If this is any indication of how the Government stand in the country it is time they started to pull up their socks and did something about it.</P>
    <P>If we look at the Agricultural Credit Corporation we see that they have done wonderful work, particularly for the farming community.  Now they are impeded in their programme. According to the policy outlined by the Minister he has eliminated the £8 million in last year's capital programme and the total resources available to the Agricultural Credit Corporation will be increased by a mere £4½ million.  This is completely inadequate and means that the Agricultural Credit Corporation must now restrict their programme.  They will not have the capital available to them to give to farmers who are developing and trying to modernise their farms so that they can compete with Danish and British farmers; they will not be able to give them the capital they require for this development programme.  The Agricultural Credit Corporation will now have to carry on their business with £15 million provided from their own internal resources and £19 million raised on the domestic market.  For this £19 million they will have to compete with other institutions.  I fear that this may impede the efficiency of their operations.  It is a terrible pity that this body, which contributed to a very large extent to the modernisation of farms, to helping the farming community, should now be restricted in their programme.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="135" /> There are many other things I could say about this budget but I do not propose to hold up the House.  I have made my points.  I am completely dissatisfied with the budget because I had expected there would be in it something that would really boost the economy.  I am not convinced from what I have heard from the Minister, or from the Government benches, that any proposal outlined in this budget will help the economy of the country or create the employment we desire.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DesmondGoverney" hpid="Mr. Governey Mr. Governey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Governey</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not wish to detain the House but I should like to put a few words on the record with regard to this budget, the second budget of the National Coalition.  I have heard speakers from the Opposition benches saying how disappointed they were with this budget.  Perhaps there were various points within the budget or the Minister for Finance's speech on which they may have held other views.  But, in view of the fact that this was a budget introduced with, we might say, practically no additional taxation&mdash;after such a short term in office&mdash;this has been a wonderful achievement by the Government.</P>
      <P>I am one who is convinced and firmly believe&mdash;I said so on many occasions previously&mdash;that we must get our priorities in order.  In this budget I am convinced the Government and the Minister for Finance have got their priorities in order. When I say that, I refer to the benefits in this budget for social welfare recipients. It is no harm to put on the record of this House that, in the two budgets introduced by the present Minister for Finance, much more has been done than ever was done in the history of this State for the people most in need of help.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the 14-point plan of intent in the last general election the National Coalition candidates stressed in no uncertain manner the needs of the less well-off.  It is proof of our sincerity that in two budgets the Minister for Finance has given more increases in social welfare benefits to the old age pensioners, widows and <Col N="136" /> orphans and in allowances for parents of certain handicapped children than has ever been done in this State before.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DesmondGoverney" hpid="Mr. Governey Mr. Governey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Governey</NameTxt>
      <P>It is very easy to speak from the Opposition benches. Indeed, I had 11 years opposite.  I was abroad when the last budget was introduced.  This is the first opportunity I have had from these benches to speak on a budget.  Let us take the position today.  In the last general election we promised that the old age pensions, which were payable then at 70 years of age, would be reduced gradually to 65.</P>
      <P>Within 14 months of that election the age limit has been reduced to 68 years and we have yet another three years to go in the life of this Government. Now, what the Minister has given in this budget is a help, but I believe there is still much more to be done.  The old age non-contributory pensioner allowance has been increased by £1.15 from £6.15 per week to £7.30 per week as from 1st July next.  That is one example of what has been done.  But I am still not satisfied.  We must not stop there and I believe it is the intention of the Minister and the Government to ensure that increases like these will continue right throughout the lifetime of this Government.  If this Government did nothing else but what they have done for social welfare beneficiaries that is an achievement that any member of this National Coalition can be justly proud of.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is talk of taxation, particularly the tax on wealth adumbrated in the White Paper.  The main theme in this debate has been criticism of the wealth tax.  The White Paper is a White Paper produced by the Minister and on the front page of that White Paper for all to see is a request by the Minister for constructive criticism and constructive suggestions. It is quite a change to have a Government asking for suggestions and criticism.  When the present Taoiseach took office his words were, if my memory serves me correctly: &ldquo;This is open government&rdquo;.  The <Col N="137" /> very first message in this White Paper proves the truth of the Taoiseach's words on that occasion.  Now everybody has a right to criticism, but is it not a big change to have a Minister in a Government producing a White Paper inviting the public&mdash;taxpayers, farmers, business people, anybody and everybody&mdash;to make constructive suggestions and offer constructive criticism?  Is that not a great change for the better as compared with the time when the farming community were left sitting outside the office of the Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries in Merrion Street, not so many years ago, and would not even be listened to?  I do not like referring back to things like this, but that is one thing that should not be forgotten.</P>
    <P>As far as taxation relief is concerned, the allowances for income tax purposes have been increased.  The increases may not be very big but they are certainly a step in the right direction and they show that the Minister is determined to move along the right road and do something about the income tax code anomalies never attempted by the previous Government.</P>
    <P>We must not forget that within the last 14 or 15 months health charges have been removed from the rates. Last year the rates in Carlow were reduced because of the action of our Minister for Local Government. Again, this year, there has been a further reduction in the rates due to the action of the Minister for Local Government and Government policy.  In the last general election we undertook to remove health charges from the rates.  That has been achieved in the short period in which this Government have been in office.</P>
    <P>Children's allowance were increased last year.  They have been increased again this year.  There has been an easment in the means test for non-contributory pensions.  Last year the first £4 income was ignored; this year the figure has been increased to £5.</P>
    <P>One very important statement by the Minister was that he was making £100,000 available to fund pilot schemes into poverty research.  Here <Col N="138" /> again, if my memory serves me correctly, is something that has never been previously attempted in the history of the State.  It is something that has been welcomed by every section of the community.</P>
    <P>These are just a few of the achievements of this budget.  The increase in the personal allowance in income tax may look small but at least it is an indication of the work and thinking of the Minister for Finance, and his colleagues in the Government.  I wonder what would we have today if those in Opposition were on these benches.  Income tax, in my view, is something that will have to be looked at at regular intervals.  In this regard I welcome the undertaking of the Minister to do this.</P>
    <P>A new scheme of social assistance for long-term prisoners has been introduced.  Again this is something new.  I believe the Government had, as with the other points in the budget, such as social welfare, a moral obligation to give assistance to these unfortunate people.  To introduce such a budget with practically no direct taxation is certainly an achievement, one of which anybody would be proud.  The Members on this side of the House can say that we have our priorities right.  Much more remains to be done and I am convinced that with the team we have in the Cabinet much more will be done within the lifetime of this Government.  There is ability within this Cabinet and I have heard it stated that this is the best Cabinet ever.</P>
    <P>The Cabinet, and the Minister for Finance, can be proud of their achievements to date but there is no time to sit back.  Much remains to be done but I am convinced it will be done within the next three years.</P>

      <P>This is only my second time to contribute to a budget debate.  I am reminded now of the position a year ago when the Minister for Finance sat opposite me and interrupted me on many occasions. On any occasion I made reference to income tax, and there were many relevant points I made to him in this regard, the Minister interrupted <Col N="139" /> me.  At that time I felt the Minister was like a schoolboy who thought he had all the answers but was disappointed when a Member could point out faults to him or where there was room for improvement.  I hope that in the past year the Minister has come to realise that he does not know all the answers, that, in fact, he has very few answers.</P>
      <P>The two speakers I have heard from the Government side of the House tonight have proved to me beyond all doubt how dissatisfied their supporters are with this budget and I am convinced that their supporters conveyed this dissatisfaction to them during the recess.  Immediately after the Minister introduced his budget we had some of the power and might of the Government speaking, some of these strong men in the Cabinet.  The Minister for Industry and Commerce, the Parliamentary Secretary to the Taoiseach and the Minister for Foreign Affairs, among others, made long contributions but with very little content.  The Minister for Industry and Commerce devoted his time to attacking the Opposition.  Tonight the contributions from the Government side were pathetically weak in trying to pick the good points in this budget.  It was clear from their contributions that they do not believe it is a good budget.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Governey referred to social welfare benefits and to what had been achieved for social welfare recipients. One would think, listening to him and to other speakers from the Government side, that only one group of people were interested in the social welfare recipients.  I have as much right to speak for the lower income groups and the under-privileged classes as anybody on that side of the House.  There are members of the Labour Party who would give one the impression that they are the only people interested in the welfare of these people.  That is far from the truth.  The party of which I am proud to be a member were the party who first showed what a social conscience was.  They were the party who first have the people status and money.  I <Col N="140" /> agree that enough was not done, nor is enough being done now.  However, there is a vast difference between what we have done and the efforts of the present Government.  The two speakers I have heard tonight have said the Government have given extensive increases in social welfare benefits.  Deputy O'Brien, who is not now present, said more was given in the last two budgets than in the previous eight years.  The Deputy might be asked why more was given in the last two budgets.  The reason is simply that more money was available because of our accession to the EEC.</P>
    <P>The Minister opposite me knows he campaigned against our entry. Had his party's campaign been successful, the Minister for Finance would not have that kind of money to give to the poorest sections.  It is thanks to Fianna Fáil that this money is available, to the campaign led by Fianna Fáil which was supported in a half-hearted way by most of the Fine Gael Party, although there were some exceptions.  At that time it was made clear that this money would be available to the social welfare recipients.  If money was provided to give to the poorer sections of the community that alone was worth our entering Europe.</P>
    <P>I am glad that some new schemes were introduced.  I am always interested in the welfare of the people and any move by any Government to alleviate poverty and to improve the lot of people will have my unreserved support.  However, the kudos being given to the Minister for Finance or to the present team on the front bench&mdash;the excellent team, as Deputy Governey calls them&mdash;is due to the extra money now available.  Deputy Governey represents a rural constituency and I am surprised he is not aware that no longer will the huge agricultural subsidies be provided which had to be provided in former years.  Later I shall explain to him and to others why I think this budget bears no relation to the budgets the people knew up to a short time ago. There are many reasons for the change.</P>
    <P>The increases in the social welfare benefits are still not sufficient.  On the <Col N="141" /> Minister's own admission, they are still only slightly ahead of the inflation growth.  I accept any figure given by a Minister as a conservative one and I think the social welfare increases will not keep in line with the growing rate of inflation and with the huge price increases since the budget.  I wish to repeat that Fianna Fáil were the party who always had a social conscience.  They will support any improvements that are given to those in need and I wish to put that on the record of this House.</P>
    <P>In recent times I have seen the Minister for Finance under severe strain at Question Time.  I hope the worry and frustration, and possibly the disappointments he is meeting&mdash; which the people of the country have to face&mdash;are not upsetting him to the extent that he shows this sign of strain.  Perhaps it is due to the tug-of-war that goes on between the two parties in the Government.  At times I wonder if he is like the cord tied around the tug-of-war rope, being pulled back and forth across the centre point.  This may be the reason for his frustration.  If this is so, we may be facing a situation that, unfortunately, was faced by the Government in the early fifties and in the terrible years of the last Coalition Government from 1954 to 1957 which many of us, as young people, remember too well.</P>
    <P>In the opening sentence in his statement, the Minister said the success of last year's budget policy was responsible for the growth rate.  It is generally accepted that, for the most part, the growth rate last year took place in the first half of the year.  What impact could the budget have had at that time?  It would have been a very minor one.  The growth rate can be laid on the shoulders of the solid Government who went before them. Let him give credit where it is due. The foundation for the growth rate was laid by the Fianna Fáil Government and it was further helped by our entry into the EEC and the opening of the European markets to us.</P>
    <P>Naturally it gave a great incentive to industrialists to come here, to set up shop and to provide more jobs. Again, one of the parties in the Government <Col N="142" /> campaigned solidly against entry into the EEC.  For my part I shall always be in favour of industry where it provides more jobs and opportunities for our people.  It annoys me to hear members of the Labour Party making statements in this House because one would think they were the only people who represent the workers.  I am proud to say I was always a worker, and I shall always look forward to representing them and to speaking on their behalf.</P>
    <P>The tug-of-war to which I have referred is becoming more clear as the weeks go by.  We have seen it on a number of occasions on the wealth tax issue.  I think it was the Minister present who claimed in a recent radio interview that this was one of their achievements in government.  However, the Parliamentary Secretary to the Taoiseach has said it is a White Paper that must be discussed, that representations may be made and that at this stage it is not law or something the Government will introduce.  We had a Fine Gael Deputy who said the wealth tax will be even higher than it is in the White Paper.  It is difficult to know who is winning the tug-of-war&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>The budget of any country or indeed, of any company must be positive, progressive and forward-looking.  The old-style budgets are gone.  Understandably a budget was assessed in such terms as: &ldquo;How much did my cigarettes and beer go up?  How much extra children's allowance will I get?  How much extra old age pension?&rdquo; This is in the past, for a number of reasons.  The first reason is that we have seen solid economic progress and growth particularly since the latter years of the fifties.  Those of us who were around in the 1956-57 period remember only too well the scarcity of employment, the emigration, the hopeless situation in our towns, cities and countryside. We remember the queues at the local country barracks which were operating as labour exchanges.  From that day to the present we have seen a huge growth.  I am not saying things are perfect yet, they are a long way from it but we have seen a vast improvement in the number and type of jobs available, in the amount of money in circulation.  All those things have shown solid improvement, for the most part under a Fianna Fáil Government, a sound Fianna Fáil Government.  We have seen a changing face of Ireland&mdash;more houses, more jobs, better living conditions for the majority of people.  Our entry to the EEC removed completely any resemblance between present day budgets and those of former times. Taxation was put on a different footing. The raising of money was put on a different plane as, of course, were the improvements in social welfare benefits.  If we derived nothing else from entry, the fact that we had extra funds to spend on the less-privileged classes of our community made it worth while.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Governey said that no extra taxation had been imposed.  I wonder has Deputy Governey slept since 3rd April.  Is he not aware of all the extra taxation that has gone on since then?  A budget of this nature takes place every week now.  Apart <Col N="144" /> from foodstuffs, in every other price increase there is a certain percentage of VAT, further revenue for our country.  I can understand Members standing up on the Government side and saying that no extra taxation was imposed.  It may not have been imposed directly on budget day but on the following day the price of petrol went up by .5 of a penny.  That increase was an increase to the petrol retailer and an increase that he deserved. In fact, it probably was not enough for him because if any man suffered in the recent oil crisis it was the petrol retailer.  I do not think he was treated fairly in the situation that arose because of the scarcity of fuel.  He was not treated fairly because of the queues and the increasing cost and the money he had to pay out and the greater overdraft expenses he had to carrry.  That halfpenny went on on the day after the budget. It, of course, included extra taxation because it carried VAT.</P>
    <P>On the following day there was an increase in beer prices and this again included VAT.  Then Members on the other side stand up and say that no extra taxation was imposed.  It may not have been imposed on the 3rd but it was imposed on the 4th, 5th and 6th and it has been going on steadily since then.  I have lost count of the number of price increases since budget day.  It had reached the record figure last week of 121 on items ranging from ice cream to turf.  In those 121 price increases there was a certain element of taxation, extra revenue for the Government.</P>
    <P>I heard the Parliamentary Secretary, who is now in the House, challenging one of our Deputies to answer a question, trying to distort the situation. The position is that the present Government in February, 1972, promised that if elected they would remove VAT from food.  They also promised that they would reduce prices.  They said that the removal of VAT from food would have the effect of reducing the weekly household budget.  Unfortunately, it did not.  It had the opposite effect because of the extra VAT imposed on other essential items.  At budget time last year it was <Col N="145" /> said many times from this side of the House that the increased VAT on other essential commodities would have the effect of increasing the household budget.  We all know the huge increased revenue from VAT gained in two ways, by the transfer of VAT and by the price increases that took place in the meantime.  Let nobody tell me that for the average youngster today an ice cream is not an essential.  I hope nobody would say that a child in any family is not entitled to an ice cream.  Surely turf is also another essential commodity.</P>
    <P>What followed the 121 price increases? There was a recommendation from the National Prices Commission that the situation has grown so bad that there will be no more newspaper publicity for these increases.  The only place now that these increases will get any publicity is in the NPC monthly publication which is circulated to about 2,000 people.  In other words: &ldquo;We will not tell the people what is happening. We will continue to increase prices.  We cannot control the situation, despite what we promised&rdquo;.  Worse than that: &ldquo;We will forget about our open government&rdquo;&mdash;this wonderful, open government that Deputy Governey spoke about a short time ago.  He spoke about the Minister for Finance asking for suggestions on wealth tax.</P>

That costs a lot of money nowadays.  Unless I misunderstand the situation it is the latter that the Prices Commission recommend the discontinuance of.</P>

      <P>The overriding factor in all this is the rapid inflation, with price increases being kept back until after the budget and then released in a flood.  I hope the Parliamentary Secretary will be here to face me on the 20th June when I know we will have a further flood of price rises but, of course, they will not be advertised in the Press on this occasion. They will be circularised to the newspapers in the booklet which has at present a circulation of about 2,000 and it will be left to the newspaper commentators to go through these minutely.  They will not refer to every price increase because they will only have a certain number of columns or lines in which they can refer to the price increases.  At the moment the people can read the comments of the economic commentators and they can go to the advertising columns and see what price increases have taken place.  They can then go to their local grocers or supermarkets and they know what goods have been increased and by how much.  They will not know this if the recommendation from the National Prices Commission is accepted.  Why should the newspapers carry the boring details of the price increases on tapioca, rice and other items and have column after column of those increases?</P>
      <P>The Parliamentary Secretary has no answer to this.  The Minister for Industry and Commerce by accepting this, is throwing his hands in the air in despair and saying there is nothing further he can do, that the Government will keep as much of it as they can under the carpet because they have inflation.</P>

      <P>Do I have to explain that to the Parliamentary Secretary? The interruptions are taking me back over ground I have covered but I should like, if I do not incur the displeasure of the Leas-Cheann Comhairle by being repetitive, very briefly to say this.  The system up to now has been that although there is a booklet published by the NPC in the daily Press there is an advertisement showing the commodities that have been increased, the names of the manufacturers and the amount they have been increased by.  In addition, the commentators in some part of the newspapers comment on the price increases. The people who buy papers in the morning can read all this.  They know what goods have been increased and by how much.  Under the new system you cannot expect the newspaper commentators to go into details on over 100 price increases.  They can give their own resume of the booklet presented by the NPC.  I suggest that the Parliamentary Secretary ask the Minister for Industry and Commerce who will now be the watchdogs in relation to price increases.</P>

I appreciate the Parliamentary Secretary has got the message when he suggests that I put down a question to the Minister for Industry and Commerce.  I suggest the Parliamentary Secretary take it back to the Cabinet and say that our Minister has made a fatal mistake; he has prevented the people having the opportunity of being watchdogs on <Col N="150" /> the price increases taking place daily all over the country.  It may be departing from the budget to go into the recommendations but it must be mentioned and, indeed, cannot be mentioned often enough, that on the 121 price increases there was a percentage of VAT and thus extra taxation.  Some Government Deputies in their very weak contributions to this debate say there was no extra taxation but the extra taxation since April 3rd up to date by way of VAT increases alone is sizeable.  Inflation is galloping so quickly, prices going up so quickly and the Government getting such huge handfuls of money by way of VAT that they should consider reviewing the rate of VAT being charged on many items.</P>

      <P>Not alone is the Parliamentary Secretary becoming thin-skinned but is, I think, also beginning to appreciate the faults in Government and the awful mistake the Minister for Industry and Commerce has made in the last week in regard to the 121 price increases.  Again, we have a huge increase in VAT but next month the people&mdash;other than a select few&mdash;will have no idea how <Col N="151" /> many more increases will be sanctioned or how much they will be. Perhaps the Minister's timing is not bad.  The present Government are opportunists and good at courting publicity.  Prices were not going in their favour and probably with local elections imminent it is a nice time for the Minister for Industry and Commerce to say: &ldquo;We will not advertise prices.  We can always start again when the local elections are over&rdquo;.</P>

      <P>VAT is part of the budget and revenue from it is growing so rapidly that I suggest the Minister should do one of two things, either review the rate of VAT or&mdash; and I presume this would be theoretically possible&mdash;not include VAT on price increases.  I assume that is not practicable.  The Minister is throwing in the towel.  We are concealing the serious situation that has arisen and keeping the information from the ordinary people who are only paying&mdash;after all that does not matter, I suppose.  So much for the open government that we heard preached so long and so often, and even in this House tonight.  Yet, the one issue on everybody's lips, price increases, is being concealed from the ordinary people.</P>

      <P>Let us be realistic.  VAT is increasing with every price increase.  For God's sake let the people know what is being increased and by how much.  I was amazed to hear some earlier Government speakers claim that the removal of VAT from food had helped the household budget.  One can only say that food is probably not as dear as it might be if VAT were on it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMKelly" hpid="Mr. Kelly Mr. Kelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>Is that not a lot to say?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. G. Fitzgerald Mr. G. Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>Let me finish. Although food is not as dear as it might otherwise be, other essential household commodities&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMKelly" hpid="Mr. Kelly Mr. Kelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>What is more essential than food?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. G. Fitzgerald Mr. G. Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not saying more essential but &ldquo;as essential&rdquo;. I do not know the Parliamentary Secretary's home circumstances.  I am talking of the average man with a wife and a few children for whom there are items just as essential as food which are taxed and on which the VAT was increased.  Do not try to put that one across.  Over all, the household budget was increased.  Obviously, the increased yield from VAT this year will exceed all reasonable limits.  So, let us have it examined and let us have one budget aimed in the right direction to make up for all the budgets we have had in the wrong direction in the last few months.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is amazing that any Government speakers I have heard in this budget debate did not refer to price increases which are probably the one big factor <Col N="153" /> affecting every home, every farm, every housewife, every industry.  I remember only too well what the Minister for Finance said in February, 1973 before the election, that if elected, his Government would reduce prices, an area in which the Fianna Fáil Government had shown no concern. What concern have he and his Government shown in the time since February, 1973 to date?  Of course, the Arabs and outside pressures are being blamed but I have not heard any satisfactory explanation of the huge hoarding of coal, fuel and fertilisers that was allowed to take place. These were allowed to be stock-piled in every yard and were not given to the public.  There was a scarcity of all three until price increases were imposed. This also happened in regard to animal feeding stuffs.</P>
    <P>In honesty, the Minister should now admit that the situation is a free-for-all, absolutely beyond control, that he hopes to make extra revenue and that he will give benefits in some other way from it.  In saying this he would be honest with himself, with the House and with the people.  I do not think we need expect many increases to be announced between now and 18th June.  As happened on 3rd April, we will then have a springboard and a rush of increases.</P>
    <P>I hope the Parliamentary Secretary remembers what I said in my discussion on the budget last year about income tax as clearly as he remembers about football boots and roller skates. My involvement as a worker, as a PAYE contributor, and with workers over the years has educated me fairly well regarding the problems in this field.  To anybody who was familiar with the situation before the first attempt at a national wage agreement this year, it was obvious that if the Minister for Finance was not prepared to come out and say that some substantial allowance should be made to the PAYE contributors the national wage agreement would not be accepted. In case the Parliamentary Secretary doubts my sincerity I can produce evidence of a statement I made before the first attempt at settling the national wage agreement took place. <Col N="154" /> However, the Minister realised his mistake and intervened before the next meeting.  Promises were made and substantial allowances expected by PAYE contributors.  They expected that they would have a big reduction in their income tax contributions and something worthwhile in their take-home pay once the budget was over.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMKelly" hpid="Mr. Kelly Mr. Kelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Deputy realise that because it was very unusual, and justified only by the extreme importance of the national wage agreement, the Minister gave an undertaking of any kind in advance of the budget?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. G. Fitzgerald Mr. G. Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>This statement proves the Parliamentary Secretary's inexperience and lack of involvement at the levels that matter.  I agree wholeheartedly that that would have been an unusual step for a Minister for Finance to take, But, as I said, I can produce a copy of the <i>Cork Examiner</i> quoting a statement I made that it would be advisable for him to intervene, as he did later, before the national wage agreement was first rejected. I agree it would have been an unusual step but one must remember that for a Government to be strong, progressive and with it, they must be prepared to take unusual steps in unusual situations.  We are living in a changing world.  Unless a Minister&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I repeat, I have more experience of involvement with workers than the Parliamentary Secretary and I am in a better position to know the problems at that level than he.  We allegedly have in the Government a Labour Party, some members of which claim to be close to the workers.  They must have known, as anybody close to trade union members knew, that the national wage agreement at the first attempt was doomed to failure.  I would not like anybody to get the wrong impression by thinking that I would encourage this sort of thing, because I would not.  I am only too anxious, for the sake of the country, to see a national wage agreement carried through.  The Minister should take whatever sensible steps are necessary to see that it is carried through.</P>
      <P>The actual allowances given in the budget were far short of the promises made.  The increased allowances were only a pittance compared with expectations. Deputy J. Lynch and Deputy Colley have already explained in detail the size of the allowances necessary to keep them in line with the present inflation growth and restore them to the 1972 situation.</P>
      <P>I wish to refer to certain aspects of these allowances.  An explanatory document entitled &ldquo;The Principal Features of the Budget as Presented to Dáil Éireann&rdquo; was circulated with the budget on 3rd April.  According to this document a married man with three children who earns £2,000 a year saves £41.40.  If he earns £10,000 a year, he saves £320.70, which is approximately eight times the amount he would save if he were only earning £2,000 a year.  Yet we hear from the Coalition that they are a Government determined to help those in the lower and middle income brackets.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Many married men with three children are paying mortgages on their homes.  If they earned over £2,000 &mdash;as most men do because of overtime and bonuses&mdash;they had the interest <Col N="156" /> on those mortgages allowed at 35p in the £.  But under the new system interest will only be allowed at 26p in the £.  This means a loss of saving which is, in effect, an increase in mortgage payments.  The same applies to any life insurance policies they may have or any such benefits they may be getting on their income tax.  They are getting a smaller allowance than they would have under the old system.</P>
    <P>It was not surprising that the Minister for Industry and Commerce when speaking on this debate devoted the major portion of his contribution to attacking what Deputy J. Lynch and Deputy Colley said.  He spent some time lining up the allegiance of certain newspapers and picking selectively from one of them.  There is a tendency on the Government side to be critical of the Press and to expect them to print only what they, the Government would like to see printed. I hope the day never comes when we no longer have freedom of the Press.  They may be harsh at times; we may all be annoyed with them because they are unkind but no Minister of an Irish Government should endeavour to strangle or blame a paper for giving a particular view on any legislation.</P>
    <P>The case made in favour of the budget by the Minister for Industry and Commerce was weak.  It was obvious that he knew as well as we all know on this side of the House that the ordinary manual worker and white collar worker, the people who are the backbone of the country, were tricked with promises and were disappointed.  The speeches made with fire and venom by the Minister for Industry and Commerce, the Minister for Foreign Affairs and the Parliamentary Secretary in favour of the budget were in sharp contrast with the two contributions this evening. Obviously, during the recess their supporters throughout the country pointed out to them the defects in the budget.  They did not speak with conviction. They did not believe what they were saying.  They were trying to put a brave face on it.</P>
    <P>I would like to see the tax net <Col N="157" /> broadened and any benefits that accrued given to the PAYE contributors who contributed so much over the years but I must express my doubts about the timing of the White Paper and the intention behind it.  It was not only intended as a talking point or a launching ground for discussion on the taxation structure.  It was also designed to impress on the workers that so much was being done by the Government.  It is obvious that little thought was given to it. There are contradictions in it.  Not much research went into it.  We are not sure what tax will accrue even assuming that the figures in it are used.  It is not a thorough document. It looks as if it was produced in a hurry.  I hope I am not right in suspecting that it was a lever to help to achieve the national wage agreement and as a confidence trick to get the ordinary honest working people, the backbone of the country, to accept that agreement.</P>
    <P>I presume that the fact that the new tax system will not apply until July 1st was deliberately intended because of the local elections, in other words, before the full impact of the disappointing allowances will be felt by the majority of the people.  Possibly many people will not bother to check on what they are entitled to until they get their first wage packet and it is only then they will realise what was given to them by way of savings in tax.  With loud acclaim from the Labour benches the Minister shouted that he had increased personal allowances from so much to so much for single and married people.  There was a huge cheer from the Labour Party benches.  A little while later in a very low tone he announced that he had done away with the earned income allowance.  He was publicising what was good and playing down what was bad.  There was silence here on the second occasion.  It took a little while for the combined effect to sink in.  I think the overall situation sank in a good deal more during the recess and after 1st July the full effect will be more apparent and it will, to use a modern term, become a streaker in its own right and be exposed when it is fully implemented.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Industry and Commerce <Col N="158" /> referred to the myth of left and right.  I call it sheer nonsense to talk about left and right.  He tried to say what he thought the thinking of a Fianna Fáil Government would be or, to be more correct, what he would like it to be.  I will go into that in more detail later.</P>
    <P>Last year I mentioned a few points about income tax which I thought worthy of consideration and I should like to mention them again.  The first is the question of the old age pensioner. I outlined fairly clearly last year the case of the old age pensioner who was also drawing a small pension from his place of employment.  I took as an example a county council road worker who has a pension from the county council and his old age pension.  This man has probably reared a family.  He has worked for the State.  At the end of his days he is being taxed on the two pensions.  The Minister waved his hands and said: &ldquo;We will do wonderful things for you.  We will reform your tax structure.&rdquo; These people cannot understand why they have to pay tax at the end of their days.</P>
    <P>Last year I also mentioned men who have to travel to work.  I am not talking about all people who travel to work but people who work in particular types of employment.  Their place of employment is not regular. They move around from location to location and a car is an essential.  This type of traveller should get some income tax benefit.  I also feel that some concession should be given to the worker who does overtime.</P>

      <P>On the 28th of November, 1973, Deputy Tunney asked the Minister for Education whether he had instructed civil servants in his Department not to give any information to Dáil Deputies except through his private secretary and, if so, why?  The reply to the question was given by the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister who spoke about an instruction of longstanding <Col N="159" /> in the Department of Education in relation to telephone and written representations or requests made by Members of the Oireachtas.  Some time later, in reply to a supplementary question, the Parliamentary Secretary stated that it was an existing instruction which was in force in the period of office of his predecessor and of his predecessor's predecessor.  I happened to have been the Minister's predecessor and I would assume that an instruction could be in force only if I decided that it should be in force. I have already stated that I gave no such instruction.  Therefore, the argument that such an instruction was in force cannot be sustained.</P>
      <P>On the 6th of December, 1973, Deputy Tunney put down a further question to the Minister for Education and I quote:</P>
      <P>To ask the Minister for Education when the instruction to civil servants regarding the treatment of inquiries by Dáil Deputies was first issued; and the dates on which it was subsequently renewed.</P>
      <P>This appeared at col. 1,215 of the Official Report, vol. 269 of the 6th of December, 1973.  These questions were put down by Deputy Tunney when, on telephoning an official in the Department of Education, he was informed that the official was not permitted to reply to the Deputy's query unless the Deputy first telephoned the Minister's office and, more particularly, when Deputy Tunney discovered that any ordinary citizen, on telephoning the Department, could get this information without any need to get in touch with the Minister's office.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In his reply, on that occasion, the Minister stated that he did not know when the instruction was first issued but that it had been brought to the attention of his Department from time to time and most recently on the 2nd November, 1973, presumably by himself. I then stated that, during my term of office, no such instruction had been issued by me.  I pointed out that I regarded Deputies on all sides of the House as responsible people and that I considered the officials of <Col N="160" /> my Department quite capable of dealing with Deputies' queries.  I should like to add further that during my three and a half years in the Department of Education not only did I not issue such an instruction but I had never even heard that there had ever been such an instruction.</P>
    <P>I then asked the Minister, if during my term of office, he had had any discussions with officials of my Department and, if so, whether he had been referred to my office by the officials concerned before they would discuss a matter with him.  I understood the Minister to reply to the effect that he had had such discussions and that he had not been so referred and I continued my supplementaries on that basis.  Since then I note that he is reported in the Official Report as saying that he had been so referred, so obviously I did not hear him clearly.  I want to state emphatically that I know personally that the opposite was a fact and the Minister knows it.  I shall not go any further into that particular aspect.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Faulkner</NameTxt>
      <P>In other words, it is not properly reported.  I wish to put on record that, unless a Deputy contacted me personally, I never made any inquiry of my officials or of my own office about Deputies' queries.  I trusted the officials of my Department and I found that whatever might be the individual political loyalties of the various officials, they returned the confidence I placed in them in full measure.  There were occasions when Opposition Deputies got in touch with me personally, particularly Opposition spokesmen on Education, but this was their own decision.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Judging by the very justifiable furore created by Deputies in regard to the present Minister's directive on the matter under discussion, it is hardly <Col N="161" /> likely that each time Opposition Deputies telephoned the Department of Education during the three-and-a-half years I was Minister they would not have raised this matter in the Dáil time and time again if they were informed by the officials that they could not have the information without first acquainting the Minister's office.  The fact of the matter is that it was never raised in the House during my term of office simply because no directive had ever been issued by me.  During the period when I was Minister the officials did, in fact, reply directly on the telephone to Deputies.</P>
    <P>My main reason for raising this matter on the Adjournment is that when I again denied having issued any such directive, on the 6th of December, 1973, the Minister addressed the following question to me:</P>
    <P>Could I ask the Deputy if he was Minister on 5th of December, 1972?</P>
    <P>And he related this question to a document which he showed to the House and which he gave the House to understand was a directive.  The clear implication of the Minister's question to me was that the directive had been issued by me to my Department on the 5th December, 1972 instructing officials to refer all Deputies' queries to my office and not to reply to Deputies' queries until the matter had been cleared by my office or, to put it in very simple language, that I had, in fact, told a lie when I stated that no such directive had been issued by me.</P>
    <P>I did not follow up this matter there and then because, while I knew I had not issued any such directive, I could not be certain as to what the Minister was driving at and I decided to investigate the matter further before proceeding. My statement that no such directive was issued by me was true.  But the deplorable aspect of the whole matter is that the Minister knew that my statement was true when he referred on the 6th December, 1973 to the 5th of December, 1972, and the directive allegedly issued by me then. The Minister knew that the so-called directive of the 5th of December, 1972 was simply a note, on behalf of the Parliamentary Secretary, Michael <Col N="162" /> O'Kennedy, stating that the final decision on free school transport problems was his, as was his right and duty and this particular note, as the Minister well knows, referred to the school transport area only and had no bearing on any other section of this very large Department and we are fully aware of the background.</P>
    <P>However, there is another aspect of this matter which to me is a very serious one.  On leaving the House after Question Time on the 6th of December, 1973, the Minister travelled up in the lift with Deputy Liam Cunningham who had asked also a number of supplementary questions to Deputy Tunney's question. The Minister showed Deputy Cunningham the document purporting to be the directive issued by me but he did not permit him to read it.  He then told Deputy Cunningham&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="PadraigFaulkner" hpid="Mr. Faulkner Mr. Faulkner">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Faulkner</NameTxt>
      <P>The point is that the Minister told Deputy Cunningham to tell the Deputies of his party not to pursue this matter any further. I want to make it very clear that neither Deputy Cunningham nor I is betraying a private conversation here because the Minister told Deputy Cunningham to pass this information on to Deputies of the Fianna Fáil Party, and, of course, Deputy Cunningham passed the information on to me.  I will not deal with that any further.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As soon as I heard of the Minister's threat I was immediately aware of two things: first of all, the Minister was quite obviously skating on very thin ice and, secondly, and much <Col N="163" /> more important, the Minister recognised that in giving such a directive he had gone too far and the liberal image bestowed on the Government and himself by the media was in very grave danger because his action made a mockery of the so-called &ldquo;open government&rdquo; promised by the Coalition parties in the election.</P>
    <P>When this matter was brought out into the open by Deputy Tunney and myself the Minister's concern was to stop discussion on it and attempt to extricate himself from his difficulty by trying to place the responsibility elsewhere.  I deplore the action of the Minister in monitoring Deputies' queries to his Department in the way in which he is quite obviously doing it.  I do not care what precedents he can quote.  This is 1974 and it is, to say the least, distasteful and a poor reflection on people in public life when an ordinary citizen can get directly from an official of the Department of Education information denied to a Deputy unless the Deputy first acquaints the Minister's office of his query.  It is a very sad commentary, though by no means unexpected after the experience of the past year of &ldquo;open government&rdquo; by the Coalition.</P>
    <P>While I deplore the Minister's action, I want to emphasise I am not denying the Minister's right to instruct his officials to refer Deputies' queries to his office before a reply is forthcoming. If the Minister distrusts his officials and believes they are disloyal to him, or feels they may let him down, then, in such circumstances, one could understand a directive of the type we are discussing being issued but, as I said earlier, I can assure the Minister that, from my long experience, he will not find in any Department of State more loyal officials than those to be found in the Department of Education.  However, when the Minister does issue a directive, whatever the reason for it may be, let him stand on his own two feet and take responsibility for it&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>&mdash;&mdash;and not try, as he has done in this particular case, to escape responsibility for it by blaming his predecessor simply because he now realises that the issuing of this directive by himself has tarnished what he would like to believe is his image.</P>
      <P>I regret to say that the line pursued by the Minister in this particular case is typical of his general attitude.  I am sorry to have to say this.  Decisions taken by me to increase the number of primary teachers in training, for example, resulting in a better pupil/teacher ratio, and decisions finalised by me to make more scholarships available to the regional technical colleges, and so on, he claimed as his own.  On the other hand, decisions taken my me, which I believed in the circumstances were the correct ones, but which may not have been in the accepted sense of the word &ldquo;popular&rdquo;, he made sure to refer to my period in office with the well-worn phrase: &ldquo;I am honouring a decision of my predecessor&rdquo;.  The decisions in relation to Skerries school, Clonakilty school and Athenry school come to mind.  I made these decisions. I believed they were the right decisions and I was perfectly willing to stand over them.  One thing is clearly demonstrated and it is very pleasant for me now to know that the community school for which I fought so hard to ensure its acceptance by the people has now reached the stage at which there is no longer any need to fight to establish them but, rather, the problem is to supply sufficient of them.</P>
      <P>I would say to the Minister, if my decisions in respect of such matters were good, then let him admit they were good, or else pass them over in silence.  On the other hand, if he thinks they were bad, then it is his duty to change them.  Dodging the column will not get any of us very far.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When I was Minister I went through some very difficult times&mdash; I think that is generally acknowledged&mdash;pursuing policies which I believed to be in the interests of education. I fully recognise that at certain times information prematurely leaked <Col N="165" /> from the Department could have had very serious repercussions and could have created very difficult problems for me.  I can honestly say that during my time in office it never entered my head that my officials would in any way betray the trust I placed in them.  Those interested must, I am sure, find it hard to understand why the Minister for Education in office from July, 1969, should have waited until 1972 to issue a directive to the officials of his Department regarding Deputies' queries when, at that stage, he had overcome most of his problems and smoothed the way for his successor.</P>
    <P>During my term of office many people agreed with my policies.  Some disagreed.  But there was one thing everybody was agreed on: nobody doubted my integrity and this is one reason why I raise this matter on the Adjournment here tonight.  If the Minister has any doubt as to the interpretation of others outside the House of his query to me regarding who was in office on 5th December, 1972, I have already mentioned in reply to a supplementary question what was quoted in <i>The Irish Times</i> of the 7th December, 1973, by the columnist, and I quote:</P>
    <P>Yesterday when his hand was strong Dick could afford to be generous&mdash;</P>
    <P>I hope the Minister will excuse the use of his Christian name, but I am simply quoting&mdash;</P>
    <P>and when Pádraig Faulkner tried to leave the House with the impression that in his day, Deputies and Senators could come and go as they liked without having their calls routed through the Minister's office, Dick persisted that there was a directive on the matter.  The date on the directive was 5th of the 12th 1972.  By my reckoning it was in the time of Pádraig's stewardship in Education.</P>
    <P>It is clear from that, I think, that the obvious impression was that I had, in fact, issued the directive.  I want to say that Pádraig Faulkner did not try to leave anybody under any impression; he simply told the truth and I <Col N="166" /> would have thought the columnist in question, whatever his opinion of my policies or party, would have known me long enough to doubt that I had issued the directive.  I fail to see how any other interpretation could be put on the Minister's query.</P>
    <P>I note the Minister, in reply to a supplementary question, pointed out that this directive had been in operation since the 1920s.</P>

      <P>That is what is in the Official Report here.  Surely, in the year 1974, we are not going to rely any longer on directives of the 1920s or the 1930s.  Looking at the changes that have taken place in education during the years since the 1920s and the 1930s, it is not too much to ask now that that type of directive should be done away with.  In this year of 1974 the Minister should re-think the whole situation.  Deputies and Senators who hold responsible positions as elected representatives should not be treated as school children but should, rather, be recognised by the Minister for what they are, responsible people, and they should be given the right to make their queries without let or hindrance.  Where a particular difficulty arises, and difficulties will arise, the official concerned could always refer the matter to a higher official, or even to the Minister himself, should that be necessary.  But in general routine matters it is humiliating for a representative of the people to be told by an official that he cannot have a reply unless he applies to the Minister first</P>

      <P>In reply to the original <Col N="167" /> question put to me by Deputy Tunney on 28th November, 1973, I gave the gist of the long-standing instruction which has operated in the Department as follows:</P>
      <P>Telephone or written representations or requests made by Members of the Oireachtas will be replied to by the Private Secretary to the Minister or the Parliamentary Secretary as appropriate.</P>
      <P>I stated that the basis for the instruction to be as follows:</P>
      <P>I am sure that the reason behind the instruction was to ensure that the reply would be accurate, complete and prompt.</P>
      <P>I added that the identification of the caller also arose in the case of telephone calls and that the instruction applied to all Members of the Oireachtas.</P>
      <P>I intend, in replying to this Adjournment Debate, to concentrate on positive aspects and not to enter into argumentation except here and there on negative ones.  It is essential, in my view, that information to Deputies should issue through a central office, that being the office of the Minister.  Apart from anything else this allows for a good working relationship to develop between Deputies and the staff of my office which, in my view, can only lead to beneficial results for Members of the House.</P>
      <P>In the nature of things written representations take longer to answer than do telephone queries.  It may well be that a particular section of my Department to which a telephone call has been made by a Deputy may not be aware, due to a time lag, that written representations have been made on the same subject by another Deputy.  The Minister's office will be so aware and by dealing with the telephone query by one Deputy can ensure that the written representations of another are replied to at the same time, by telephone if necessary.  This, I think all Deputies will agree, is only as it should be.  I should stress that this procedure is followed in regard to Deputies from both sides of the House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="168" /> In regard to Deputy Faulkner's personal preoccupation with the matter it is to be hoped that it would be considered sufficient that he was informed in reply to his question on 28th March, 1974, as follows:</P>
    <P>No specific directive in this regard was issued by the Minister for Education during the period July, 1969 to March, 1973.</P>
    <P>It was never suggested that he had issued such a specific directive but his supplementary question on 6th December, 1973 was not in this form. In the Official Report it reads as follows:</P>
    <P>Therefore, would it not be proper that it should be recognised that no such directive was issued during my term of office?</P>
    <P>Deputy Faulkner must be aware at this stage that the reply to this question in this form could not be in the affirmative.  Nonetheless, a directive was issued from the Parliamentary Secretary, as has been stated in the House, in regard to how telephone calls from public representatives should be dealt with.  One of the main points in this directive was that information should not be given on the telephone but calls be replied to by letter only and that such letters be issued through the Parliamentary Secretary's office.</P>
    <P>In a supplementary question when the matter was last raised in the House Deputy O'Kennedy indicated that he issued a directive for a specific purpose.  While it is true that his directive arose out of a specific case, the directive, as Deputy Faulkner knows, gave explicit and general instructions in regard to how telephone calls to public officials should be dealt with.</P>
    <P>I wish I could get Deputies to accept that there was nothing sinister in my action in having the staff of my Department reminded of the long-standing procedure for dealing with representation from Deputies, whether orally or in writing.  The action was, in fact, taken in connection with my consideration of a situation where I felt that there may have been an undue delay in dealing <Col N="169" /> with certain inquiries which had been received.  The directive to the staff was associated with an exhortation and request to endeavour to have information made available as quickly as feasible in all cases.  In any large organisation, including a Department of State, certain procedures based on experience evolve over a period of years as the most suitable for the purpose of securing the most efficient, accurate and courteous service in the circumstances of the activities of that organisation.</P>
    <P>I find it no more extraordinary to have the staff of my Department reminded of the long-standing procedure with which they were, in general, familiar for dealing with correspondence and telephone inquiries from Deputies than the Parliamentary Secretary in my predecessor's time would appear to have found it in any way inappropriate for him to have a general directive issued to members of the staff dealing with school transport matters where the volume of inquiries, in relative terms&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="PadraigFaulkner" hpid="Mr. Faulkner Mr. Faulkner">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Faulkner</NameTxt>
      <P>That could not have been a general directive.</P>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. R. Burke Mr. R. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Burke</NameTxt>

      <P>Except to concede to Deputy Faulkner that the point he was making originally was correct. This, I think, was a fair concession to make.  I am not very surprised that Deputy Faulkner should not have been aware of the directive issued at the behest of his Parliamentary Secretary and it was precisely to draw his attention to that fact that the incident he refers to here took place.  It was precisely to alert his colleague to that particular fact that the conversation <Col N="170" /> referred to by Deputy Cunningham took place in the lift.  I had no intention of making Deputy Faulkner appear as if he did not know what was going on in his Department during his period of office.  It would appear that the Parliamentary Secretary regarded the matter as being in the interest of efficiency and effective administration and not requiring the specific approval of his Minister.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PadraigFaulkner" hpid="Mr. Faulkner Mr. Faulkner">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Faulkner</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. R. Burke Mr. R. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy should be patient and let me make my case. I am particularly anxious that Deputies should be supplied with the information to which they are entitled as promptly as is feasible and that this information should be accurate and comprehensive.  I accept that I have responsibility to ensure, in so far as it is possible to do so, that information given to Deputies is as reliable as that given in letters issued over my own name or that of my Private Secretary.</P>
      <P>Furthermore, in the case of telephone inquiries it is necessary to be satisfied that the telephone call is from whom it is stated to come.  If I am to discharge my responsibilities in this regard I must satisfy myself that the required procedures are adopted and observed.  I recognise also, and I believe Deputies do in general, that the relationships between Deputies and the civil servants are, of their nature, unusual.  The Deputy has a different role and function in respect of inquiries and representations which he may be making from that of an ordinary member of the public.  In this connection I stated in reply to a question on the 28th February that no Member of the Oireachtas is denied information which can be obtained by members of the public and I wish that Deputies opposite would stop chasing that hare.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not feel that it is necessary for me to expand on this aspect of the matter.  It is obvious and incontrovertible. <Col N="171" /> In fact, I would not need to refer to it only that the Deputy cast some aspersions on the suspected loyalty of civil servants.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PadraigFaulkner" hpid="Mr. Faulkner Mr. Faulkner">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Faulkner</NameTxt>
      <P>That is absolutely incorrect.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. R. Burke Mr. R. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>My attitude towards that loyalty is that I accept it as incontrovertible. The Irish Civil Service have a splendid record in regard to their impartial and objective service to all Governments irrespective of party political affiliations.  This means, however, that at any particular time the loyalty of the staff of a Department is primarily to the Minister in charge of the Department and not to Deputies, no matter what political party they may belong to.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I believe that an arrangement whereby contact between Deputies and members of the Civil Service is mainly through the office of the Minister is the best one in the interests of avoiding embarrassments on both sides.  I am not suggesting that protocol should be carried to excess or that it should be too rigidly observed in all procedures.  I stated in my reply to a <Col N="172" /> supplementary question in 1973 that if Deputies got in touch with my ministerial office they would be put through to the section directly and to the person at the highest possible level who would deal with the question and who would give them the information sought.  I regret if some Deputies do not find that a fair and reasonable arrangement but I have my responsibilities also and I mean to discharge them.  I do not wish to comment on the difficulties which Deputy Faulkner may have had with a commentator who got one impression or another&mdash;&mdash;</P>

The Deputy is a scholar and he knows what Irish means.  He can take his own interpretation from that.</P>

      <P>The actual rates in the £ adopted by county councils in the financial years 1973-74 and April-December, 1974, and the reductions estimated to have resulted from the Government's decision to remove health charges from the rates on a phased basis are set out in the schedule hereunder.  In calculating these reductions, it has been assumed that increases in the rates required for health services in these years would have been limited to the increase which obtained in 1972-73, in respect of each full year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="43" /> In addition to the rate reductions relating to the health charges, there are reductions arising from the phased transfer from local to central taxation of that part of the cost of local authority housing provided for letting which heretofore fell on the rates.  In the 1974 local financial year, the average reduction in county council rates under his head is estimated at 26p in £.</P>
