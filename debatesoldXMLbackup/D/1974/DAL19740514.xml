      <NameTxt>Parliamentary Secretary to the Taoiseach (Mr. Kelly)</NameTxt>
      <P>The index generally used to measure the rate of inflation is the consumer price index. It is assumed the Deputy is referring to financial years in the question.</P>
      <P>For the years 1971-72 the average of the four quarterly consumer price indexes in the year ending 31st March, 1972, was 8.8 per cent higher than the average of the four quarterly indexes in the year ending 31st March, 1971.</P>
      <P>The corresponding figures for the financial years 1972-73 and 1973-74 were 8.8 per cent and 12.3 per cent, respectively.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>Is there any particular reason why the figures the Parliamentary Secretary gave were computed on the basis of the average of four quarters as distinct from the actual increase between the beginning of a year and the end of a year?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Kelly</NameTxt>

It will be a number of years before the results of most of these are published as they involve extensive fieldwork.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>I assume the Deputy is referring to the diphtheria/tetanus/ pertussis vaccination.  I am aware that there have been reports in Great Britain of adverse reactions to the whooping cough component of this vaccination.  These reports have not caused the British authorities to alter their existing policy in favour of vaccination.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Whooping cough can be a serious and sometimes fatal disease.  There were two deaths from it last year in <Col N="1320" /> this country, one the year before, three the year before that and an average of three every year over the last ten years.  Vaccination against it provides a reliable immunity.  All vaccines can cause reactions and there is some evidence that on rare occasions these reactions can be serious.  Replies to a recent questionnaire sent to county medical officers regarding the diphtheria/pertussis/ tetanus immunisation procedures did not result in any reports being received of serious adverse effects from it.</P>
    <P>The position of all vaccines in use in this country is kept under constant review by my Department in association with the county medical officers of health who are primarily responsible for the implementation of the immunisation schemes.  A meeting has been arranged between officers of my Department and a representative group of CMOs later this month at which immunisation procedures will be reviewed.</P>

      <P>The person referred to by the Deputy claimed, on her own insurance, maternity allowance and maternity grant in respect of a confinement expected 13th March, 1974. She is not qualified for payment as she does not satisfy the contribution condition which requires a claimant to have a minimum of 26 contributions in the contribution year governing the claim.  She was so informed <Col N="1322" /> on 7th February, 1974. Inquiries as to the possible nonstamping of the insurance card for the period July, 1972, to June, 1973, have been made and the matter is still under investigation.  As soon as the investigations are completed the claim to benefit will be reviewed.  The maternity grant due by virtue of the husband's insurance was paid on 23rd April, 1974.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>I am aware of the dispute referred to by the Deputy which is essentially one between two affiliated unions of the Irish Congress of Trade Unions.</P>
      <P>As indicated on the 25th April last by my colleague, the Minister for Labour, in his reply to a question from Deputy Gene Fitzgerald, Congress have been trying to settle this dispute under their procedures for dealing with disputes of this kind.  In the circumstances I consider it would be inappropriate for me to say anything further at this stage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanDaly" hpid="Mr. Daly Mr. Daly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Daly</NameTxt>
      <P>Has the Minister taken any steps to resolve the dispute?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>I made it clear I do not think it would be proper for me at this stage to interfere in the matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. G. Fitzgerald Mr. G. Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sure the Minister knows about the unexpended balances in Cork&mdash;the matter was discussed recently in this House.  I understand similar situations are arising in other counties, in addition to the fact that work to rule seems to operate in all counties.  In view of the considerable time lost last year and the disruption being caused this year, I would ask the Minister or the Minister for Labour to intervene personally at this stage to see if something can be done about this long-standing dispute.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister for Labour has tried to get an agreed basis of settlement between the unions.  This is a matter in which the Minister for Labour can do certain things but I do not think I should interfere.  The position is that there are two trade unions involved.  One insists that their trade union will be recognised in the C and A scheme. The other says that if they are they will go on strike.  I do not think that this is a matter in which the Minister for Local Government could possibly get involved.  It is purely a matter which the trade unions must settle between themselves.  They have certain machinery for doing that and I understand that at the present time they are trying to do so.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister not agree that his colleague, the Minister for Labour, has shown greater interest in the bus dispute, which affected only Dublin, than in the engineering dispute?  He must be concerned at the effect this dispute is having on the ordinary works programme of the various local authorities which were affected.  Would the Minister give us any indication as to whether the Minister for Labour will involve himself more actively in this dispute?</P>

I am sure the Minister for Local Government will be pleased to help in this matter.</P>

      <P>The employment of lifeguards at bathing places and the provision of water safety equipment at any place, including small fishing harbours, where they consider such equipment is likely to be of use, are matters for sanitary authorities.  They are encouraged by my Department to take all necessary precautions to safeguard against drowning accidents at such places.

      <P>I have not got that information but I am glad to tell Deputy Daly that Clare, which is the Deputy's constituency, is one of the front runners in the field of water safety.  The county council employ 30 lifeguards at nine centres, including <Col N="1338" /> one lake, during the summer season.  They also provide a lifeguard service on an <i>ad hoc</i> basis at other coastal points on special occasions. The Clare County Committee of the Irish Water Safety Association are one of the most active of the county committees.

      <P>My understanding is that there is not evidence to enable differences in life expectancies in this country as between urban and rural dwellers to be attributed to pollution or to support the statement that air pollution is one of the major causes of illness here.</P>
      <P>Air and other pollution can, of course, be associated with illness.  The effects of pollution, including the health effects, are being studied under the EEC environment programme and otherwise internationally.

The problems which would arise from the adoption of a common imputation system, including provisions for a measure of relief of double taxation of dividends, are at present being discussed at meetings of a working party of the Commission in Brussels to which the member States, including this country, send representatives and formal proposals will be submitted by the Commission to the council in due course.</P>

      <P>The directive on mountainous and other agriculturally less-favoured areas, the terms of which have already been agreed to in principle by the Council of Ministers, is designed to complement Directive 159/72 on the modernisation of farms. The aim of the measure is to raise farm incomes in the areas concerned in order to ensure the continuation of farming and thereby to maintain a minimum level of population and to conserve the countryside.</P>
      <P>The special system of aids for the less-favoured areas may include a supplementary income payment in the form of a livestock headage grant, higher investment aids for development farmers, aid for joint investment projects and the continuation of national aids to farmers who do not come into the development category.</P>
      <P>A list of the areas in this country in which the directive might be applied is at present being prepared for submission to the EEC Commission. It will be a matter for the Council of Ministers to approve of the lists from the various member states when these have been examined and cleared by the Commission.</P>
      <P>The FEOGA contribution to the livestock headage payments also remains to be settled by the Council of Ministers but it will be not less than 25 per cent or more than 50 per cent. In the case of any other aids qualifying for Community financing the FEOGA contribution will be the same as under Directive 159 namely 25 per cent of the expenditure incurred by the member state.  There will, of course, be no FEOGA contribution to national aids extended to farmers outside the development category.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JustinKeating" hpid="Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. Keating) Justin Keating">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. Keating)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The operation of building societies is governed by the Building Societies Acts, 1874 to 1942.  The purpose of the Bill now before the House is to simplify the procedures required under the Acts in effecting a merger <Col N="1359" /> of societies and to make provision for the guaranteeing by the Minister for Finance of certain borrowings by building societies.</P>
    <P>It has been represented by the Building Societies Association that section 33 of the Building Societies Act, 1874, and section 19 of the Building Societies Act, 1894, which deal with amalgamations and mergers of societies&mdash;or unions and transfers of engagements as they are called in the Acts&mdash;were unworkable in practice since they required any society involved in a union or transfer to obtain the consent in writing of the holders of two-thirds of all its shares. The difficulty of fulfilling this requirement will be appreciated when it is realised that some of the bigger societies may have 30,000, or more, shareholders; societies of this magnitude were not envisaged when the present legislation in this regard was enacted.</P>
    <P>The building society movement in this country is unduly fragmented and its rationalisation is desirable on a number of grounds.  First of all, a general trend towards larger and fewer societies should mean greater efficiency and economy throughout the movement as a whole and should give savings in general management expenses. Such savings should lead to the provision by the societies of a better service for both borrowers and shareholders.  From the point of view of the housing programme, rationalisation is desirable to ensure better co-ordination in the use of the very substantial amounts which the societies now provide in housing loans and to strengthen the financial standing of the movement as a whole.</P>
    <P>I am aware that at the present time preliminary steps have been taken towards at least one desirable merger of existing societies.  It would be unfortunate if the unduly onerous requirements of the existing Acts were to prevent the implementation of such mergers.  Having considered this situation carefully, the Government decided that, notwithstanding the fact that a comprehensive review of the Building Societies Acts is being undertaken the present short measure <Col N="1360" /> should be promoted with a view to providing a remedy for the practical difficulties which could otherwise arise.</P>
    <P>Under the law as it stands a union or transfer of engagements is a two-stage process.  Firstly, the proposal must be agreed at a general meeting of each society by three-fourths of the members present and, secondly, the agreement must be confirmed in writing by the holders of not less than two-thirds of the whole number of shares of each society.  Sections 2 and 4 of the Bill aim to simplify this rather cumbersome procedure by reducing the majority required for the first stage to a simple majority, and by providing for confirmation of the union or transfer by the Registrar of Friendly Societies as an alternative to the second stage.  This alternative is seen as being much more practical compared with the procedure of seeking the approval in writing of, perhaps, some tens of thousands of shareholders. When the procedure of confirmation in writing by the members was written into the legislation a century ago, the existence of societies with some tens of thousands of members was hardly envisaged.  The procedure of confirmation in writing is not being abolished and it can continue to be used as an alternative to the new procedure provided for in the Bill.</P>
    <P>The purpose of Section 3 is to make statutory provision for the guarantee by the Minister for Finance of special borrowing facilities which, at the instance of the Minister for local Government and in co-operation with the Minister for Finance and the Central Bank, were arranged in October last between the Associated Banks and certain building societies. The background to this provision is that the Minister for Local Government became aware that in the light of the trends in interest rates which prevailed in 1973 and the resultant uncertainties in relation to the inflow of new funds, the societies found it difficult to assume forward commitments for loans on a scale appropriate to the needs of the private housing programme and of the house-building industry.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1361" /> A series of discussions on this problem took place among the parties involved.  It was clear that the societies' needs were not for immediate recourse to borrowing facilities but for an assurance that, in the event of their embarking on an expanded programme of loan approvals, fall-back borrowing facilities would be available to them at a later stage to meet any shortfall that the expansion might create in their net inflow of new funds.  The Associated Banks, I am glad to say, co-operated fully in making available the kind of facility that was seen to be required and the societies for their part responded positively by means of an immediate relaxation of their lending policies. The total amount involved in the arrangement was £6 million, this amount to be drawn on at any time up to 30th June, 1974, and is to be repaid during the period of 12 months commencing in July, 1975.  The provision in relation to the guarantee which is set out in the section is standard.</P>
    <P>The Bill now before the House is aimed principally at the rationalisation of societies by simplifying the procedures for unions and transfers of engagements.  It is relevant, I think, to mention in this connection that I have become aware recently, in the context of my responsibility for the registry of friendly societies, that there has been an inordinate rush to register new building societies.  It appears that the increased activity is related to the Government's proposal to introduce comprehensive new legislation governing all aspects of building society operations.</P>
    <P>I think it is right that I should use this occasion to emphasise that the comprehensive Building Societies Bill will provide for new requirements in connection with the establishment and registration of societies and that we regard it as reasonable that means should be found of ensuring that societies which have been registered as a result of the recent spate of applications, and other societies which, in effect, have evolved from a reactivation of old and dormant societies, will comply with the requirements to be prescribed for new <Col N="1362" /> societies.  There is, therefore, nothing to be gained in terms of legislative control by registering a society now rather than after the comprehensive legislation comes into force.  It is well, I feel, that persons who are thinking of setting up new societies or who are engaged in the preliminary processes involved in the registration of new societies should be made fully aware of this situation.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JosephBrennan" hpid="Mr. Brennan Mr. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>There is not very much in this short Bill, but I am glad the Minister has promised us what he describes as a comprehensive Bill later.  If this promise had not been made, we would all have been very anxious in regard to the whole question of building societies, especially having regard to the amount of controversy that surrounded the operation of these institutions recently. Originally we were aghast at being offered a Bill dealing only with two simple aspects of the situation and not dealing with the fundamental issue that must be tackled&mdash;the overall functioning of the building societies.  These institutions are of great importance because of their role in the housing programme.</P>
      <P>Without wishing to impute any motives, it would appear to me that the question of union dealt with in the Bill is merely a front for what is the real purpose of the Bill, that is, to make provision for moneys that have been borrowed already from the Associated Banks.  I refer to the £6 million which, in panic, the Minister for Local Government beseeched the Associated Banks to lend to the building societies at a time when these institutions were themselves in trouble because of the unbridled escalation of inflation.  The banks responded to the crack of the whip and lent the money, apparently without any guarantee.  This Bill seeks, in retrospect, to guarantee that the Exchequer will be responsible for that money and, ultimately, for the collection of it from the building societies, together with interest and in accordance with whatever terms the Minister may arrange.  I assume that is the real purpose of the Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister is making it easier for <Col N="1363" /> building societies to transfer their engagements.  Perhaps it is of some significance that there is a proliferation of building societies taking place. There would not seem to be any great demand for cohesion, for the formation of fewer but larger and stronger societies.  Regarding the statement that there is a spate of applications for new societies I should like the Minister to elaborate further in this regard in view of his having told us that in future there will be new requirements for qualification to comply with the comprehensive legislation promised.  Is it meant by that that those societies registering now in accordance with existing regulations may be deregistered when the new legislation is enacted?  The Minister has stated that they will not be exempted from the new regulations to be contained in the future legislation.</P>
    <P>While the building societies are doing a tremendous job there are times when I fear for those who must seek assistance from them.  I refer to the difficulties involved so far as the borrower is concerned.  For instance, he is tied hand and foot before receiving the assistance required.  Perhaps this is not relevant to the Bill, but it is an area that one would hope would be included in the future Bill to which the Minister referred and which will be introduced, we are told, when the probing into the operations of the building societies has been completed.</P>
    <P>There is some degree of simplification required in regard to the procedure of obtaining loans.  One of the first requirements of the societies is that an applicant must have insurance cover and, although he may be insured already, that insurance may not be considered sufficient and the applicant may have to become insured with, perhaps, another insurance company and one that may be nominated by the building society.  Any expenses incurred in this way, together with fees and so on, are usually paid for out of the loan so that by the time the borrower receives the money a large proportion may have been deducted already.  Any borrower I have ever spoken to has indicated his exasperation with the whole procedure. <Col N="1364" /> The delays involved in the payment of loans often force people to resort to bridging loans in respect of which they pay to the finance firms an interest rate of 19 per cent.  This interest may have to be paid for a protracted period, usually much longer than anticipated, with the result that a huge amount of interest would have been paid before the loan from the building society becomes available.</P>
    <P>The stage has been reached when the building societies are indispensable in so far as the construction industry, both public and private, is concerned.  It is my hope that the Minister will be forced to adopt what is Fianna Fáil policy in relation to the updating of these institutions, that is, that they be relieved from income tax liability and so, enabled to grant loans at a lower rate of interest to the borrowers.  The removal of income tax could result in the temptation to pass the advantage to the investors but legislation could be framed so as to ensure that the main benefit would go to the borrower.  Perhaps a percentage should go to the investor, because to attract money at present the building societies have to have reasonably attractive rates of interest, and while there are so many other financial institutions competing who are paying such high rates of interest to investors, the building societies must find it difficult to get the necessary funds to carry on the work they are doing.  Therefore, while relief from income tax is essential and, as I say, is official Fianna Fáil policy, we must ensure that not all the benefit of that relief is passed on to attract better investment by way of giving a higher interest rate on investment but that it would go mainly to the borrowers by way of lower interest rates on loans.  This Bill has got nothing to do with that, but the Minister has, I am glad to say, promised a comprehensive Bill dealing with the working of building societies generally.  It is a very welcome pronouncement, and I would like to say on behalf of this side of the House, with all sincerity that the sooner he can produce that comprehensive <Col N="1365" /> legislation the better.  We shall then have an opportunity of going into this whole serious matter of lending for residential building purposes.</P>
    <P>I would hope that at that stage the Minister would take the opportunity of having a serious look at this whole question of mortgages.  The recent decision by the Government regarding secondhand houses has caused quite serious problems.  People who are buying new houses cannot get rid of the houses in which they are living as readily as they might.  In other words, this has succeeded in depressing the market without conferring any benefit on the purchaser. A more serious move could not be taken.  That is the factual position as a result of the change made in regard to mortgage limits.  These things are of great importance to our entire society, and the Minister's announcement about further legislation will help to allay the anxiety of people who felt that this Bill was the be all and end all of what we might expect in relation to building societies.</P>
    <P>In regard to mergers of societies, the Minister says here that instead of a three-fourths majority of shareholders being required for agreement to the proposal, there would be substituted a simple majority; that instead of the requirement to write to all the shareholders, a statutory notice would appear in <i>Iris Oifigiúil</i> or some other paper stating that any objections should be forwarded within 21 days. This provision is understandable.  The law as it stands is an example of legislation which has become obsolete by time.  However, as I say this is a very simple Bill in so far as it relates only to that matter.  The Minister is aware that there is one merger due to take place and I accept what the Minister says; I had a suspicion myself that it was to take retrospective action to secure moneys that had been handed out last year in a time of panic by the associated banks when the building societies found themselves in real trouble.  However, whether that is correct or not, I do not think that we on this side of the House would have any <Col N="1366" /> serious objection to this Bill, particularly when the Minister assures us that comprehensive legislation is being introduced.  At the same time, I would like the Minister to give us time to have a look at the Bill before Committee Stage in case there may be reason to have some simple amendments proposed.  I do not propose to deal at any length now with the Bill as such.  As I say, while the Bill deals with two important matters, they in no way affect the serious problems which lie at the root of the building societies <i>vis-á-vis</i> our economy, namely, building for residential purposes, the construction industry generally, and the future of building societies.</P>
    <P>If there is a spate of applications for registration of building societies, which is undoubtedly prompted by the expectation of stricter regulations, the Minister would want to examine the matter carefully.  I can understand finance companies who are lending for types of building other than residential building being in a position to pay higher rates on investment and getting higher rates from borrowings but if building societies are confined to lending for residential building and doing a social service, as by and large they are supposed to do in that respect, I cannot understand that there would be a rush for registration of new companies at a time like this when there are so many other opportunities for investing money at high interest rates.  However, perhaps what the Minister says is based on the knowledge that there is a spate of applications coming in for registration and that they are seeking to beat the dateline of what might be more stringent registration requirements later on.  The Minister will, I am sure, clarify the position when he comes to wind up, whether what he says is another way of stating that such societies will find themselves not registered, that if new regulations are brought in they would be retrospective to a date which might be justifiably regarded as being a date at which these people could be suspected of trying to register in anticipation of stricter regulations, the deadline for which they tried to beat.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1367" /> I would be prepared to facilitate the early passage of this Bill through the House except that, as I have already said, we should have some time before the Committee Stage to put forward amendments.  As regards the guarantees for the £6 million which has already been handed out to the societies since 18th October last, the terms and conditions are to some extent at the Minister's discretion. Perhaps it might be necessary to spell out the period over which the money must be repaid with interest. Section 3 (1) (a) states:</P>
    <P>The Minister for Finance may, if he so thinks fit, guarantee in such form and manner and on such terms and conditions as he thinks fit the due repayment by a society of the principal of any moneys borrowed by the society from an Associated Bank between the 18th day of October, 1973, and 30th day of June, 1974, or the payment of interest on such moneys or both repayment of the principal and the payment of the interest and any such guarantee may include a guarantee of payment of incidental expenses arising in connection with such borrowings.</P>
    <P>It is obvious from that section that the conditions the Minister will apply are vague, that he may impose such terms as he considers appropriate in the case of both principal and all the interest.  Is this a matter to be negotiated with the people who have borrowed the money or the people from whom it was borrowed?  Naturally, those who have borrowed would seek to get the most generous terms possible in regard to repayment.  Was any guarantee given, verbal or written, at the time?  On what conditions did the associated banks issue the £6 million?  How do they expect it to be repaid?  Was there an assurance that the finance companies would be in a position to repay it over a period? Was there an assurance that the Government would come in with a guarantee such as is enshrined in this Bill?</P>
    <P>To a great extent this is an unusual <Col N="1368" /> procedure in that it provides for guarantees in retrospect after the money has been borrowed.  I should like to be in a position where I could go to my banker and say that I wanted £6,000 or £6 million and that he would get a guarantee sometime next year that he would get it back. Banks do not usually part with money on terms as loose as that.  I take it they had some assurance that such a guarantee would be given.  These are points on which the Minister will, no doubt, elaborate when replying, if I am reading the Bill rightly&mdash;perhaps I am not.  To me it appears to be unprecedented. At the same time, I see no objection to the Bill.  I believe the necessary guarantees must and should be given.  I am pleased that the comprehensive legislation about which we are all concerned will be forthcoming and, I hope, in the near future.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnGrattanEsmonde" hpid="Mr. Esmonde Mr. Esmonde">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Esmonde</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Bill. I am aware that difficulties have been encountered by developers.  When they have looked for support and finance from building societies where the development is a large one they have found difficulty in obtaining the business interest of a building society in the development in view of the amount of money involved.  This appears to indicate that there are few societies in the country of a size sufficient to deal with the larger developments. In some cases I think developers have sought to come to an arrangement with financial institutions outside the country in order to get finance.  When a developer wants to develop a considerable area of property he must prefer to have one building society with which to deal because that building society would study and know the title to the property and the various details associated with the building development and subsequent leasing to purchasers. This makes for ease of management and means in effect that when the first two houses have been erected and leased or sold the title to the other houses follows in the same pattern.  That suggests the requirement of further legislation which will no doubt be considered by the <Col N="1369" /> Government because it seems a little ridiculous that the purchaser of the last house in a 200 or 300-house estate has to pay the same fee to the society's solicitors as the first person had to pay when the title is exactly the same and the investigations and requisitions are just automatic.  It is really 200 repetitions of the first case. These matters require looking into.</P>
      <P>I am also glad that the Minister has referred to this future legislation and in particular to the spate of applications for new registrations of building societies.  I am a bit doubtful as to whether the full reason is that pending legislation might affect the building societies situation.  My own information and knowledge indicate that some of these registrations are for motives other than those suggested by the Minister in his opening statement.  I think many of them have been made for the purposes of a certain tax structure availed of by developers.  That type of situation indicates an unhealthy condition in the world of building societies, a situation which I am certain existing orthodox societies would not like to see continuing or developing.  When that situation is created the viability and trustworthiness of these many new societies&mdash;if I may so describe them&mdash;may be in doubt.  I think it is necessary to have a tightening up in existing legislation which, as indicated by the Minister, goes back to 1874.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As this Bill is here for a specific purpose I do not intend to make any other remarks in relation to building societies and legislation except to agree with Deputy Brennan that the unfortunate borrowers nowadays have to go through a mountain of difficulties before they can obtain loans from building societies.  Although it may annoy certain people associated with the building society movement I think it is fair to recall the saying: &ldquo;Big fleas have little fleas on their backs...&rdquo;  It is a well known fact that in relation to the obtaining of money from building societies there are many people obtaining commissions in relation to loans or insurance, a matter which has been <Col N="1370" /> referred to by Deputy Brennan. Some people obtain commissions on that type of activity.  I should like to see that type of activity cut out because if there is to be any justification for the establishment of further branches of building societies it should be unnecessary to have these agents for building societies.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnFOConnell" hpid="Dr. O'Connell Dr. O'Connell">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Connell</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome this Bill in so far as it makes some effort at rationalising building societies.  It is well accepted that building societies have come in for considerable criticism in recent times, and justifiably so.  Many Deputies may have seen the &ldquo;7 Days&rdquo; programme on building societies.  I was astonished that an inquiry was not instituted immediately into the activities of some societies as a result of that programme because we saw an open admission on it by a director of a building society that there were abuses of building societies rules and regulations.</P>
      <P>In this Bill we are talking about rationalising building societies and guaranteeing certain borrowings by building societies, but we are doing nothing about the blatant abuses of the rules and regulations by certain societies in this city.  After hearing about block loans being made I wondered why we did not have an immediate inquiry.  It is a really serious abuse where a building society can favour a particular builder and offer him massive loans. This gives him an unfair advantage over other builders and at the same time confines borrowers to a particular type of house.  This is not in keeping with the purpose for which building societies were established.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We saw on this programme also where there was favouritism in regard to family interests, where money was advanced for purposes other than the purchase of houses. This is an open abuse of the building societies' rules and regulations.  I was astonished, having heard that, that we did not have a public inquiry, particularly in view of the fact that building societies are receiving special tax concessions from the Government. <Col N="1371" /> I feel very strongly about building societies and I wonder why we did not have some form of inquiry into them.</P>
    <P>The Government should be in a position to have an inquiry into block loans, family interests obtaining money, companies under different names receiving money that should have gone to the public, and money being advanced for purposes other than houses&mdash;for big businesses, office blocks, public houses and so on.  This all calls for an inquiry into how building societies are carrying on their affairs.</P>
    <P>We should also have an inquiry into the excessive spending on advertising by the building societies.  I hope that this rationalisation will put an end to this unnecessary spending which in the long run must be borne by the members and the would-be borrowers.  In my view it is also wrong that a solicitor to a building society should be a director of that society.  This is a fact in the case of one particular building society in Dublin.  I am astonished that there is no means by which these societies can be made to conform to the rules and regulations under which they were established.  There must be some control when the Government can guarantee money and finance for these societies.</P>
    <P>I can recall mentioning in the Dáil some years ago about a building society introducing a special rule whereby a man anxious to go forward as a director of the company must submit his name by the December before the annual general meeting. However there is a rule whereby a man can be expelled from a society without being given any reason.  This was used in a particular case to prevent the man putting his name forward as a director of the society.  A number of other methods were tried but he was prevented by this new regulation introduced by the society itself, with the approval of the registrar of building societies.  This was an open violation of the rules of building societies, but again nothing was done about it.</P>
    <P>If one attends the annual general meeting of one building society one <Col N="1372" /> sees the farcical thing that happens. If anyone tries to go forward as a director he finds he has not access to the list of members of the society. The family of one of the directors of this society is on the board; they control the whole lot.  This is a major building society, the building society in Ireland, and one family controls it. It is astonishing to think that this can happen when we talk about Government control and the Government guaranteeing the borrowings.  This is not right.</P>
    <P>We should have some investigation into the rules and regulations of building societies to see that they comply.  I wonder what is the purpose of the building societies setting up branch offices throughout the country. We have more branch offices of building societies in Dublin than ever before and I wonder are they justified. Is it correct for an auctioneer to have a building society adjacent to his own auctioneering office?  Is this ethical? In my view it is a serious matter and a matter which should be pursued by the Minister concerned.  When we talk about rationalising building societies we should consider these matters.  We should also see that the annual general meetings of building societies are held at a time when it is possible for ordinary members to attend&mdash;for instance, in the evening time.  On a number of occasions I have forwarded complaints regarding this matter to the building societies and they informed me that nothing could be done.  There should be some provision for the ordinary members of those societies to have a say in the running of those societies.</P>
    <P>We should see to it that the incidentals which arise when a borrower is obtaining a loan from a society should be streamlined.  There are many other expenses added on besides the interest rate which make it very hefty for the ordinary borrower. Some effort should be made to reduce these expenses to the minimum.  The agency fee is wrong and the commission charged by building societies for insurance on houses should be eliminated.  This is an unnecessary burden on the ordinary borrower and <Col N="1373" /> attempts should be made to put an end to it once and for all.  This is the way we should talk about rationalising building societies and if we do this we will be doing something positive for the ordinary person who is overburdened by the present high interest rates.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EugeneTimmons" hpid="Mr. Timmons Mr. Timmons">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Timmons</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to be associated with the remarks of Deputy Brennan in welcoming this measure as a first step forward towards the eventual rationalisation of building societies.  It is true that some societies have departed from the original idea they were founded for. Fianna Fáil set up an inquiry into the activities of the societies, and I understand an interim report has been presented.  However, I believe it has not yet been finalised and that other investigations are being carried out.  I represent the constituency of NorthEast Dublin where there are a big number of people who obtained mortgages from building societies.  There is a growing feeling of uneasiness and dissatisfaction among the community that could lead to social unrest.  This has arisen because of the crippling burden of interest rates these people have to bear.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Any young married man is faced with repayments of between £12 and £15 per week out of his income to building societies.  In some cases it is a lot higher.  Organisations in the city who have taken this matter up and have held public meetings are gaining support in their efforts to change this system.  It is my view that where people are endeavouring to provide their own home they should not be burdened by an unfair rate of interest.  The high repayments are crippling the young couples and leading to serious domestic problems and medical problems.  I know of women who are worried because apart from this huge commitment involved in providing their own homes they have other commitments from the point of view of goods and certain charges and, on top of that, they are placed in the predicament of having to travel many miles into the centre of the city.  They are, as it were, living in isolation and this is producing a <Col N="1374" /> serious social problem.  From meetings in my own constituency I know that this can lead to social unrest. The Minister and the Government should give an indication as to what policy is with regard to housing, whether it be local authority housing or housing in the private building sector.  The matter is a serious one from a social point of view.</P>
    <P>Reference has been made to charges which the unsuspected borrower is not fully aware of when he goes to borrow money.  A very high fee has to be paid before a loan is processed and there are incidental charges against the loan.  Following on that the borrower has to raise the balance of the money.  All these are matters to which we must address ourselves on a technical measure like this.  I feel very strongly about this because so many people trying to buy their own houses are affected.  I appeal to the Minister to give some indication of what Government policy is in this very serious social matter.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. B. Desmond Mr. B. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>I appreciate the fact that this Bill is of a restrictive nature.  Its purpose is twofold.  First of all, it is designed to simplify procedure affecting mergers and, secondly, to provide a guarantee by the Minister for Finance of special borrowing facilities by the societies. The Bill is a narrow Bill but a very necessary Bill.  It is one both sides of the House welcome.</P>
      <P>I want now to refer to the undesirable rush of registration and pending registrations of new building societies in recent years, particularly in the last 18 months.  In my opinion, a prestigious name or a name with historical connotations may overtly give the impression of major standing in the community.  I want to make it very clear that such a title is no assurance whatsoever of financial viability or propriety.  I hold that view very strongly.  This is something the public should be made aware of in regard to all societies but particularly in regard to the newer registrations.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I also have reservations about some <Col N="1375" /> of the advertising that goes on.  We do not have the protection of a Trades Description Act.  We have no protection against misleading information, information which may give the impression that money invested in these societies automatically goes into social benefits.  In fact, a higher proportion of investment, as many of us know, of some of the new building societies goes into nothing other than spurious fronts for the purpose of personal property speculation.  People who are investing money in these newer societies should inquire of the directors as to whether or not their money is being invested in houses or in office blocks, in houses or in shopping centres, in houses or in personal loans to the directors so that they may be enabled to convert, for example, houses into flats to provide lucrative incomes for themselves.</P>
    <P>I strongly support the original purpose of building societies.  That purpose was and still overwhelmingly is to provide money for housing.  By and large, building societies still observe that fundamental principle.  I have, however, some misgivings about the role played and I shall come back to that later on.  The original purpose of some societies has been distorted because of the activities of fly-by-night speculators, mostly Irish, who are now screaming their heads off about the wealth tax.  They are setting up new building societies or re-activating dormant ones and enjoying the cream of the tax concessions.  Outdated legislation is being used for the purpose of tax avoidance.</P>
    <P>I welcome the warning given by the Minister that these people will find themselves caught retrospectively. I am no great lover of retrospective legislation but when I see Irish speculators benefiting themselves through the medium of the loopholes in the 1874 to 1942 Acts, and taking advantage of the situation, I sincerely hope the Minister will sting them sharply and painfully retrospectively under legislation which will be introduced later this year.  I know the Minister is anxious to have this legislation as quickly as possible.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1376" /> In making these harsh comments I want in no way to affect public investment in established and reputable building societies.  About 60 per cent of loans to people to purchase their own homes is provided by these societies.  A warning&mdash; which is not political but personal&mdash;that one might give to Irish people would be to be extremely careful and well-advised and to invest only with the more reputable and established building societies. They should not be taken in by any high-faluting name which might be thrust at them.  In future legislation the Minister should ensure that there are rigorous safeguards in relation to investment.  This is outside the scope of the Second Reading of this Bill.  As registrar the Minister should ensure that in future there will be very fundamental protection for investors, both by regulation and by statute. These are my reactions.</P>
    <P>Finally, I think we may have to face up to a situation where the social and economic role of the building societies may have to be changed.  In the long-term I believe that the State in the common good should have an expanded role in investment, particularly in relation to the provision of money for essential housing.  It may be that in the long-term we shall see the establishment of State-sponsored national building societies.  This is overdue.  We have not had such a company.  Many European countries have such societies.  I should be glad to see the setting up of a State-sponsored national building society on the lines of the ESB which would provide gilt-edged investment opportunities for the people and, above all, a guarantee that the people's money will be used to build houses and not to build up the personal fortunes of those who abuse the building societies' structures.</P>
    <P>That is a comment I wanted to make.  I am acutely aware that this would require a major change in the social and political attitudes of our people.  An increasing number of questions are being asked about the operations of building societies.  I feel that the people will come around to <Col N="1377" /> that point of view.  They will not regard it as socialist heresy that somebody should advocate in Dáil Éireann the setting up of a State-sponsored national building society.  The people have been stung a little bit recently by inflation in some of the charges of some of the building societies.  I refer particularly to charges relating to servicing, advertising and legal fees rather than to mortgage interest rates. There is little one can do about mortgage interest rates except provide a State subsidy.  I do not believe in subsidising companies to that extent as distinct from subsidising the unfortunate borrowers, and that is outside the scope of this Bill.</P>

      <P>I wish to pass a few comments on this Bill.  I welcome the Bill very much and am glad to see that the whole House welcomes it.  It is the first step in a direction which is desired by everybody, not least by the building societies themselves. I will declare my interest&mdash;as the saying is at the moment&mdash;I am connected with one of the Irish building societies.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The building society movement is one of the finest ideas which was ever thought up by men to help each other.  It started less than a couple of hundred years ago.  A group of people somewhere in the north of England was formed.  They were working-class men.  They paid in money week by week.  There were probably 12 or 20 of them.  When sufficient money had been collected they had a draw for a house.  That was the beginning of the building society movement.  They elected secretaries and treasurers to look after the affairs of the society.  A committee was formed from among the men who paid in their money every week.  In due course the movement grew to such enormous proportions that, as I heard in London last week, the building society movement at the moment has now reached £18,000 million and will very shortly <Col N="1378" /> be increased to over £20,000 million.</P>
    <P>It is one of the greatest forms of banking and one of the greatest financial institutions in that country. It is also becoming so in Ireland.  The building societies have been pressing for a number of years for the Government to bring the legislation up to date to enable them to deal with this rapidly growing movement.  They can recognise that certain dangers exist in the present situation and that it is too easy for certain societies to get a licence and go ahead.</P>
    <P>I welcome the Bill and congratulate the Minister for having brought it in.  There are special reasons at the moment why such a Bill is necessary. Although it is rather difficult to do so on the floor of the House, I should like to try to dispel certain misconceptions which have arisen in the minds of the public and in the minds of some of the people here.  It has been said that there are too many societies.  There are not very many in Ireland.  It would not be a good thing to see those numbers greatly reduced.  There are only five or six of the companies who belong to the association which try to regulate their affairs in the interest of the borrowers and in the interests of the depositors.  It was mentioned here that there are a lot of branches.  It is always popular to attack building societies because of the number of branches they have.  Building societies compete with each other in the sense that banks do.  Therefore, if there are branches in a street a building society will want to get a share of the business in that street or area.  What is more important is that there are many other financial institutions which are endeavouring to attract that very scarce and important commodity, money, into their coffers.  If the building societies do not have branches readily available to the public, the public cannot come in and deposit their money.  They will go to other institutions which are crying out for their money and so the money would be lost to the building society movement.  Not only would this radically affect people who wished to own a house but it would <Col N="1379" /> affect the whole building programme. No Government can afford to neglect the building society movement because it is so important to the supply of new houses, especially for young married people.</P>
    <P>Mention was made earlier of the fact that new houses have a priority for loans.  That is good but very often the purchase of a new house means the sale of an old house.  An old house may not really be old.  It may be occupied by only the second family in its history.  If the sale of old houses is held up or prevented it can have a slowing down effect on the sale of new houses.  Newly-weds form a large proportion of new house buyers, but they are by no means the only buyers.  Some people move into smaller houses when their families have grown up and gone away, so there is a constant buying and selling of houses both new and second-hand. If one interferes with that normal process unduly it can have the unfortunate effect of slowing down the building and the occupying of new houses by the very people the Government wish to help.</P>
    <P>The question of advertising was raised.  It was said that too much money is spent by building societies by advertising.  Were is not for the number of advertisements the money which comes to building societies would go to other financial institutions.</P>
    <P>The last speaker talked about nationalising the building societies. This would cost a sum of money which no modern State could raise without the greatest of difficulty and indeed might find it physically impossible to raise.  Even if it were possible to raise it I do not think this would have any beneficial effect.  I do not think it would lower the mortgage rates.  It might very easily have the opposite effect.  It could also be a great temptation to a Government to use that as a weapon to further their own political aims which might not necessarily be in the interests of the homeowners and still less perhaps of the country as a whole.  I would not be at all in favour of that.  Of course, the <Col N="1380" /> Minister has not put that forward.  It is not a practical proposition now but the time may come when financially it could be done.  I very much doubt if it would be in the interests of the borrowers.</P>
    <P>The fundamental system of the building society is very simple.  People come in with their money and lodge it and then individuals are lent money. If anything interferes with that or if the building societies do not offer the depositors sufficient interest in return for their money they walk by and young people and indeed old people looking for houses cannot get advances. We are living in a time of very dear money and that is having the most unfortunate, indeed sometimes tragic effect on individuals who have borrowed money.  They see their weekly payments going up and sometimes it is a real hardship on them to pay.  As long as money is as expensive as it is at present it will continue to be expensive to borrow money from the building societies.</P>
    <P>There is the question of the fees charged by the legal profession.  That is something for which the building societies are sometimes blamed but it is something over which they have no control.  That is a question for the legal profession to deal with.  The building societies are powerless to reduce charges which they themselves have to pay.</P>
    <P>I would say to the Opposition that the Minister has done very well in introducing this Bill.  I think he is hoping to bring in the main Bill later this year.  Without being nasty to the Opposition, they had many years to bring in a Bill, years during which the building societies and their association asked for legislation to strengthen their hand and to tighten up entrance into the building society area.  They did not get any speedy response; they certainly did not get a Bill, which is what they were looking for.  I thank the Minister and I hope we will have the main Bill as soon as possible.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJLalor" hpid="Mr. Lalor Mr. Lalor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lalor</NameTxt>
      <P>In the debate so far there has not developed any feeling that this is a controversial Bill.  Our <Col N="1381" /> spokesman, Deputy Brennan, welcomed the introduction of what the Minister described as a simple piece of legislation.  Deputy Dockrell's remarks about the years the public and Members have waited for this legislation surprised me.  The Minister pointed out that the two major portions of the Bill were forced on him: first, because of the desirability of enabling a merger of two existing building societies, which he mentioned in the report as being imminent if some facility can be provided to enable this to happen; and secondly, the enabling section, which would have allowed the Government to have stepped in last October, is urgently needed.  This will enable the Minister for Finance to stand over the necessary lending and the welcome arrangement whereby the banks promised to make available £6 million to the building societies to enable them to perform their functions. From that point of view, I do not think anyone can allege neglect by Members on this side of the House.</P>
      <P>As I see it, the two building societies at present endeavouring to arrange a merger are probably the reason for sections 2 and 4 of the Bill.  The Minister was complimented by Deputy Dockrell on the introduction of the Bill and the promise of imminent effective legislation covering wider aspects of the building societies which is urgently required. Although sections 2 and 4 are enabling sections to deal with mergers, for the last 15 months the House has been waiting for legislation in connection with monopolies and mergers, which was promised a long time ago.  Depending on one's point of view, that legislation could be regarded as much more important.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Although my comments might be more appropriate on section 2 on Committee Stage, it might be no harm for me to convey my views on the section.  The Minister pointed out that the procedure built into the old Building Societies Acts from 1874 to 1942 made amalgamation extremely difficult and I agree it was necessary to introduce a more simple form.  The <Col N="1382" /> Minister mentioned it was extremely difficult to arrange a merger under the existing Acts in that a meeting called to decide on a change would have to arrive at a decision by a three-quarters majority and, subsequently, the members would have to accept it by a two-thirds majority.  Working on the Minister's figure of 30,000, some 20,000 of the shareholders would have to write in signifying it was acceptable to them.  I do not know if there would be difficulty in getting a three-quarters majority, but I notice that the proposed change states that a simple majority would suffice.  Has the Minister considered the change which would have envisaged a two-thirds majority at that stage?</P>
    <P>There is mention about a straightforward majority of the members of each society concerned with a merger being present at a general meeting convened for that purpose.  In the calling of a general meeting, is there any provision that each of the 30,000 members are called to the meeting?  I presume the members would be told that a certain building society were proposing to merge with another society, or that a society were proposing to transfer their engagements to another society?  I would ask the Minister to tell us if this is built into a previous Act, that this change does not alter an earlier provision that all the members are summoned to the general meeting and are notified of the intentions of the building society. If members have an objection to the proposal, they should be given an opportunity to oppose it.  This provision should be built into the legislation.</P>
    <P>Section 3 deals with the arrangements which had to be made last year where the banks agreed to stand by the building societies to the extent of £6 million.  The Minister said that the money which the building societies borrowed would be drawn on at any time up to 30th June, 1974, and is to be repaid during the 12 months commencing July, 1975.  The impression I got from section 3 (7) was that there would be two years where money borrowed at the end of April or May need not necessarily be repaid until April or May, 1976.  The guarantee <Col N="1383" /> was that the money would be repaid with interest within two years from the date of the advance of the moneys out of the Central Fund.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Local Government and the Minister for Finance made this arrangement with the Associated Banks.  Is this an on-going thing?  Supposing £9 million has been borrowed by a number of building societies under this arrangement, it appears to me that in the year commencing 1st July, 1975, they will have to pay back £5 or £6 million.  At that stage, will that not bring great pressure on the building societies, pressures which will react to the extent that they will again have the problems which existed last October, that is, the non-availability of money for lending?</P>
    <P>Is the repayment of this £5 million within a two year period the wisest thing to legislate for?  There is a provision under subsection (8) which visualises that all the money will not be paid back by that time.  I presume that in the four-sided discussions which took place between the banks, the Minister for Local Government, the Minister for Finance and the building societies last October, this was looked on as a temporary measure.  In his reply will the Minister tell me if section 3 is an on-going section whereby this £6 million is available all the time to be drawn on, paid back, redrawn and again paid back within a two year period and whether the building societies are getting themselves into a serious position from an interest point of view?  The building societies were in difficulties last October.  That coupled with the warning which we heard this morning from the Confederation of Irish Industry, was frightening from the national point of view.</P>
    <P>Over the past 12 months every Government spokesman drew attention to the comparison between the unemployment figures existing at that time and the figures for this year.  We now have a situation in the first week of May, 1974, in which we have greater unemployment than we had in the corresponding period last year.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1384" /> The accumulation of difficulties will have very serious effects.  Maybe, at this stage, the Government are looking forward to this three-year period whereby there will not be great demand for money for the building of houses.  In two years time people may have reached the stage where the building industry will be in a coma, where no building will be going on with no requirement for loans from building societies.  Up to now the Government have been in a position to say that in comparison with last year there are fewer people unemployed now than there were in the corresponding period last year. Exactly 12 months after the Coalition Government took office we have a situation in which there are 68,155 people unemployed compared with 68,015 unemployed last year, an extra 140.  As Deputy Coogan so aptly says from time to time, it is only the tip of the iceberg.</P>
    <P>In section 3 (3) it is stated that the Minister for Finance will be laying before each House of the Oireachtas a statement setting out with respect to each guarantee under this section given during that year in connection with a loan, particulars of the guarantee in cases of payment by the Minister. When this Bill is passed, will the statement be laid before the House giving the amount of money outstanding on the 1st or 6th April this year?</P>
    <P>In his opening remarks the Minister issued a warning, it could justifiably be put that way, to new societies being created.  Just because they are setting themselves up now they should not think they will escape having to abide by whatever regulations are made.  He also referred to reactivated or new bodies developing from dormant societies.  I agree fully with him on this.  If he introduces legislation and endeavours to get at newly formed societies or re-enlivened dormant societies, it will be very difficult to put through measures covering societies of that nature, the ones which have been actively in existence and which have been looked upon in a good light over a period of years.  I presume that there should not be any difficulty so far as <Col N="1385" /> they are concerned in falling into line one way or the other.</P>
    <P>Many of the views expressed about the building societies over the past 12 months draw attention to the competition between existing societies and the spending of money in various areas&mdash;the spending of capital in building new offices in order to project themselves in individual areas.  I agree with the Minister when he says that fewer societies should mean greater efficiency and economy throughout the movement as a whole and should give savings in general management expenses.  That should encourage the Minister to let the country see the proposed new legislation to deal with building societies as soon as possible.  When there is a vacuum and a threat of legislation there is a temptation to rush in.  It is very difficult to get effective retrospective legislation covering this type of thing.  Following the threat of the auctioneers' and estate agents' legislation I think I was the only Deputy who did not take out an auctioneer's licence.</P>

      <P>Now that the threat is there, the sooner that legislation can be seen the better.  There is no doubt that we need a little competition between building societies but we do not want a surfeit of it.  The fact that we have 20 or 30 affiliated societies means that a tremendous amount of people's money is being used for purposes other than those on which it is purported to be spent.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesCTunney" hpid="Mr. Tunney Mr. Tunney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tunney</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to associate myself with other Deputies who have welcomed the proposed legislation.  I must say how difficult I found it to listen to Deputy Dockrell associating present-day building societies with the humble men of the last century who got together to pool extra moneys for the purpose of building houses.  It is fair to say that the present-day sophistication of the building societies is far removed from <Col N="1386" /> the spirit of their humble origins, to which Deputy Dockrell referred, when the <i>raison d'etre</i> of the building societies was the building of houses for people, presumably subscribers. Since then building societies have been used as the <i>via media</i> through which certain people built office blocks at home and villas on the Continent&mdash;not for subscribers.</P>
      <P>It may be popular at the moment to be unduly critical of the building societies but it can be said in all honesty that, over the past few years, building societies have given grey hairs to people who sought to build houses through their agencies. They also contributed to the grey hairs of politicians who endeavoured to make inquiries or representations on behalf of prospective borrowers, or on behalf of people who were promised a loan by a society a year before and who had not yet been allowed to enjoy the benefits of the promised loan.</P>
      <P>I have a reservation about the proposed merger.  We must bear in mind that all these societies exist for the benefit of the would-be house purchaser. I should like to have an assurance that there will not be a continuation or a development of the terrible, frightening and frustrating anonymity of the building societies. We all know that there is not any warmth&mdash;if there is, there is no evidence of it&mdash;in the manner in which building societies operate.  I make this comment from my own experience to date.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>After the passing of this legislation, if I feel disposed to make an inquiry, will I find it more difficult to get anybody in these offices to identify himself or herself with the application about which I am making the inquiry? I am sure the Minister would agree with some of the criticisms made of the building societies.  I hope he has made provision against that which I feel may happen.  There has been a certain amount of recession but, at the same time, housing is a sellers' market.  I said during a debate on housing that, if the Good Lord had foreseen what is happening at the moment in housing at different levels, <Col N="1387" /> what the prospective buyer is being asked to pay for loans and for legal fees and for what I would regard as sharp practice in the cost of his house &mdash;when a price of £6,000 quoted today rises to £6,500 inside a couple of months.  He might have had second thoughts about advising us to increase and multiply.  The sooner the better it is accepted that there must be restrictions to protect the unfortunate person, whose ambition is the natural one of having his own house, from the many people who over the past ten to 15 years have risen from practically nothing to the millionaire class. They are in the building industry and the building societies.  It is obvious to me, without searching too deeply, that there are excessive profits being allowed to these people and I would be hoping that the Minister would be able at least to say that what is envisaged here would be to the advantage of the prospective house buyer.</P>
    <P>We can hope, as the Minister has said, that a general trend towards larger and fewer societies will lead to greater efficiency.  On the other hand, it may lead to a point of diminishing returns and it may become more expensive. Worse still, it is my experience that it will lead to frustrations and annoyances because of the terrible anonymity to which I have referred.</P>
    <P>I will not refer to the relative merits of the left or the right, as posed by Deputies Barry Desmond and Dockrell, respectively, in regard to the building societies and the building industry. As far as I am concerned, that which affects the would-be householder is the concern with which I most sympathise and I am hoping that when he replies the Minister will indicate it is his concern too.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TomEnright" hpid="Mr. Enright Mr. Enright">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Enright</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Bill. On numerous occasions it has been put on record in the House that the building societies are the people who have furnished loans to married couples who wish to own their own houses.  I would hope that the same type of loans will continue to be made available by the building societies to <Col N="1388" /> young married couples and to others desirous of owning their own houses.</P>
      <P>As well, building societies have been investment sources for many people who were able to place their money in them and obtain a fair rate of interest. This is an important aspect of their work.  It has been mentioned in the report commissioned by the Minister that building societies are on the increase and it has been said that this will lead to increased costs.  It is logical to assume that if there are more building societies it will lead to an overlapping or a multiplication of costs.  More societies would need more floor space in office blocks, there would be more staff to pay and there would be a multiplication of advertising in newspapers and television&mdash;in other words, a multiplication of effort. Even at the moment this is far too prevalent.  If some of the extra money involved could be saved, it would be to the benefit of all.  Therefore, the Government should make every effort to facilitate mergers of building socities.</P>
      <P>Building societies have been passing through a difficult period in the past few years.  Merchant banks and other finance houses have improved their interest rates, stocks and shares have improved and, therefore, people have been less inclined to invest in building societies, who have consequently had a falling off in investment.  Nevertheless, I believe our people still have enormous confidence in these societies as a means of investment and I hope this confidence will continue.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In regard to the funds available for house loans by building societies, I recommend that the Minister would make every effort to ensure that such funds are controlled.  It was mentioned that some large building organisations have arrangements with the building societies, that such builders are able to obtain large blank terms which enables them to service individual loans so that house purchasers do not deal directly with the building societies.  I hope the Minister will be able to make a definite statement on this so that the position will be clarified. Such an arrangement is not satisfactory. It is not a safe way and if it <Col N="1389" /> is a prevalent practice, I hope the Minister will see that it is stopped.</P>
    <P>Another point is in relation to funds that have been used by building societies in large office blocks and so on.  I thought that the main purpose of building societies was to finance the purchase of houses for young married couples.  Funds at present being used for office blocks and so on I hope will not be allowed to continue to be used in such a manner.  I would think that the building of office blocks is not a desirable way of spending building societies' moneys.  Rather should such moneys be utilised to help people obtain their own homes and enlarge the building industry in this country.</P>
    <P>I should like to pay a small tribute to the local authorities of this country for the manner in which they have contributed helping young families obtain their own homes.  Certainly local authorities are financing a huge amount of building at the moment.  I believe they are to be complimented on the work they are doing in obtaining moneys from the Local Loans Fund, from the Government, and I hope this will continue.  It is important that some effort be made by the Minister to try and enlarge the scope of local authorities in the building industry.</P>

    <Speaker pid="TomEnright" hpid="Mr. Enright Mr. Enright">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Enright</NameTxt>
      <P>Then I would seek the advice of the Chair: what I am getting at is that it may prove that some local authorities might be able to obtain some form of stock to finance loans.  In other words, over the years it may prove necessary to allow an extension of local authority activities to obtain moneys in the form of stock and then release the money to people to erect their own houses.  I shall not pursue the point but it may prove that it would come under Bills such as this in the future.  But if the Chair feels it would be out of order at the moment I would be happy to accept such a ruling.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. Keating)</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to thank my fellow Deputies for a constructive and good humoured discussion on this small Bill.  It must be emphasised that it is a small Bill.  I said that there is a comprehensive piece of legislation coming in relation to building societies and coming as quickly as we can possibly get it before the House because this Government are satisfied that it is an urgent matter and we appreciate the concern of Deputies with it.  In the debate I think people may anticipate a little the speeches they might make on the comprehensive piece of legislation and they broadened the issues far beyond the two-essentially two &mdash;matters in this Bill.  If in endeavouring to reply to the points made I am a little disorganised it is because I find it not easy to listen and simultaneously to organise my thoughts into coherent speech.  Also I think it desirable that I limit what I have to say to the matters that bore directly on the Bill because we do have a pressure of work in the House and we will have the opportunity, in a much more extensive way, in a much wider Bill in the fairly near future, to discuss the whole matter at much greater length.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Brennan said he thought the real purpose of the Bill was not to facilitate mergers but to provide guarantees in regard to the loan of £6 million.  I can assure Deputy Brennan&mdash;and indeed it was evident <Col N="1391" /> from the speeches of other Deputies on both sides of the House that they were familiar with the position&mdash;we are being urged briskly by these two companies wanting to get on with the merger to clear the road for them. We think it desirable that they do it and this Bill is an effort to facilitate them quickly.  Had it not been for the pressure, in this context of a single merger, the matter of the guarantee could have waited until the later legislation or indeed, I understand, could have been dealt with under other legislation.  For example, I am advised that it could have been brought before the House under something called the State Guarantees Act.  Therefore there were other mechanisms open to us.  It just happened that we wanted to facilitate people doing what we thought was a sensible thing and we took the opportunity of putting two things together.  We thought it would be too long to wait for the much larger Bill in the offing.</P>
    <P>Let me try to say something about the matter which exercised a number of Deputies, about the rush I mentioned on the part of new societies to get registered or on the part of what one might call&mdash;without meaning the word offensively&mdash;moribund societies to be revitalised prior to the bringing forward of the major piece of legislation.  The purpose of the warning that I issued was to suggest to them that they were wasting their time because I am advised by the experts on the drafting of legislation that it is perfectly possible, without retrospection either, to have a legal mechanism that will ensure the new rules will apply to them, the new rules under the comprehensive legislation, and that they will not be able to have a relatively advantageous position by registering now.  I do not want to anticipate what may be the final decision as to the best way of achieving this objective but there are at least two causes: a precedent for one such course is the Central Bank Act of 1971.  The precedent in that case would indicate that all registrations would be terminated on a specified <Col N="1392" /> date, that all societies would be registered, and that would apply to everybody&mdash;because of course there is not much point in having a fairly fundamental piece of new legislation if it is not able to alter the circumstances of the existing companies, whether they have been in existence for a long time, have been trading vigorously and have enjoyed the highest reputation which applies to many societies, or whether they are societies that have been set up very recently or societies that have been revitalised.  One wants to be able to change the circumstances anyway. The alternative would be not to deregister any, which would simply be to require all societies to comply with conditions relating, for example, to such things as liquidity, financial reserves, the financial state of the directors, in regard to a number of aspects of building societies to which reference has been made over the past year or so.  Either of those mechanisms would ensure that no advantage would be gained by this rush and that it is in fact a waste of time on the part of the people undertaking it.</P>
    <P>I will try to deal with some of the points made by Deputy Lalor.  He asked in regard to mergers whether it was a good thing to go all the way to a simple majority of the meeting.  The proposed change is from three-quarters of the meeting to a simple majority.  I would agree with him that this would be going too far if that were the sole criterion of amalgamation but it is one of two conditions. Deputies will note that the second half of the existing merger mechanism can be retained if people wish it.  The new second half, which is being proposed, is that it be made the responsibility of the Registrar for Friendly Societies to confirm or refuse.  He has a second look and if there is any wish on the part of people to make representations to him they have time to do so before the merger is confirmed.</P>
    <P>This brings me to another point which was raised.  If there is any suggestion that there was not a wholehearted and thorough circularisation of all the people entitled to attend <Col N="1393" /> the meeting, if there was a selective notification with a desire to produce a wished for result, then the mechanism exists whereby this can be brought to the attention of the registrar.  He retains the second barrier to the merger. In those circumstances, I think the simple majority is permissible.  If it stood alone it would be too little and I would go along with the suggestion of two-thirds rather than a half.  I think, coupled with the second safeguard of the scrutiny and the power of veto in the hands of the Registrar for Friendly Societies, that it provides a mechanism which is both simple and workable, on the one hand, and yet which prevents the people who are too clever by half from doing things which are not quite proper even if they are not formally improper.</P>
    <P>One ought to say at this stage in regard to building societies that it is a matter which has exercised the public very considerably and which indeed my Department and the other interested Departments of Local Government and Finance are very well aware of in the very recent past.  This is the sort of general observation one could apply in very many sectors of our economic life in this country.  The vast majority of building societies are behaving responsibly and decently and doing their best within the framework of legislation to carry out the task they were set up to do.  In making criticisms&mdash;this has been done here and in other places&mdash;of particular activities, particular companies and particular societies, that is by implication, we do not want to give the impression that the whole area of building societies is one with which we are deeply dissatisfied or one in which the public should not have considerable confidence.  We want the flow of investor's funds to continue inwards so that the flow of building societies' funds can continue outwards.  They can then go on providing the finance for a growing number of people to have their homes, whether they be newly-weds or any other section of the community who want to buy houses.</P>
    <P>There was a question about section 3 in regard to the nature of the guarantee.  I ought to emphasise that <Col N="1394" /> the wording in that section is standard formula found in very many Acts.  It does not imply an onerous obligation on the State.  It implies no obligation at all because it is a guarantee&mdash;it is quite distinct from the subsidy given to the building societies&mdash;of an arrangement whereby in negotiations between the building societies and the banks they were advanced, not a finite sum of money, but a sum of money on call up to a limit of £6 million.  They had a period in which to repay it after a period in which no repayment would be made.  It is only in the event of default, which nobody anticipates and nobody is suggesting, that the State would become liable. The advantage of a guarantee, which is an advantage in the end for the desperately hard-pressed consumer of the services of building societies, is that in these circumstances, with the State guaranteeing in the event of a crisis no one anticipates or wishes for, societies can negotiate a little better rate from the bank than they could without the State coming in in the background.  Therefore they can pass on, in circumstances where we have desperate worldwide pressures on interest rates, hopefully, a slightly better deal to their users than they could if the State did not offer this encouragement and guarantee.</P>
    <P>It is a guarantee.  It is not a loan. The details of the facility offered were worked out between the building societies and the banks.  It is the sort of thing that has happened in a number of contexts.  It is a standard formula and it is found in many Acts in other contexts.</P>
    <P>I have tried to deal with the real substance of the matters which Deputies raised and I do not want to stray from this Bill, which, as I say, contains two essential things: (1) facilitating of mergers and (2) a guarantee of a borrowing right negotiated between the different societies and the banks.  That is the heart of the Bill. However I should like, in reply to what Deputies have said, to indicate the most profound concern on the part of the Departments involved, primarily Local Government, but I am here as the person responsible for the Register of Friendly Societies and of <Col N="1395" /> course the Minister for Finance is involved as well.  Indeed, the whole Government are deeply concerned. We have the worldwide circumstance of extremely high interest rates.  It is a contribution to inflation in the general sense because people borrowing for the sake of their businesses are paying more for money than is the norm.  There is a shortage of capital and it is being bid up.  We are part of a larger financial area, the sterling area, which is not just a bigger area than our own economy but is also a very important medium for international exchange as a currency. Therefore the international circumstances in regard to interest rebound on to us very quickly in a way against which it is not easy to insulate ourselves.</P>
    <P>There are some advantages for us in this participation of the sterling area but certainly for the ordinary mortgage holder at this time paying the dreadful rate it is very much more than embarrassing.  It is a source of anger; it is a source of very understandable irritation.  If one looks at the matter of subsidy very large reductions in interest rates by subsidy will swallow immense amounts of money.  The amounts one could spend in subsidy in this way are absolutely immense and do not represent a practical course of action.  That is not to say that one can do nothing.  We have some little gleam of silver on the horizon because of the vigorous action by the British Government who are much more influential than are this Government in regard to sterling interest rates.  There has been a little drop in the United Kingdom.  At least, the rise has ended.  However, one notices that at the same time interest rates in the US, which is by far the larger and more powerful economy, have been increasing but, perhaps, there will be a reduction there, too, and a levelling-off as has been the case in Britain.  In the meantime, the Government have provided subsidies of an unprecedented kind in regard to those people who are making repayments to building societies.  Dreadful as is the present rate, one can say truthfully that it would be appreciably <Col N="1396" /> worse, that it would be worse to the extent of 1¼ per cent, if it were not for the action that this Government have taken but that is not to minimise the difficulties or to say that we should not sympathise with the fury of mortgage holders.  It is to say that within the limits possible we have taken action in this direction, and that we hope that the rise has passed. There is evidence to indicate that this is more than a hope.</P>
    <P>I shall not say more than that but it is proper for me to express my concern. In this little Bill of two main items we are not trying to avoid discussions. There will be many other opportunities, including the opportunity of discussing the larger Bill, for debate on this issue.  I shall leave it at that because it would not be my wish to pre-empt either the area of responsibility of the Minister for Local Government or of any discussion we may have on another occasion in relation to a more comprehensive Bill.</P>

      <P>While it may not be necessary to table amendments to this Bill, a couple of points may come to mind later and for that reason we would prefer, unless the Minister requires the Bill urgently, to defer the Committee Stage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One point which occurs to me immediately is that the Minister is not making it obligatory on companies to go through the procedure <Col N="1397" /> of this Bill in order to merge, in other words, they may merge under the old system and without the Minister's consent or knowledge.  Might it not be wise to provide that it be obligatory and that all mergers be subject to section 2?  While the Bill purports to improve the procedure, for example, in regard to meetings, it might be possible for a merger to take place without the Minister's consent or, indeed, without reference to this Bill.  I was thinking of an amendment on those lines.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JustinKeating" hpid="Mr. Keating Mr. Keating">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>I shall come to that point in a moment but, first, I would point out that I had hoped this Bill would have been ordered a week ago. The Bill is not one that has been circulated with the minimum of notice.  Not for my sake nor for the sake of the House but for the sake of those people who have indicated their wish to go ahead with mergers, I should like to have the next Stage now.</P>
      <P>Regarding the point made by Deputy Brennan, it is possible that the existing procedure would be adopted.  Of course it would come to the knowledge of the registrar of friendly societies but only after the merger had taken place.  The point made by the Deputy is arguable theoretically but in reality the provision in relation to not only three-quarters of a meeting but of two-thirds of all shareholders would be an enormous difficulty so that in practice, provided the new mechanism to be suggested is a great deal easier and, therefore, would be the one of choice, our experience is that existing legislation is holding up mergers that are desirable.  Therefore, while the suggestion might have some merit in an abstract sense, I am advised that it is unnecessary and that in practice what we are suggesting is much more attractive.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JosephBrennan" hpid="Mr. Brennan Mr. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Brennan</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="JosephBrennan" hpid="Mr. Brennan Mr. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>There has been a tendency by building societies in the past to look more favourably on city property for investment than on rural property.  Indeed, it is only in recent times that it has been possible to get mortgages on rural property at all from building societies.  This, again, is something that is looked upon by those in rural Ireland as a leaning towards the urban areas.  Perhaps different building societies and finance companies generally used to look askance at country investment because they feared that if the need arose for a forced sale in order to realise guarantees, there was a certain neighbourliness in the country that sometimes tended to see that it did not happen.  I do not think that applies anymore, but the fact remains that it is more difficult, <Col N="1399" /> in many cases not possible, to get a mortgage in rural areas.  As I said, I had experience once of a loan from a building society and by the time I was finished I did not know whether it was they or myself that was getting the loan.</P>
      <P>They must be brought into line to be a more oncoming institution such as the banks are.  The banks are, by every test, yet the best means of borrowing. In the building societies there seems to be a complete conglomeration of vested interests, all seeking to have their own cut out of the cake before it is finally handed over to the borrowers.  Unless they are brought into line with the commercial banks and made perform in a more businesslike manner, they will not be fulfilling the function they are really expected to fulfil in society.  I would be in favour of anything the Minister does to bring them into line in that way.  I know many of the things we have said and what I am saying now are not relevant to this Bill but we are anticipating legislation of a more comprehensive nature soon.  On that basis I want to assure the Minister we are letting this Bill through all Stages today.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. G. Fitzgerald Mr. G. Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>When I reported progress on the last day, I was dealing with the sporting activities of the Army and expressed the opinion that they should be more involved in games within the community. I referred to the Collins <Col N="1400" /> football team in Cork, which county had a great team, particularly in the early and middle 50s.  Such involvement creates good relations between the Army and the ordinary people. There were officers and private soldiers playing football together on that team.</P>
      <P>I want to refer again to the position of Collins Barracks in Cork. As I pointed out, much of the accommodation there is in need of improvement.  Has the Minister considered whether or not Collins Barracks, as at present sited, is the ideal choice for a barracks in that city? While it commands a great position within the city, with the growth in the volume of traffic it is not as easy to get to and particularly from, as it was in olden times.  Therefore, I wonder if the Minister or his Department have ever considered the relocation of the principal barracks in the Cork area and whether it would be worth looking at Ballincollig to see if sufficient space and land is available there to build a new barracks; there would be easy access to and from it in an emergency and there would not be the same build-up of traffic in narrow streets and narrow roads such as there is in the city area at present.</P>
      <P>Still on the land situation, I think it was Deputy Taylor who mentioned the Curragh.  I am sure the Minister is examining, if he has not already done so, what lands are held by the Army and what their future use should be, whether it is wise to retain them all, whether some of them should not be devoted to other purposes. I refer to places like the Curragh, Kilworth and Crosshaven. There is the question as to whether some of these lands could be put to other use, given to the public for recreational facilities, maybe for housing, as was done in the case of the large tract of land which was handed over to Cork County Council from the Ballincollig area.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On the question of Civil Defence, I should like to compliment those people who are devoting so much of their free time to training and in improving their own efficiency at camp <Col N="1401" /> sites and in the ordinary weekly training that takes place within the Civil Defence organisation.  This, of course, is something that can be expanded but I often wonder if we as a people are sufficiently aware of the functions performed and the facilities provided by Civil Defence.  During the heavy flooding of January when families were in difficulty, the Civil Defence were willing not only to help out by pumping water out of houses, getting people to new accommodation and providing clothing and so on, but to have a stand-by telephone service at night.  These people deserve to have a very high tribute paid to them.  It often bothers me that the public may not be aware of these services.  There are many emergencies in which these people are only too willing to put their facilities, their equipment and training, at the disposal of people who may be in distress of some kind.  I am not saying it is not getting good coverage from the Minister's Department but sometimes when the need arises people do not know that such a service is available.  Particularly now with camps being held in the summer months we should advertise and tell the public what is being done at the various camps.  It would tend to give people who devote so much of their spare time to this service more job satisfaction and, perhaps, win greater appreciation from the general public.</P>
    <P>In view of the Law of the Sea Conference which will be held in the near future I should like to know what our approach will be to the extension of the fishery limits and, the limits having been extended, what the approach will be to having them adequately controlled by our service vessels and personnel now and in the future.  Provision must be made for the future rather than the present. The Minister said that one vessel has been provided but we must ask ourselves how many vessels do we need in the present and in the future.  The Minister said that work on the second vessel will commence this year and that delivery may take place towards the end of 1975.  What will be done after that?  What plans have we in mind in regard to whatever extensions <Col N="1402" /> we will seek in our fishing limits?</P>
    <P>The Minister referred to building work.  Here, let me get in another plug regarding a few houses in the Crosshaven area.  I am sure the same may be said in regard to Army houses in other areas.  I am concerned about men who have given lifetime service in the Army and who for some reason are, perhaps, not in a position to acquire houses or possibly local authorities have no houses they can rent.  These people, having retired and having reached that stage, find that their pensions&mdash;and these may be substantial in some cases&mdash; are withheld.  I ask the Minister to examine that situation in each individual case, particularly if the children are still school-going, and look first at the amount of the pension.  If it is substantial the Minister should consider what sum he would be justified in withholding while a man is overholding a house. I do not want to create a situation in which you have overholders forever. I appreciate the problem in that regard but I think there can be extenuating circumstances in very many cases, particularly in regard to the houses I mentioned.  These are not as well equipped as I think houses for Army personnel should be today.  Also, they are removed from the main barracks in Cork.  When houses are provided for Army personnel today, I think they should have proper indoor toilets with hot and cold water laid on and all the modern amenities and facilities of the average home.  This is important. I specifically ask the Minister to examine the situation I mentioned last week.  I do not want him to open the floodgates completely and say that no matter what happens they will be allowed to stay on.  I can well imagine the problems that would create but I do ask that each case be examined on its merits so as to see if it is justified from a social point of view to withhold all the weekly pensions.</P>
    <P>I like the tribute the Minister paid to the Army.  I think they have created a new image for themselves in the past ten or 15 years.  I can <Col N="1403" /> imagine the problem of the Army in a small country like ours.  If there is no sense of adventure or excitement or something to be concerned about, life for fit and trained men can be disillusioning and monotonous.  The first change was wrought by the overseas service with the United Nations forces.  Our troops have certainly done credit to themselves and their country.  They have been good ambassadors in various places abroad. They deserve a tribute for the manner in which they have upheld our flag, our uniform and our country.  More recently we had the northern situation and they have been called on to perform security functions in conjunction with the Garda.  While it is unfortunate that this situation prevails and that the Army should be called on to exercise these functions we are all only too acutely aware of the need for them and of how well they have acted when called on.</P>
    <P>The Minister spoke of the number of times the Army had been asked to undertake security operations.  This is not the type of excitement we would like to have for our Army and I am sure we all regret that the situation in Northern Ireland provides it but undoubtedly all this has given a new life and a new image to the Army.  It has also probably made clear to young people that there is a career in the Army.  When I was speaking on the previous occasion I mentioned the necessity in order to foster not only the present recruiting drive but also to help towards future recruitment, that the image of the Army would be portrayed in schools where lads at the age of deciding on a career could, perhaps, be influenced by well disciplined Army personnel visiting them, speaking to them, showing them their uniform and convincing them that the Army would be worth considering as a career.</P>
    <P>I should like to see the FCA annual training further developed and courses extended, again with a view to encouraging recruitment, with a view to giving these young people, proper facilities that would leave them as <Col N="1404" /> ambassadors of the Army, the Army salesmen, and the people who could help the Minister in his recruiting campaign.  We must ensure that when they go on their month's training their accommodation is good.  The accommodation for such members of the Defence Forces, as well as that for the regular soldiers, can never be good enough.  In this regard I am glad the Minister announced that a number of new barracks are being erected. Accommodation is always very important and I hope the Minister continues his drive in this regard.</P>
    <P>I should like to remind the Minister that he promised on the last occasion to invite me to inspect Collins Barracks with him on the occasion of his visit there.  I look forward to joining the Minister on that trip.</P>
    <P>The money spent on the Army Equitation School is worthwhile and I hope we will see good results from it in the years to come.  I remember as a boy hearing of the great achievements of Army horsemen who represented the country many years ago. Many of these Army horsemen were held in high esteem throughout the world.  I feel sure every Member of the House would like to see the present Army team reaching the heights of glory of former teams.  The money devoted to this school by the Minister I feel sure will lead to the Army team being a great competitive force at show jumping events throughout the world.</P>
    <P>On the last occasion I expressed my disappointment that the Minister had not made any reference to the <i>Claudia</i> incident in his statement, particularly in view of the fact that last year when I raised this matter I was informed that it was <i>sub judice</i>.  I was disappointed that aliens got away.  Some of our own people who were brought to court were penalised and are still being penalised but the aliens who were involved got away completely free.</P>

      <P>I should like to congratulate the Minister on the wonderful work he is doing for the Defence Forces particularly with regard to improving the married <Col N="1405" /> quarters for soldiers and the accommodation for the single men and recruits.  The Army, who have done excellent work overseas, are under a great strain, particularly those members engaged in Border areas.  The people owe a great debt of gratitude to the Army for maintaining peace and harmony here.</P>
      <P>On the matter of improving quarters I would urge the Minister to continue the good work he has started so as to ensure that the soldiers, and their families, have the quarters they are deserving of.</P>
      <P>I should like to congratulate the Minister on the success of his recruiting campaign.  There are a number of points I should like to make in relation to the Army and it is my belief that if the Minister acted on this advice there would be a considerable improvement in the attitude of people generally to the Army and in the attitude of young people to the Army as a career. My knowledge of the Army is mainly confined to the Curragh Training Camp and, consequently, it is with that particular base that I shall deal.  While there are vast playing fields at the Curragh I am not satisfied that the Army are provided with proper facilities for playing games there.  The Minister should consider the erection of a sports complex at the Curragh, a complex that would befit the headquarters of any army.  Everything needed for the provision of such a complex is available at the Curragh.  A sports complex would make life a lot more attractive to our young soldiers and recruits.</P>
      <P>I agree that there is an idea abroad that our Army is not the best career for a young man, but in my view it is a fine healthy career.  I should like to congratulate the Minister on being a little more selective of the type of people who are being allowed to stay on in the Army than heretofore.  Our Army should be above suspicion and the people comprising that Army should be looked up to by the general public.</P>

There was the view that the Army was a kind of refuge for people who were not of particularly good character.  That was an attitude of the general public but I am not saying it happened. However, the Minister has made it clear that anyone who joins the Army and wishes to remain in it will have to be of excellent character.  What the Minister has done in that direction is to be welcomed.</P>
      <P>I am glad that the Minister intends to have better quarters for serving soldiers.  I should like to see him providing more quarters of the type provided at the Curragh.  Such facilities would give confidence to the serving soldiers and would help to attract the right kind of person to the Defence Forces.</P>

      <P>When the House adjourned on Thursday last I was replying on this amendment to section 24.  During the course of the debate last Thursday, and on the other days on which this Bill was debated, but particularly on last Thursday, spokesmen from this side of the House made very valid arguments as to why this particular category of employee of a local authority should not be qualified to stand for <Col N="1407" /> election to the local authority for which he was working.  If the Minister sought to qualify the employee of one local authority to stand for election to another local authority our objections would not, perhaps, be so strong, but what the Minister proposes is, in our opinion, absolutely ludicrous; and, in the intervening period since last Thursday, I and my colleagues on this side of the House have been confirmed in the viewpoint we expounded here when this section was being debated last Thursday.  The people are now more aware of what exactly the Minister is proposing and they are in total agreement with our point of view.  People have been amazed at what the Minister is proposing. That has been the general reaction.  You may find the odd person who has a vested interest and who expresses a different point of view but the general feeling on the part of the public is that this is a retrograde step.</P>
      <P>The Minister is excluding every other local authority employee.  How he can distinguish between one category and another is something I cannot understand.  We believe that no employee of a local authority should be placed in a position in which he could find himself elected as a member of the council for which he is working, given the conflict of interests that must arise, the awkward situations that could develop and the clash of loyalties that could result.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not want to repeat the arguments we advanced last Thursday. The Minister made no attempt to answer them and he gave no valid reason for not answering.  The debate last week took place under a cloud. That cloud was caused by the continuous threat issued by the Minister that, unless we hurried up, the Bill could not be debated in both Houses in time to come into effect for the local elections on 18th June next. Looking back, I think now we were right to ignore the Minister's threat because, on the following day, Friday, the Government Chief Whip made an approach to the Fianna Fáil Party. The assistant Whip was in charge when the approach was made.  A very <Col N="1408" /> strong appeal was made to the Fianna Fáil Party to agree on Tuesday, today, to allowing the Bill to conclude in the Dáil.  I will go so far as to say that the approach made by the Parliamentary Secretary to the Taoiseach was close to a begging request.</P>

      <P>The point I am making is that this special plea was made by the Minister and it was held over the Opposition speakers as a threat.  They were told that the Bill was necessary in a short time and that unless we co-operated it could not become law.  I wish to quote something which the Minister said on that occasion&mdash; Volume 272, No. 7, column 1092:</P>
      <P>Before anybody else speaks I would again appeal to Deputy Molloy.  If we are to get through this we would want to make some progress. As of now the position is that apparently the Opposition feel that certain people should be included and Deputy Molloy has an amendment down.  I do not agree and I do not intend to accept the amendment. We could talk until 12 o'clock tonight, if we had time, and we would not be getting any further. This is my information and the House can accept it or not.  The Bill must be reprinted tonight for the Seanad to have it at 10.30 tomorrow morning.

      <P>I move amendment No. 4:</P>
      <P>In page 13, between lines 33 and 34, to insert the following subsection:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;(8)  An order under this section shall only be made after <Col N="1415" /> consultation with the Minister for the Public Service.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Last Thursday I indicated I was prepared to withdraw this amendment as it would be deemed to be introducing a new responsibility for the Minister for the Public Service who is not at the moment responsible for local authority staffs.  At the moment they come within the ambit of the Minister for Local Government.  Before formally withdrawing the amendment, I do not mind pointing out that it was put down as a further illustration of the thinking contained in the sections of this Bill which, as the Bill was presented, meant this House was by-passed in relation to very important orders which could be made under the Bill.</P>
    <P>We have discussed that and the Minister has accepted an amendment. We have reached an amicable agreement that meets our point of view on the orders.  However, it illustrates a trend, one that should not be allowed to obtain in legislation passing through this House.  When I put down the amendment, I thought that as the Bill was so loosely drawn and such wide and devastating powers were available to the Minister with regard to who could or could not stand as a candidate in a local election, it might be appropriate if the Minister had to consult with another person of similar rank.  I thought the Minister for the Public Service might be the appropriate person.  However, in view of the agreement on the amendment in relation to the making of the orders, when they come into effect, their publication and presentation to the House, and the fact that our amendment comes into operation 12 months after this election&mdash;we could not insist on it coming in now as it would not be feasible having regard to the time scale&mdash;the agreement we have reached on the amendment regarding the presenting of orders before the House in draft form will provide sufficient safeguard against any one person, no matter what his office might be, acting in a manner that could be deemed afterwards to have been vindictive or biased.  As it would have been possible for two Ministers to be &ldquo;in <Col N="1416" /> cahoots&rdquo;, I thought this would have been a safeguard.  In the circumstances, I am prepared to withdraw the amendment.</P>

Under this section other Ministers may make orders setting out the grades of employees in their Departments who will be eligible to become candidates at local elections. So far, we have not got any information whatsoever as to the eligible grades of officials or employees of the Department, not even the Minister's own Department.  I should like to get his views as to the thinking of other Ministers on the categories of people employed directly by their Department who can, and I am sure will, become candidates at the forthcoming elections.  We will know when the orders are made.  When will that be?  Could the Minister give any information on this?  It is necessary before we give a blank cheque to find out what the purpose of the blank cheque is.

      <P>This point is causing some confusion.  Deputy Cunningham asked the Minister if he could state what categories of employees in the Public Service would be qualified to stand as candidates in the forthcoming local elections.  We appreciate that under this Bill certain orders can be made by the Minister for Local Government in relation to local authority employees, the Minister for Education in relation to certain employees in the vocational education committees and the Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries in relation to agricultural committees.  That is clear under this Bill.  But the House and the public are anxious to know to <Col N="1418" /> what extent our civil servants qualify to stand for election to local authorities. I have tried to get this information. As Local Government spokesman for the Opposition, this information should have been made available to me.  I tried to get it by way of a Parliamentary question and I was informed today:</P>
      <P>I regret that I have had to disallow the question addressed by you to the Minister for the public service regarding the category of employees in the public service qualified to stand for election to local authorities.  The Minister has no official responsibility for stating the law in this matter.</P>
      <P>That was a genuine attempt to obtain the information in the simplest possible manner and gave the Minister plenty of time to gather it.  I was refused.  If the Minister for the Public Service is not responsible, then our idea of his responsibilities is misleading. We understood that he was responsible for all matters relating to staff in all branches of the Civil Service. The Minister for Local Government might help us by offering to circulate to us later a list of the categories of civil servants who will be allowed to stand for local elections and also those who recently were allowed to participate actively in political affairs.  There has been some lifting of restrictions in the post office, but it is difficult to know where it starts and where it ends.  Could the Minister undertake to&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>As the Deputy knows, anybody in the Civil Service could offer himself for election.  It would then be a matter for the Minister for the Public Service to say whether he could hold his job and serve on the public authority.  This is not a matter with which I can deal here.  Therefore, I think it is unfair that I should be asked, at this stage, to give this information.</P>

This information has nothing to do with the Bill.  I do not propose to take responsibility for something for which I am not responsible. Deputy Molloy knows that any civil servant can offer himself for election.  It is then a matter for the Minister for the Public Service to decide, in consultation with the Minister responsible for the civil servant, whether or not he will be allowed to stand.  I will not discuss this matter at this stage.  It has nothing to do with the Bill.  It would be unfair to the House to attempt to bring in something now which is entirely irrelevant.</P>

      <P>I agree that it would be unfair to expect the Minister to have this information available now. It was brought up quite innocently by Deputy Cunningham.  I have indicated that I am prepared to withdraw this amendment but, as he did <Col N="1420" /> mention it, and as the Minister is aware of the confusion in this regard, I thought it would be appropriate&mdash; and the Chair has allowed it&mdash;that we should seek clarification.  In view of the fact that the Minister for the Public Service is on record as having no responsibility in this matter, and in view of the fact that the Minister for Local Government has stated that he is not responsible for it, we seem to be in greater difficulty.  I do not want to put the Minister on the spot. Could he give us some assurance that he will let the Opposition Party know what changes, if any, have been made in relation to public service staffs in recent times?</P>

      <P>There is a difference. The local authority employee cannot stand until the Bill becomes law.  A civil servant can stand and he can be disqualified from his job.  If he hands in his nomination it will be accepted. A nomination of an employee of a local authority of a certain grade will not be accepted.  That is the difference. If Deputy Molloy wants the information I am quite sure it will be made available in good time, if it has not already been made available. I am not quite clear on what exactly he is looking for.</P>

We have information as to the categories for which it is obligatory on the Minister <Col N="1421" /> to seek permission from the House.

    <Title>Committee on Finance. - Local Elections (Petitions and Disqualifications) Bill, 1974: Fifth Stage.</Title>
    <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill do now pass.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesCTunney" hpid="Mr. Tunney Mr. Tunney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tunney</NameTxt>
      <P>Under this Bill the Minister for Local Government has removed the ban which existed in respect of local authority employees' eligibility to stand for local elections. The Minister has informed the House that he is entitled to ban certain categories of workers or official from standing and that he can include certain categories, certain types.  We understand from him that he proposes to remove the ban from the clerical officer grade in the local authorities. Deputies have addressed themselves to this point and I should like to add my voice to theirs in reminding the Minister of how dangerous a move this may be.</P>
      <P>We know that in the past few years the position of a clerical officer in a local authority has been upgraded and that you now have a situation in which a clerical officer may be engaged in work which can be regarded as very important, very confidential. Until it can be demonstrated that the inclusion of clerical officers is desirable and necessary I think there should not be any haste on the part of the Minister or on the part of this House in providing for a situation where clerical officers can operate simultaneously as members of a local authority.</P>
      <P>I read in a paper&mdash;I think it was <i>The Irish Independent</i> yesterday or, if not, <i>The Evening Herald</i> of yesterday afternoon&mdash;a letter from the secretary of the regional council of the Labour Party in which he expressed the opinion and policy of his regional council that auctioneers should not qualify for membership of local authorities.  Presumably the secretary of that council was concerned that an auctioneer might abuse his position as a member of a local authority.  Having studied the situation, apparently that is the policy of what I might describe as a major element of the Labour Party.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If the members of that party can see a danger in having an auctioneer, a professional man who for the greater part of the week and indeed <Col N="1425" /> the greater part of each day operates outside the office of the local authority, if they can see in him a danger to true democracy at local government level, I fail to see how they would not share the concern I have that similar dangers, and indeed greater ones, could apply in the case of a clerical officer of a local authority also being his own boss and having ready access to documentation and to all matters appertaining to his own position, on the one hand, as clerical officer and simultaneously related to that of his position as a member of that local authority.  I am sure the Minister must accept that it gives to that clerical officer a special position <i>vis-á-vis</i> the other members of that local authority and tends to distort that equalisation on which democracy is based.</P>
    <P>We can take other aspects of it.  Let us take the case of a clerical officer in Dublin Corporation who is also a member of the local authority and thereby also qualifies for and indeed must accept membership of two subsidiary bodies.  We shall take his position in an area which might be described as hypothetical but which can occur and where, in the pursuit of the duties devolving upon him as a member of the local authority and of those also devolving upon him as a member of subsidiary bodies, he finds himself&mdash;as do most members of the authority quite often&mdash;having to take serious issue with the city manager. It is unnecessary for me to develop the embarrassment, the awkwardness and undesirability of the situation which must ensue.  Again this might be extremely hypothetical.  But can it happen that in the conscientious pursuit of his duties and responsibilities as a member of the authority he antagonises or annoys the city manager? Can the city manager grant relief to himself by arranging for the promotion of that clerical officer?  If that clerical officer is promoted to the rank of rate collector, minor staff officer, major staff officer or executive officer, if that proposition is placed before him, it can be readily accepted that it can and should be avoided.</P>
    <P>We know that of late the position <Col N="1426" /> of clerical officer in local authorities is enjoyed by females as well as males. I think one can foresee the dangers I see applying to the male clerical officer applying to the same if not a greater extent to the female clerical officer.</P>
    <P>The Minister earlier on, on a point of information on which I shall not elaborate to any great extent, said that all civil servants have a right to offer themselves for election to local authorities. That may be so but I think that most civil servants realise that in so doing they automatically disqualify themselves from the position they hold in the service.  Are we to take it that this move towards giving permission to the clerical officer in the local authority to serve simultaneously as a member will apply presently to the general service?  One can have a situation where a clerical officer, a junior or higher executive in the service will qualify for membership of this House.  I think it would be very wrong to treat lightly the important position which a clerical officer holds at local authority or general service level.  I served for some years as a clerical officer in a State Department.  I can put on the record of this House the true position that, in the matter of my Minister of that day replying to parliamentary questions in this House connected with the section in which I worked, I, at mere clerical officer level, answered the question.  Subsequently it went through a channel of inspection and correction but invariably it was the answer which I prepared that was voiced here by the Minister.  I cite that in passing to indicate that clerical officers are no mean officers.  Even though it might be in a limited field, but in respect of the section in which they work they have access to the best and most confidential information in that section.</P>
    <P>Having regard to human frailty and to the fears expressed by the regional council of the Labour Party in respect of auctioneers, the Minister must accept that on balance it is much better for democracy and it is much more equitable that the ban on clerical officers being members of local authorities should remain.  If the Minister <Col N="1427" /> insists on the opposite there is an obligation on him to indicate to this House where he sees the tremendous advantage lies in removing that ban.</P>
    <P>The point was made the other day that the Minister has had no representations from clerical officers or the association catering for that grade to remove this ban.  One must therefore be forgiven for asking where did the germ of the thought which led to the action here arise.  There is an obligation on Deputies on this side to ask the Minister to indicate to this House as well as to the people of the country why it is that he is removing the ban from clerical officers seeking election to local authorities.  The present Minister for Local Government is fully conversant with pressures and lobbies from organisations and associations. What pressures, if any, were put on him to remove this ban?  If no pressures were put on him to do this, why does he think it is so necessary to the perfection of the local elections system that clerical officers, officials of local authorities, should while holding such positions also enjoy membership of local authorities?  The Minister's action cannot be defended.</P>
    <P>The Minister has excluded other categories.  We know that a welfare officer may not be a member of the local authority which he serves.  A rent collector or a rate collector may not be a member of the local authority which he serves.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Tunney</NameTxt>
      <P>When discussing that which is in the Bill it is practically impossible not to fringe at least on that which it might relevantly contain. The Minister has indicated to the House in the powers given to him in this Bill he intends to remove that ban on local authority officers being members of the local authorities which they serve.  Therefore everything I am discussing must be accepted as relevant to the Bill or being in the Bill.</P>
      <P>It is not my intention to move beyond that which I have already stated.  I should like the Minister to give his reasons for allowing clerical officers to be full time members of local authorities, who on promotion may find themselves ineligible and who, if one has a suspicious mind, could say they are being put in the position where an unscrupulous boss may promote them because in the exercise of their duties and responsibilities they are making life difficult for him.  A large wing of the Minister's party indicated yesterday that it was their policy that professional categories&mdash;they referred to auctioneers&mdash;should not be members of local authorities.  How can the Minister accept in all those circumstances that Members of this side of the House should be prepared to accept the <i>bona fides</i> of this case in respect of clerical officers, especially in view of the fact that our understanding of it is that individually or collectively those clerical officers have not desired the removal of the ban proposed by the Minister?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LiamCunningham" hpid="Mr. Cunningham Mr. Cunningham">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cunningham</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister, who usually does not give way on anything, realised during last week that the case being put forward by the Opposition had merit, so much so that he accepted two amendments; but he was not prepared to accept our amendment dealing with clerical officers in the local service.  We do not expect the Minister to accept our policy but surely during the past week he has been aware of the large volume of newspaper comment, both in the daily and Sunday papers, on this issue. <Col N="1429" /> In fact one of the papers devoted an editorial to the matter.  All of this comment, including the editorial, favoured the case being made by this party.  One would have thought that the Minister would have considered this comment worth paying attention to, but so far he has refused to listen to the logic being put forward by us. Evidently he has chosen to ignore the Press comment.</P>
      <P>I am sure too that the Minister has been through his own constituency recently and has been made aware of the opinions of sensible people in all constituencies who do not wish to be represented by clerical officers in the service of their local authorities. Despite all this the Minister is prepared to continue with that part of the proposal contained in the Bill, while on the other hand he is not prepared to tell us what will happen in the case of clerical officers in his own Department or in the case of those civil servants who are in grades comparable with that of clerical officer.  The Opposition are anxious to know what categories of persons either in the employment of the local authority or of central government can be selected by the various parties.  We want this information before we embark on the local election campaign.</P>
      <P>It is disrespectful to the House to present a Bill which sets out the position in respect of local authority employees but which makes no mention of the other employees in the public service, who generally are much more numerous.  We have failed to extract from the Minister a statement as to his thinking in so far as his own Department are concerned.  He has said that the matter is one for each individual Minister but Deputies of this House and the people generally should be made aware of who is eligible to go forward as a candidate in the forthcoming local elections.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister has said that every civil servant would be eligible to go forward as a candidate.  That is not true or at least it is true only to the extent that a civil servant would be prepared to forego his position, his pension rights and any other benefits he had built up during the years.  However <Col N="1430" /> we want the Minister to tell us which categories of civil servants will be enabled to go forward as candidates in the forthcoming elections.  It is not right that the present ambiguous position should prevail at a date only five weeks away from the local elections.</P>
    <P>Rate collectors, for instance, have been excluded from eligibility.  I do not know where on these scales this category of persons is placed <i>vis-á-vis</i> clerical officers, whether they are on a grade that is higher or lower than clerical officers.  A rate collector is an outdoor staff man and is not regarded as being in the administrative grade.  However rate collectors are not being excluded from urban councils. This seems strange if the reason for the exclusion of this grade from local elections is because of their handling of money and because of the possibility of fiddling the register. An urban council would be within the county council electoral area.  I notice that the Minister is smiling, but earlier he said that home assistance officers, rate collectors and rent collectors cannot stand as candidates in a local authority election where they are employed but that they could go forward for election in an urban council election and that, consequently, a rate collector in County Dublin could be a candidate for Dublin Corporation.  The same would apply to any other area of the country.</P>

      <P>On a point of information, section 24 of the Bill refers to the 1955 Local Government Act, section 21, subsection (1).  That section reads as follows:</P>
      <P>No person shall hold any office of profit under or be employed for remuneration by or under any local authority while he is a member of that authority.</P>
      <P>This Bill proposes to remove the ban on all local authority employees, and the Bill then enables the Minister by order to replace that ban again on certain categories.  However, under this Bill every employee of a local authority is affected and I think Deputy Cunningham is in order.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cunningham</NameTxt>
      <P>Section 23 refers to any paid officer.  However, I am not going to take up time with the matter. Just to finish it, what I am saying is that a rate collector is excluded, but he is not excluded if he becomes a candidate for an urban area within the electoral area for which he is rate collector. This was indicated by the Minister an hour ago.</P>
    </Speaker>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cunningham</NameTxt>
      <P>The question was asked by Deputy Lalor: Can a home assistance officer employed by one local authority be a candidate for election for another local authority? The Minister said yes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FlorenceCrowley" hpid="Mr. Crowley Mr. Crowley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Crowley</NameTxt>
      <P>Is that correct?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>That is correct.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LiamCunningham" hpid="Mr. Cunningham Mr. Cunningham">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cunningham</NameTxt>
      <P>That is clear and not denied.  What I am pointing out is that a rate collector employed by the Donegal County Council cannot become a member of the Donegal County Council nor can he become a candidate in the local election for that body, but, following the Minister's statement, he can become a member of another local authority, the other local authority being, say, the Letterkenny Urban Council.  If he is collecting <Col N="1433" /> rates in the Letterkenny electoral area to which he was appointed, which would include the Letterkenny Urban Council, then you have this gilbertian situation, that the Minister has said that he cannot consider rate collectors because they compile the register, but in this instance a rate collector would be allowed stand in an area where he not alone collects rates but compiles the register.  Therefore, his argument against having rate collectors stand for the electoral area in which they are employed does not hold water. I shall not follow that any further.</P>
      <P>There is another situation.  If a clerical officer is elected to the county council, he may be one who holds a position in one of the sections to which elected members of the county council call to make representations. Clerical officers in the Donegal County Council are dealing day in and day out with personal telephone calls and letters by county councillors to the office where they work and where, in a lot of cases, they are the most senior persons most of the time available in that office.  We should not have a situation where such a person, as well as being a clerical officer, would be a member of the county council.</P>
      <P>Suppose that person is elected to the county council, if he is a popular person&mdash;and these people are; they are well used to dealing with the public and with other members of the county council&mdash;he may well find himself as chairman of the county council and being able to tell his manager where to get off, or on, as the case may be.  If the manager thinks that the clerical officer is becoming too independent or is a thorn in his side&mdash;most managers will tell us that county councillors are thorns in their sides; they would like to get on with their job and not be annoyed sometimes by the county councillors&mdash;he might want to get rid of him.  All he has to do is to call John Brown into his office one day and offer him promotion.  John Browne gets his promotion and there is a vacancy in the county council.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That is one of a large number of <Col N="1434" /> ridiculous situations which can happen and which the Minister is creating, and is creating purposely and with malice aforethought.  I do not mean malice in the ordinary sense, but we are warning him; we are telling him that he is doing wrong. We feel in a hopeless situation about this.  I had a phone call recently from somebody who is not an official of the county council but who was very annoyed at this situation and what it could lead to.</P>
    <P>I know there is no use asking the Minister at this stage to do anything about this matter; he will not.  But at least when this Bill is through we can, as a party, say we did succeed in amending the Bill in some respects, that we tried very hard to amend the Bill as far as clerical officers are concerned.  We did not succeed, but nobody can say we did not try.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FlorenceCrowley" hpid="Mr. Crowley Mr. Crowley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Crowley</NameTxt>
      <P>I think that, in regard to most of the amendments we have put forward, the Minister has been very reasonable and accepted them, because, as he said himself, they improve the Bill that he brought before the House.  This is why we have pursued so vigorously the amendment in relation to clerical officers.  I do not want to delay the House unduly, and certainly we do not want to go back over all the other things that have been said over a number of days in this debate.  However, I did ask the Minister the last day if he would give us just one good reason why he designated clerical officers to be put into this special category and why he excluded other people from it.  Again, I personally do not disagree with rate collectors, rent collectors and home assistance officers not being allowed to stand for a local authority election. Neither do I agree with clerical officers being allowed to stand.  To be consistent the Minister must put clerical officers into exactly the same category as those we have mentioned. He said he was anxious to grant this facility to clerical officers in order to further the aims he or his party or the Government had in regard to job democracy.  He might, when replying, tell us how this would further those <Col N="1435" /> aims in regard to clerical officers. Does he not agree that already democracy in regard to these jobs is operating at a very advanced stage in all local authorities?  Certainly that is so in the local authorities of which I know anything.</P>
      <P>No doubt among clerical officers there are many men who would be worthy and indeed excellent representatives of the people but we could say that equally of rate collectors, rent collectors and home assistance officers.  Nevertheless, we must view with a certain concern the fact that representations which are the every day occupation of all county councillors could ultimately be referred for a report or indeed even for advice on a decision being taken to a clerical officer of the opposite party in the same electoral area.</P>
      <P>Up to now we have been very fortunate in our local authorities where we have had very few scandals and where accusations of corruption have been minimal.  Personally I cannot recall any accusation being made on that score.  This is how we want to be. I think the Minister is upsetting a very delicate balance of cross-check whereby members and officials and officials and members ensure that each section of the democratic and bureaucratic machines does its job efficiently, fairly and honestly.  On that score alone the Minister should give very careful consideration to the danger of having an elected member who would also be an official of the council at the same time.  This delicate balance I have mentioned could be put in jeopardy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is important that the people we represent at any level should be in no doubt that we are doing a conscientious job on their behalf and that our officials are working in a similar way.  The Minister has been more than reasonable in regard to several of the amendments to this Bill and he should try to ensure that confidence in the democratic structure and its integrity is not affected. It has been said that the Minister has a clerical officer in his own constituency who wishes to stand for the <Col N="1436" /> Labour Party and that this is the reason for the introduction of this Bill.  It is very hard to accept that theory and personally I find it difficult to understand why this should be; but when one endeavours to find a logical explanation for clerical officers being singled out, one is forced to conclude that no substantial argument can be made for this.  Perhaps when replying the Minister, if he is not prepared to consider again the case of clerical officers, would tell us clearly and unambiguously why he found it necessary to include that grade.</P>
    <P>We realise the necessity for a Bill such as this to make provision in relation to local election petitions, to make provision in relation to membership disqualifications with regard to local authorities, to enable certain restrictions on holding office under or being employed by a local authority to be modified, to repeal certain enactments relating to local elections and to make other provision connected with the foregoing.  As the Minister saw in the debate here, except for a few contentious sections we, on this side, accepted in the main the bulk of the Bill.  Not only did we accept it, but we saw the necessity for the introduction of the Bill.</P>
    <P>I think the Minister has deviated dangerously from the delicate balance we have been discussing.  A situation could come about in which a clerical officer would be elected as chairman of the county council and this, in my opinion, would create a very dangerous situation for local democracy as we know it.</P>
    <P>Surely the Minister must see the logic of the situation we are complaining about.  He could, having stood out assiduously against our suggestion and refused to accept our amendment, in the not too distant future regret his stand.  I accept that the Minister does not have any ulterior motive in introducing this section and I know that there is no demand from the Local Government Officials' Union in relation to this but it is possible that some individuals have contacted the Minister and requested that he include this.  Maybe in his <Col N="1437" /> generosity, and in a weak moment, he made certain commitments which he finds difficult to go back on now. If that is the case, I can well appreciate the Minister's predicament in not wanting to go back on his undertaking but the consequences of his action could have very severe repercussions for local democracy.</P>
    <P>The Minister should reconsider the action that he is contemplating.  I am aware that we are very fortunate in having officials in our local authorities&mdash;the same can be said of our civil servants&mdash;who are of the highest integrity.  We also have on local authorities public representatives who, for no payment, work and strive on behalf of the people they represent.  These public representatives strike a very important balance as a cross-check on each other and up to now that has worked perfectly.  Why does the Minister at this stage create the danger of upsetting this balance?</P>
    <P>If the Minister was honest, he would say that we have a very strong argument on our side.  As Deputy Cunningham has pointed out, a lot of impartial commentators and ordinary people see a lot of folly in what the Minister is attempting to do.  The Minister has shown that he is big enough to accept amendments, even at this late stage, and he should also reconsider this issue, the question of including clerical officers, very carefully. He should ask himself if it is a wise move and if it will have repercussions that he will later regret.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnCallanan" hpid="Mr. Callanan Mr. Callanan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Callanan</NameTxt>
      <P>Since I spoke on this Bill on Committee Stage I have consulted county councillors of all political parties to ascertain their views and they all see a great danger in the Minister's move.  I am all in favour of job democracy but county councillors do not deal with staff.  It is solely a managerial function.  Even if staff feel they are being victimised, the councillors can do nothing about it.  If the county manager so wishes he can refuse to allow a discussion on such matters to take place at council meetings.  The county manager is entirely in charge of staff and for <Col N="1438" /> this reason if clerical officers are elected to county councils I can see a ridiculous situation arising.</P>
      <P>For seven years I have been a member of a local authority and because during those years it could be held that I was an awful boy I would not like to be employed by that local authority.  Members of local authorities are obliged on occasions to stand up to officials and to the manager.  The clerical officer who is a councillor will find himself in a very awkward position if he is a bold boy at a meeting.  If a county manager wishes to get rid of such a person, he has only to appoint him a staff officer.</P>
      <P>A former senior official of a local authority told me on one occasion that after a council election the officials discuss those elected and consider how to get on the right side of them. Another danger I see in this is that every political party will want to have a clerical officer on the council because it must be accepted that it would be a great thing to have a man on the inside.  The clerical officer's fellow party members will then be in a position to obtain information concerning grants and loans from the inside.  This is the feeling abroad.</P>
      <P>If clerical officers are to be permitted to become members of county councils. why should the same not apply with regard to rate collectors who are now on a salary?  There was an argument against their being members of a local authority when they were on a percentage basis because it was held that it was to their advantage to increase the rates so that they would obtain a bigger percentage.  If there is a good reason for not allowing them to stand for local elections, there is also a good reason against clerical officers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Public representatives should not be under any compliment to anybody if they stand up and defend the workers, or anybody else, but I doubt very much if someone who has to meet the manager the next day will be in that position.  I am more afraid for him than I am for the manager because the manager is his boss.  There is a good deal of talk about job democracy but there will be no job democracy here <Col N="1439" /> because, whether he is inside or outside, he will have no say; the manager has that.  Of course, if the Managerial Act is amended and control of staff is given back to the county council the position will be different.  If he then says anything which may hurt the boss he will have the support of the other county councillors because it is they who will try him.  At the moment it is the county manager who tries him.</P>
    <P>I ask the Minister to look at this from the point of view of ensuring that everyone gets fair play and that we have independence.  I give the Minister credit for what he wants to do, but we have a great deal to contend with in the line of planning and so on.  To my mind we have too many &ldquo;yes-men&rdquo; from every party on county councils.  I have been a member of a county council for several years and I do not give a fiddle-de-dee whether the county manager or the county engineer talks to me or does not talk to me; I say what I have to say and they can take it or leave it.  I do not give a darn about them.  However, I would not like to have to go into an office the next day after saying something that might not redound to the credit of the county manager.  I would be afraid for my job.  I ask the Minister to take all these factors into consideration and ensure that, when we elect our county council, we will have on them people who are independent of officialdom.  I am not saying anything against officials; I am merely pointing out what could happen.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Calleary</NameTxt>
      <P>This is the first time I have come in on this Bill and I do so having sampled the views of quite a number of people in the constituency I have the honour to represent.  Having done that, I now want to add my voice to the voices of those Deputies who have asked the Minister to exclude, even at this late hour, clerical officers from this Bill.  I make this request for a number of reasons.  The Minister was a member of a local authority for a number of years and he knows quite well that 99 per cent of the representations made, be they made directly personally to the manager, by letter or by telephone, they eventually arrive <Col N="1440" /> on the desk of a clerical officer.  It is a clerical officer who will have to pick out the information sought.  It is a clerical officer who will have recourse to the relevant files, many of which are confidential.  It is the clerical officer who will eventually make out the answer to the representation.  Were that clerical officer so minded he could hold the answer to the representations until such time as he himself had an opportunity of writing to the person making the representations.  All parties here have in them members who were at one time or another members of local authorities or officers of local authorities. These latter had quite rightly to resign or get leave of absence while they are Members of this House.</P>
      <P>I remember a by-election some years ago in which a number of allegations were made about the number of medical cards issued.  The Minister should tonight, by deleting clerical officers from the scope of this Bill, put an end to any opportunity of allegations of the same nature ever being made again.  We should be very careful here to avoid any repetition of these allegations.  I, personally, as the Minister knows, have a very good knowledge of what can happen an individual associated with the local authority because I acted in a temporary capacity for approximately three years and, in that period, there were occasions on which I was in possession of information which I could have, if I so desired, used to my own advantage.  There are occasions on which the possession of information makes the task of any official a hard one to carry out.  It is impossible to serve two masters, but that is what will happen if a clerical officer is elected to a local authority. Most of the candidates for the forthcoming election have already been selected but in the following election there will certainly be a rash of clerical officers as candidates for the reasons mentioned by Deputies.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should like at this stage to pose a question: what will happen if a clerical officer is an acting staff officer? If a clerical officer becomes a staff officer and he is a member of a local authority he will have to resign <Col N="1441" /> his membership.  What will happen in the case I have posed?</P>

      <P>If a person is promoted in an acting capacity to one of the grades that would disqualify him, will the Minister inform us what his position will be?  If a man is in an acting grade would he have to resign for a fortnight or three weeks until such time as a person is employed full-time?  I do not think it is possible for a man to serve two masters properly.  A man could not get up at a council meeting, disagree violently with his manager and then come in the next morning and take orders from him, having ordered that manager on the previous evening to do something.</P>
      <P>Some Deputies have already referred to the possibility of a clerical officer becoming chairman of a county council.  This opens even greater possibility for abuse.  The chairman of a county council has the right to look at any file.  He can ask for any file to be brought to the council chamber.  He has unlimited access to all types of confidential information.  I appeal again to the Minister, even at this very late stage, to exclude this grade from the Bill.</P>

      <P>I want to ask the Minister for clarification on section 24. The question relates to the proposed orders.  I should like to ask the Minister if it is intended to debar public officials from standing for election to the authority they are employees of or in the area of operation of their employment. I can give a specific example in the north Sligo electoral area where the county council, which includes the borough of Sligo, takes in people in the borough.  That part of the county can vote for county council elections and at the same time the people in the borough have a vote for elections to membership of the Sligo Corporation. Consider a rate collector, for example, or any of the people described in the order, such as employees of the Sligo County Council, who are debarred under the order from standing for the county council where the actual area of operation of their employment may be within the borough.  I should like the Minister to give us some information in relation to these people described in the order under section <Col N="1443" /> 24 and to tell us whether they will be allowed stand for election to Sligo Corporation.</P>

It seems to me that they will be in an invidious position. Various Members have given reasons for this.  This should be self-evident. Sometimes information leaks and a man in such a position would be suspect even though he might be completely innocent in the matter.  Many situations could arise which would cause embarrassment.</P>
      <P>I do not see that there is any political issue in this.  It is not as if it would affect one political party as against another.  We would have the same advantages and disadvantages. It is surely a matter of working out the system of local government in the best way possible without depriving anybody of the franchise.  There are people in this country who are at present deprived of the franchise because of the positions they hold.  I spent 30 years in local authorities and saw changes coming gradually.  Sometimes the changes came too slowly but on the whole the changes came in the right direction and were, by and large, an improvement on previous situations.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are good managers and some who are not so good.  It all depends on the man in office.  We have been blessed with very good managers where I come from and we have had <Col N="1444" /> little or no complaint about the administration of local government.  It seems to me that to bring in this now, in the teeth of argument which seems to be rational and sane, is without justification.  If there was an outcry or demand from a union of these people, such as the Post Office Workers' Union, it might be understandable. For years there was agitation among those workers and their grievances were discussed and decisions arrived at.  In this particular case I cannot see any advantage, and that puzzles me.  It is not a matter of great political significance to any party if this materialises.  Parties will be anxious to recruit these people into their various political parties because, rightly or wrongly, they will feel such people have unfair advantage over an ordinary member of a party or a member of the public.  That is an invidious position.</P>
    <P>The Minister, for whom I have a certain regard because of his public service to the country, surprises me because I cannot understand why he should set himself against what seems to be reasonable argument, without rancour and without political bias.  I should be interested to know why the Minister feels it is essential to put this through when there is so much of merit in the Bill before the House.  The Minister should concentrate on the points in the Bill that will prove to be of benefit.  I should be surprised if the Minister has not had arguments similar to ours from members of his own party in another place.  I should be glad to know why the Minister feels this is essential.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to refer later to the argument which has been made by a long succession of speakers on this side of the House, but before I get on to the main point of contention in this Bill I should like to refer to section 19.  In that section there are a number of unusual provisions.  On the whole they are rather undesirable provisions.  In subsection (2) of that section there is a provision that</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>.... a person who is called as a witness at the trial of a petition shall not be excused from answering <Col N="1445" /> any question relating to any offence at or connected with the relevant local election on the ground that the answer thereto may incriminate or tend to incriminate him or on grounds of privilege;</P>
    <P>It then goes on to make some provisos in relation to that, to which I will refer later on, but the point about which I am particularly concerned is that a witness will not be excused from answering on the ground that the answer thereto may incriminate or tend to incriminate him.  It has always been a very basic provision in our law that nobody giving evidence in any form of court, particularly when he is on oath, should be forced to answer a question the truthful answer to which he himself considers might incriminate him.  In every court in this country, criminal and civil, and even in semijudicial courts like, for example, a coroner's inquest, there is an obligation on the judge, justice, coroner or whoever happens to be presiding or indeed the man presiding at a sworn inquiry to tell a witness if he is asked a particular type of question that he is not obliged to answer it if he feels that the answer to it might tend to incriminate him.</P>
    <P>That rule is basic in our law not just for 50 or 100 years but back as far as one can go.  Of course the reasons for it are very good; that a man should not be put in the position of having an alternative choice of either perjuring himself or else admitting to a crime for which he can be prosecuted.  Our law, and the English Common Law long before our own specific law, always recognised that no citizen should be put in that position, and with very good reason. That rule is as valid and as necessary today as it was 500 or 600 years ago because the unenviable choice that can face many witnesses remains and is just as unpleasant now as it ever was. Perhaps it is even more unpleasant now in many circumstances for people are brought in, possibly against their will, to give evidence at a petition hearing in the Circuit Court about a matter which, let us face it, is not all that important: a disputed local election.  It may be of great importance <Col N="1446" /> to those who are immediately involved in it but, looked at in any way objectively, it is not really of great importance whether or not a particular councillor is or is not validly elected to some local body.  I do not think any man should be brought in and put in the position&mdash;I may be wrong but, so far as I know, he cannot be put in that position anywhere else under our law&mdash;that he has a choice in certain circumstances of two things: either admitting to a crime for which he will be prosecuted as a result of his admission or alternatively committing perjury.</P>
    <P>I do not think that is fair.  I know there are certain provisos in relation to this, that the court can give him a certificate that it believes his evidence. However, I do not think that is of much use.  In fact that itself could well give rise, as was pointed out here last week on the Committee Stage, when unfortunately I was not present, to many problems because untrue statements about somebody can be certified for by the court.  The right of a man to decline to answer on the grounds that he might incriminate himself is regarded as so fundamental in some other countries that it is written into their Constitutions.  I do not think it is specifically written into our Constitution probably not because the drafters felt it was not the kind of basic right which should be protected but because it was so very much part of our fundamental law that they did not envisage that it would ever be sought to be set aside.  We seem to have this situation here and it is no harm to remind the House that this situation could not arise in other countries.  In many ways one would be less concerned about this if the proceedings in which a provision of this kind was made were much more important than these proceedings. Petitions about local elections are not very common and even when they do happen they are not normally of world shattering or even nation shattering significance.</P>
    <P>Later on in this subsection there is a proviso that a man is entitled to get a certificate from the court if the court is satisfied that he answered truthfully and this gives him an indemnity <Col N="1447" /> against everything except a prosecution for perjury.  It was pointed out here last week by Deputy Molloy that the position of a perfectly innocent outside party slandered by somebody who gets a certificate of this kind from the court is very difficult indeed. He might be more than anxious to take proceedings to clear his good name.  He might be able to prove that the statement made about him was untrue and was slanderous but notwithstanding that he is precluded from even bringing those proceedings.  This sort of artificial protection of somebody who makes a statement at one of those petitions is wrong.  The point could well be made that while he is in the actual petition court and makes that statement he is privileged anyway. He is, but if he gets a certificate of its truth he can go outside the court and repeat it <i>ad nauseam</i> if he wishes in the full knowledge that it is untrue but because he has this certificate he can never be sued.</P>
    <P>The provision in subsection (1) which allows the court of its own volition to direct that a particular person should be brought before the court and should give evidence at the trial is, on the face of it, perhaps not too onerous.  But it can give rise to, to say the least of it, a danger of perjury, because if people are being dragged in against their wills obviously they are trying to stay out for some good reason.  They are more likely in those circumstances to commit perjury than if they came voluntarily as witnesses or even under subpoena from any of the parties to the petition.  It is hard to imagine anyone who has anything relevant to testify about not being brought by one of the various parties to that petition because a petition is not confined, as an ordinary case would be, to a plaintiff and a defendant. There may be quite a large number of parties, including in most cases, the Attorney General, who would have full power to subpoena somebody and would have a duty to do so if he thought that person had any relevant evidence to give in relation to the matters at issue.</P>
    <P>The matters dealt with in section <Col N="1448" /> 19 are important.  They perhaps do not get very much attention because they are of a technical nature.  They go to the fundamental rights of a citizen in a fairly drastic way.</P>
    <P>The part of the Bill that has got much public attention is that which arises out of section 24, namely, the question of giving power to the Minister for Local Government, the Minister for Education and the Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries to make regulations specifying what classes of local government or other employees may take part in elections to local authorities.</P>
    <P>All of us accept gladly the principle that manual employees and the lower grades of employees outside the office in a local authority should be entitled to take part in any such election as candidates or to canvass on behalf of candidates.  Everyone welcomes the proposed order in that respect. There is only one simple, net point about which virtually all in the House&mdash;not just the Opposition&mdash;are in disagreement with the Minister for Local Government, whether or not they express that disagreement. I am referring to the proposal under the proposed order he has given us in relation to what he intends to do under section 24, his intention to include clerical officers of local authorities, and presumably their equivalents in health boards and vocational education committees.  He intends to exclude them from the restriction on local government employees.</P>
    <P>In common with very many speakers who put their point moderately, calmly and coherently, I think this is wrong.  As earlier speakers pointed out, all of us have met people over the past week of all political persuasions and of none who are unanimously of the opinion that this proposal is wrong.  Unless there is some ulterior motive involved, I cannot understand why the Minister for Local Government will not accept the amendments and proposals that have been put continuously from this side of the House in relation to this point.</P>
    <P>The matter has been argued more ably than I could do.  I do not need <Col N="1449" /> to repeat the arguments of Deputies Calleary, Callanan, Crowley and others who have a great deal more experience of local government than I have.  We had the example of Deputy Calleary who was employed by a local authority at one time; he told the House about the dangers, of which he knew from experience, of someone in the position of clerical officer with access to private and confidential information being allowed to be a member of the local authority by whom he was employed.</P>
    <P>I am surprised that although the Minister on Committee Stage accepted amendments which many people might think important in themselves but less important than this case, now he refuses to accept this amendment. In the last few days I have spoken to various grades of employees of local authorities, including clerical officers, and most of them thought this proposal was wrong.  I would add I do not know the political affiliations of the employees concerned. They were able to instance to me numerous examples of what a clerical officer could do that he should not do.  They made the point, as was done by Deputies Calleary and Callanan tonight, that there will be a serious conflict of duty if a clerical officer, an employee of the manager for the purpose of control of his employment, is also to be a controller of the manager because of his membership of the local authority. There is a blatant, clear and open conflict here and I do not think anyone has denied or could deny, this is so.  It is most unsatisfactory because as Deputies Crowley, Healy and others said, the proper kind of balance as between the membership of a local authority and the employees could be put in jeopardy.</P>
    <P>Unfortunately, there may be a situation where there will be two grades of councillors, those with access to everything and those with access only to what the manager tells them.  It is unfair to the other councillors, and it is unfair to the clerical officer/ councillor himself, and this point was made earlier tonight.  For instance, if a meeting of the local authority takes place on a Monday evening, the other <Col N="1450" /> members of the local authority can go their different ways and not meet again for a fortnight or a few weeks. However, the clerical officer has to face the manager on the following day, conscious of the fact that he is a comparative junior employee and very much subject to the manager's directions.  His whole career is in the manager's hands and, consequently, the man who is interested in not jeopardising his career will take it very handily so far as many issues that come before the council are concerned.</P>
    <P>In my opinion, and I think this is shared by many speakers, it is wrong that the hands of a public representative should be tied in advance because of such a situation.  Any man who enters public life, whether in this House, in the Seanad or in a local authority, should be free to speak his mind as he sees fit to do so. Whatever the political consequences for him&mdash;and this is a matter he must assess&mdash;there should be no consequences, or potential consequences, for him in his employment and in his career.  That is where the great danger lies in this situation.</P>
    <P>It is not even a question of having to amend the Bill at this late stage&mdash; this might not be possible for one reason or another.  In order that we might be happy about section 24, all that is necessary is an assurance by the Minister that in the order he will make he will exclude clerical officers. If he does that, he will be agreeing with the views of 95 per cent of the people who know anything about the problems caused by this proposal.</P>
    <P>One could make a valid case for the inclusion of people such as outdoor rate collectors and rent collectors, whom the Minister proposes to exclude.  I am not particularly worried one way or another whether they are in or out, but there is far more justification for having them in than there is for including clerical officers.  A rent collector or a rate collector does not have access to files or information in the local authority office.  He is not in a position to have prior information about proposals of the local authority. We are all aware that certain members <Col N="1451" /> of local authorities have been able on occasions in the past to get prior information from officials of the council, usually from clerical officers or people of that grade.  Having got that information about actions proposed to be taken but still confidential, it is known that members of local authorities have gone to their electoral areas and, for instance, have told the people in that area that a certain road is in a terrible condition and that they are immediately going to the county council about the matter.</P>
    <P>They know perfectly well that work will be starting in five days, because they were so informed.  They come back five days later when the steamroller has arrived on the particular road.  They are hailed as marvellous men because of what they have done. We have all heard stories like that. We know that type of thing only occasionally happened in nearly every county because some official failed in his duty of confidentiality.</P>
    <P>A man cannot be aware of something in his capacity as a clerical officer and not be aware of it in his capacity as a counsellor.  He would not be human, to say the least of it, and probably not very effective if he was not sorely tempted to make use of that private information.  He may be intimidated in acting as freely as he should because of his relationship of master and servant, <i>vis-á-vis</i> the county manager, who is his superior, and his views on him can have considerable bearing on his future career in that or another local authority.</P>
    <P>Because of these reasons I believe there is an unanswerable case that clerical officers should be excluded. We are now asking the Minister to be reasonable in his attitude to this. He must be aware by now that it is the view of the overwhelming majority of the people who have anything to do with or know anything about local authorities that his proposals in the draft proposed order, of which he has given us details, should be changed.  While we could make valid cases about the inclusion or exclusion of various other grades, we are confining ourselves solely to <Col N="1452" /> the glaring case of the proposed inclusion of clerical officers among those entitled to stand for local authority elections.</P>
    <P>I would remind the Minister again that we have not even the problem of having to make an amendment at this late stage.  As the clerical officers will be in or out because of a subsequent order which the Minister will make, if and when the Bill is passed, we do not have the problem we usually have if we propose a change or an amendment on the Fifth Stage.  It would be very easy for him to do what everyone, including the Government parties, knows is the right thing in the circumstances.</P>
    <P>I must be the eighth or ninth successive Fianna Fáil speaker on the Final Stage of this Bill.  Everyone of us feels the same way about the same point and for the same reason. We were all moderate in the way we put our case.  Any arguments used by the Minister on the Committee Stage in relation to the same point, do not answer at all.</P>
    <P>There may be some advantage to the Minister or his party in the short term to persist in this, but I can say with certainty that in the long term the benefits will even themselves out. Therefore there is no political advantage in the long term to anyone.  The Minister should do what everyone who has put his mind to this particular proposal is agreed should be done.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Mr. Molloy Mr. Molloy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>The reason why the Opposition party have so strongly opposed the Minister's proposal was because of his expressed intention of making an order under this Bill allowing a certain category of employee in a local authority to stand for election. That point was made very strongly and in a valid way by several Opposition speakers.  This Bill, as presented, created a certain amount of confusion in the minds of those involved and interested in the forthcoming local elections. The fact that the Minister tonight&mdash;although it was sprung on him &mdash;was not in a position to give an indication of the categories of employees in local authorities and State Departments who would be qualified to stand <Col N="1453" /> is adding to the continued confusion. I appeal to him to be specific tonight, if he gets a chance to reply on this debate, or in the immediate future to issue a statement saying clearly who of all those employed in public service, whether as members of the local authorities, health and harbour boards or civil servants, are entitled to stand as candidates.</P>
      <P>Section 24 of this Bill empowers the Minister to make the order which will allow this category to stand as candidates in an election.  We feel very strongly against the principle involved. Section 24 (1) (b) reads:</P>
      <P>For so long as an order under this subsection is in force, section 21 (1) of the Local Government Act, 1955, shall not apply as regards an office or employment which is of a class, description or grade designated by the order.</P>
      <P>I should like to draw the attention of the House to what is contained in section 21 (1) of the Local Government Act, 1955.  It states:</P>
      <P>No person shall hold any office of profit under or be employed for remuneration by or under any local authority while he is a member of that authority.</P>
      <P>It is quite clear that that section prohibits any employee of a local authority from standing for elections.  The Minister will have power to remove from that section certain categories.</P>
      <P>In his reply will the Minister give some explanation of the effects of section 21 (2) of the 1955 Act?  That subsection states:</P>
      <P>No person shall hold any major office of a local authority while he is a member of any other local authority whose functional area is, or is situate in, the same county or county borough as that of or within which is situate the functional area of such local authority or in any county or county borough adjoining to that county or county borough.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The point raised by Deputy MacSharry creates a certain question mark which needs an answer.  The question posed was whether an employee of the Sligo County Council was qualified to stand for election to <Col N="1454" /> the Sligo Corporation?  Is a clerical officer in the Galway County Council entitled to stand as a candidate at the Galway Corporation elections?  If the category of worker, such as clerical officer, is excluded from the provisions of section 21 (1), do the provisions of section 21 (2) apply to him and in that way affect his position in relation to an adjoining authority?  There is some doubt about that and I would ask the Minister to clarify it.</P>
    <P>All that needs to be said has been said.  I should again like to make a final appeal to the Minister to reconsider his decision and his attitude. This Bill, as Deputy O'Malley pointed out, can be passed if the Minister has a majority to pass it, but if it is passed by this House and, assuming that it is passed by the Seanad and becomes law, the power still lies with the Minister not to make an order qualifying this category we are speaking about, clerical officers, to stand as candidates. It is not specified in the Bill which category will be excluded from the provisions of section 21 (1).  That will be done by an order and the Minister has time to seriously reconsider the stand he has taken so far.</P>
    <P>I am sure he must at this stage be totally convinced that our efforts to draw this matter to his attention and to use whatever powers of persuasion are available to us, and whatever powers are available to us as Members of this House even in Opposition, are genuine.  That is quite obvious from the number of spokesmen who have contributed to this debate from our side of the House on the provisions and powers in the Bill.</P>
    <P>It is notable that, on legislation brought forward by the Minister, there has been the minimal number of contributions from his own side of the House.  Very few speakers, other than the Minister, have made any contribution to the Committee Stage debate.  Certain contributions were made on Second Stage but we had very few contributions from the Government side on this Stage.  The Minister has been left here as a lonely figure by his own party and his own Government.  One could not but come to the conclusion that the Minister <Col N="1455" /> has been left with his own baby.  He may have his own reasons for sticking to his guns on his suggestion in relation to the proposed order, but he is being obstinate and stubborn in refusing to concede that he has made a mistake, as we genuinely believe he has, in suggesting that any category of employees of local authorities should be allowed to become candidates. An opportunity is still available to the Minister to give some indication to the House that he has reconsidered, that he will reconsider, or that he may reconsider his proposed actions if and when this Bill becomes an Act.</P>
    <P>Our final plea to him is to think seriously before he draws up an order and to consider the effect such an order will have on the belief of the community in the worth and the meaning and the authority of local government.  It is a sad blow for democracy that such a step should be proposed.  The elected member has always proved himself to be the great protector of the community against the bureaucratic machine.  To suggest that the bureaucrats should now be entitled to take over the function of the elected member is too dangerous even to consider.  Yet it is being proposed seriously here by the Minister.</P>
    <P>The bureaucrats have given good service.  In referring to them as such, one does not intend to throw any slight on them, or on the work they have been doing.  I have the highest regard for them.  I had special reason to have great respect for all of the staffs working in our local authorities down through the years while I was an elected member, and particularly during the term I spent as Minister for Local Government.  I am in a special position to express great appreciation of their dedication to their work and of the quality of the work which these officials have been doing.</P>
    <P>As I said last Thursday, I had no knowledge of any such request from them during my term as Minister, or as a member of a local authority in the years before that, or even since I became spokesman on local government for my party.  No approach has <Col N="1456" /> been made to me seeking such a concession for any category of employees in local authorities.  This proposal was brought forward out of the blue by the Minister, without any evidence of a demand for it from the persons concerned.  Even if there had been a concerted effort on the part of those concerned to seek this concession, it still would not be justified. It is all the more surprising that it has been done despite the fact that they themselves have not sought it. In this case they might have been expected to have been seeking something like this.  Having a special vested interest in the matter, one could forgive them for thinking along those lines, but the community would not welcome such a move.  There has never been any demand from the community to grant this concession to any category of employees in the local authorities.</P>
    <P>We have said quite clearly that our only objection is to those who work in an administrative capacity, those who work in a daily capacity within the office of the local authorities.  We welcome the move to extend the opportunity to stand as candidates to the manual workers.  In the figures the Minister gave at the outset the manual workers and other categories in the employment of the local authorities, other than the administrative staff, form the bulk of the employees.  We see no great conflict in their interest in working for the council and being members of the local authority, but we see a great conflict and a great danger in members of the administrative staff also being members of the elected council.</P>
    <P>I gave an example last week where the freedom of an individual who was a member of a voluntary organisation was seriously restricted because the organisation of which he was chairman had taken certain steps which, in the eyes of the manager of the local authority, interfered with the rights of the local authority and that employee was, if you like, dressed down to a certain extent and told by his manager that he would have expected more of a member of his staff. The implication was clear and the <Col N="1457" /> employee in question got the message, acted accordingly, and resigned from his position as chairman.</P>
    <P>That was a very minor incident but it is an indication of the conflict of interests.  The manager in this case thought that, because this person was an employee of his, he should not have taken certain steps together with another voluntary organisation which would cause some upset to the local authority.  Imagine the situation where the employee is a member of the council and the conflict that will arise. The mind boggles at the thought of all the thousands of awkward situations that will arise.  This man has to decide where he stands, whether he stands with his employer and gives his loyalty to him, or whether he stands with the people who elected him and gives his loyalty to them. He would want to be some form of a political schizophrenic to operate both of these responsibilities, to work in these two capacities and, at all times, to be fair and just to the people to whom he was responsible.</P>
    <P>The Members from this side who have spoken have vast experience of what is involved.  Deputy Healy referred to the 30 years or more during which he has been a member of local authorities.  Many other Members have long experience of working on those bodies.  All public representatives, particularly Deputies, are in contact on a weekly basis with the different local authorities, so we know what we are talking about.  It must be accepted that we speak with a fair amount of authority.  Deputies from different age groups on this side of the House have spoken against these proposals, and it is strange that from the Minister's side there should have been this great silence.  One can say that there is not 100 per cent support on that side&mdash;&mdash;</P>

I ask him in particular to give us an indication of the changes, if any, that have taken place in relation to the staffs of other authorities&mdash; the health boards, for instance, the Department of Posts and Telegraphs&mdash; and whether any change in the terms of employment has been made in relation to any State employees not covered by this Bill.  I also ask him to clarify the position in regard to the conflict concerning persons employed in one local authority who would be anxious to stand in the area of an adjoining local authority.  There is the position regarding a person in Dublin employed by the Dublin County Council who would be anxious to stand for Dublin County Borough&mdash;Dublin Corporation.  Of course there might not be the same conflict in that respect as, for instance, in the case of Sligo where some of the work of Sligo Corporation is carried out by the Sligo County Council.  We should like some indication of the position of such people.  I will end by making one final appeal to the Minister not to go ahead with this.</P>

I had given valid reasons why the Bill should be passed in order to give those who wanted to stand in the local elections next month, and those nominating, time to know where they stood.  I could not do that until the Bill had gone through.  Deliberately, Deputy Molloy prevented that from happening, though as members of his party will know, there was an arrangement, an agreement, to have the debate concluded by 5 p.m. on Thursday last.</P>

      <P>Deputy MacSharry asked a reasonable question.  I replied to him but perhaps I did not make myself sufficiently clear.  He asked if officers of Sligo County Council could stand for Sligo Borough Council.  The position is that section 21 (2) of the 1955 Act relates only to&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>Deputy Crowley asked why a clerical officer should be designated and not rate collectors. The electorate must be given the widest possible choice.  Deputy Crowley would include rate collectors, and I gave the reasons why I was including clerical officers.  According to some Opposition Deputies, clerical officers are engaged on very high standard work, and according to others they are on the most menial type of duty, all depending on the argument those Deputies were making at the time. According to them, the electorate would not want clerical officers.  They <Col N="1461" /> made the argument that clerical officers would not want to go forward, yet they maintained that councils would be flooded with them in the future.  This is a line of reasoning which I fail to follow.  As a matter of fact, I stopped trying to follow it a long time ago.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FlorenceCrowley" hpid="Mr. Crowley Mr. Crowley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Crowley</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister is saying he could not be the chairman.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>According to some of the speakers over there the clerical officer who, in the first place, did not want to be selected, found himself selected and elected on to the council and then found himself chairman of the council.  In addition to that we had Deputy Brennan.  Deputy Brennan is a fair and reasonable man, like Deputy Crowley, who says what he thinks.  The point he made was that here were clerical officers who would be so good that if somebody came into the office with a form incorrectly filled in, instead of rejecting it, as apparently he thinks would happen in the normal way, perhaps because there was a comma left out somewhere, these clerical officers would fill in the form or show the person where he made the mistake.  The consequence would be that he would get immediate results; the clerical officer would know so much about it, he would be a great county councillor and, for that reason, he should not in any circumstances be elected.  I asked Deputy Brennan did he feel that nobody with any common savvy should be elected to a county council or corporation because that seemed to be the line of argument he was adopting.</P>

    <Speaker pid="FlorenceCrowley" hpid="Mr. Crowley Mr. Crowley">

    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">

      <P>Then Deputy O'Malley came in and I was somewhat surprised by his contribution, he being a lawyer.  He made a point and I would ask your permission to repeat a reply already given when I dealt with this at an earlier stage.  Because of the importance of it, I should like to give it again.  Deputy O'Malley referred <Col N="1462" /> to section 19 (2) of the Bill which provides that a witness may not be excused from answering on the ground that the answer might tend to incriminate him or on grounds of privilege.  This provision simply repeats the provision which was contained in the former law relating to local election petitions.  A similar provision is contained in the law relating to Parliamentary election petitions and the Referendum Act, 1942, and there is also a similar provision in relation to referendum petitions. Therefore, it is not correct to say that we are introducing a new concept into our law when what this section does in fact is to repeat a provision which has always been a feature of the law relating to election petitions.  Nor is it correct to say that it is an old, out-dated provision which has been copied from an enactment passed in the last century.</P>
      <P>As mentioned already, a similar provision is contained in the Referendum Act, 1942&mdash;I am not sure whether 1942 is considered to be an awfully long time ago&mdash;but it is modern in the sense that it was passed in the present century and, in more recent times for example, in our Constitution. It should be noted that the section is a built-in protection against the weaknesses of the situation.  If the court is satisfied that he has answered truly, he will be entitled to receive a certificate from the court and his answer cannot then be admitted as evidence against him in any civil or criminal proceedings.  The only exceptions to this are criminal proceedings for perjury irrespective of the evidence itself.  In other words, if it turns out that he did not in fact answer truly, it should be emphasised that the witness is entitled to this protective certificate as of right. Therefore, he is not in effect being required to incriminate himself.  It is very important that the Bill should contain a provision of this kind in order to assist the court in its task of determining the issue and ascertaining the correct result of the election.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Molloy's point about local <Col N="1463" /> authorities not being important is typical of the attitude the Opposition seem to have towards local elections generally.  In 1961 the Petitions Act was declared unconstitutional and the Fianna Fáil Government did nothing about it good, bad or indifferent.  Now, when I introduce a Bill which proposes to regulate that issue, there is nothing but abuse from the Fianna Fáil benches.</P>
    <P>In addition to that, Deputy Molloy told us tonight how glad he was that certain people were allowed to stand for election except, of course, clerical officers.  What did he do about it during his period in office?  What did Fianna Fáil ever do to make it any wider?  Nothing at all, good, bad or indifferent.  They just stood back and said: &ldquo;What was good enough for my father is good enough for me&rdquo;. That has changed now and there are new people being allowed to stand for election and new people being allowed vote.  If Fianna Fáil do not like it, it is just too bad; they had their opportunity, they did not take it.  They need not start screaming and caterwauling here about it because they did not do what they should have done.</P>

      <P>A staff officer is a different person altogether.  Those of you who have been on county councils will know the difference between a staff officer and a clerical officer; a person who is temporarily promoted automatically loses his seat if he is a member of the council.  He can only hold it while he is a clerical officer and, if he is offered promotion, the onus is on him to accept or reject it.  If he accepts it, he is not entitled to remain as a member of the council.</P>
      <P>Let me point this out to a number of Opposition Deputies who apparently do not know: this is 1974 and no longer have we the employee coming in shaking in his boots before his employer.  Thank God, those days are gone.</P>
