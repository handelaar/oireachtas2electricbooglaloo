      <NameTxt>Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries (Mr. M.P. Murphy)</NameTxt>
      <P>Supplies of milk for the liquid trade should be adequate to meet requirements in the coming winter.</P>
      <P>The high seasonal cost of producing winter milk for that trade has been taken fully into account in the increased price now payable to producers for liquid milk supplied up to the end of next March for sale in the Dublin and Cork areas.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M.P. Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not so aware.  The position is that the price of milk got from producers in the Dublin and Cork areas has been increased by 11p per gallon, or 42.3 per cent, and I think that should take care of the winter period.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Collins</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelPatMurphy" hpid="Mr. M.P. Murphy Mr. M.P. Murphy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M.P. Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>Measures to improve the quality of dairy herds include the comprehensive progeny testing of AI bulls, the milk recording scheme and the importation of high class breeding stock and semen.</P>
      <P>The aim is to encourage the breeding under Irish conditions of the highest quality stock for both milk and beef production.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Gibbons</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Parliamentary Secretary not aware that, because the service of bulls standing in AI stations costs more than the resultant calf produced by that insemination, the use of inferior bulls is increasing at an alarming rate and, as a consequence, the quality of our dairy herd must be suffering?  Has he <Col N="1041" /> any suggestions to make on how to combat this problem?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Gibbons</NameTxt>
      <P>This is not so. There are rumours to the effect that the use of scrub bulls throughout the country is very widespread at present because it is no longer an economic proposition to use insemination or to use good bulls, because the cost of the insemination is greater than the value of the resultant calf?</P>

      <P>The next question, please.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>4.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GerardCollins" hpid="Mr. G. Collins Mr. G. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minster for Agriculture and Fisheries why the projected 10 per cent increase in milk production predicted for 1974 <Col N="1042" /> did not materialise; and if he will state the consequences for the industry.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelPatMurphy" hpid="Mr. M.P. Murphy Mr. M.P. Murphy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M.P. Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>The shortfall in milk production this year, as compared with earlier expectations, was due mainly to adverse weather conditions.</P>
      <P>Our dairy farmers have however acquitted themselves very well in achieving a level of creamery milk supplies which falls little short of the record quantity, 600 million gallons, supplied to creameries last year.  It is already evident that the total supply of milk to creameries this year will be the second highest on record and is likely to be within about 4 per cent of last year's figure.  At the substantially higher prices being paid for milk, this year's receipts by farmers from the sale of milk will create a new record.</P>
      <P>On the manufacturing side of the dairy industry, this year's relatively small decrease in intake of whole milk has been accompanied by a partially offsetting increase in the rate of use of skim milk for manufacturing purposes.  The throughput of the industry is therefore only slightly lower than that of last year.  Prices ruling for dairy products have risen appreciably this year, and it is to be expected that the value of this year's output of dairy products will prove to be well above that of any previous year.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesMGibbons" hpid="Mr. J. Gibbons Mr. J. Gibbons">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Gibbons</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Parliamentary Secretary not aware that many of the bigger dairy complexes are in serious financial trouble at the moment because of the failure in the anticipated rates of growth in milk intake?  Far from there being any growth there was a very sharp drop in milk supplies this season.  The reason is not entirely as the Parliamentary Secretary has stated.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesMGibbons" hpid="Mr. J. Gibbons Mr. J. Gibbons">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Gibbons</NameTxt>
      <P>A formidable contributory reason is the fact that people are getting out of the dairying business because of the uncertainty of the trade and the fall in profitability&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Gibbons</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M.P. Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>As the reply indicated, last year there was a record supply of 600,000 gallons of milk to creameries.  This year it has been down by an estimated 4 per cent.  I am pleased to announce we have an unlimited market for milk products&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M.P. Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>It is likely that the price of milk to creameries will increase by as much as 20 per cent next year.  I was pleased to be present at the launching of the &ldquo;More Milk Campaign&rdquo; by the Bord Bainne co-operative. Dairy farmers can be certain, so far as the foreseeable future is concerned, of a much increased price for milk as well as a guaranteed market.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrendanCrinion" hpid="Mr. Crinion Mr. Crinion">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Crinion</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Parliamentary Secretary not aware that the reason the target has not been reached is due to the fact that an extra 130,000 cows were slaughtered this year as compared with 1973?</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelPatMurphy" hpid="Mr. M.P. Murphy Mr. M.P. Murphy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M.P. Murphy</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries if there was a major cut-back in inseminations in the liquid milk areas last spring; and, if so, its likely effects on the availability of liquid milk this winter.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelPatMurphy" hpid="Mr. M.P. Murphy Mr. M.P. Murphy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M.P. Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>In the Dublin and Cork district milk board areas, inseminations were down by 11 per cent and 15 per cent respectively, in the period January to June as compared with last year.  This decline which applied generally throughout the country is not likely to have any effect on the availability of liquid milk this winter.</P>

    <Speaker pid="LorcanAllen" hpid="Mr. Allen Mr. Allen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Allen</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M.P. Murphy</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="JamesMGibbons" hpid="Mr. J. Gibbons Mr. J. Gibbons">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Gibbons</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelPatMurphy" hpid="Mr. M.P. Murphy Mr. M.P. Murphy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M.P. Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>The answer is self-evident.  It is obvious that the number of cows available for insemination was down by 11 per cent and 15 per cent.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesMGibbons" hpid="Mr. J. Gibbons Mr. J. Gibbons">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Gibbons</NameTxt>
      <P>Is it not evident that there will be a further dramatic and serious drop in milk supplies to the dairy industry next year with a consequential financial loss for these undertakings?  What does the Parliamentary Secretary propose to do about it?</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelPatMurphy" hpid="Mr. M.P. Murphy Mr. M.P. Murphy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M.P. Murphy</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Gibbons</NameTxt>
      <P>The number always increases in October.  Surely the Parliamentary Secretary is aware that this is the season when normally the greatest number of inseminations are made so that cows will calve in April and May.  The number will be down 15 per cent as compared with last year.</P>

    <P>6.</P>
    <Speaker pid="HughGibbons" hpid="Dr. Gibbons Dr. Gibbons">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Gibbons</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries if he will make a statement concerning the decision that Irish skim milk powder must be sold into intervention in future; when this decision was made; the agency that represented Irish interests; the language in which the associated documentation was circulated; whether the proposal was conveyed to him and to his Department some time beforehand; and, if so, his recommendation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelPatMurphy" hpid="Mr. M.P. Murphy Mr. M.P. Murphy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M.P. Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>It is not correct to say that a decision has been made that Irish skim milk powder must be sold into intervention in future.  What happened is that under a regulation of the European Commission, which came into operation on 16th October, 1974, and which expired on 31st of that month, community traders were enabled to purchase for export, on favourable terms, skim milk powder held by intervention agencies.</P>
      <P>Under normal procedure, Commission regulations are considered in draft by the appropriate management committee.  The text of this particular draft regulation, in the French language only, was placed before the Management Committee for Milk Products for their recommendation on 7th October.  No prior notification of the proposal had been given.  The measure was strongly opposed by the Irish representatives on the committee who are officers of my Department but the voting against it was not sufficiently strong to secure its withdrawal. The question of continuing the regulation, with possibly some variation of its terms, is currently under consideration by the Commission. The Deputy may be assured that this country will continue vigorously to oppose any Community measure which militates against the normal private trading in dairy products or which encourages their sale into intervention.</P>

      <P>In order to conserve sugar supplies and to ensure equitable distribution, the Sugar Company introduced a quota system in February last whereby each of the company's customers was allocated a quota for each month equal to the amount purchased by him in the corresponding period in 1973.  The company maintain that there is no real shortage of sugar here and they continue to release sugar on the home market at levels greater than their 1973 sales.  We must have become more sweet-mouthed in recent months because in respect of September of this year, the most recent month for which I have information, there were released 14,738 tons of sugar by the Sugar Company compared with 13,626 in September of 1973.

      <P>Developments of an international, commercial or local nature in respect of which I have no function or cannot exercise any control can affect the supply of nitrogenous fertilisers, I understand however that home production of the main nitrogenous fertiliser&mdash;calcium ammonium nitrate&mdash;is projected to increase by 44 per cent in the 1974-75 season as compared with the 1973-74 season. This increase, coupled with the availability of other straight nitrogenous fertilisers and high nitrogen compounds, should be adequate to meet demands in 1975.</P>

      <P>On a point of order&mdash; I think I am correct in saying, although I am not absolutely sure because there was some confusion, that the Parliamentary Secretary replied to Question No. 15 and it was then discovered that he had skipped some questions.  He went back to them and there were supplementary questions on them and when Deputies endeavoured to ask supplementary questions on Question No. 15 he had gone on to further questions.  In other words, there was not an opportunity to ask supplementaries on Question No. 15. I think that is correct and, if so, I submit that Deputies should be allowed supplementaries.</P>

      <P>There was a meeting with the National Poultry Council on 14th October, 1974.  The Minister stated that the prohibition on imports from Northern Ireland must now be lifted in accordance with international requirements.  In view of the depressed state of the industry <Col N="1069" /> which the poultry council claimed obtained here, they asked for an extension to enable them, in consultation with officers of the Department, to examine EEC, Northern Ireland, and Irish legislation to see whether there was any legal means whereby imports from Northern Ireland might continue to be prohibited.  The Minister agreed to this extension and we await a decision from this committee, which is examining the question of the legislation, whether we can do so legally.  We cannot prevent importation illegally.  We are anxious to keep Northern Ireland fowl out if we can do so legally.</P>

As far as subheads B and D are concerned, relating to travelling expenses, I am not as familiar as perhaps I should be with the details of what is involved here but I understand that what is involved is some increase in travelling expenses consequent on increased costs of travelling under various heads with which we are all familiar.

    <Speaker pid="SeanMoore" hpid="Mr. Moore Mr. Moore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moore</NameTxt>
      <P>Reading the Minister's speech one gets the impression that a lot of work went into it.  Nevertheless, one wonders if in all aspects the work was well directed towards trying to achieve our aims.  I compliment the Minister on his expansionist policy in regard to the creation of more diplomatic missions and offices in various parts of the world.  This is a good policy.  The previous Government always had it as a basic item of policy <Col N="1097" /> to expand as much as possible.  At the same time, we should be more selective and we should establish diplomatic relations with countries with which we have something in common, such as the former victims of colonial abuse.  We should try to have some kind of rapport with the smaller countries rather than the bigger ones.  It may be the &ldquo;in&rdquo; thing to have relations with the USSR but I wonder how well this will serve this country?  Will it mean we will be a more prosperous country or that we can influence Russia towards coming around to a more democratic way of life?  I doubt it very much.  When USSR staffs came in here I felt we were adding further to our present troubles.</P>
      <P>The British are not noted for their lack of cunning in regard to espionage work.  In the circumstances it may be necessary for us to employ more police to watch for possible espionage not against ourselves, perhaps, but against some of our neighbours.  It is a disturbing thought that we should be drawn into the web of international espionage but that is the situation we may be faced with.</P>
      <P>I agree that is may have served a useful purpose to establish a new relationship with the USSR.  It will be of mutual benefit to both countries, but having regard to past activities of that country in the international field, we may well be faced with the task of countering moves by the secret services of other countries.  We may be drawn into this game of international espionage and I would deplore that situation. I am pointing out to the Minister that when he is opening relations with other countries he should be more selective.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I agree with the move to open relations with Middle East countries.  We have a certain affinity with them from the point of view that they, too, were occupied by colonial powers.  It is good also that we should open cultural relations with them.  The Minister has been criticised for going all over Europe and the US but my opinion is that the more contacts we make in this way the better for us.  We cannot be insular. We cannot cotton-wool ourselves against movements and changes taking place abroad and therefore nobody <Col N="1098" /> would question the amount of money we spend on international co-operation and the development of our diplomatic service.</P>
    <P>At this point I should like to express appreciation of our efforts in regard to the Third World.  Our people have never failed to make sacrifices to help those who are less well-off than ourselves. We must remember that two-thirds of the world population are at or below starvation level.  We must therefore express appreciation of the efforts of young and not so young people from this country who have gone out to work in Ethiopia and Bangladesh.  These efforts should inspire the Government to increase our contributions to the Third World.</P>
    <P>That is my contribution in regard to our efforts abroad.  It behoves me, as it does every other Deputy speaking on this Estimate, to devote some time to what is happening in our own country.  Every morning one hears and reads news of people being killed and maimed and surely one must ask one's self in what way we can bring peace to the six north-eastern counties.  It may be true that the British want to leave the North.  I believe they do because if the Northern ports meant something in imperial defence plans, those days are gone.  There may still be the remnants of the colonial forces among the wealthier ruling class in the North who still exploit the people in the Shankill Road and other such areas. I see some glimmer of hope that the men and women in Shankill Road as well as the majority in the North will begin to see through his exploitation.</P>
    <P>Most of us here, when we hear of a man being shot or blown to bits, do not ask what faith he was.  We ask rather why these things happen, with fellow Irish men and women continuing to suffer in the North day in and day out without any let-up.  There are the same harrowing stories day after day and we have to ask ourselves what can the Government do in this part of the country to bring an end to this frightful situation.  It would be unfair to suggest that the Minister is less interested in the situation than I am. I believe he and the whole Government are deeply interested in the <Col N="1099" /> North.  However, as far as policy is concerned it seems to be a matter of what we are not doing.</P>
    <P>Last year I suggested there should be a special Department concentrating solely on the North and on what we can do to help.  I believe that in many a good Protestant heart in the North there is a genuine fear that we want to take over.  Nothing could be further from the truth but we are convinced that, until we have a United Ireland, we will not have a peace.  In the last 300 years there were constant outbreaks of violence followed by periods of peace and then fresh outbreaks of violence.</P>
    <P>Any attempt at patching up would only result in putting off the real solution to the problem for another few years, at the end of which time we would again find ourselves back to square one and violence.  I commend Deputy O'Kennedy's remarks yesterday to the Minister.  He mentioned a possible phasing out with the British offering financial help.  There is a distinction to be drawn between the wealthy few and the bulk of the people who work for their living.  The wealthy few play on the fear of the others, manufacturing bogies which do not exist, with the intention of preventing unity because they believe that, if there was unity, they would lose their power.  They are the élite of the North.</P>
    <P>It should be brought home to the majority they have nothing to fear in being brought into a United Ireland and they should be assured that we are prepared to do all we can to enable them to continue enjoying whatever standard of living they now enjoy.  Of course, the standard of living would not deteriorate in a United Ireland, with the 32 counties working together.  We would share in the expertise of the North and our workers in our much more diversified economy would have something to give to the North.  Working hand in hand, without coercion, we could certainly build a better nation, guaranteeing to each individual in that nation a better standard of living and complete freedom of worship.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1100" /> As far as I can see from the Minister's brief, he did not mention internment. This is a great pity.  This is a subject on which there is tremendous unity.  The majority in the North abhor internment just as much as we do and abhor events like those which occurred last night in the prison there and a few weeks back.  Some women belonging to the majority occupied a building yesterday to protest against internment.</P>
    <P>The time has come when the Government must use all their powers of persuasion on the Government of the United Kingdom to show how foolish that Government are in not ending internment.  Is there anything which will convince the minority or the majority in the North that there is another future for them beyond that of brother fighting brother, an exercise which only brings misery to themselves and to the country as a whole?  The Minister could well canalise all the efforts of the people and those of our fellow-members in the EEC to bring home to them the fact that what is happening in the North is not something peculiar to this island and not something which could not have repercussions outside. The situation is sufficiently serious to engage the attention of the nine nations together in the EEC.  The possibility is that Europe may not be healthy while this festering sore exists in part of our country.  Some of those interned without trial may be completely innocent of any crime.  Most right-thinking people everywhere believe internment without trial is wrong.</P>
    <P>The Government should make an effort to bring home to the British Government that they should end internment.  It is wrong.  It is causing frightful suffering.  The vast majority of the people North and South will back the Government if they are successful in bringing the British Government to their senses and making them realise that the first step towards reconciliation between the people in the North is the ending of internment.</P>
    <P>I realise that the Government may have a difficult task in getting the British Government to see the light, <Col N="1101" /> but this is nothing new.  A tragedy of the history of ourselves and our neighbours across the water is the terrible difficulty in getting them to see the light until it is too late.  Last week the Taoiseach spoke in Oxford on the theme that British efforts towards Ireland have been too little and too late.  As we approach the end of the 20th century, should we not be able to hope for new thinking and a realisation that the relationship between the two countries is different in the 20th century from what it was in the 17th century?</P>
    <P>There is an onus on each of us to say how we think we should work towards total unity.  I suggested last year, and I suggest again, that there are men and women in the North who belong to the majority who feel that they will find their common salvation in uniting the people who have suffered.  In the North they suffered from unemployment and bad housing just as we did down here.  These are the things on which the workers North and South can unite.  These are the things that really matter.  We must build up the economy so that the man in Belfast, Armagh and Portadown, like his counterpart in Galway, Limerick and Dublin, can look forward to peace and prosperity on this island, an island where their children will be able to play as children are meant to play without any fear that, when a child picks up an old tin can, it will be a bomb which will blow him into eternity.  We must realise that the families in Belfast or Portadown or anywhere else feel for their children and for their people just as we feel for ours.</P>
    <P>When one reads in the papers or hears on radio or television of another man being shot and one is told that he was a Protestant, one knows that the next day one will hear of a Catholic being shot.  I suppose in some people's minds they are meant to cancel each other out.  That is not civilisation. People who act in that way are acting out of fear.  I believe that 99 per cent of people everywhere are against violence.  It is repugnant to us to think of a man, or a child, or an old person being shot or blown to <Col N="1102" /> pieces.  There are other forms of violence which are practised by the &ldquo;haves&rdquo; in most countries who want to maintain a system which gives them the best things of life.  They are quite prepared to exploit people who cannot get jobs and housing.  If there are not enough jobs to go around they say that &ldquo;our people&rdquo;, as they call them, will get the jobs.</P>
    <P>Through a great educated publicity drive we should try to get it over to the people in the North that they are being exploited and that we have no intention of trying to coerce them into doing something they do not want to do.  We should point out to them that at the moment they are being coerced by forces using them to satisfy their own ends and using the economic situation to stir up trouble.  They suggest that we have got an ulterior motive in seeking unity.  We can say in all honesty that we seek the prosperity of this nation. This can only be achieved when the nation is united as one country.</P>
    <P>I do not rule out the possibility of the North, because of 300 years of history, being given some recognition for the conditions which have grown up there.  If the majority think back on their history they will realise that their forebears preached to us that Republicanism was a good form of government.  Through the Department, the Government should set out to prove to the majority in the North that we simply seek the prosperity of the country and that we believe this can only be achieved in a united country.  If we were to tear up the Constitution tomorrow this would not impress the majority in the North.  I do not know how many people in the North have read our Constitution. Some very good ideals are expressed in it.  If they read it they would find in it guarantees which they lack at present.</P>
    <P>There is an onus on us to act quickly, not by trying to persecute the people in the North, and not by trying to coerce them, but by trying to show them what we really mean. The Government have been maintaining a low profile on the North, not saying too much in the hope that <Col N="1103" /> things would quieten down.  This is like suggesting that if a person is ill their must be silence in the house. Unless you get a doctor to try to cure the cause of the man's illness, you are wasting your time.</P>
    <P>The Government have a tremendous opportunity to tackle the question of the North.  Up to five years ago what happened in the North did not evoke great interest throughout Europe.  I am convinced it does now. With the media giving such great coverage to the happenings there, and with Europe shrinking because of the expansion in travel, people in Europe realise that the Northern Ireland problem, the whole Irish problem, is something to which they will have to give more attention.  We cannot have a united Europe with the present happenings in the North.  With such a great problem there can be no hope of uniting Europe.  Some people think this problem is only confined to a small portion of the country but it should be remembered that a world war resulted from an incident in Sarajevo.  Then followed the great holocaust of that world war.  I am not suggesting that a world war would follow but I believe that European unity cannot be achieved while this frightful suffering continues in the North.</P>
    <P>If I am to blame the British I blame them for not being sufficiently conscious of the happenings in the North. I often regret the fact that Britain did not produce a figure of the ability of General de Gaulle who handled the Algerian situation admirably.  The British should study his solution to the Algerian crises to see if there is a lesson to be learned from that.</P>

      <P>We must disabuse the Minister for Foreign Affairs on the attitude of the French towards the Algerians.  That may not appear relevant to this debate but the Minister has interrupted me by making this reference.  If he must interrupt, let what he says be the truth.  I do not wish to be as petty as the Minister but I want to make sure that his unreasonable outbursts are on the record. At the beginning of my speech I praised the Minister.  It is easy for one to doubt his ability when one realises that his knowledge of recent European history is so limited.  Perhaps he might take time off from his journeys around the world to study this very recent history.</P>
      <P>One should not use levity, as he has done, when speaking of the suffering in the North.  When I suggested what might be done in order to ease the suffering of the people there, he made a silly remark about Algeria.  He then went further and tried to suggest that the French did something they should not have done. I hope the next time he goes to France he will have brushed up on his history and will know more than he does this evening.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There should be a specialised Department to deal with all aspects of the Northern problem.  Its prime <Col N="1106" /> function would be to set out the problems in the North and show that our aims are for the common good.  It would also emphasise that we realise the people of the North have suffered through unemployment, bad housing and other ills similar to those suffered by some of our people here.  We should unite to remove these common ills.  If we can convince the people of the North that these goals are worth attaining, then half the battle will be over.</P>
    <P>The Minister should do his utmost to ensure that the British end internment in the North.  The majority, as well as the minority want internment ended.  I hope I have made some suggestions which the Minister will consider when dealing with those problems and towards ending the violence which has afflicted the North over the past five years.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sure the findings of the politicians who visited Long Kesh no later than yesterday will be <Col N="1107" /> accepted as fact and that the conditions under which the internees are now existing are also accepted as fact.  The conditions there are unbelievable and nothing approaching or paralleling the treatment of these internees has been experienced in any part of the world since the concentration camps in Germany.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Dr. FitzGerald Dr. FitzGerald">

    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Dr. FitzGerald Dr. FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>No, only about the murder of Irish people.</P>

    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>He does not seem to recall that the IRA were not in existence when the trouble started.  They came into existence in order to defend the people of the Six Counties, and in the minority areas in particular. The Minister and the Government should never forget this.  Nobody else should forget it either.  When they start talking about violence, they give the impression that violence is coming only from the IRA.  We have the sorry spectacle of the UDA&mdash;whose offshoots have claimed responsibility for some of the bombings which killed some of our people on this side of the Border&mdash;being received by some of the Ministers and the Taoiseach while at the same time not only the Government but the Opposition have refused to take part in a weekend debate in Galway.  Their refusal was based on the premise that there would be people there with whom they would not wish to talk.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Do the Government appreciate where they are leading the people?  Do they appreciate the manner in which they are blindfolding the people by the suppression of RTE, radio and television, in order to ensure that we do not know what is going on in the Six Counties?  Yet, we go around the world, as the Minister has done, settling the problems of other lands while our own people are being treated as no other people have been <Col N="1108" /> treated since the last war.  There are sow hutches littered over the Six Counties which are far in advance of what the internees are living and sleeping in at the moment in Long Kesh.  We will probably hear Mr. Rees this evening telling the House of Commons the difficulties he has had trying to replace the burned down concentration camp which was Long Kesh and, because of all sorts of strikes which are holding up supplies of materials, they have been unable to rebuild as fast as they might.  I say now that the sow hutches for which grants are available in the Six Counties&mdash; scattered over the fields of that territory&mdash;are better than the huts in which our people are lying who were never condemned, tried or convicted of any crime.  Likewise, with the people who made their escape last night; they were fired on and one of them shot down like a mad dog.</P>
    <P>I have no doubt that the Minister, from his interjection here which I provoked by asking a very obvious question as to whether this Government had made any protest or intended to do so in regard to that shooting, has exposed to me, and I am sure the House in general, his attitude that if these are IRA people that is good enough for them.  They are not only IRA people now in Long Kesh and their sympathisers who are protesting about the conditions in Long Kesh.  We have the Loyalist people protesting and there was a protest yesterday in the takeover of the BBC building in Belfast.  I am sure the Minister must have been educated and edified to some degree if he saw on TV last night even the little we are allowed to see.  Some of these women said what they thought about the conditions there and the manner in which their Loyalist family friends were being treated in that hell hole that is Long Kesh.</P>
    <P>We have a Government in Dublin not taking the slightest notice of what is going on in this country.  Any condemnation is immediately coloured by the obsession that all of this violence would cease, would never have existed and that there would be peace here for <Col N="1109" /> ever after if only the IRA would stop their violence.  The first thing the Minister for Foreign Affairs must learn is that it is not the IRA who started it and it is not the IRA, by a cessation of their activities, who will end it.  He must come to realise what has been accepted down the ages&mdash;that Ireland divided, Ireland unfree, will never be at peace.  This is something which has been accepted and, unless the Minister and his Government, and apparently those others who have come to believe differently, can show us that that belief has been totally wrong, then there is no reason why their attitude, as a Government, should be as now displayed&mdash;that of crawling on their bellies to the British, of apologising for our existence, of attempting to make peace offers to the Loyalists of the Six Counties by changing our Constitution in a way we think they will like.  Those Loyalists are as they have always been on the wagon&mdash;that there is not an inch, there is no surrender, and there cannot be&mdash;in fairness to them&mdash;while Britain retains her grip on this country and occupies it, as she does.</P>
    <P>The Minister and the Government are doing a great disservice to the prospects of peace in this island by refusing to face up to the reality that while we are divided, while Britain occupies this country, or anybody else occupies it, there will not be any lasting peace, no lasting peace can possibly emerge, no lasting peace can be achieved in any way, no matter how it is connived at, no matter how we may try to sell ourselves out, no matter if we make the offerings to those in the Six Counties in a manner in which we feel would make them like us better. It is like Article 44.  It is like the Contraception Bill in this House.  More recently it has been Articles 2 and 3. These are of no use whatever.  If every Article in our Constitution were changed, if it were scrapped entirely in the morning, it would make no difference.  It will not make any difference so long as Britain continues to guarantee her presence and her support financially and militarily to the Six County majority.</P>
    <P>In my estimation the Taoiseach has no right, he has no mandate to stand <Col N="1110" /> up&mdash;nor has anybody else in this House&mdash;and say that no putting together of this country will take place without the consent of the majority, because clearly the corollary of that is that so long as Britain wishes, and so long as the majority in the Six Counties wishes Britain to stay, then so long must the minority in the Six Counties be committed to the lack of rights and discrimination from which they have suffered for generations past.  When the Taoiseach, or anybody else, says that the majority have the right to decide in the Six Counties, then they are saying that the minority do not have any right and they are immediately on to the very weak ground that any majority in any given area&mdash;in this or in any other country &mdash;have the right to opt out and stay out regardless of the benefit or lack of benefit to the overall people of that entity.  This is, in fact, what the Taoiseach is saying when he talks about the right of the majority and only by their consent.  It sounds very good and it is great to say it across in Oxford. It is great to say it so that the people in Belfast may hear it but it does not make any sense without putting beside it the corollary, which is, that the minority who have suffered down the years are to continue to suffer down the years at the whim of the majority of part of the people in this country.</P>
    <P>You just cannot get away with it and there is no point in trying to move along in this fashion.  Is this bi-partisan policy?  Is this what we hear about or is that a myth that has been exploded by the Leader of the Opposition's criticism of the Government in recent days?  I should like to know from the Government what is this policy, if they have one.  I am at a loss to know what it is.  I am certainly at a loss to know what is the bi-partisan policy when I find the Government and the Leader of the Opposition at odds in a particular way in relation to the Six Counties.  Yet we seem to have this continued belief that there is this bi-partisan policy. We do not know what is the policy. We do not know what it was and we do not know if it exists now judging by recent happenings and speeches.  I <Col N="1111" /> say to the Taoiseach and to the Minister for Foreign Affairs that they have no right, no mandate, to condemn the minority in the Six Counties forever to the degradation and discrimination from which they have suffered since the country was partitioned over 50 years ago.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>Is not that the fact of the matter or does the Minister really appreciate the circumstances up there?  Does he now, by his interjection, indicate that their right, as a Government, and the right of the Taoiseach to speak, as he has spoken, must be paralleled by the question as <Col N="1112" /> to whether the IRA have a right. Whether or not they have a right.  I say that this Government have not the right, never had the right, never had the mandate to sell out and say that the Six Counties will remain in British occupation so long as the majority, who are enjoying the fruits of that union to the disadvantage of the minority, and some of their own majority, so long as that majority agree that it should be so.  Then so long will the minority, and the deprived persons of the majority, be deprived should that be forever.  And it will be forever judging by the antics, activities and the lack of foresight or any clear-sightedness on the part of the Government as to what it is all about.</P>
      <P>No, we can have our people shot down, shot escaping from the hell hole of Long Kesh and we cannot have the semblance of a protest made from this House, from the Government and, particularly, from the Minister for Foreign Affairs.  We just look on with complete equanimity, we regard it as another of these things when the British Army open up and have target practice at fleeing prisoners.  We are conditioning public opinion to accept these things as nothing more than daily regrettable happenings of no great consequence. If some of those who are condoning these happenings by their silence, as the Government are doing at the moment, were asked what they thought of the concentration camps in Germany and the extermination of the Jews they would tax eloquent.  However, these things are happening in our own land, being perpetrated by a Government who have exercised control over the Six Counties since 1922.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Far from protesting, we on this side of the Border through the agency of our Government are assisting the occupation visibly and clearly, day in and day out.  I will give one instance of why I say this.  If one goes across the Donegal border at Lifford from Tyrone or Strabane, one is not checked going into Donegal; however, when one leaves Donegal to return to Strabane a check is made by our own gardaí, not by their wishes nor I am sure the wishes of the commissioner, but on the <Col N="1113" /> instructions of the Minister for Justice at the behest of the Government.</P>
    <P>Will the Minister for Foreign Affairs tell the House why there must be this silly, crazy situation, that our gardaí are used on the frontier post at Lifford to check those going into the Six Counties but are not required to check people who come out of the Six Counties and enter Donegal?  I would point out that only 300 or 400 yards across the Border there is a built-in installation with road blocks, traffic lights, sandbags, barriers and the British Army who check people entering the Six Counties to ensure they are not dangerous.  They do not check people at Strabane because the British Army could not care less if there was one ton or 100 tons of explosives crossing the Border to blow up some place in Donegal.  Apparently the gardaí at Lifford do not have any instructions on this matter.  Their instructions appear to be to make sure that nothing of any danger goes into the Six Counties but it does not matter a damn about what goes into Donegal or any other part of the country.</P>
    <P>If one goes to Aughnacloy one sees the provocative searching and delaying tactics carried out by the British Army for the last year.  Why is it only this route which connects the most isolated county in the Twenty-six Counties that is getting this special treatment?  Why has there been no protest from the Minister for Transport and Power who is responsible for tourism, the Minister for Foreign Affairs or the Taoiseach regarding the maltreatment given to people in this region who must travel to Dublin or any other southern point?  They are subjected to this blackguardly treatment day in and day out.  There is no transport other than public transport but that allegedly express service is now getting a very drastic screening. Last week the passengers were put out on the road in the midst of a downpour and were left there for one and a half hours but there has not been a squeak out of the Government or the Ministers concerned.</P>
    <P>However, the Government are very concerned to give aid to the occupying forces to down those who do not <Col N="1114" /> agree with their occupation and to take every step at their disposal to aid and abet the bully boys of the occupation forces.  The latter are specifically assigned to duty on the two points at Strabane and Aughnacloy in order to make life difficult and to dissuade those of us who are in the habit of travelling on this route not to do so. This is what the two hour delay is all about.  It is not due to the fact that the traffic is so heavy they cannot deal with it.  The point is we have to suffer in silence for anything up to two hours in order to cross from Monaghan to Tyrone on the main route from Dublin to Donegal.  It is necessary to carry out a similar exercise, but not to the same degree, when one is leaving Donegal at Strabane; then one will be checked by the gardaí at Lifford Bridge.</P>
    <P>This is the nonsense that is going on.  This is what the Government are concerned about now rather than exploding into life, telling the British just what they think of them and where they can get off so far as this treatment by their army is concerned. The people being subjected to this treatment are trying to go about their daily business, with no semblance of their being violent people or being associated with violent people.  There is not this kind of approach by the Government.</P>
    <P>The speeches of the Ministers for Foreign Affairs and Posts and Telegraphs, not to mention the Minister for Justice who carried the can in Cork for his little contribution, indicate that it is evident the Government are imbued with the idea that we sell out our aspirations to unity, to abolishing Partition and the occupation of our country.  It is obvious the Government will do anything they can to help the British Government.  We will make offerings of various kinds, will make noises to try to assure the extreme loyalist in the Six Counties that we do not mean him any harm.  We might as well whistle jigs on a tombstone so long as Britain continues to guarantee she will stay in the Six Counties; they need Britain so long as she is prepared to dip into her pocket and to send <Col N="1115" /> in the army to quell the rows that extremist element will have started.</P>
    <P>We have joined this peace brigade, the so-called effort to bring peace to the Six Counties, by giving in to the very people who from the outset by their violence and their exercise of a bluff in the last 60 years have brought about a situation where this Government and the British Government are prepared to concede that the bullying tactics and the discrimination that have been practised must and will continue, aided and abetted by any forces at the disposal of the two Governments. That is what is happening. I can scarcely credit the Government have so blinded themselves to the realities of life that they missed the point, that they are participating in a continuation of all that is worst about Partition and discrimination in the Six Counties.  Their whole outlook and their antics indicate that they are prepared to settle for a continuing of that situation so long as they can prevent any of the trouble crossing the Border into the Twenty-six Counties.</P>
    <P>We hear a great deal about coercion. I am sick and tired listening to those of Church and State who say that we cannot bomb a million Protestants into a united Ireland. Who asked to bomb them into a united Ireland?  The people who pose that question have not the slightest regard for the 500,000 Catholics who, literally, have been bombed into the conditions of the Six Counties and kept there or for the other 500,000 people who are living in the counties adjacent to the Border and who, apart from the discrimination factor, are affected as much by partition as are the Catholics who are inside the Border area.  I would be prepared to agree with the sort of outpouring of goodwill which says that it is not possible to bomb a million Protestants into a united Ireland were it not for the fact that by so saying we are concluding that it is all right to have bombed the other million people into circumstances which keep them in subjection, divided and deprived because of the unnatural division of our country.  That is the other side of the <Col N="1116" /> coin and there is no point in looking at it as if it were a two-headed penny. The Government are prepared to leave in a state of siege the one million people who make up the Catholic population inside the Border and in the adjoining counties.  All of us who live near the Border know the effects of Partition.  Apparently, the Government's attitude is that it is all right to leave the situation as it is because it has been that way for the past 50 years.  The minority in the North are not prepared to remain that way and that is what the trouble is all about. The eruption in 1969 was the result of long suffering.  Time and again there had been eruptions but these had fizzled out.  However, the trouble is not fizzling out on this occasion and even if supressed will re-emerge in a very short time with much greater and much more severe consequences than we have witnessed up to now.</P>
    <P>Let us realise what is the situation. Let us consider what the children who are now 10 or 11 years old have gone through in the past five years. We must realise how they have become hardened during that time and, then, remember that we, as a Government, are prepared to condone a continuance of the circumstances that brought about the troubles that have been experienced since 1969.  It should be clear that we are sitting on a massive powder keg in so far as the future in the Six Counties is concerned. It will explode as it has never exploded before unless our Government can get the ear of the British Government who, no doubt, have their ears wide open but are hearing nothing from here by way of advising them that, down through the years, having tried so many different ways of dealing with the problem of the North, they try the one and only way which, ultimately, can bring about the beginning of the end of the violence, ultimate peace and eventual unity.  That is, that they get to hell out of this country.  They must be told that but it is my opinion that for some time past they have been flabbergasted in so far as our Government are concerned, a Government whose role traditionally would have <Col N="1117" /> been to demand Britain's withdrawal. Any semblance of a suggestion that the British might withdraw gets from Dublin the first whimpering as to why they should not go.</P>
    <P>I agree that the problem is a horrible one for any Minister or any Government but I suggest that what the Government are doing and what they are failing to do is adding to the dangers that exist in the North, that it will add to the possibility of the trouble escalating in the future and acquiescing in the occupation of our country is not the answer.  The answer must come ultimately from Britain but we are being far from helpful in bringing her to the conclusion that she must go.</P>
    <P>We have, too, the low profile attitude of the Minister for Foreign Affairs.  What is meant by that?  To me and to those who know a little more about what goes on in the North and, perhaps, who hear a little more because, obviously, our sources of information are not the sources that are available to the Government, the low profile attitude really means that you keep from the people of the South in so far as possible all information in regard to the dreadful happenings in the Six Counties and that if, occasionally, as may happen, some brave or some stupid spirit, may move our media to leak a little information as to what is happening, that spirit is rapped.</P>
    <P>We witnessed this in relation to the &ldquo;7 Days&rdquo; programme televised a short while ago and in which an effort was made to give our people a little of the background to what is happening in the North and to let them see how the mothers, wives and children of those interned in Long Kesh are being affected.  On the morning after that programme was shown there was commanded a reshowing for the benefit of the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs who saw fit to order a special inquiry into the showing of the programme which resulted, I understand, in people being fired for their temerity in endeavouring to show a little of what is going on in the North.  I would not mind if the goings on up there were none of our <Col N="1118" /> business.  They are very much our concern and we should not depend on what is handed out from the army propaganda machine in Lisburn but should be made aware through our own media of what is happening. Surely the least we might expect to see are programmes that would balance what is issued from the propaganda machine in Lisburn, an office that is working overtime on behalf of the British Army and the British commander of the forces in the North.  Apparently, however, such a balance is not on and anybody who attempts to unfold as much as the slightest bit of information is knocked on the head as a warning to others not to attempt anything of the kind in future.</P>
    <P>At the same time, we have the liberal minded Minister for Posts and Telegraphs continuing to pursue his ambition of another channel so that we might be better informed as to how our neighbours live across the water and elsewhere.  He is negotiating with the BBC to link up one of their channels with ours.  I wonder whether, two days after the &ldquo;7 Days&rdquo; programme was shown, the Minister who, in the meantime, had ordered an inquiry to be carried out, saw an Ulster Television programme on internment.  If he did I imagine that he must have felt very badly because the subject on that occasion had been probed much more deeply than was the case of the &ldquo;7 Days&rdquo; programme.  This programme was shown on the BBC, on the channel with which our good liberal minded Minister is attempting to link us.</P>
    <P>How can the Minister for Foreign Affairs deal with the problem of having a Minister for Posts and Telegraphs who raps the home station for showing anything concerning internment or any other happenings in the Six Counties but at the same time proceeds to make a deal with the BBC regarding a linking up of channels?  If that deal is completed, it will be irrevocable and the Minister will be in an awful fix since he will not be able to censor what is shown by the BBC.  If he is in any way consistent, he must declare either that he was wrong for having knocked RTE <Col N="1119" /> or that he is totally wrong in being so liberal as to link us up with the BBC the only people in the TV world now who are showing us anything.  We know what we get from the BBC.  When they are concerned themselves they will not show us in the best light; they will not show themselves in a bad light but nevertheless it is regrettable to say that we get more on their screens of an insight into what is going on in the Six Counties than we get from our own television service.  That is not through any lack or wish on the part of those working in RTE but as a direct result of the direction, suppression and censorship that has been imposed severely on this organisation by the present Minister&mdash;there is no point in blaming him alone&mdash;with the complete agreement of the entire Government. While we may castigate the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs, who is responsible in a direct way, all of the Government undoubtedly agreed to this suppression of what is happening in the Six Counties.  They agreed to it and no doubt have given him the OK to go ahead and &ldquo;wallop&rdquo; away in his own way.</P>
    <P>Another matter I would particularly like to emphasise is that I sincerely hope the Government will not proceed blindly and stupidly with their often talked about common law enforcement area.  This would be the greatest sellout of all time for the reason that if there is to be a common law enforcement area we could only consider such an eventuality if such were to be proposed between two equal partners so far as the enforcement of that law is concerned.  We could not touch the Six Counties on such a basis while their law courts and their method of handing out justice is so blatantly unjust and unfair, as has been displayed over the years.</P>
    <P>Surely the Government cannot contemplate a common law enforcement area wherein, by whatever device may be used, people are tried by the courts of the Six Counties and expect to get justice particularly in so far as offences connected with political outlook are concerned, when we know justice is not to be had there.  This <Col N="1120" /> has been commonly accepted and yet we still hear rumblings that the common law enforcement area is something that should be proceeded with. I ask the Government not to do this, not to agree to it.  People cannot expect a fair trial from the courts of alleged justice in the Six Counties. This will not happen while we still have occupation and all that goes with it.  I hope the Government will keep that in mind and not let themselves run away with the idea of wiping Articles out of the Constitution, or setting up new types of machinery to deal with cross-Border offences and so forth.  They should not run away with this idea of common law enforcement, with courts trying people in the Six Counties for crimes committed there, or people from down here; they should not expect that this could work or that justice would be done.  The Government must realise that justice would not be done and that any such common law enforcement area would be another pandering to the extremists who have suppressed the minority, degraded them and discriminated against them down the years.</P>
    <P>I would like to ask the Minister and the Government why they did not come to Galway to meet these people who are of no different ilk to some of those the Ministers and the Taoiseach met?  Why were the &ldquo;7 Days&rdquo; team and the &ldquo;Féach&rdquo; programme team warned off at the last moment and told to drop all their arrangements?</P>

      <P>The Minister should not be so touchy about this matter.  If it has turned into a debate on the Six Counties&mdash;it is a contradiction, of course, because I do not regard the Six Counties as a foreign country; I never have and never will&mdash;the circumstances of the time are such that it is the one platform in this House available to anybody who is concerned about the matter to discuss it.  There is no more opportune or appropriate time to discuss it than today, the day on which some of our people were shot down by the British Army.  They were no doubt shot in the back as happened before.  There is not even a whimper from the Government by way of protest as to what was the cause of this; no question asked why conditions in Long Kesh are as they are, or if they are to continue as they are when even pigs in the Six Counties have better housing than the prisoners in Long Kesh or in some parts of Magilligan Camp.  According to the <Col N="1122" /> most recent information I got today, the priest who went to give the Last Rites to the man who was dead before the priest got there, saw eight or ten men stretched against the wire who obviously were badly bleeding and had been beaten sick.  We do not mind about that.  They are behind the wire in Long Kesh and the British Army are taking care of them so they are out of our hair.  So long as they are kept inside the wire up there they are not likely to bother us down here.</P>
      <P>This is something we should be concerned about.  Our Minister for Foreign Affairs should be knocking at Mr. Rees's door and should be talking with the people in Westminster, telling them we cannot stomach this any longer, that we are not prepared to go on collaborating and helping the occupation of the Six Counties that is producing this sort of violence in our midst to our own people.  He should also be talking about an ex-Member of this House. What has the Minister done in regard to the incarceration in Long Kesh concentration camp of an ex-Member of this House, John Joe McGirl?  Has he any information on him?  Is it not a scandal that a man who is obviously regarded as quite clean by the authorities here goes across the Border for a peaceful meeting at which he is to speak, that he is picked up, that nothing in his speech could be regarded as a case against him, that no case was made against him and that since then he has been flung into Long Kesh like other interness?  Surely the Minister must draw the line somewhere as to the extent to which he can ignore such happenings?  Surely this is a typical case in point, an ex-Member of the House crosses the Border&mdash;&mdash;</P>

The Minister may not sit there smilingly washing his hands in public and proclaiming himself as having never interned anybody.  Of course, people are being interned here at the moment just as truly as they are being interned in Long Kesh. The Minister is merely being childish or facetious in this public washing of hands, saying that he never did any such thing.  He is doing it at the moment.

      <P>I shall not broaden my contribution to include anything but what is our immediate concern.  I do that deliberately to focus, to the best of my ability, the eyes of this House and I hope the eyes of the public on the sorry and sad plight of our Six Counties and the abysmal performance of our Government in the face of the troubles and difficulties there.  Through this House I would ask the public not to be deterred or persuaded by any glib talk of the Minister's no matter how ably he may put it across and not to believe that we can continue to turn <Col N="1126" /> our back on the Six Counties, ignore them and try to believe that they do not exist, that their troubles are not our troubles, that the people there are not our people, that they are far removed from us, that we can devote our time and energy to looking after the downtrodden, the depressed and the hungry in the other corners of the earth but under no circumstances do we look to see what is going on up there.</P>
      <P>I hope the public are beginning to shed the scales from their eyes and wake up to the fact that the Government will not do anything other than what they have been doing which is not seeing or hearing what is going on there.  The public will have to try to find their own means of helping to change the situation by bringing pressure on their representatives in the Government&mdash;or out of it&mdash;to impress on them that the public are not being properly represented in that they are concerned about that part of our country and its people.  We can at least hope that this is something that will emerge and that the horrible happenings of this morning and the horrible situation that is Long Kesh concentration camp will get through to our people and that they, who have always been generous in helping lame ducks of whatever origin, will clear their minds of the propaganda pumped into them in recent years about not concerning themselves with the Six Counties, that it is a bad thing, something remote from us and that our one concern is to ensure that none of it overspills to this side of the Border and that so long as that happens we should be quite happy and have achieved something.  While the Border is the cause of the trouble, there can really be no Border inasmuch as these people are Irish.  They are our people and our responsibility.  Therefore, we should not ignore the situation and any Government that would lead the people into the belief that it can be ignored are building up a hell of a kick-back for themselves in the not too distant future.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Are we to take it that the Government will awake from their slumbers by virtue of the bloody murder of this young man this morning, by virtue of <Col N="1127" /> the shock it must be to them, having forgotten the massacre on Bloody Sunday in Derry?  We must be conscious of the facts now emerging from Long Kesh, of the brutality that has been used on other prisoners today, left hanging on a wire, as it were, beaten half to death and bleeding, while we do nothing.</P>
    <P>What a marvellous job the Government have done in averting the people's minds from happenings in the Six Counties?  The people have been largely brainwashed into the belief: &ldquo;All right.  It is happening, but it is not on our doorstep.&rdquo;  We do not associate the happenings in Belfast with happenings in our land. This turning away of people's minds from the North is a cruel thing and must be undone.  If the Government are not prepared to do it, the happenings of today will do it and undoubtedly will also undo the Government. They cannot ignore the long-held belief that Ireland unfree will never be at peace.  By their policy of ignoring the Six Counties, with the idea that it is all right as long as the trouble does not overspill into the Twenty-Six Counties, the Government are perpetuating the festering sore that is the Six Counties, the dividing of our people.  Until they get wise to the idea that this is a wrong role they are playing, then I humbly put it to the Government that there cannot possibly be any hope of a change in the circumstances of the Six Counties.</P>
    <P>Until the Government get a change of mind and go after the British to do what they must do eventually, to declare their intention to go in advance of their actual going, there is no hope of our beginning to discuss our future North and South both as a people and as a country, whereby we can look forward to some peace and, I would say, eventual unity. There is no prospect for peace on this island unless the Government tell Westminster where they belong, back in their own country, with their Army, that this is our country and our people.  Then we can begin solving the problem after they have <Col N="1128" /> decided they are going.  This is absolutely essential and no headway can be made while they remain in Ireland.</P>

      <P>When the last speaker started I expected that he would produce something constructive in the matter of Foreign Affairs.  I have rarely listened to a more depressing speech, a speech with such lack of hope, a speech which does nothing to deal with the frightful difficulties concerning the North.  I do not like to be personal, but were I to summarise his speech I would say it was rather like &ldquo;Little Jack Horner&rdquo;. This has become almost a monthly occurrence in this House, and instead of negative speeches in matters about the North one would hope for a little bit more positive thinking.  Deputy Blaney has persisted in his line and has given nothing new to the House. If I were a complete stranger, not having heard Deputy Blaney another time, I would believe he came into this House to advocate violence, though in his last few sentences he somewhat redeemed himself.</P>
      <P>On the same issue&mdash;and I want to depart from it as soon as possible&mdash; a statement was made, I believe, by the spokesman for the Opposition to the effect that England wants to get out of the North.  I am speaking personally on this matter and I must say that in any meetings I have had with British politicians&mdash;and they have been informal&mdash;I never got that impression.  Indeed, I got the impression that there is no difference between the Conservative Party and the Labour Party in England in their wish to stay on and keep the North as part of the United Kingdom.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dowling</NameTxt>
      <P>I move:</P>
      <P>That Dáil Éireann deplores the failure of the Government to produce coherent policies to combat the problem of rapidly rising unemployment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This is a motion that was tabled after considerable thought.  The <Col N="1129" /> workers are now involved in a tragic situation.  We have examined the situation.  We believe the Government are not aware of the actual situation that exists.  On 23rd October, 1974, the Parliamentary Secretary to the Taoiseach said, in reply to me, and I quote from the Official Report, column 17, volume 275, for that date:</P>
    <P>The number of persons on the live register on 4th October, 1974, was 71,412 and the number on 5th October, 1973, was 60,910.</P>
    <P>I asked :</P>
    <P>Could the Parliamentary Secretary indicate if redundant persons are included and if professional unemployed people are included?</P>
    <P>The Parliamentary Secretary replied:</P>
    <P>The only information I have got is of the kind which has been circulated to Deputies and which the Deputy would have received in the post.  I will inquire into the further point put by the Deputy if he wants to pursue it.</P>
    <P>Later on I said:</P>
    <P>In view of the Parliamentary Secretary's statement that he will look into the matters raised, would he agree that the figures given do not give the entire situation in regard to the unemployment situation throughout the country?</P>
    <P>He replied :</P>
    <P>Naturally information about a phenomenon like unemployment contained in a single foolscap sheet will not cover every element.  That is obvious.</P>
    <P>It was quite clear that the information which has been circulated to Deputies is not comprehensive and does not give a clear picture.  If the Parliamentary Secretary to the Taoiseach had no indication of the actual position in relation to unemployment then it would be very difficult for other members of the Government to have this type of information.  The Parliamentary Secretary really did not know <Col N="1130" /> how many people were unemployed. When one examines the situation and sees the vast number unemployed at present one wonders whether this is what the Labour Party meant by socialism in the seventies or the new republic or have we still got the old Fine Gael outlook that it is not the duty of the Government to find employment for the people.  Have the Labour Party accepted this?</P>
    <P>We have examined the situation in depth following the Parliamentary Secretary's reply.  On 29th October the quarterly economic survey of the Economic and Social Research Institute indicated that the level of unemployment stood at 79,596.  The ESRI point out that this is the highest ever since the war.  Their report also forecasts that the number of unemployed will he in the region of 90,000 by January or February next.  Another expert put the figure at far higher than 90,000.  However, the Central Statistics Office on 25th October gave the figure on the live register as 73,477.  This was the only information the Parliamentary Secretary to the Taoiseach had on that occasion.  Other groups carrying out surveys have different figures, far higher figures.</P>
    <P>That is not the whole story.  We have examined the situation here as against the situation outside.  Ministers have spoken at great length about outside factors.  The number of people unemployed in Northern Ireland on 14th October was 30,880, some 4,694 less than the previous month.  The number of unemployed in Britain, according to figures published by the Department of Employment there, was 643,442, a decrease of 39,233 as compared with September.  Those are the trends in Britain and Northern Ireland, our closest neighbours.  They have downward trends while the upward trend continues here.</P>
    <P>There is a difficulty, of course, in comparing the present figures with those when Fianna Fáil left office because of the number of changes that have taken place, particularly the reduction in the retirement age from 70 to 68.  If that is taken into consideration there are a further 25,000 people who would appear on the live <Col N="1131" /> register as unemployed.  If we take that 25,000 and the figure of 79,596 given by the very responsible Economic and Social Research Institute, the figure is 104,596.  That figure is bad enough but taken with the other factors such as short-time working and redundancy it indicates clearly the terrible position at the moment.  It is about time the Government made a comprehensive examination of the unemployment figures and produced some policies to meet this terrible crisis.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach and other members of the Government being questioned in Dáil Éireann up to a couple of weeks ago indicated that there was no real problem.  Then the Taoiseach decided to bring together the captains of industry and the trade unions to discuss the terrible tragedy he found on his doorstep overnight.  This is a situation that has developed not overnight but over many months and possibly over a year or more.  The Government took no action and tried to indicate there was no problem.  We now find ourselves with over 100,000 people unemployed.  I would say the figure is far higher than that indicated when one takes into consideration the number of people who have lost their jobs and who have emigrated and do not appear on the live register.  There are the school-leavers seeking employment for the first time, adult students, professional people who do not appear on the live register.  There are the redundant persons who need retraining; the lumpers in the building trade who do not appear on the live register; the self-employed people who have lost their employment, the semi-professional and other groups.  These people do not appear on the live register and therefore the position is graver than was indicated by the Parliamentary Secretary.  If people are laid off for only one day a week they do not appear on the live register.  If they are out for two days possibly they do appear.  This is a further reduction in the earning power of the workers. There is a very real problem on our doorstep and so far we have had no indication that the position may improve except an indication from the Minister for Industry and Commerce <Col N="1132" /> in the House recently that this situation will probably be with us for 18 months or so&mdash;that we will have a developing situation during the next 18 months.</P>
    <P>We have a tragic situation, one the public would like to know the extent of, and it is only by examining it in depth and finding its real extent that we will be enabled to take measures to combat it.  Many workers throughout industry have been laid off but the number of casual workers who are laid off do not appear on the live register.</P>
    <P>The Government have no policy whatsoever to solve this problem. Indeed, I believe it was deliberately created by the Government in order to get over other problems.  Mr. Killeen of the IDA estimated that 15,000 jobs would be lost this year. We can add them to the 100,000 already unemployed.  Then, there have been 15,000 redundancies.  That is the extent of the problem and with short time and other devices there is no hope for the workers in the foreseeable future.</P>
    <P>If experts who have examined the situation are correct, and there has been no suggestion that their figures are erroneous, the pay-packets of many people now employed are at risk.  Broken time is now becoming a widespread device used by employers. There is also short time. What the Government should be talking about and taking action on is fulltime employment for all our people.  These devices of short time and broken time used by unscrupulous employers should be acted on by trade unions to protect the workers. It is being blindly accepted that workers have to be laid off.  I am sure that many employers have work but that they choose these devices to hide the real situation.</P>
    <P>In this tragic situation, the newspapers give us more information than the Parliamentary Secretary or the Taoiseach.  The <i>Cork Examiner</i> described the situation as the worst since the 1950s and the main victims are the wage earners.  Hunger marches and dole queues are no solution. People must be put back to work so that their families will be provided with the necessities of life.  The <Col N="1133" /> Central Statistics Office figures do not give us a true picture of the problem.  When the factual position becomes clear, when the smoke-screens have been blown away, when we have had an in-depth assessment of the situation, effective counter measures must be taken.  A wishbone is no substitute for backbone and it takes backbone on the part of a Government to ensure that people are put back to work.</P>
    <P>It is only three weeks since the Taoiseach discovered that a crisis existed.  That is the extent to which he is removed from reality, from the glaring fact that 100,000 people are unemployed, that an emergency situation exists.  Is it still the old Fine Gael policy that it is not the duty of the Government to provide work for the people, and have the Labour Party now accepted that approach?</P>
    <P>
      <i>Review of 1973 and the Outlook for 1974</i> gives just two lines to this. We find paragraph 16 on page 60 :</P>
    <P>Employment is estimated to show a slight net increase over 1973, the main increases occurring in Chemicals and Food.</P>
    <P>This is an indication of the type of in-depth study being done, the type of consideration being given to the employment factor.</P>
    <P>Another matter on which one might seek clarification is as to whether the Government are sacrificing jobs for the sake of monetary stability.  Some Ministers make this point.  Others repudiate it.  One would like to know clearly what the policy of the Government is and how they intend to deal with the problem.</P>

      <P>We have the Minister for Labour and others saying that Fianna Fáil speakers have not offered any solution to the problem.  Finding solutions to problems is the Government's job.  The Government were elected for that purpose.  The Government had all sorts of solutions to all manner of problems prior to the <Col N="1134" /> election.  Now we are told Fianna Fáil should provide the solutions.  It is not the duty of an Opposition to provide solutions.  That is the duty of the Government.  I would like to quote Deputy O'Leary speaking here on 29th October.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JosephDowling" hpid="Mr. Dowling Mr. Dowling">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dowling</NameTxt>
      <P>Fair enough.  The Minister for Labour speaking on the confidence motion on 29th October at col. 370 of vol. 275 of the Official Report had this to say :</P>
      <P>There are, therefore, great factors outside our control, great issues over which we have no influence, whatever the Opposition might think, and there are factors within our control.</P>
      <P>Of course, we knew that all along.</P>
      <P>It is the job of the Government to distinguish between both these circumstances and to try to advise, lead and legislate our way out of the present difficulties by the direction of our economic policy to maintain this home demand that is so important.  It is ludicrous for a Government to play the role of a kind of Mighty Mouse with the implication that we can remain unaffected by these outside events.</P>
      <P>A kind of Mighty Mouse! If the Government would stop playing Mickey Mouse we might get some indication as to what they are prepared to do and we might be able to get down to business.  The Minister for Labour admits there are outside factors and he implies that members of the Opposition may not think these factors are contributing in some way to the problems with which we are faced.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On 30th October I asked the Taoiseach the total number of man-days lost through industrial disputes in the 12 months ended 4th October, 1974, and for the corresponding period in <Col N="1135" /> previous years.  The reply I got from the Parliamentary Secretary to the Taoiseach was :</P>
    <P>The latest available data are those in respect of the period to August, 1974.  The number of man-days lost due to industrial disputes in the 12 months ended August, 1974, is provisionally estimated at 563,000.  The number of man-days lost in the corresponding earlier periods are: 12 months ended August, 1972, 158,000...</P>
    <P>Just think of it&mdash;563,000 man-days lost.  I believe the Government are quite happy with this figure and they would be even happier if the figure were doubled because these people would not be reflected in the live register and there would not, therefore, appear to be so many people unemployed.  This is a dreadful situation. Of course, if these people had been working, the fact is a great many of them would be laid off.  In every Estimate during this period we were constantly told the Government would deal with industrial problems and industrial strife; they had ready solutions. I accuse the Government of sitting back and allowing a situation to develop so that there would be this development resulting in man-days being lost.  This is the tragic situation with which we are faced, in addition to short-time, redundancies and 100,000 unemployed.</P>
    <P>The situation in the building industry is a clear indication of the trend of thought on the part of the Government. We are told by the Minister for Local Government that there are no problems and no unemployment in the building industry.  But the building workers signing on at the labour exchange know full well there is unemployment. If one reads the daily papers, one is aware of the numbers being laid off in the builders providers, in the sand and gravel suppliers, in the timber mills and in the industries producing accessories for housing.  We were all aware that the building industry is a generating force in the employment field because there are so many subsidiaries of one kind or another.  All these are, of course, <Col N="1136" /> affected by any lay-off in the construction industry.  It is vitally important that the industry should be developed once more into its former viable position to ensure it once again becomes the generating force it always was.  The unemployment figures are once again identical with those on a previous unhappy occasion.  We wonder what will be next.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Local Government has indicated on so many occasions that there is full employment in the building industry that he has convinced himself that this is the situation.  The building crisis had been gaining momentum for quite a considerable time.  We were told about the targets they hoped to reach, but the momentum has been gathering force for a considerable period and the repercussions are now being felt right through the industry down to the very smallest builder.</P>
    <P>The Government took action in relation to building society mortgages but the action was too little and too late.  We have now reached a point at which, even if an abundance of finance were available, those who might avail of such finance for the purpose of purchasing houses are so uncertain of their future, with inflation running at 18 per cent, that they would not take up this finance.  This situation has been created by the Minister for Local Government himself and by the Government as a whole and its purpose is to ensure we have unemployment.  This is a very serious situation.</P>
    <P>I accuse the Minister for Local Government of sabotaging the building industry.  I do not know why he was so critical of certain sections of the building industry when he was in Opposition and of certain individuals in the industry.  I believe the Minister is now sending these individuals to the wall.  I believe that is a positive policy in order to try to strangle some of the people in the construction industry.  One has only to read the newspapers to find out the desperate situation that is now upon us.  Perhaps the Minister for Local Government is aware that some crises, exists, but he will not admit it.  I hope <Col N="1137" /> the Minister for Industry and Commerce, who probably has a greater grasp of the unemployment situation than the Minister for Local Government, is convinced that there is a real crisis, that there are problems and that people are becoming unemployed. In the <i>Evening Press</i> of October 29th there is a report of a receiver being appointed in the case of one building contractor with a loss of 700 jobs. That was only a few days ago.  This is only one of the many cases where receivers are in, and people are becoming redundant.  It is reported in <i>Liberty</i> that the delegates of one trade union, dealing with the Labour Party document &ldquo;Protecting the Future&rdquo;&mdash;whose future are they protecting&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>
        <i>Liberty</i>&mdash;&ldquo;the journal of the Irish Transport and General Workers' Union, Liberty Hall, Dublin&rdquo;, Volume 29, November, 1974.  I quite sympathise with the trade union officials who are trying to protect their workers because the Government have no real interest in the workers, as we have learned from their various contributions from time to time.  This shows that there are people who are concerned for the workers.  I share their view that there is real concern.  Whose future is this document protecting?  Certainly not the future of Irish workers.  It is stated :</P>
      <P>It would have been better if the document &ldquo;Protecting the Future&rdquo; had been turned down by the delegates to the Labour Party Conference in Galway.  This was the considered opinion of the ITGWU contingent.  The draft economic policy document hurriedly put together by the Administrative Council has too many gaps in it to recommend it to trade unionists.</P>
      <P>The trade unions are not satisfied that &ldquo;Protecting the Future&rdquo; is comprehensive enough.  There are people in the Government who are producing documents protecting their own future and not the future of the workers. The quotation goes on:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1138" /> ...with a Government White Paper on the Economy coming up in a few weeks' time it was poor tactics to have such a weak document as pretentiously presented by the platform.</P>
    <P>How can the Labour Party ministerial team now persuade the Taoiseach and his Fine Gael colleagues that they have an upsurge of opinion behind them insisting on medical policies for economic and social reform?</P>
    <P>We see the balance.  This is a weak document which is not accepted by the workers and will not be presented to the workers.  It will take more than a White Paper or a green £ to cure our economic ills.</P>
    <P>The workers enjoyed very high standards under Fianna Fáil and they are now finding it difficult to adjust themselves to lower living standards.  We always hoped that there would be an improvement in living standards and that we would have full employment. Spokesmen on this side of the House have indicated continuously where they disagree with the Government. They have shown the vital weaknesses in the policies of the Coalition Government in relation to the advancement of job opportunities.  We realise that Fianna Fáil will be called upon to do the same type of clearing up operation in the future as we had to do in the past after two previous Coalition Government terms of office. I do not think it will be too long until we are called upon to do that.</P>
    <P>Apart from the redundancies, the short time, the unemployment, with the small pay packets available now we have the question of prices and promises.  We all know the sad story of the solemn promises made prior to the last general election.  They said that not only would they stabilise prices but they would reduce them. The Minister for Industry and Commerce thought that if he once got into office he had the solution to all the problems and all the ills, and that with one stroke of the pen he and his socialist colleagues could solve them. If this is what is meant by socialism in the seventies I do not think they will have many supporters in the <Col N="1139" /> future.  There has been a reduction in the purchasing power of Irish workers and a rise in prices.  This is the terrible situation facing the wives and children of workers in the coming year.  I am sure the question of prices will be dealt with effectively during the course of this debate.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanTreacy" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Seán Treacy">

    <Speaker pid="JosephDowling" hpid="Mr. Dowling Mr. Dowling">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dowling</NameTxt>
      <P>When people become unemployed they have no purchasing power.  A pronouncement was made recently that 24 per cent of our people are living in poverty.  The indications are that this figure will be far higher before the Government leave office. If it is 24 per cent now, what will it be in a year's time or in 18 months' time which the Minister for Industry and Commerce indicated it will take before there will be any real change?</P>
      <P>Fianna Fáil had positive policies in relation to employment.  We had the setting up of the Department of Labour, AnCO, the National Manpower Service, the various reports on employment, and the various surveys. We kept abreast of an ever-changing situation and positive changes were made to meet positive needs.  There can be no set policy because of the ever-changing problems outside the nation.  These are real problems which must be dealt with effectively.  It is not our job to propose solutions to the problem.  Until the extent of the problem can be identified in positive terms no real solution can be found.  The Government have no positive policy &mdash;they have no policy whatsoever&mdash;to bring people back to their jobs.  This is what it is all about.  People must be brought back to employment so that they can have the necessaries of life and live in reasonable comfort.</P>
      <P>Who is next?  That is the question which is posed.  Trade union officials say that in every industry every day they are confronted with the same question.  The worker does not know whether he is next, whether his employment will be terminated, whether he will become redundant or be put on short-time.  Devices are being used to eliminate him at the moment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1140" /> I agree with the Minister for Labour on his call for people to buy Irish.  I fully support a call to the nation to buy Irish commodities so that we can have an upsurge in the demand for Irish products.  Irish workers, many of whom are unemployed at the moment, are as effective and efficient as the workers in any other country.  I hope that this matter will be pursued and that a message from this House will go out loud and clear to the consumers to purchase as many Irish goods as possible.</P>
    <P>Some study group should be set up to investigate redundancies.  An in-depth study is now required.  It is not good enough to accept that redundancies must occur in our traditional industries. Many could be averted but the blind acceptance that traditional industries must produce redundancies is not acceptable to me.  We have seen in many concerns where Irish workers came together after it was indicated that the concern was not viable and they were able to carry on effectively and efficiently.  There may be problems with managements and defective management is one of the curses of our industry.</P>
    <P>The House should have no hesitation in accepting this motion deploring the failure of the Government to produce a coherent policy to combat the problems of rapidly rising unemployment. No policy has been produced and we hope that the people who claim to be realists in this House, on both sides, will see this motion as one that should be supported.  Otherwise, it is like the Minister for Local Government indicating that there is no problem and that everybody is fully employed in the building industry, but nobody believes that but the Minister himself.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JustinKeating" hpid="Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. Keating) Justin Keating">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. Keating)</NameTxt>
      <P>I cannot deal with allegations that are unsupported by quotations or by attributions to particular people.  Allegations were made, in fact, contradictory allegations, that we were indifferent to the situation, that we were affirming that no problem existed, and that we have no policy to deal with it in regard to <Col N="1141" /> the matter of employment.  I do not think there is any question here or in any other country with a free market economy but that there are grave economic difficulties in the world and that these economic difficulties inevitably reflect themselves in the level of employment.</P>
      <P>There is rising unemployment here and this is a matter of profound concern to the Government.  I will be arguing that we have a coherent policy for dealing with it and also that that policy, in certain regards, is working in a way that is a credit, not only to the people who have developed it but also in a way that is a credit to very wide sectors of the whole Irish economy who are responding vigorously, courageously and effectively in the face of severe challenges.  It is for that reason that I was disappointed with Deputy Dowling's speech.  I can understand, especially at by-election time, with all the ammunition that the economic situation gives him, Deputy Dowling's desire to pump the Government. However, I think it dangerous at a time like this when that desire to throw political stones passes over into irresponsibility which I believe it has done in the speech we have just heard.  It, therefore, has the result of damaging the people Deputy Dowling affects to be defending.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In my view Deputy Dowling has so exaggerated his case and made such crazy allegations that the whole case is hard to take seriously.  He said in regard to the general unemployment situation that it had been deliberately created by this Government.  In regard to the matter of industrial strife Deputy Dowling said this had been deliberately created by this Government. Referring to the Minister for Local Government, he said it was his deliberate policy to damage the building industry.  Then he said, and I think this is quite scandalous, that it was a positive policy of the Minister for Local Government to strangle some of the people in the construction industry. Deputy Dowling made that allegation, under parliamentary immunity, without the faintest effort to substantiate it and that seems to me to be wildly irresponsible.  Those three <Col N="1142" /> allegations taken together make the net effect of what he had to say simply ridiculous or, possibly, paranoiac. Either way it is a pity because this is a serious subject which deserves to be talked about seriously.</P>
    <P>We have this important moment in our economic history.  Certainly, we have rising unemployment with which this Government is deeply concerned but we have a moment where in a world crisis we have the choice of losing our nerve and being desperately damaged in regard to employment levels and our economy, or of keeping our nerve and coming through this much better than any comparable places.  That is the choice and, therefore, the great need is for confidence and calm.  We were told&mdash;I am in the mixed position of partly agreeing&mdash; about the terrible position and the terrible crisis in which we now find ourselves.  It is a terrible position and a terrible crisis and yet if the people, with the vigorous leadership of the Government, respond with courage and dicipline we can survive this terrible situation very well.  That is the choice which depends upon our own actions.</P>
    <P>I do not have time to read detailed statistics about the economy on to the record of the House but I would like, if people are interested, to refer to the monthly industrial survey which is produced jointly by the CII and the ESRI.  The most recent survey, entitled Business Forecasts, September 1974, covers up to the end of September and is the most recent detailed figures I am in possession of.  In many sectors where we were deeply concerned about employment there is some hope.  I think it is important to balance that hope against the gloom. Page three of that report states that there were slight increases in regard to wearing apparel, in regard to leather and footwear&mdash;both areas of deep concern&mdash;and in the area of furniture. Home sales in September are reported to have picked up slightly.  Exports have also picked up over the August levels.</P>
    <P>That is not a document which states we have no problem but, certainly, not a document saying that we <Col N="1143" /> are in the depth of crisis and that we are not coping.  I quote that not for the sake of self praise because self praise is no praise.  That is not a measure of the activities of a Government, it is a measure of the activities of industry which is responding extremely courageously and well in difficult circumstances.  On the most recent figures available in the most sensitive areas, and I know the concern for things like wearing apparel, footwear and furniture&mdash;concern for employment in those areas is not the prerogative of any Member of any side of this House&mdash;the most recent evidence is not so depressing.  Let us not damage them by talking ourselves into gloom and pessimism. Deputy Dowling knows, as well as I do, that confidence in continued buying, the avoidance of panic and despair is very important.  It is very important that the wheels of the economic machine go on turning. They can be slowed desperately by a lack of confidence or a flight from confidence.</P>
    <P>Again, either side could make considerable play on the matter of employment and unemployment.  In my view Deputy Kelly spoke truthfully about unemployment figures.  There is a figure prepared by the Central Statistics Office.  One can read detailed discussions of that figure and the basis of making the figure has not changed under this Government; that mechanism has existed for some time.</P>
    <P>That is a fairly accurate measure of unemployment but it is not perfect. That is and has been understood for decades.  There are the one-day layoffs. Of course there are the things which do not show up.  If one says that a figure is not exactly precise, which the Parliamentary Secretary to the Taoiseach said truthfully, that does not mean that it is valueless and without meaning.  It does not mean that one can play this game of picking figures out of the air, adding them together and making 100,000, 125,000, 150,000 and so on.  Why stop at any particular spot?  Why should the numbers game not have been played four or five years ago?  The same fringe areas and soft areas, which did not <Col N="1144" /> occur in the Central Statistics Office figure, existed then as they do now. Why do it now if it is not to create panic, alarm or dismay?  Nobody questions the seriousness of the situation. But do not play this irresponsible game of trying to pick figures out of the air and building them into a terrifying snowball which could break over all of us and bury us.  A &ldquo;snowball&rdquo; of panic is not to be encouraged. Our trend in unemployment is very serious.</P>
    <P>Denmark is of comparable size to Ireland.  They entered the Community and were subjected to the same stresses as we were.  In Denmark in July, 1973, the unemployment figure was 12,300.  Their most recent figure was 76,300 an increase of six times the 1973 figure.  Germany's figure has more than doubled.  Our unemployment figure has risen by 20 per cent. We must put our figure into context; it is very serious but not disastrous.</P>
    <P>One must get this balance before declaring something profoundly serious. It does not mean that it is a crisis out of control.  To inflate it for party political purposes is damaging. One can make comparisons year on year.  February is not comparable with September because there are fluctuations through the year.  In February, 1973, the figure was 75,551 which is higher than at present.  The Deputies opposite were not going around during the general election trumpeting about the tremendous crisis in employment.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JustinKeating" hpid="Mr. Keating Mr. Keating">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, we were.  According to the Central Bank Report, for Autumn 1974, the average figures in 1970 were 65,000 and in 1972, 71,000. It will be higher for 1973.  Put it in context.  Do not run away with these wild exaggerations which are damaging to purchasing power, to investments from overseas, which are holding up very well, and to the confidence of Irish industry.  If we trumpet about them enough they will become self-fulfilling prophecies because they will generate that situation which is now being so gleefully predicted.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The elements of a coherent policy <Col N="1145" /> are not made up of gimmicks or dramatic novelties but of pursuing all the available mechanisms as vigorously as possible.  We are not in an area where there are dramatic new initiatives. I am not surprised that some speeches have been a little reminiscent of the confidence debate on the economy. I am not surprised at this useful fiction that the task of the Opposition is to oppose.  It saves them from revealing their own bankruptcy of ideas.</P>
    <P>It would be a magnificent form of Opposition if they produced ideas which were so good that we would have to adopt them&mdash;in which case the Opposition would be making policy &mdash;or else we would be so foolish as to reject them because they came from the Opposition, in which case we would be doing something very stupid. If Fianna Fáil have any good ideas they should reveal them.  That would do much more damage to the credibility of this Government than the type of irresponsible exaggeration which was the real content of what Deputy Dowling had to say.</P>
    <P>The pursuit of job creation is an extremely important way to combat unemployment.  We have had decades of reports about the weak sectors of our industry.  We have had some areas where there was real vigour and others where management failed&mdash;and I agree with Deputy Dowling about some of our management defects&mdash; to take the necessary vigorous steps. As soon as the boom was over, they were in very bad trouble.  Everybody knew that a decade ago.</P>
    <P>I will talk about the rescue and aid mechanisms which are being vigorously used in a moment.  The greatest defence of employment is to create jobs which are viable, have a potential for expansion, will not continuously be causing trouble and that we will not be faced&mdash;I know the Opposition have faced this difficult choice&mdash;with the problem of throwing money endlessly down a hole.</P>
    <P>The work of the IDA, supported by the Government, is being pursued vigorously and successfully.  I can claim sincerely in the 20 months since I took office to have given moral and financial support to this commitment. In my view, Deputy <Col N="1146" /> Dowling was unfair not just to industry, to the workers or to management of industry by denigrating their magnificient efforts in a difficult time, but to the State agencies who are performing extremely well.  The record of IDA new job creation is magnificent.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>It is nice to hear Deputy Brennan, who is probably in a better position to know than Deputy Dowling, agreeing.  That record has not been disimproving in our period of office.  Our support, personal, moral and financial, has not been diminishing but increasing.  It is not a new pillar of employment policy.  Indeed, if one thinks back far enough, neither can it claim to be a Fianna Fáil pillar, although it was important in their time.  The IDA are behaving very usefully.  I will not read figures into the record but they are easily and readily available.</P>
      <P>The other great guarantee of employment with such an open economy as ours is exports.  Personally, morally and financially this Government are supporting the efforts of Córas Tráchtála, and exporters brought together by Córas Tráchtála, to attain a magnificent response in difficult times.</P>
      <P>I have been to Denmark, Saudi Arabia, Kuwait and the Lebanon and my colleagues have been in other parts of the Middle East in the recent past.  We will be in France next week. The people in Córas Tráchtála personally, morally and financially supported by this Government, are performing prodigies, as are the exporters of Ireland.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JustinKeating" hpid="Mr. Keating Mr. Keating">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not want to read too many figures on to the record. But the increase in industrial exports may be illustrated by the following figures: in 1970 they rose by 17 per cent; in 1971 by 9.5 per cent; in 1972 by 23 per cent&mdash;and it is <Col N="1147" /> fair to recall that those years of 1971 and 1972 were years of very great boom.  In 1973 they rose by 38.7 per cent.  The figure for 1974&mdash;though it is a running figure; we do not have a total as yet&mdash;looks as though it will come out at 40 per cent.  Therefore it is going to be as good as last year or a little better.  But last year was the end of the boom.  It ceased last October with the oil crisis, which took a little time to come through.  This year, by common assent, is the worst period in world trade since the 1930s, when the OECD recorded the most rapid diminution of economic activity since they started keeping records.  In those circumstances our export performance, which last year was the best it has ever been in industrial exports, is going to be matched again this year. Let us not denigrate it or pull it down; let us be proud of those people and hold them up, as the Government are doing physically, morally and financialy.  That is a pillar of our policy in regard to employment.</P>
      <P>I do not want to talk in detail about AnCO.  I think there are others better qualified to speak on this than am I.  I do, though, want to talk about the building industry because it is a crucial part of our whole economy. Nobody needs to emphasise its significance, not just in direct employment but in other sorts of employment. It is a bellwether of the health of our economy.  Deputies opposite may not like to hear comparisons made with other countries.  They may like to think that we are suspended, like Mohammed's coffin, between heaven and earth and that we do not in any way feel the influence of events overseas, but the building industry is in great difficulty in very many countries. The response to those difficulties on the part of this Government has been enormous.  We are not declaring that there is no difficulty.  We recognise the difficulty and we have responded to it with immense vigour.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have figures which were prepared by the same people, using the same methods as when the Opposition were in government&mdash;again Deputy <Col N="1148" /> Dowling may attack those figures&mdash; but let us not attack those people who are civil servants doing a job according to the same parameters.  I do not think those civil servants were subverted by Fianna Fáil to twist the figures.  We are not subverting them to twist the figures and they are the same figures prepared under the same rules.  I think we can trust them.  The figures I have indicate that in the private sector of the building industry employment in September, 1974, was about 600 down on what it was in 1973.  Now, that is down, and nobody likes it going down.  It would be nicer if it went up, but that is not a disaster. Further, the figures I have indicate that unemployment in building contracting and the work of construction is up by about 14,000 on the most recent figures I possess over 12 months.  All right; it is up, and up seriously.  But if one considers the sort of volume of money being put into building, the figures are very large. All right; some people might say they were always very large but they are growing quite dramatically.</P>
    <P>I want to talk about the provision of local authority house purchase loans.  The total amount for these loans was £26.8 million for the nine months to December, 1974.  Since we have the nine-month financial period this year, that would mean an annual rate of £35.8 million.  For the previous comparable full financial year it was £21.74 million and, for the financial year before that, it was £9.9 million. Let us look at this explosion of money available in that area&mdash;£9.9 million, £21.74 million and £35.8 million, a very rapid growth, a profound indication of the understanding by the Government of the difficulties in the building sector and of their commitment to spend large amounts of public money to solve it.  The total provision for housing now stands at £71.05 million for nine months, an annual rate of £92.81 million.  In 1972-73 the sum was £46 million; in 1973-74 it was £68 million.  Consider that over three years&mdash;I am taking round figures&mdash;£46 million, £68 million, £93 million, very rapid growth, a profound indication in the hardest possible <Col N="1149" /> way that one can indicate a commitment to helping the building industry.  Then there was a special interest subsidy for the building societies; the moneys made available by the associated banks to the building societies.  Not enough?</P>
    <P>If one man loses his job in building, that is worth responding to.  But that does not spell a crisis; that does not spell indifference by the Government; that does not spell disaster; in fact it spells profound concern.  The figures indicate that, while there is some turning down, without these extremely vigorous measures there would be a crisis.  These extremely vigorous measures, with large amounts of public money committed in time, do not totally neutralise the adverse effects but make them much less damaging and much more manageable.  To claim that we could live in this ivory tower and not at all be influenced by external factors is to claim something impossible.</P>
    <P>I want to say a word too&mdash;because, again, it is always worth paying tribute to work well done&mdash;on the rescue service put together by the IDA, by the officers of my own Department and by other agencies when their co-operation is deemed necessary.  We have an extremely vigorous, alert and efficient rescue service.  The tragedy is that often industrialists leave it too late before they seek help.  They are inclined not to call in that rescue service in time. I think I could use this occasion and this forum&mdash;where we have the good fortune to be listened to more widely outside than inside&mdash;to say to industry and to beg of industry: please do not wait until you get into desperate financial difficulties, until you are worrying about how you will pay the wages bill next Friday, or whenever it may be.  Please come quickly while there is time for this rescue service to be mounted, because there is an effective rescue service consisting of the IDA, of my own Department, and of other appropriate agencies when necessary, whether in regard to helping with exports, with management difficulties, with other sorts of finance, the export credit schemes&mdash;a whole package of schemes.  These are direct contributions <Col N="1150" /> to the staving off of redundancies, to the keeping of the increase in unemployment&mdash;which we affirm, and which we regret deeply&mdash;within manageable proportions and to keeping the industrial performance of the Irish economy as good as it is currently in difficult circumstances.  If I seem resentful in tone, I am not resentful for myself because of a political attack, for my party, or for this Government because that is the stuff of politics&mdash;we go at each other.  But I am resentful of these attacks on Irish industry, whether it be management or worker.  I am resentful of these attacks on State agencies because both industry and State agencies are performing very well and extremely courageously in very difficult circumstances. It is not for me to anticipate the contents of the economic white paper or indeed, at a later stage, to anticipate the contents of the budget. But, so far as I know the contents of the economic white paper will be seen as a vigorous response, as the recognition of a difficult situation and as a vigorous response to it.</P>
    <P>Finally, it would seem that there is a great contribution, we, as a Government, can offer to the surmounting of difficulties.  I do not pretend they are going to go away quickly.  Whether one wants to quote 12 months or 18 months, I do not care.  We are in a difficult time and the difficulties are not going to blow away suddenly.</P>
    <P>The great contribution we have to make towards controlling unemployment and keeping our economy healthy&mdash;and they are two sides of the same thing&mdash;is the concept of a national partnership.  It was easy to sneer at our having in the major economic agencies, industry, the farmers and the trade unions but we told the truth from the economic point of view at that time, as we did in our party conferences.  It is not nice for Labour Party members to have to tell those economic truths; it is not nice to have to say to people that they must forego growth in real income for a period of a year or longer.  It would be equally unpleasant for people on the opposite side because all politicians want to see growth in the real incomes of their constituents and the <Col N="1151" /> citizens of the country.  It was courageous and honest to say that we must forego that growth in view of the transfer of wealth from this country due to the rise in the price of oil and other commodities.</P>
    <P>However, we offered something instead, namely, that an increase of social justice could continue even though growth in real incomes had to be deferred for a year or so.  In the realm where we said that when growth is resumed the distribution will be more equitable, that we will have advanced to social justice even though we cannot give more income, we had the basis for building a national partnership.  This partnership will surmount the crisis; it is the great guarantee of the continuing success of the economy in difficult times, of the continuing control of unemployment, with some rise but not with a catastrophic one.</P>
    <P>The whole package of taxation reform, of reform of social welfare and health, of law reform, of a resources policy resulting in a much more equitable distribution, of worker participation, of a fairer deal for women and the massive investment in housing, are offered as a national partnership.  This is the great contribution to social calm, to the defending of the economy and to the guaranteeing that while we cannot protect every job we can protect the vast majority of jobs and keep the economy healthy and expanding in desperately difficult circumstances.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JosephBrennan" hpid="Mr. Brennan Mr. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>The motion in the name of our spokesman for Labour reads:</P>
      <P>That Dáil Éireann deplores the failure of the Government to produce coherent policies to combat the problem of rapidly rising unemployment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have heard the Minister for Industry and Commerce but those whose job it is to employ people will go to bed tonight less enlightened than they were last night&mdash;after hearing that statement.  What I take from the statement is that Fianna Fáil had unemployment in their time but that that was due to Fianna Fáil's failure to <Col N="1152" /> cope with the problem&mdash;we have unemployment now but nothing can be done about it because it is world-wide and we must accept it.  The attitude of the Government is that while they say they can do nothing about it, if there is any slight glimmer of an improvement anywhere they will take credit for it.  This hypocrisy is more than the people can stomach; there must be a limit to it.</P>
    <P>I remember being on television with the Minister about a year ago and then we spoke about the matters that have inevitably lead to the situation existing today although at that period the Government still had time to do something about them.  What the Minister tried to do on that occasion was to tell the people that anything that happened was due to circumstances over which the Government had no control but that the Government were doing something about these matters and that the best was about to happen.</P>
    <P>In the <i>Irish Independent</i> dated 21st January, 1974, the Minister is quoted as follows:</P>
    <P>The Government had been slowing the rate of increase since taking office, and improving our performance <i>vis-à-vis</i> comparable countries.</P>
    <P>The opening paragraph of the article in the <i>Irish Independent</i> of the same date reads:</P>
    <P>A strong defence of the Government's record on prices, and a call to workers to give their backing to the proposed National Wage Agreement, was made yesterday by the Minister for Industry and Commerce, Mr. Keating.</P>
    <P>The article does not state where this statement was made.  It continues:</P>
    <P>He said Ireland had improved its position in the EEC inflation league, from being the country with the fastest inflation of the Nine in 1972, to a present position of joint third with two other countries.</P>
    <P>Here the Minister is immediately taking credit for doing something&mdash; although we are not told what is was &mdash;that brought the country to the point where we were joint third with <Col N="1153" /> two other countries.  This is the same kind of performance we have just heard; the attitude of the Government that the Opposition should keep quiet, should continually express confidence in the economy.  The Minister tried to deflect an attack on his own inactivity when he stated we were attacking the industrialists.  I do not want to be vindictive but I am sick and tired listening to people I meet every day asking me what we are doing about the present state of affairs and wondering when we are coming back to power.  Their constant question is, &ldquo;What is happening to the present outfit?&rdquo;</P>
    <P>We are listening to a lot of ostentatious talk, to the demagogue's approach to everything, but nothing practical is emerging.  I listened carefully to the Minister's speech for any concrete suggestion of an effort on the part of the Government to alleviate the serious situation in which we find ourselves.  The only such suggestion was in regard to industrialists and the great job they were doing and he said he was giving them physical, moral and financial support. The physical support was that he went to a number of countries and asked industry to come here.  The moral support he is offering is that he is continually telling them they are doing a good job.  I do not know what the financial support entails.</P>
    <P>In today's <i>Irish Press</i> a speech by the secretary of the Limerick Chamber of Commerce is quoted.  That body had a lot to say about the inactivity of the Government.  Had it been said by one of us we would be accused of rocking the boat, of creating a lack of confidence and of damaging the credibility of our industrialists the people and institutions Fianna Fáil built up which even a Coalition Government cannot destroy. They have considerable resilience and they will come back despite their present difficult circumstances.  The secretary of the Limerick Chamber of Commerce said that business people and wage and salary earners must be released from the tax death grip in which they were held by bad Government administration.</P>
    <P>I am not questioning the Minister's <Col N="1154" /> statement when he said he would give physical and moral support but I am questioning his statement that he would give financial support.  This is what this motion is about.  All the economic indicators are pointing to a decline in domestic consumer purchasing. This is resulting in unexpected stockpiling by many of the firms whose liquidity has been so eroded in recent times that they have not the facilities to retain that stock and they are being pressed by the banks to make good their commitments in the area of extended credit. I trust that the Minister will come to their assistance in the first instance by providing the necessary credit facilities and by ensuring that the extension of credit will be available to enable them to stockpile rather than to lay off some of their workers.  The Minister could help, too, by easing the tax burden so as to enable industrialists to retain employees.  This move would ease considerably the demands which undoubtedly will be made in negotiating the next national pay agreement.</P>
    <P>With the Cork by-election in mind the people are being told that there is no crisis, that there is merely a little rub-off of world conditions and that if we remain quiet and if the Opposition are as mute as mice, everything will pass off nicely.  At the same time the Government held a summit conference to which they invited trade unionists, industrialists and farmers. The Government told them that there is a serious crisis, that we must tighten our belts and be prepared to accept no rise in our standard of living.  We are told that we must be prepared to moderate demands for income increases because we are facing a disastrous situation while, for political reasons, we are being told that there will be an improvement soon in the economic situation.</P>
    <P>The first hitch in regard to the credibility of the Coalition was in relation to prices.  One has no wish to harp forever on the famous 14-point programme on which the Coalition came to power and which they talked of for their first six months in office but of which we have heard nothing in more recent times.  Those people <Col N="1155" /> who had hoped that this Government would perform in relation to prices have now lost all confidence in anything that the Government may do or say in this area.</P>
    <P>When the National Prices Commission were brought into being, they were welcomed by the Confederation of Irish Industries.  I was one of those who sat at the Government table at the time that the NPC were being set up.  However, I am not happy with the criteria which the NPC have been using recently in regard to price increases. I am surprised that the Minister would allow to be included in the NPC's report a statement which says that, if it were not for the NPC, the consumers would be paying £31 million more than they are paying. In other words, the NPC are saying that they have reduced demands&mdash; although they have acceded to every demand&mdash;to the extent that the percentage increase in the cost of consumer goods is not as great as it would be if we had no NPC.</P>
    <P>I wonder if the Minister has ever brought a cow to the fair or whether he knows anything of the practicalities of the economic life in the country where people must work and try to balance their household budgets.  Does the Minister realise that people who seek increases in prices ask for twice as much as they expect to get and that they are happy to get a fraction of what they demand although they usually get more than what they expected? On a previous occasion I have heard the Minister take credit for the situation whereby the NPC claims that, if it were not for them, the percentage increase in the cost of consumer goods would be greater.  There is nobody who is prepared to swallow a statement of that kind.  The Minister is suave and slick when it comes to passing backhanded compliments but I would ask him to ensure that in future no such statement as that to which I have referred appears either in an NPC or in any other report.</P>
    <P>The NPC were intended to act in a capacity of surveillance, to monitor prices and to report to the Minister. The Minister should have available to him a good advisory body who <Col N="1156" /> would tell him what should or should not be done.  This does not mean merely looking at prices in the supermarkets or any other retail establishments. The question of costs should be monitored from the stage at which the raw material is purchased, along the line through the wholesaler, through the retailer and to the consumer. This is where the surveillance must take place but where it is not taking place with the same care as should be applied and as was applied when the NPC were established.  This lack of surveillance is obvious from the number of commodities&mdash;70 or 80&mdash; that increase in price every month. The impression has been created among business people that the correct thing to do when selling something is to get the highest price possible so long as you can get away with that.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnGrattanEsmonde" hpid="Mr. Esmonde Mr. Esmonde">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Esmonde</NameTxt>
      <P>When the debate was adjourned I was referring to the speech of Deputy Blaney.  He made some very wild statements.  I had the feeling that his contribution was one of posturing.  He made allegations against the attitude of the Government in respect of matters which were relevant to the North of Ireland and it was only in the last few sentences that he brought it into the context of dealing with the British Government, when it was then more a matter for Foreign Affairs.  I do not agree with his approach in treating the subject of the North as a matter for Foreign Affairs.  I will, instead, deal with other matters which I consider more proper to this debate.</P>
      <P>One matter that is relevant to the whole of Ireland is that of a regional policy or the lack of one on the part of the EEC.  I believe the message is now getting through to the Commission in Brussels that Ireland stands to gain a great deal from a properly structured and properly planned regional policy.  I always thought the prime intent of the EEC was to move to economic and monetary union.  It seems to me that a proper regional policy is the only way imbalances can be removed in the EEC.</P>
      <P>A British politician, Mr. Heath, said in a newspaper recently that the EEC appear to have failed to deal with the problems affecting the daily lives of ordinary people.</P>
      <P>That is possibly a fair comment to make.  The EEC started with great hopes and a certain amount of structural planning, but it now seems to have got into a state of bits and pieces. Mistakes appear to have been made, particularly in relation to the beef situation.  This country can claim that we warned the EEC Commission and the Council of Ministers of the difficulties that would arise if the importation of beef continued the way it was planned.  Unhappily we now have to relate that the advice and the warnings given by Deputy Mark Clinton, our Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries, to the EEC have been proved only too right and too correct.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The main criticism, I suppose, in relation to the EEC is the disorganisation <Col N="1162" /> of markets, rising prices and inflation, lack of a common regional development policy&mdash;and for that matter a common energy policy but I think this is now beginning to take shape&mdash;and a very serious watering down of the principles of the common agricultural policy.  These matters naturally weaken the Community, first, in the eyes of its own members and, secondly, in the eyes of communities outside the EEC.  It is very hard to point to any particular aspect of the activities of the EEC as giving rise to this rather justifiable criticism and judgment of the EEC.  In the eyes of many, and in my view also, it seems that the Community is organised for discussion but its weakness for some time has been, and still is decision making.  This is a long standing criticism by European parliamentarians and possibly it has been brought about by the unwritten but over-riding ambition to get unanimity on every point before a decision is made.</P>
    <P>Unfortunately, the passage of time has also had the effect of changing the attitudes of member states to the EEC.  When I was in Brussels in June, as a member of the committee of this House which deals with secondary legislation from the EEC, it was freely expressed by the EEC Commission members that there was originally a scale of priorities in dealing with EEC matters, that the first point was economics, the economy of member States and of the EEC.  Only as a very poor second the political aspect came into the picture.  That being so, it seemed to be always possible to find a compromise in a situation of differing views.</P>
    <P>It is only right, when looking at this problem, to say that the change has taken place in parallel with thinking in political circles in Germany.  Up to fairly recent times Germany has been prepared to compromise and give a bit.  I do not say that she is not still prepared to compromise and give a bit but her attitude on EEC problems has greatly hardened.  This was brought to light in the new discussions concerning agricultural prices, the lead up to the green £.  We know the delay that occurred there but it <Col N="1163" /> was ultimately accepted.  I suppose every country has a certain political conscience in regard to its past history; that might have had something to do with the change of attitude; and it is quite freely said that Germany felt that she had expiated her sins of the last war and was now entitled to hold up her head, free from blame and could be an equal partner.  I may be wrong in this but I have heard it said more than twice or three times.</P>
    <P>It is right that, when looking at EEC matters, we should realise that we must now fight for every inch we want in the way of benefits and concessions in the EEC.  When we went into the Community many people thought it would be a wonderful bonanza, a sort of Utopia.  We have just had a debate on unemployment but many people forget that at the time the referendum was being held on entry to the EEC it was pretty clearly stated by the politicians who advocated joining the EEC that there would be those who would fall by the wayside and that businesses would find themselves in difficulties because they had not made any attempt to adjust to the changed economic circumstances in which they would find themselves, that they would no longer be looked after by protective tariffs and would have to stand on their own economic feet, that they would have to prove that they were individually viable enterprises.  If my memory is correct, those who would suffer were estimated to be nearly 20 per cent of our business sector but we hoped by an on-going policy in the IDA and the Government that we would be able to meet this difficulty.</P>
    <P>Any impartial judge, looking at the work that has been done since we joined the EEC, will have to concede that the IDA and other organisations, the CII, the Federated Union of Employers and the unions have all put their shoulders to the wheel and it can be fairly said that they have all combined to do a very good job.  They have avoided the difficulties that were anticipated.  Nobody, of course, anticipated a year ago that we would have <Col N="1164" /> this colossal difficulty of the fuel crisis&mdash;some may have, but generally the public did not realise that outside the EEC there were countries that lived by exporting what I might call primary, unmanufactured products, that they had been at the wrong end of a belated mercantilism, a doctrine that was applied with considerable success by what were the colonial powers.</P>
    <P>When the EEC was created many of the members still seemed to think in the days of mercantilism when they had colonies or states outside Europe where they had cheap sources of raw materials.  In an effort to compensate for that loss, through the evolution of the world and the emergent nations, they naturally seized on the principles embodied in the Treaty of Rome.  However, in doing so many of them have failed to shake off the old fever or disease and their thinking became translated into a watered-down nationalism, but a nationalism that was not compatible with the true principles of the Common Market. There was a lack of a full will to co-operate in a common design and purpose.  When difficulties and stresses appeared there was evidence of individual thinking and an unwillingness to work as a team.</P>
    <P>The energy crisis brought this very much to the fore.  We had a prior warning of this in relation to the regional policies as adumbrated by the Commission.  It is regrettable that this has been so, but is is a fact with which we have to live.  The pity of it is that there are other countries outside the EEC, the emerging nations, who, like all new nations, are having somewhat of a struggle to build their own economic viability, and the energy crisis has come as a far greater blow to them than it has to the well-developed nations.  This is the corner stone of the Minister's speech to the House when he deals with the world economic crisis.  I as an Irishman take satisfaction in the attitude that has been adopted to these new nations by our Government in the various meetings that have taken place following the difficulties of the energy crisis.</P>
    <P>I do not know if there was any <Col N="1165" /> Member of this House who saw a programme on BBC television two or three nights ago which dealt with the question of food and the world food shortage.  For those who did not, let me say there was a very obvious and interesting message conveyed by the Prime Minister of Jamaica when he was discussing the question of sugar or some other raw material that they were exporting.  He said their price for this raw material had not increased, but for the purpose of tilling and harvesting their crop they had to import machinery and, whatever the price was, something like £600, it had been increased recently to £900; yet the world expected them to produce their sugar or other raw material at the same price.  It said they had not much to give but that this was their lifeline.</P>
    <P>It is in that light one has to view the world situation.  We are no longer considering the strength of the dollar. There are far more people in the world than those in the United States, and there are now far more causes for inflation.  One does not hear so much about financial illiquidity in the world. One hears the new word &ldquo;recycling&rdquo;. This has arisen because the money is now freely flowing back to the oil-producing nations, and some of these nations have not got the population or the demand to utilise the money they are making.  Some of these are comparatively small States and sheikdoms, but colossal amounts of money are now coming in because of the increase in the price of crude oil.  During the summer the English money market had to take precautionary measures to deal with the movement of this tremendous amount of money in Europe.  I would agree with the Minister when he says the problem is one of recycling, so that the world can utilise this money if the nations who make it cannot utilise it for their own home purposes.</P>
    <P>I think the proper description of the present world difficulties is that we are very near an economic war but that good sense is prevailing in all quarters to avoid that situation.  People previously thought of war as guns, bullets and bombs.  There is a far more deadly weapon, and that is that of <Col N="1166" /> hunger, starvation, lack of vital economic resources.  On the same programme to which I referred earlier there was a gentleman from Bangladesh who was involved in trying to obtain sufficient food to prevent death from starvation in his nation.  I think he said that at the time of speaking he had filled half his requirements but another half was left to be filled.  I am glad the Minister came back again and again to the difficulties of those countries.  We are at a time when we cannot say: &ldquo;I am all right, Jack, hump you.&rdquo; We are all involved.  We regard ourselves as a Christian and a democratic nation.  In those circumstances it behoves us to get ourselves very closely involved in world problems.</P>
    <P>Allied to this, I suppose, is the fact that you can only give what you have got, what you do not require for yourself. Of course, views differ as to what a nation requires for its own purposes. Much depends on national attitudes. I would imagine the Irish nation, taken as a whole, would be more a giver than a taker.  We have a very fine tradition in the mission fields.  That was certainly one-way traffic both in manpower and in money and it still continues today.  When there is a world tragedy the Irish people are quick to subscribe and quick to recognise the plight of the people involved.  I suppose our past history has taught us what it is to suffer hardship.  We can possibly better understand the hardships those countries are now undergoing than might be the case with other countries who have better resources, higher standards of living and have had easier times.</P>
    <P>Inherent in any consideration of international difficulties is a difficulty created by inflation.  The great fear in the world today is that the stronger nations may over react in their efforts to produce deflationary policies.  I am concerned at the attitude being adopted by the American and German governments.  Taken in relation to other countries they are regarded as strong, viable nations, indeed, extremely strong and extremely wealthy nations.  Because of their strong position <Col N="1167" /> they must realise that their strength can only continue if the rest of the world can be kept on an even keel economically.  I do not know but I would imagine a cure for home inflation in both those countries might be to give a little more.  It would take wealth out of circulation and it could be given to countries that require it.  I am talking about the poorest developing countries and countries that are particularly hit by the energy crisis, to tide them over a period of re-adjustment.  The first panic in relation to the fuel crisis was that one must cut down consumption by 10 per cent.  This has already been achieved by most member countries of the EEC and has, in some cases, been greatly exceeded.  A criticism of the suggestion that consumption should be cut by 10 per cent was that this was not enough and that countries could easily cut by more without affecting their productive capacity. This seems to have been proved by the course of events.</P>
    <P>Undue emphasis has been placed on keeping relations happy between Germany and France.  The attitude of France to some matters in the EEC leaves much to be desired.  She has been far too fond of taking an independent line and not regarding herself as part of the European club.  I would not view her attitude to efforts to produce a common energy policy with any degree of happiness.  She is now making a suggestion that we should get together around a table the heads of state.  I have great doubts about this meeting of heads of state. I think our Minister for Foreign Affairs has the same doubts.</P>
    <P>I do not think there is any point in having a meeting of heads of state unless there is a definite will to come out with a common policy, with a common agreement.  We know what happened in Stockholm.  Nothing came of that.  We know that France failed to join in certain discussions dealing with the energy crisis.  When a country adopts that attitude it is about time she laid down what she thinks is the way to deal with it and show her good will and show what she is prepared to do.  It is not my function <Col N="1168" /> to attack governments but I am entitled, as an Irish Deputy, to point to things that cause concern in the minds of the Irish public.  Ireland has abided by the rules of the EEC.  She has done her level best to assist others to do likewise.  One would expect the larger countries to give good example in times of crisis.  Nobody can say that the stronger countries are free of blame for their failure to regard their responsibilities in the community.</P>
    <P>We must not forget that certain countries have more votes, that there is a weighted voting system in the EEC.  Why were these people given those votes?  Having the greater strength when it comes to voting, they have also got a greater responsibility to the Community.  One must guard against the Community being used as a plaything to be pushed and used as the larger countries might like to use it, for their own purposes.</P>
    <P>Just because there is inflation it does not mean that a country like Germany should be entitled to indulge in a heavy deflationary policy that will interfere with European employment. One must remember there is mobility of labour in the EEC and every decision that is made must be looked at in the context of how it will affect not alone your own country but the other EEC member countries.  This is a large part of the criticism of the EEC, why there is dissatisfaction with the EEC.  I quoted the statement made by Mr. Heath in relation to the disenchantment people felt about the EEC.  He said:</P>
    <P>The EEC appears to have failed to deal with the problems affecting the daily lives of ordinary people.</P>
    <P>Further on in his statement, which appeared in a supplement to the <i>London Times</i> on 5th November, he did not refer to agriculture until the very end when he referred to the so-called renegotiation.</P>
    <P>England's record is very poor in relation to CAP.  She has failed and refused to work intervention.  We and other countries in Europe have worked it.  This is coming back to the old nationalist principle that these countries will use at the wrong time. <Col N="1169" /> There must be a little more give and take by all EEC member countries. People talk about political attitudes hardening towards the EEC forgetting that it is primarily an economic community and there will have to be a dropping of rigid attitudes.</P>
    <P>I referred already to the failure to produce a regional policy.  If the larger or better-off countries fail to agree and refuse to face fundamental facts, one must call in question the honesty of their approach and their real intent to get to economic and monetary union.  One can readily instance how CAP was very nearly wrecked by the revaluation of currencies. If one wanted to ride a coach and four through CAP, that was the obvious and the easy way to do it, and, in effect, that has happened and that has been a large part of the trouble in European affairs.  You start on a certain basis with a unit of account, you start with currencies at a certain ratio to each other.  Then a country can come in unilaterally and revalue its currency.  This makes a dog's dinner of the agreed targets and policies.  It is unilateral variation.</P>
    <P>There is one matter that came before the Oireachtas Joint Committee on the Secondary Legislation of the European Communities. They furnished an interim report dealing with the matter of tax harmonisation. This, in turn, is referred to in the third report, dated June, 1974, issued by the Department of External Affairs, at paragraph 14, page 105.  I am glad to note that a working group has been set up and that the functions of that group have been limited to fact finding.  The Oireachtas committee voiced some concern at the implications of the preliminary proposals of the Commission.  The working group have already reported and stated that the policy cannot be implemented by the Commission at the target date of 1st January, 1975.  This is due to the complexity of the proposals, the serious problems involved and the necessity for detailed discussion.</P>
    <P>I should certainly like to underline the words &ldquo;necessity for detailed discussion&rdquo; in the Irish context.  There is not much point in aiming for tax harmonisation, <Col N="1170" /> which is necessary for the purpose of providing money for the EEC budget, if you are to have a complete up and down, in and out sort of performance on the relativity of the European currencies to each other.  You will have considerable difficulties and there will be a rather unreal situation arising if the tax is applied as I have seen it proposed.  For instance, one of the proposals would mean that food would have to be taxed, and that is of no assistance, particularly in this inflationary period we are going through.</P>
    <P>I note that there are more optimistic reports coming in relation to the several economies in Europe from the point of view of inflation&mdash;it seems to be stabilising somewhat&mdash;but I should much prefer to see a proper stabilisation of the inflationary situation before going into the realms of a new tax structure where the currencies are not updated in relation to the unit of account.  I appreciate that we have the green £ which makes some effort to compensate for inequalities in relation to the unit of account.  This in turn has other implications in relation to prices of imported goods.  We as a country very open to the effects of outside affairs have to think very hard before we make serious decisions in this field. We had no option but to press for the green £ in the circumstances in which we found ourselves having regard to the mess made by the agricultural section of the Commission in Brussels.</P>
    <P>I mentioned that some outside countries require financial assistance in the hope that some of this money obtained by the oil exporting countries would be recycled in the proper direction, but the same can be said for the countries in Europe who are suffering very badly as a result of the increase in the price of fuel.  The Community will have to look carefully at its approach in the matter of loans to members of the Community.  The giving of loans will have to be looked at in the light of the real resources of the Community as a whole.  This has been advocated by M. Monet as desirable and I have noticed that M. Guiscard d'Estaing, the French Premier, is going to have discussions with M. Monet and, arising out of those discussions, something may come of that aspect of Community <Col N="1171" /> activity.  This is all the more necessary now where large sums of money will have to be made available to deal with the aftermath of the present situation arising out of the fuel crisis.  I do not believe the fuel crisis should be any reason for pessimism. We have suffered a good deal as a result of the increase in fuel prices; these are washing through all branches of our economic activity.  But the Government have managed the whole problem very well.  It is interesting to throw one's mind back to when the fuel crisis first broke and the sort of panic that was being generated by some people who actually advocated rationing. Fortunately, our Minister for Transport and Power held out against the pressure and he has been proved right.</P>
    <P>In much of our economic activity we are inclined to be somewhat parochial in that our sights are set somewhat short.  In this respect the fuel crisis has taught the country an unwelcome but necessary lesson.  We must realise that this country is just part of the entire world community of nations and our economic activities are not just related to the United Kingdom or the European Economic Community; we must have regard for our relationships with the wider world.</P>
    <P>When the Estimate for Foreign Affairs was before us on the last occasion I made a small contribution to the debate and one of the matters I mentioned was that of physical aid in human terms, in the sense of individual know-how, professional know-how and so forth, which could be useful to emerging nations and nations in difficulty.  Apparently the Minister was working along the same lines. He had already put in train this very desirable objective and it has produced very valuable assistance to these emerging nations.  There are now 100 souls working in different activities for these nations.  The reference in the Minister's opening speech shows the need for this kind of assistance and proves that such assistance is availed of when it is offered.</P>
    <P>With regard to grants or loans available under certain headings, an applicant for a loan likes to know fairly <Col N="1172" /> early on where there is a fairly large capital commitment involved what his chances are of qualifying.  I have in mind the situation in relation to FEOGA.  I understand the practice is not to say whether an applicant qualifies until the full investment has been made by the particular applicant. It would be of considerable assistance if there was some expression of intent: &ldquo;Look, if you do so and so, you will qualify&rdquo;.  Two constituents of mine are applicants for loans.  They are engaged in the fishing industry.  There is, as we all know, a very heavy capital investment in the building of trawlers.  I am talking now about deep sea trawlers, not offshore trawlers.  Apparently these applicants are not told whether or not they qualify; they are told only when they have involved themselves fully.  The Minister might drop a word in the ear of FEOGA about this because it is a matter of some little concern when one is running into £1 million or £2 million.</P>
    <P>The Minister referred to staffing difficulties and how they had been overcome.  We were totally unprepared from a staffing point of view where the European Economic Community was concerned.  We had made no real provision until membership became a <i>fait accompli.</i> This placed a great strain on the public service.  In this context, it is a little odd that a great many countries do not put a great deal of meas on public servants.  They require a Minister of State to be present. In one instance a mission constituted of civil servants went out and nothing came of it.  On the other hand, when a Minister accompanied the mission quite a bit came of it.  All the Minister had to do was to be there.  My predecessor in my constituency told me that, when it came down to negotiations in Europe and elsewhere, it is the political point of the mission that is regarded as of vital importance.  We have had evidence of this in two instances recently.  One instance was the trips made by the Minister for the Gaeltacht and the other was the trips made by the Minister for Industry and Commerce.  These two trips were well worthwhile.  It is hard on Ministers, but I would like to put it on <Col N="1173" /> record that trips made by Ministers have produced real results and real dividends from the point of view of trade and contracts.</P>
    <P>I welcome the reopening of the Suez Canal.  This is a really great move and it should assist considerably in trade and communication.  It will, of course, have the effect of reopening one half of the world to the other half.  Something will come of that.  I should like to make one suggestion to the Minister and, through him, the Government.  I do not think we have an ambassador to Israel.  We should, as we have an ambassador to another nation in the Middle East. This is an area where it is very necessary that we should have high diplomatic representation.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FrankCarter" hpid="Mr. Carter Mr. Carter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Carter</NameTxt>
      <P>This Estimate and its supplementaries provide wide scope for debate.  I am not in a position to indulge in an extended debate because I was not able to study in full all the implications of the Minister's introductory speech which covered not merely foreign affairs but also international co-operation.</P>
      <P>I should like to select a few points and try to deal with them off the cuff. That is the best I can hope to do.  One point which immediately affects this country and our membership of the Community, and that of Britain, is the ever-pressing question of the British attitude towards the Community. It is being said&mdash;and it was stated in the arguments which led up to the last British general election&mdash; that Britain proposes to renegotiate her terms of entry to the Community.</P>
      <P>I did not have much time to study speeches made in that election or to watch some of the programmes from the BBC dealing with those matters. From sketchily reading our own daily newspapers and listening to comments on a world basis, it seems to me&mdash;and I would think to many more people&mdash;that the British are either playing a political game or they are not dealing in realistic terms with the European Community.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I read the Treaty of Rome a good while ago and I doubt&mdash;and the Minister reinforced this in his speech&mdash;<Col N="1174" /> that the British, clever and all as they think they are, can breach the treaty.  It would be a very bad day, indeed, if they could.  Membership of the Community is as good for Britain as it is for many of the other countries who make up the Community at the moment.  Indeed it is a good deal better.  I submit that this type of talk or propaganda will not lead to any useful solutions of what the British are aiming at.</P>
    <P>From observing this whole matter it seems to me that some of the British politicians think they are back in 1913 and that the British can live in isolation regardless of Europe and the seas around them.  Of course, they are not slow to exploit the seas around them.  For Ireland there is the problem that the British, to all intents and purposes, are neither in nor out of the Community.  It has come to a very bad pass that, this being so, they should set out to impede the trading of other members of the Community, and that their subjects should take it upon themselves&mdash; although they say they are the law givers they are now the law breakers &mdash;to prevent our exports going into intervention in the Community.</P>
    <P>I heard a Welsh farmer last Sunday speak on behalf of the farmers of Britain.  Either he was badly briefed or he did not know much about the cattle trade.  He gave as one of the excuses for the activities there the fact that cattle were so much dearer in Ireland than they were in Britain. Listening to that argument it seemed mighty strange to me that dealers from Britain would come here to buy dear cattle if they could buy cattle at home much cheaper.  There were many flaws in his argument.</P>
    <P>The farmers' union in Britain either has not got the confidence or the courage to face the Government of the day and say: &ldquo;This is your affair.  It is not the affair of the farmers of Ireland.  They are doing their best.&rdquo;  As erstwhile purported leaders, the farming community in Britain have lost their morale in so far as they would take to the streets to prevent their neighbour from exporting its produce to the Community to which it belongs.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1175" /> We should condemn that action. That is the action which makes Parliament irrelevant.  That is the action of the streets.  Once politics takes to the streets, that is a blow to Parliament. As politicians, we should make it our business to comment on these matters in time, so that we will keep politics where politics really belong, on the floor of the institution which professes the politics.  So far as I know, no Minister in the British Government has come out with a decisive statement condemning those people at the ports.  Perhaps the Minister for Agriculture talked in certain terms to the farmers there, but he did not condemn them half strongly enough in the opinion of many here.  We are finding it harder than ever before to sell our stock and we want to get rid of the beef in order to make way for the sale of younger stock.  The only way we have of ridding ourselves of the beef we have on hands is to sell it into intervention.  Fortunately, the Community provides the service of intervention but if we did not have the Community I wonder where would we stand.</P>
    <P>When I hear people talking in uncomplimentary terms about the Community this point always springs to mind.  It will be recalled that we were long enough depending on the British market and that the British market in turn was always, by virtue of its competition, a dump market.  Now that we are trying to get away from that we are being way-laid by the British farmers.</P>
    <P>The Ministers for Agriculture and Fisheries and Foreign Affairs, if this continues, should take every step possible to bring it to a speedy end.  This is not conduct calculated to lead to any sort of commercialism.  Our farmers have spoken out in moderate terms, and the various leaders of the farming community have said that they do not want any disagreement with their counterparts in Britain.  We all subscribe to that view but it is time it was brought home to the British Government that it is their responsibility and if they are not able to curb their own farmers they are not <Col N="1176" /> a Government.  If they are not able to appease their farmers by political management or by paying them off in money it has come to a very poor time.</P>
    <P>In my view the British believe they are living back in 1913.  Two world wars were fought since then and a lot of treasure has gone to the bottom of the sea.  The British may live to learn how far some countries in Europe are ahead of them.  Even though we are going through a depressed period, Europe will be an example to the rest of the world provided that the Rome Treaty and the EEC rules are given a chance, and provided that we lose the eternal fear of life in general.</P>
    <P>It is a strange factor that hand in hand with affluence one has the prospect of hunger not far away in terms of present day communications.  A world conference on food is being held this week and we have been told by leading authorities attending that conference that inside five or six years 33 developing countries could be experiencing hunger.  We have been told that the only country in a position to solve this problem is America.  Instead of the tactics the British Government are engaging in it would be much better if they directed their attention outwardly because the only chance the British, or Irish, have of survival in the long run is by international co-operation.  Britain no longer rules the waves and no one shivers now when John Bull shouts.</P>
    <P>By now the British must know that they have been losing ground steadily since 1913 and that they are showing no signs of regaining it.  It could be said that they won the war but lost it as far as their economy is concerned. The Treaty of Rome, if applied and subscribed to by all members of the Community, has wonderful advantages.  In my view Europe can achieve great advances, not merely for the Continent but for the developing nations who depend on Europe.</P>
    <P>I read a synopsis of the aid provided in 1973 by the Community for African countries.  Whatever may be said about lumbering democracy this aid was provided <Col N="1177" /> in double quick time to an area badly in need of it, an area in central Africa.  There are 4,000 miles of territory there involved in a phenomenon unknown in history, a drought lasting for eight years which wiped out one of the finest tribes in the Sahara and their cattle population.  Despite the fact that the Community is beset with problems aid was given to those stricken people.  In addition, the countries making up the Community also gave help.</P>
    <P>I subscribe to the view that we would benefit substantially from membership of the Community, provided we have discipline, a sense of purpose and the integrity to play our part, even a small part, as members of the Community. But a small part is important when it comes to matters such as those about which I have been speaking.</P>
    <P>We should be doing more to promote trade with Northern Ireland. For many years we have had a trading surplus with the North.  This, I think, is the only area where we have a surplus in our favour.  We should try to cultivate the idea in Northern Ireland that EEC membership will benefit them in the long run.  They seem to be bitten by the same bug as the British.  They think they are back in 1913 so far as Britain is concerned and that Britain can afford to carry them indefinitely.  This is not so, as any realist knows.  Britain could expeditiously use at home the money which is subsidising Northern Ireland, especially in the North of England to rehabilitate some of the industries there.</P>
    <P>We have been told that Northern businessmen are astute and keen.  If they are they now have a chance to extend the scope of their trade with us and turn their trade deficit into a balance in their favour.  This could be done very easily if they tried, but they are not trying.  Those who were responsible for trying to keep the wheels of industry turning should direct their minds to this matter.  The loud-mouthed politicians on the street corners shout about refusing the Irish pound.  Next they will be refusing the European arrangement.  They know <Col N="1178" /> very well that when Britain finds it difficult to live in isolation in terms of trade, they in the North will not be able to live in isolation either.  I am not even referring to the political side of this question.</P>
    <P>We now speak of regional aid, regionalism in general and what the Community propose to devote to regional regeneration.  We should make the chances which lie in this direction known to the businessmen of Northern Ireland.  We have a surplus in our favour of approximately £30 million and in terms of trade export only 10 per cent of our goods.  Likewise the flow-back of the North's exportable goods is only about 10 per cent.  We should try to widen this bridgehead.</P>
    <P>We have heard a good deal of recriminations and exclamations following the various murders, robberies and so forth.  In my view, the silent majority in the North do not want rebellion.  Like the silent majority in other countries, they could allow themselves to be intimidated by the aggressive, tough, vociferous minority of violent men on both sides.  It has been known for such minorities to force countries into difficulties in the past and they may well do so again unless the silent majority there and here rethink this matter.  As I said, the first bridgehead could be trade.</P>
    <P>I do not know anybody who could offer an opinion on the political side, so much has already been said.  Still these murders, counter-murders and revenge killings go on.  This is revolting in any alleged Christian community, North or South.  I do not admire, and I am sure nobody could admire, the attitude of the British Government at the moment.  Having taken steps to try to curb the activities of certain people, it seems that there is a hesitancy, an indecision, which could give false hopes to violent people and which could be the cause of prolonging these activities much further into the future.  I would hope the Minister would impress on his colleagues whenever he meets them, be it in England or in Europe, the desirability of a better sense of purpose <Col N="1179" /> in this regard, backed up by the necessary action to curb the people who openly advocate on street corners and in halls the boycotting of our goods, of our money, and who generally act as they did at Finaghy 20 years ago.  This is not good enough. It might be all right in calmer circumstances but it leads now to murder, counter-murder, revenge killings, the wiping out of families and so on.</P>
    <P>It seems that the leaders of thought in Northern Ireland know very well that they could not go it alone.  They know very well that Britain has been bleeding for so long there is not that much left.  They know very well they would have a future in Europe.  We should make known to them also that their future is in Europe with us. Whether or not they would find common ground with us there even in the next 20, 30 or 40 years is doubtful. But I would hazard a guess that in the next five years&mdash;if we are all alive and if Europe makes the strides it did in the past five&mdash;they will find out the hard way.  It would be an indication of a very shortsighted and gullible people were they to say: &ldquo;We are going to refuse your £ because it does not bear the imprint of Her Majesty.&rdquo;  They would be making fools of themselves.  One would hope that it is a very small minority only North of the Border who would indulge in that sort of talk.  Certainly no politician who purports to be one of Westminster stature should advocate that type of argument for a moment.</P>
    <P>On the other hand, we should continue, as much as we can, our efforts to reduce violence, offering the best terms possible by way of trade to our neighbours in the North.  In the long run, in this way, it may dawn on the silent majority that, after all, this is the best course to adopt.</P>
    <P>I shall leave dealing with the Minister's opening remarks until last.  Very briefly, I note that the scope of the activities of his Department has increased rapidly in the last couple of years.  Those of us in politics know this very well.  We know of the responsibility <Col N="1180" /> and extra work thrown on the personnel of that Department.  We know also that the coming year will impose an extra strain on the Minister's Department and, even with the help provided, there is no doubt that it will be a difficult assignment.  We have to take over the office of presidency of the Community for, is it, six months or the year?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Harte</NameTxt>
      <P>Most Deputies contributing to this debate have dealt with EEC conditions.  Others have confined themselves to the North of Ireland problem.  Some have dealt with both. I do not propose to speak at all on anything other than our relationship with Northern Ireland.  Therefore, I should be obliged if I might be allowed express views which I expressed in the past and make some comments on things that have happened since Northern Ireland was last debated in this House.  I cannot understand why informed public representatives, even after four years of total conflict in Northern Ireland, still rant the old catch phrases of: &ldquo;Get the British out; withdraw the subsidies and let Britain declare her intention to withdraw&rdquo;.  These were, and perhaps still are, quite popular with people who are removed from the scene of conflict in Northern Ireland; they are deeply-held views of people who have not been forced to re-think the position, or who are not in the front-line of battle in the North of Ireland.  I forgive those people but I cannot accept that those who should be informed can continue to rant this kind of nonsense because unless I misjudge the situation it has never been the problem and certainly is not the problem now.</P>
      <P>If the British Government tomorrow morning were to agree to these demands, a civil war would take place in the North of Ireland and I do not wish to contemplate the dimensions of such a catastrophe.  I do not want the British Army to stay in Northern Ireland for one hour longer than we can afford but the simplistic approach of asking them to withdraw immediately is typical of that which has bedevilled Irishmen not only of this generation but for the past 150 years.  This approach is that all our troubles would be solved if we could get John Bull to take out the troops, to withdraw subsidies and to declare that they have no longer any interest in the six north-eastern counties.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Do those people who are mad <Col N="1182" /> enough to preach this gospel not understand that the Loyalist community in the North have almost total control over all the services that provide for the care and upkeep of the people in that area?  They control ambulances, fire-fighting units, water supplies, sewerage services, hospitals, petrol, electricity, radio and television. If the British Government were to withdraw tomorrow, as demanded by people like my colleague and friend from North-East Donegal, Deputy Blaney, does anyone think that madmen&mdash;and they are to be found in every society&mdash;who will come to the top and preach violence from a Loyalist platform could not use these forces to cut off every supply from the minority in the North of Ireland?.</P>
    <P>That is the reality of the situation. Unless we understand that and unless we are prepared to compromise honourably on basic fundamental beliefs that we have held so dear as a nation for two, three or four generations, this trouble will never end. Those who speak loudly about their theories of republicanism and nationalism are condemning innocent people on the front-line of battle, in the streets of Belfast, to sudden and violent deaths.  On the shoulders of the politicians who refuse to lead towards this honourable compromise must remain a certain amount of responsibility for not fulfilling the obligations vested in them by the Irish people who elected them to this Parliament.  So far as vote-catching is concerned, it is very nice having the glory of topping the poll or having the mob running after one and shouting one's name.  However, it serves no purpose after the election other than the selfpride of claiming that one has a better policy than those who tried to preach moderation.</P>
    <P>I do not wish to say publicly some of the things of which I have been made aware during my visits to Northern Ireland, but I can say publicly and with conviction that there are people on both sides who realise they have a problem and that they have an obligation and duty to try to solve it.  They also realise if they travel too fast they can leave behind <Col N="1183" /> the massive support which it is necessary to bring with them in order to succeed in any settlement.</P>
    <P>When I was an Opposition Deputy I found it almost impossible at times to relate my thoughts to the vast majority of the members of Fianna Fáil who were then in Government. I must say there were members of the Cabinet and the former Taoiseach who had an attentive ear and who could listen, and there were members of the Fianna Fáil backbenches who had an attentive ear and listened. However, there were members of that party who did not give full consent at that time to a movement towards mutual settlement in the North of Ireland and I want publicly to admit that at the moment I believe there is a similar situation within the ranks of Fianna Fáil.</P>
    <P>When I look across at them I wonder if it is their fault or whether in some peculiar way the present Government may find they are not doing enough to open up the avenues of possibility on this terrible problem, to assist people in the Opposition to come on a neutral front to help make a contribution towards a peaceful settlement in the North.  By that I mean that as a Parliament and a people we are inclined to wish away the things we do not like in the Northern scene.  We talk about power-sharing, of the Irish dimension and the Council of Ireland.  We make loud noises about matters over which we have no direct control.  All we can do is hope that something will happen up there; all we can do is speak with our friends and try to communicate with those who hold different political views.</P>
    <P>That is basically the total contribution that the people south of the Border can make at the moment.  We cannot get involved in Northern politics to the extent that we would have control over things we would like to see happening.  However, with regard to matters over which we have control in the South, we have done nothing about them.  When people north of the Border who oppose our way of life point the finger of scorn <Col N="1184" /> and accusation we cannot totally dismiss the accusation without questioning if we have been inadequate in some way in not meeting the demands of our people.</P>
    <P>I am conscious of the fact that if I embark on a particular aspect I have been preaching for the last two or three years I may be misunderstood. However, those who want to misunderstand me are free to do so but I want to assure the House, the Government and the Opposition that I speak for the noblest of reasons.  I sincerely believe that unless we, as a Parliament, agree on certain basic fundamental issues, on a clearly stated bipartisan agreement, we will not be fulfilling the obligations elected representatives are expected to fulfil.</P>
    <P>There are basic differences between the Government and the Opposition and it will be difficult for either side to meet at a given point.  In this regard the two most contentious points at present are enshrined in our Constitution, namely, Articles 2 and 3.  If we preach about co-operation and power-sharing in the North and if we believe firmly in what we are saying, it is not too much to say to this Parliament that we must be prepared to have a total bipartisanship agreement on our approach to Northern Ireland.  As an Opposition Deputy I found it difficult to understand why the Government of the day were not letting the Opposition know enough in regard to the everyday affairs of Northern Ireland.  Perhaps there were times when I accused the then Government unfairly but I did so believing that my criticism was justified.  From conversations I have had with members of Fianna Fáil I am aware that their attitude towards us now is similar to what my attitude was in making those accusations against them.  I appeal to the Government to re-think this question of bipartisanship and I appeal to the Opposition to rise to the occasion and, first, to bury the differences that are within Fianna Fáil and, secondly, to be more statesman-like in respect of the Government approach to Northern Ireland.</P>
    <P>It may not be strictly within the <Col N="1185" /> terms of this debate to speak of a new Constitution but that question forms part and parcel of our relationship with Northern Ireland and also of the British approach to the North. When we talk of a new Constitution let not some members of Fianna Fáil forget that the first serious attempt to change our Constitution was made by the late Seán Lemass, as Taoiseach, and that the second attempt was made by Deputy Lynch during his period as Taoiseach.  We are continuing in our efforts in that direction but let us not forget that the type of Constitution we need must be one which, if we want to make a contribution towards a new Ireland, or an Ireland that will be united, whether politically or in thought among the people, must be generous and which will be pluralist in every respect.  Let no one throw up his hands in horror and say that a pluralist society is a secular society because a pluralist society can be, basically, a very Christian society.  If it were anything other than a Christian society, I would not be advocating it.  Let us not become involved in argument as to whether we are letting down our noble dead by changing Articles of the Constitution which pay tribute to them.  Let us stop preaching to the tombstones in Glasnevin and in the other cemeteries in which our noble dead are buried.  Those people have made their contribution to Ireland but the contribution which we must make is to the people who are alive and our efforts must be aimed at preventing the further loss of lives in the northern part of this State.</P>
    <P>Therefore, I appeal to the Fianna Fáil Party in general to be more open in their views and I appeal to the Government again to re-think their attitude to bipartisanship, to avoid the areas of contention which divide them and the Opposition and to try to find more common ground which will allow us to progress along a path of reconciliation for the North.  We continue to utter pious platitudes but we can make no contribution to the northern problem unless we are prepared to deal with those matters in the South that are calling out for attention.  If we fail in that regard <Col N="1186" /> any efforts made by way of public utterances or otherwise will be seen by Northern observers and, indeed, Southern society to be hypocritical.</P>
    <P>We have few alternatives in so far as the North is concerned.  I was a disciple of the Sunningdale Agreement and the only complaint I had in regard to it was that, perhaps, it was too ambitious.  Not only did it meet all the demands that I would make in regard to it but it went somewhat further and this perhaps was its weakness.  However, Sunningdale is of the past but there are alternatives. We can have a UDI declared by the Loyalists; we can have negotiated independence by both communities in the North; we can have power-sharing; we can have union with Great Britain with majority rule as was the case under the old Stormont; we can have direct rule from Westminster or we can have total anarchy.  Those Loyalists in the North who believe that UDI would settle their problem are only offering the minority street politics.  They are only offering the minority the status of second-class citizens.  We know from experience and they must understand that UDI cannot work.</P>
    <P>If negotiated independence would comprise the consent of both communities in the North, this Parliament will have to recognise that there could be a united Ireland or a new Ireland not, perhaps, under one Parliament but under two Parliaments.  That is something that this Parliament may have to consider in the future.</P>
    <P>I agree with the concept of power-sharing. It is my belief that the Northern community would be more willing to give their consent to power-sharing than to any of the other possibilities that I have mentioned.  I say this because, despite what many people, including some leaders of the Loyalist population may say, I do not think that the Ulster Workers' strike in March of this year was against the concept of power-sharing.  Rather, I am convinced that it was more anti-Executive and anti-Council of Ireland. My reason for this belief is that in June, 1973, there was put before the community in Northern Ireland the British White Paper on a new Constitution <Col N="1187" /> for that part of this island and that at that time all the groups, political or otherwise, representing the various sectors put forward candidates for election.  It is estimated that at least 60 per cent of those elected to the Assembly believed in and supported the concept of power-sharing. These Assembly members represented a very basic thinking of the Northern community.</P>
    <P>I am convinced, too, that the Northern Loyalists or Unionists or the Northern person who does not wish to join the society in the South is as fair-minded in his approach to a fair settlement as we can claim to be. These people have the same right to commonsense as has any Member of this House.  I am convinced that if there were a fair basis for settlement the Northern community would not reject power-sharing as a system of administration in that part of the country.</P>
    <P>Under the old Stormont administration the situation of union with Great Britain but with majority rule failed and can never be restored successfully. Direct rule, which is the system in operation at the moment, is acceptable neither to the Northern Loyalists nor to the Northern Nationalists.  Therefore it is only an interim measure put forward by the British Government.  I believe, as Deputy Carter has just said, that the British Government are not doing enough at the moment to find a solution to the problems of the North. It may be, having said that, that in the South we have lost the initiative&mdash;if we ever had it.  I am not at all satisfied that the British Government at the moment, whatever the reason is, are doing enough to cool the situation in the North.  After what happened in Long Kesh yesterday one would not have to elaborate on that point of view to prove the point.</P>
    <P>The alternative to a settlement which does not meet with the consent of the vast majority of people in the North, the wide spectrum of public opinion, will not succeed.  The only alternative to that is total anarchy with lives being lost, property destroyed and other matters, which are not alone crying out <Col N="1188" /> for attention in the North but demanding attention throughout the entire 32 Counties, being left unattended. We know the amount of destruction that has taken place in the North, the lack of services that could be provided for the underprivileged, such as physically and mentally handicapped people and the housing needed to rehouse people.  The amount of money that has been lost through wanton destruction is alarming.  We think of how that money could be properly spent and the type of society we could have in this island if we could only find the solution.</P>
    <P>We cannot find a solution by drumming out the old war cries and slogans of the past.  We must acknowledge the fact that there are people North of the Border who do not want to join us and are not even interested in talking to us about a settlement.  That is the position. Whether you withdraw the British troops and British subsidy or get them to declare their intention to withdraw, it will not alter the fact that you are left with the problem of having two communities living in this island &mdash;basically the Northern Loyalists and the Southern Republicans, for want of a better description&mdash;whose ways of life are alien to each other. The Northern Protestants believe they are threatened.  They believe that because we are the majority we are all the time conniving between each other, scheming to undermine them and to overrun them at some future date.  That is the fear of Northern Loyalists among other fears they have.</P>
    <P>I know, members of the Government Parties know and members of the Opposition know that, if we were to have a settlement with this Northern community and if we were to be over-generous in our approach to a settlement, even that would be suspect.  We must prove to those people that we do not want to undermine them.  Deputy Blaney spoke about a low profile.  That to me means that we must prove to the people north of the Border that we can build a society south of the Border which they will want to join or a society which, at least, if they do not want <Col N="1189" /> to join it they can stand back and quietly admire it.  This is what I understand to be a low profile.  If you talk about any other aspect of our relationship with Northern Ireland you are talking about involvement. If we get involved we do not have to tell our next door neighbour what side we would take in the event of a civil war.</P>
    <P>I remember in one of the early speeches I made in 1969 on the Northern Ireland problem I said that basically in this island there were 2 per cent of our people who were destructive, violent and who had hatred in their hearts but that that 2 per cent had it in their power to draw battle lines and that when those battle lines were drawn those on each side would opt for the side into which they were born.  The situation is still the same.  The figure has never gone much above 2 per cent.  I hope it has gone slightly below it now.  That 2 per cent of our society, both north and south of the Border, still have the power to draw battle lines and still can force people to take sides. They can still leave us with an opportunity of criticising people who become involved.</P>
    <P>I come from the Northern part of the country.  I know many people just across the Border and very close to the Border on the Donegal side who have relations in the north of Ireland.  They are emotionally involved.  I know what it is to try and communicate with people who are emotionally involved.  When people refer to gunmen as murderers I do not dismiss them and call them total anarchists or murderers in the sense I understand murder to mean. I admit they have broken the Fifth Commandment and I do not know what way I would accept them into my community if the life of any of my children was taken by one of them.  Nevertheless we must not fail to recognise that they are a product of our society.</P>
    <P>Whether we believe it individually or not, collectively each of us shares a certain responsibility for not finding answers to this problem before now. We have allowed a situation to develop <Col N="1190" /> in the North, and perhaps to a degree in the South, where people have taken up polarised positions; and whether this is because of something which has been taught to them in their homes, schools or history books or through religious teaching, collectively as a society we must accept some responsibility for not seeking out the answers to this problem.  I speak here of all people in the South whether from the Fine Gael Party, the Labour Party, the Fianna Fáil Party or those who do not support any of those parties, and I include every section of society North of the Border.  Unless the politicians in the South&mdash;their task is not that difficult&mdash;and particularly the politicians in the North lead to a central position I will never understand if history does not condemn these people.  Historians will dismiss them as demi gods, anarchists and people who failed to do something about the problems people voted for them to attend to.</P>
    <P>Britain is not the problem in the North of Ireland at the moment.  In saying that I am conscious of the fact that Britain is very much responsible for many of the things that have happened there, because I believe Britain neglected Northern Ireland for 50 years.  They accepted certain information from one section of the community in Northern Ireland without inquiring if it was the proper advice or wrongly based advice.  I am now satisfied they understand the problem in Northern Ireland, that they listen to reason from Northern Ireland, and that they want to get out of Northern Ireland.  Up to now they might have left Northern Ireland with honour, but they may now decide to leave it in disgrace. If they do, the people shouting loudest at the moment to get the British out may find, as a Catholic priest in Belfast said to me recently, that the Catholic people may drop on their knees in the streets of Belfast to pray for the British to stay a while longer to prevent a holocaust that could occur if people lost their heads.</P>
    <P>Those who claim that if the British get out we can solve the problem ourselves are really saying that we cannot find a solution now but if we <Col N="1191" /> could get rid of the British we could sit down and talk to Northern society. They are really saying that it is easier to find a solution when people start fighting with each other in civil war conditions than it is when the British Army stand between the two communities. Let us persuade, for the purest of reasons, both communities in the North to work out a solution which we in the South can honour.</P>
    <P>I know accusations have been made against the British Army and I know that members of that army have carried out atrocious acts in the North; but such is the situation that when we think of that we must also think that when university students rioted in America a few years ago the US National Guard was called out and national guardsmen shot dead members of that student movement. It could happen even if we had our own Irish Army policing a situation. Where you have loaded guns and men trained to use them inevitably you will have conflicts which will end in death.</P>
    <P>I might be somewhat generous in making these remarks regarding the British Army.  I might be accused by people who do not want to think this way of being white-livered and not living up to my responsibilities.  I am merely trying to see the human aspect of what happens when an armed soldier in a riot situation, not understanding what it is all about&mdash;some of these soldiers who have come across here are only boys&mdash;not knowing who is friend or foe and having to take action without deep thought.  I can feel justified in my accusation that they have been more ruthless with the minority in Northern Ireland than with the Loyalists.  Anybody who ignores that position or ducks out of it is not recognising facts; but it is fair to say that, no matter what army has the civilian task of trying to keep the peace, trying to do a job an army was never meant to do, we must realise that is a situation in which people may be killed.</P>
    <P>I mention this to strike a note of urgency in the minds of Deputies of all parties, and particularly in the minds of members of the Government, <Col N="1192" /> because every effort must be made to communicate with every level of society north of the Border.  Some members of the community have said that we have been speaking to gunmen; but I believe that if you disagree with a section of a community and you want to come to terms with that section, the choices are few.  You can shoot them&mdash;eliminate them altogether&mdash;you can lock them up or we can talk to them.  Perhaps, like others, I have made the mistake of speaking at people rather than to people.  There are certain difficulties in communicating with people like this, and perhaps the Press may not be as generous as they should be, but unless we can get the people who pull the triggers to stop pulling triggers we are left with the problem.  The only way you can persuade people to stop pulling triggers is to eliminate them by execution, to lock them up or to talk reason with them.  I opt totally for the last course because the other two have never worked and never will.</P>
    <P>If any single action can be blamed for the holocaust that has taken place in Northern Ireland in the last five years nothing can equal the responsibility carried by the act of internment. In the recent past I have spoken to people who have been interned. One man told me he was interned for two years and did not know why.  The other was interned for over two and a half years.  The only thing he could admit was that he had Republican sympathies but he was not involved in violence nor did he subscribe to violence.  I need not tell the House how these men now react.</P>
    <P>Internment can never be justified but, having said that, as a public representative I believe that my responsibilities are greater to the community than to an individual.  I support the ending of internment but I make this appeal to those who are more likely to be interned than others: internment cannot be ended unless violence stops.  Deputy Blaney made a point this evening on which I take issue with him but which is hard to explain to the children or the wife of a man who is interned: whether he is behind bars as a result <Col N="1193" /> of a special criminal court case or lifted by soldiers from his own home and locked up, the fact remains that his movements are confined and his family upset.</P>
    <P>I want to see a situation where we will not have internment or detention or special courts and I want to support the Government that will end these things.  But we must be realistic. Unless those who are involved at the opposite end are prepared to cease violent activities and become politically motivated, we cannot end internment.  If Mr. Rees were to open the gates of Long Kesh tomorrow morning and release all the internees, unless the violence ceased he would be forced either to rearrest people under the Special Powers Act or have them tried before military courts on suspicion and you are still left with the problem.</P>
    <P>I do not have to labour the point.  I hope the Press will convey my views to the Loyalist section who are violent and to the Republican section who are violent that without their co-operation internment, whether in the form of detention without trial or jailing through the Special Powers Act, cannot be ended.  By co-operation I mean that they would become less violent and more constitutional in their outlook.  At times the Loyalists may point to the South and say that in any further settlement there should be no &ldquo;Irish dimension&rdquo;.  Maybe this title is somewhat offensive to them and we might try to think of some other title such as &ldquo;Anglo-Irish dimension&rdquo; or &ldquo;North-South Agreement&rdquo; which would be less offensive to that community.  But whatever it is called, the fact remains that there must be some type of co-operation between North and South.</P>
    <P>I give the example of the Foyle Fisheries Commission as having an Irish dimension.  The Electricity Supply Board and the Northern Ireland Electrical Board are another example of an Irish dimension. Under EEC regulations the customs barriers between North and South will be removed and in such a situation Donegal would be a hinterland for the commercial life of Derry city, <Col N="1194" /> and that would be an Irish dimension. The tourist boards North and South who work in co-operation and who sell the idea of more southern people going North and more northern people coming South are a further example.</P>
    <P>One of the points which is supposed to have precipitated the Loyalist strike was what was described as the Irish dimension in the Sunningdale Agreement.  They understood it to mean another step on the road to a united Ireland and they were against it.  I would like to say to that community&mdash;and no doubt some of my remarks will get there&mdash;that an Irish dimension means something completely different to me.  It means a mutual understanding between North and South.  It means a harmonising of laws North and South, whereby we could have complete harmony between North and South without the southern community using a threat to take over the Northern community and browbeat them into a way of life for which they have never shown any enthusiasm.</P>
    <P>The other aspect of the Sunningdale Agreement to which the Northern community objected was the Council of Ireland.  As one of the Members of this House who first floated the idea of a Council of Ireland after it had lain dormant for 50 years, my understanding of a Council of Ireland at the time was that it would be nothing more than a waffle shop where members of both Parliaments could meet, exchange views and consider matters of mutual concern and interest, and having listened to each other, they would report back to their respective Ministers to have the matters attended to. At the outset I said the Sunningdale Agreement was a little more ambitious than I expected it to be.  I am satisfied that the Council of Ireland could serve a useful purpose without being objectionable to the Northern community.  It could be a structure involving a Northern and Southern parliament.  This would enable the Northern and Southern communities through the committees that would be appointed by both parliaments, to meet and exchange views.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1195" /> The myths of republicanism and nationalism are surely being exposed at the moment.  The myth of loyalism and unionism has just about the same meaning.  Republicanism and nationalism meant different things to me as a growing boy than they mean to me now.  I hope that people who have been brought up in a Portestant atmosphere, born into a unionist tradition, will have rethought what unionism and loyalism mean to them.  If I do not have the right to provide for my wife and family, if I do not have the right to have friendship with my neighbours and to live on this island as a Christian and communicate and make friends with people, then nationalism and republicanism are completely meaningless to me.  If the loyalist person does not have the same right to live in Northern Ireland, then loyalism and unionism are completely meaningless.  They are myths which, unfortunately, successful politicians have portrayed with a different image for their own ends.  Innocent people have paid the price.  Families have been destroyed because some member of their family has lost his or her life.  Families have been destroyed even without losing a member of the family because they are unable to live as Christians in the North of Ireland. People cannot walk the streets of Belfast at night.  Young people cannot move freely from cinema to dance-hall. They are confined to socialising in each others homes.  If there is any value on social activities and if there is any value on the things I speak about, there is an obligation on politicians to find common ground, to have a complete reformation of political thinking north of the Border.</P>
    <P>In a conversation with a member of the loyalist community in the north of Ireland recently I asked him what did union with Britain mean to all the British soldiers who had been killed since the trouble started in the North of Ireland?  What did loyalism mean to the Protestant people who lost their lives during the strife?  And what did republicanism mean to the Catholics who are now dead?  His <Col N="1196" /> reply was something along these lines: loyalists in the North of Ireland would willingly lay down their lives to create a better Ulster for themselves and their families.  That man really believed it until I asked him the next question.  I was in his home and I had met his wife and family, and his wife had just served us with tea and left the room.  I said: &ldquo;I have just met your wife and family.  Are you telling me that if I shot you dead now your wife and family would have a better Ulster to live in?  I hope he saw the point I was making.  As far as I am concerned, I hope my family would think more of me.</P>

      <NameTxt>Parliamentary Secretary to the Taoiseach (Mr. Kelly)</NameTxt>
      <P>I listened to the speeches of the Minister and of the Opposition spokesman with very great interest.  I would like to congratulate both the Minister and the Opposition spokesman, Deputy O'Kennedy, on extremely good contributions here yesterday.</P>
      <P>I will have a good deal to say about the North of Ireland and about our policies or what the Opposition believe is our lack of policy towards it, also about our relations with Britain.  But I should like to begin, if I may, as the Minister is here, by saying something about a quite different subject, namely the subject of human rights in the world at large, in no way with special reference to the North of Ireland.  The Minister spoke in connection with Greece, Portugal, South Africa, Rhodesia and Chile, of the tremors in the political crust of the world, of the volcanoes which either had erupted or were clearly due to erupt.  Those tremors and eruptions very obviously have human rights dimensions.  The Minister is rightly concerned with them.  I do not think I am being unjust to any of his predecessors when I say that he has evidenced, since he became Minister, a more active and energetic concern for human rights in distant countries that any Minister of any side in this State before.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is just one thing I should like to say.  I know the Minister <Col N="1197" /> knows my admiration for him and my very deep and genuine respect for him and that he, therefore, will not take these words as being in any way meant in a critical sense but only meant as a footnote to some of the things which he said yesterday.</P>
    <P>He referred in the latter stages of his speech to the democratic systems which, in recent years, have been overthrown in various countries and replaced, as he very fairly said, by dictatorships of the right or of the left.  He said, with an optimism which I hope events in Greece and Portugal will turn out to have justified, that the suppression of liberty and its replacement by dictatorship is not a one-way process, that dictatorships have to contend with the human spirit, that they can never leave it out of the reckoning and are always at the risk that it will rise up and strike them down.  It is perfectly true that the military dictatorship in Greece and the somewhat more civilianised dictatorship in Portugal have been shattered. What is going to emerge in the heel of the hunt from these developments I think it is too early to say.  There are people who are very doubtful and have expressed very serious misgivings about the likely outcome of events in Portugal certainly, possibly even in Greece.</P>
    <P>It seems that the subversion of liberty by a dictatorship and the abolition of parliamentary democracy by a dictatorial system, in spite of the Minister's very fair reference both to the right and to the left, is much commoner in one direction than in the other.  Speaking roughly from memory I can only think of one instance in which an avowedly Marxist régime was subverted from within and turned into a régime of the right, and that was the instance of Chile, which was a régime in which the presidential power had been democratically conferred on the late president; and the Minister expressed very properly his sense of scandal and outrage that this democratically elected president should have been pulled down by militarists who have put what is very evidently an extremely cruel and brutal régime in his place. <Col N="1198" /> The régime of the late president of Chile was remarkable not only for the fact that it was the only Marxist presidency that I can think of which was the result of a democratic election but also in so far as the Chilean president did not attempt to destroy the legislature on which he in part depended, nor did he control that legislature.  In other words, he permitted, so far as I can judge it at the distance of 15,000 miles and without pretending to be a very close student of foreign politics, and did not deprive his people of the institutions to which the people had been previously accustomed.  His proceedings were in very sharp contrast to the proceedings of most Marxist authoritarians once they make themselves masters of a country.</P>
    <P>I do not want to sound cynical. I think it is an extremely sad reflection on what are supposed to be Christian countries, but in a sense, if I were a Marxist activist I would have learned a very bitter lesson from the life and death of President Allende.  I would say to myself, looking at his history, &ldquo;if you want to survive, having got yourself democratically elected, repress democracy and repress the institutions you find when you arrive because if you leave any breathing space at all, the forces of reaction will rise and crush you by hook or by crook&rdquo;.  That is what apparently happened in Chile.  I will not offer the House a judgment on it, but the experts say there is no question but that President Allende made very serious mistakes in the economic field and that he may, in some degree, have been the author of his own misfortune, but he remains the only instance of Marxist head of state who was democratically elected, who made an effort to maintain democratic institutions once elected, and who was submerged by the waves of reaction. Every other Marxist régime that has emerged since the &ldquo;glorious revolution&rdquo; of October, 1917, has not only succeeded in defending itself against the forces of reaction but has repressed every other force as well, including social democracy.</P>
    <P>While I recognise entirely and very <Col N="1199" /> much admire the Minister's anxiety to redress the balance of sympathy which in this country in the forties, fifties and, I suppose, even the sixties was too heavily on the side of authoritarian regimes of the Right, and while I think he is perfectly correct in doing so, I think I ought to add, as a footnote to his speech, that freedom, in the sense we understand it, the freedom which allows me to speak my mind and which allows Deputy Carter opposite to sit there patiently knowing that he will be entitled to speak and that the time will come when the two of us, I hope, will stand before the electorate, that kind of freedom and all the ancillary freedoms that go with it&mdash;of the Press, of speech, of association, of the person&mdash;&mdash;simply do not exist for most people on the face of this earth. That is the sad truth; and we in western Europe are somewhat spoiled &mdash;&mdash;even in western Europe freedom does not exist everywhere&mdash;&mdash;by comparison with other people in enjoying it.</P>
    <P>It is true that in the fifties&mdash;&mdash;I single out that decade only because it was for me the first decade of adulthood; I have no doubt it was the same in the thirties and forties&mdash;&mdash;the emphasis here was exclusively against dictatorships of the Left.  I can recall, as other Members here can, the parades in Dublin demonstrating against the imprisonment of the Hungarian Cardinal Mindszenty on charges the trial of which was disgraced by the very evident fact that he had been drugged or bullied into making admissions. I can recall the indignation here at the treatment of Archbishop Stepinac, even though the question of drugs did not arise in his case, and even though in his case he had the misfortune to belong to the Croatian people who had, for reasons good or bad, been somewhat identified with the German occupation of Jugoslavia throughout the war.</P>
    <P>I can recall the intense indignation which these incidents produced here among a very largely Catholic people and in that indignation the fact that if one happened to be a Spanish Socialist or a Portuguese Communist <Col N="1200" /> one was very likely to be either in jail or in exile was forgotten or ignored.  I think the Minister is quite right to try to redress that balance. However, I should like to sound a friendly warning, not to him&mdash;&mdash;naturally I would not presume to do such a thing&mdash;&mdash;but to the House and, if it does not seem too pompous to say so, to the country, against falling overboard in condemnation of authoritarian regimes which are of the Right. The Minister singled out South Africa and Rhodesia and now Chile, the latter with great justification: by all accounts it is a most brutal regime, of a most savage variety, which has apparently murdered hundreds if not thousands of people without charge, trial or anything else.  That seems to be pretty well admitted even by people who have no special admiration or regard for the Marxist regime which preceded it.</P>
    <P>It is only right to remember that the world is full of regimes about which very little is heard, because very little is allowed to be heard about them, in which the ordinary citizen is not allowed to form a political party of his own choosing, is not allowed to organise meetings to discuss matters of his own choosing; is not allowed either to read or to write papers or any published material of his own choosing, and is never given the opportunity to elect his rulers.  Though I do not expect the Minister to present the House with a litany or catalogue of authoritarian States&mdash;&mdash;it would take him the best part of the evening to do so&mdash;&mdash;and though I know perfectly well that there is no man in Dáil Éireann more conscious than he is of the existence of those conditions, it is only fair to say for the benefit of the people to whom the Press have access that the most vocal protests in my experience in recent years have been against the states which are authoritarian on the Right and that very little is now heard &mdash;&mdash;in very strong contrast to the situation that existed 20 years ago&mdash;&mdash;about states which are authoritarian on the Left.</P>
    <P>We are familiar with the Anti-Apartheid Movement, of whose objectives I approve.  We are familiar with <Col N="1201" /> protests against the late regime in Greece, but nothing now is heard about the kind of regime which was a common object of justified scorn in the fifties.  Take a country, for example, like Cuba.  The Cubans certainly were oppressed by an extremely brutal and dirty regime under ex-sergeant Batista.  There is no question about that whatever; but that regime was replaced about 13 or 14 years ago by one which has not yet given the Cuban people a chance to cast a vote. Not only that, but when Dr. Castro got into power he held trials of his political opponents&mdash;&mdash;many of them, no doubt, very nasty, brutal people&mdash;&mdash; in football stadiums under floodlights and then shot them by the hundred in trenches under television cameras and allowed that to be shown around the world.</P>
    <P>That is how this hero of the Third World behaved in 1961 or 1962&mdash;&mdash;I will not vouch for the exact date.  I have not forgotten that and I refuse to be blinded by demonstrations about the evils committed in the name of the Right&mdash;&mdash;evil is undoubtedly committed and savageries are committed in the name of the Right&mdash;&mdash;but I refuse to be blinded to the evils committed by those of the Left, who tend in this world, for reasons which I will not explore&mdash;&mdash;and which if I tried to explore would most certainly make me enemies among people whom I must conciliate&mdash;&mdash;to be supplanted as popular ogres by the ogres of the Right.</P>
    <P>The Irish people are very fortunate in having had during the last 52 years a democratic polity.  I do not regard myself as being beholden to the other side for that.  Fianna Fáil have been in power for most of my life.  I do not regard myself as being obliged to thank them for having maintained a good standard of human rights here, because I feel the Irish people are entitled to no less.  But I recognise that, even in times which were difficult for the party now in Opposition, an effort was made, very largely a successful effort, to maintain those rights.  I recognise also that the judicial arm of the State, when it asserted these rights, was with only trivial <Col N="1202" /> exceptions not interfered with.  I recognise these things gladly.  I do not thank anybody for them because a free Irish citizen is entitled to no less, I recognise them, and I think that we as a people, whether our inclinations are to the Right or the Left, must recognise the benefits that have been conferred on us.</P>
    <P>We are a member of a very small club in western Europe who are very highly politically privileged, apart from whatever economic privileges we enjoy which, even in a country of the relative poverty of Ireland, are considerable. We are politically very privileged in being able to speak our minds without fear from the State.</P>
    <P>I am sorry to say that whether the liberty to speak our minds without fear from persons other than the State still exists, or will continue to exist, is a more dubious thing now than it was five years ago.  But so far as the State is concerned we can speak our minds without fear of a knock on the door at 2 o'clock in the morning because we have spoken out of turn. That is something that we need not thank anybody else for&mdash;&mdash;we deserve no less&mdash;&mdash;but we are a very privileged small people who belong to a very privileged small club in enjoying these freedoms.  That should make us all the more fierce in defending them, and also in trying to extend by persuasion the benefits of these freedoms to the countries with which we come in diplomatic contact.</P>
    <P>The Minister very rightly, honestly and honourably, mentioned the relative smallness of this little club in the particular context of the European Human Rights Court and Commission. He said the Strasbourg cases were examples of a process which is unique in the world, a process whereby any human being, no matter what his nationality, can complain in Strasbourg against any State which is a signatory to the clause in the European Human Rights Convention submitting to a jurisdiction and based on an alleged infraction of human rights.  But the Minister went on to say, and it is quite true, that the fact is that many countries outside Western Europe still reject the concept of <Col N="1203" /> human rights transcending national sovereignty.  I think I would have left out those last three words.  I quite agree they are apposite in the context in which the Minister used them and essential to the logic of the particular paragraph, but the fact is that, not alone do many countries outside Western Europe reject the concept of human rights transcending national sovereignty, but they reject the concept of human rights&mdash;&mdash;full stop.  It is not simply that a Bulgarian, or a Czech, or a Pole, or a Hungarian has no international court to which he can have recourse if he is refused permission to leave his own territory, publish his political views, or form a political party; it is not alone that he has not got an international court to which he can have recourse, but there is just nowhere at all to which he can have recourse inside or outside his own territory.</P>
    <P>I do not want to labour this point. The Minister has put immense effort and immense sincerity and energy, as everybody knows, into every job he has ever had; his present post is the most important he has ever held and his performance is the most brilliant example of the talents he has got.  I hope he will not take these comments as in any way detracting from the force of what he was saying; they are most certainly not intended in that way.  I use the Minister's speech merely as a launching pad for these observations; and I am sorry to have to say this, but I detect in the world around me an inclination which is undoubtedly sustained by points of view which are, perhaps, over-represented, statistically speaking, among the media compared with their representation among ordinary people, and that inclination is to give a blacker eye to tyranny, if it comes from the Right, than if it comes from the Left.</P>
    <P>In my view, that is double thinking. It is a double standard, and I am sure the Minister rejects it.  But it is important to keep saying it, because in the elation of finding a regime like that of Portugal or Greece swept away, one tends to forget that there are many other regimes, with some <Col N="1204" /> of which we are in diplomatic contact, with some of which we are in trade contact, which will never be swept away by the actions of their own people, if past experience is anything to go on, because they have a powerful friend close at hand who will make sure that they are not swept away.</P>
    <P>We had two examples of that in the last 20 years, Hungary and Czechoslovakia. In Czechoslovakia even a moderate degree of liberalisation could not be tolerated; and in Hungary a revolution, much like those in Greece and Portugal, admittedly of a much more radical character, was ruthlessly trampled on by the military forces of a nominally quite separate sovereign state.  I do not want to labour the point.  I know quite well I am pushing an open door so far as the Minister is concerned and also, I believe, where Deputy O'Kennedy is concerned.  I would go so far as to say I am pushing an open door so far as all, or nearly all, of the Members of this House are concerned.</P>
    <P>I think there is a point of view very well represented and strongly defended in the media and also in organisations which are not represented in Parliament which regards a murder committed by the Right as somehow worse than one committed by the Left, which regards a wrongful imprisonment perpetrated by the Right as intrinsically more evil than a wrongful imprisonment committed by the Left, which regards the denial of freedom of speech, or the freedom of the Press, or freedom of association or assembly, if it happens in a country dominated by the Right, as an unspeakable obscenity and a denial of human nature, but is very willing to find excuses for these things when they occur in countries where a red flag flies in some shape or form.  I regard that as a double standard and I reject it.  I know that individual Members, from whatever side they come, unanimously, or as good as unanimously, reject it also.</P>
    <P>This lengthy prelude to what I really want to say in this debate is because I have not heard this point <Col N="1205" /> of view being uttered since I came into this House.  I think it is important to put it on record, for what it is worth, even though I know at this late hour of the night it will get very little coverage.</P>
    <P>It is scarcely worth passing at this hour of the night to the subject of Northern Ireland, but let me mention just one simple incident of a denial &mdash;&mdash;not so much a denial, but a grotesque contempt for human life manifested by people from whom we are geographically not very far distant and with whom, it is true, we have no diplomatic relations and not even any very substantial trade relations, a people who are within two hour's flight from Dublin Airport.  Eastern Germany is divided from Western Germany by a system of walls and barbed wire.  For a certain period it was possible to escape from the east to the west through the open city of Berlin.  During that period it is perfectly true the East Germans lost the cream of their intellect, the cream of their skilled workers and technologists. Now I do not blame any country for taking steps to make sure it is not bled white of the people it desperately needs for either its national or its economic existence.  The East Germans decided they could not allow what was happening to continue, and so they built the Berlin Wall.  If I were a German I would certainly not have liked the look of the wall, but I probably would have tried to find some understanding of it and possibly some excuse.  But this is the point I so seldom hear made by the media who every day of the week are scourges of the regimes of the Right.  Indeed, this is a point I never hear made.</P>
    <P>Let them have their wall, let them have their barbed wire and let them do their best with police guards to prevent people getting over the wall. But let them not shoot to bits a man who succeeds in climbing to the top of the wall or who succeeds in running across a few yards of no-man's-land. That is the thing I find so revolting about that regime.  It is not so much the wall.  It is not so much the attempt to forbid people leaving the particular territory.  There is no question <Col N="1206" /> but that they were suffering intensely from the migration of people in the fifties who were able instantly to command far better standards of living and ten times the real income in Western Germany.  I quite see the point that they might take measures sterner than anything we would take in the way of building walls and being slow to provide exit visas, but to go to the length of machine-gunning a man to bits or allowing him to take the risk of walking on a land mine, that is the length I find so unspeakable. That is the thing I find so horrible.</P>
    <P>If an East German manages to climb a wall, or find his way through a minefield or cut his way through barbed wire, then I say good luck to him.  I certainly could not find it in my heart if I were a border guard to shoot or give an order to shoot.  I am sure in this I speak for most people. We are talking about a man who has not committed any crime except the offence of crossing a frontier which, in Western Europe, is not an offence at all.  That is the kind of contempt for human life which characterises regimes, certainly those of the Right and of the Left, but which is hammered by the loud-mouthed, one-sided critics of tyranny in this country only when it proceeds from the Right.  It is true items of this kind are reported, but I am still waiting to see an association formed here for the reform of the East German criminal law which permits&mdash;&mdash;indeed, requires&mdash;&mdash;a border guard to shoot dead a man for climbing over a wall. That is all I want to say in this part of my speech.  On the next occasion I hope I will be able to move on to problems nearer home.</P>

    <Title>Adjournment Debate: Beef Prices.</Title>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanCrinion" hpid="Mr. Crinion Mr. Crinion">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Crinion</NameTxt>
      <P>Never before has the traditional small farmer in Ireland who is used to breeding his own calves and rearing them up to five, six or seven cwt. had such a bad time, or have prices been so bad.  The Minister realised this and got what I called last night conscience money from the factories of £750,000 to £1 million <Col N="1207" /> towards a fodder fund.  When you analyse that, you see that all they are getting is £15 per small farmer.  That is a pittance and the Government should realise that they need much more.  If the slaughter premium or its equivalent and the intervention equivalent were passed on to the cattle they are selling that would be reasonable.</P>
      <P>I know one small farmer who sold a 6½ cwt heifer last year for £120. This year a 6½ cwt. heifer out of the same cow and, if anything, perhaps, a fraction better than last year's animal, made £55.  The factory price plus the £29.5 would bring it up to £104.  If he got the intervention price for that live animal it would be £117 which would be very close to what he got last year.  The Government should have seen that this was implemented.</P>
      <P>The factories say they have been working to full capacity but they should have been put on shift work. They should have worked three shifts around the clock as any industry with an unlimited market would do.  In this way all the surplus cattle would have been disposed of and the farmers with fat cattle would have got a good price.  They would pass on the price when they were getting the replacements. Those people would buy in younger cattle and the price of cattle would have been practically normal.</P>
      <P>Never before have store cattle made £s per cwt. less than fat cattle.  Young cattle have always made a couple of £s per cwt. more than fat cattle.  The Government have been bungling in regard to the cattle trade.  I pointed out last May on an Adjournment debate that we were running into problems with beef coming on to the market in autumn.  I pointed out that there would be a glut and a rapid fall in prices.  The Minister said everything would be all right but now we see what has happened.  The small farmers along the western seaboard, in the south, and in the midlands have felt the full impact.  In many cases they will never be able to recover from the losses they have suffered this vear.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1208" /> During the period from now until Christmas they will feel the pinch. They have a little money at the moment from what they have sold, but it will run out very quickly.  The man I mentioned who sold the heifer last year for £120 and another for £55 this year is married and has four children going to school.  His commitments are greater than they were last year and he is getting less than half the price.  With inflation at over 20 per cent in the past year how will that man survive?  He has a few more of those cattle and he was depending on selling them.</P>
    <P>Another thing that could have helped&mdash;&mdash;but like everything else it is too little and too late&mdash;&mdash;was giving half the slaughter premium on cattle exported to the EEC countries outside Britain.  It appears that the Government are broke.  The only money they can give the farmers is what they can get from Brussels.  They cannot put anything to it themselves.  It is like the conscience money, the pittance from the meat factories.  The Government have not added anything to it.</P>
    <P>This is a time of national crisis in the cattle industry and for the small farmers.  The Government should ensure that the price from the factories or the intervention price goes right down along the line.  As this was Deputy Callanan's question I should like to give him an opportunity to contribute.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnCallanan" hpid="Mr. Callanan Mr. Callanan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Callanan</NameTxt>
      <P>I did not have this matter raised on the Adjournment to make a political football of it or to make a crack at anybody.  I do not want to rehash last night's debate because the question of the factories and the way they have been carrying on was dealt with effectively last night. The Parliamentary Secretary said that anything that could be done would be done.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I want to emphasise the plight of the man with the small cattle.  He is not getting the slaughter premium and intervention.  The whole thing stops at 7½ cwt.  This is the sad point. Many wealthy people have deep freezes and they are buying in fat calves at £5 a cwt.  They do not <Col N="1209" /> qualify for the slaughter premium. Why should it not be applicable to the fat beast across the board?  As Deputy Crinion said, it was always the case that the smaller beast was dearer per cwt. than the beef beast. Even with the factories not passing it on it should be about £22 but the beef beast is going at £14 or £15 per cwt.  A good calf is going £5 per cwt. and this is appalling.</P>
    <P>I do not wish to put up a case for the sake of embarrassing anybody but I represent people who are hard hit and who will be put out of business if something is not done.  People in my constituency who are not farmers come to me and tell me that we have put up the cost of living on them. They point out that the farmers have the slaughter premium, intervention premium and the green £.  I have pointed out to these people that it would not matter if there were 50 or 60 green £s because the farmers have not seen any of them; the calf man has seen no green £, slaughter premium or intervention premium. Such farmers have to sell at a giveaway price.</P>
    <P>In the <i>Evening Press</i> of this evening there is a heading, &ldquo;Farmers Urged To Switch To Milk&rdquo;.  That story was to the effect that the Parliamentary Secretary had given his blessing to this.  In fairness to the Minister, when the directive came from Europe to tell us to get out of it he said, as I did, that they should stay in it.  The small farmer, however, was told some years ago to go away from milk production but now he is being told to switch back.  How can a farmer switch back to milk?  Every cow that has had suckling calves is a useless beast for milk; she is out completely.  If that man is to go back to milk he has to build up a complete new herd.  Therefore, no farmer can switch overnight. I hope the farmers who can will switch back to milk but it will be a difficult task.</P>
    <P>However.  I would be slow to instruct anybody to go in wholesale for any line of production owing to the sad history of supply and demand. Somebody at that meeting stuck his neck out&mdash;&mdash;I believe it was Mr. O'Neill <Col N="1210" />&mdash;&mdash;and told farmers to go ahead and do it.  He was a brave man after all the prophesies we had down the years to go into various lines of production and then to have them knocked on the head.  None of the premiums I have mentioned apply to the calf.  The position is that the people who can afford to put a calf in the deep freeze are eating the best baby beef that is available but no slaughter premium is being paid on that animal.  In my county at least 30 cattle are slaughtered in the big towns but nobody would have sufficient cattle&mdash;&mdash;the required figure is five&mdash;&mdash;to qualify for the slaughter premium.  The abattoir in Galway, I believe, is the only place where the premium is collected. Inspectors are based in every town but the small butcher does not qualify for the premium with the result that he cannot pass it on to the farmer.  I am not saying that the butchers are not making enough but when they go to the mart to buy a beast they are in competition with the man who is qualifying for the slaughter premium and the intervention premium.</P>
    <P>The Parliamentary Secretary, in reply to a question of mine last week &mdash;&mdash;he included my question with a number of others&mdash;&mdash;stated that a six-month loan was being made available to help farmers to keep animals.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelPatMurphy" hpid="Mr. M.P. Murphy Mr. M.P. Murphy">

      <P>The Parliamentary Secretary included No. 71 in the answer to a number of other questions but he hardly made reference to my question.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanCrinion" hpid="Mr. Crinion Mr. Crinion">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Crinion</NameTxt>
      <P>That is why the Deputy is back tonight with that question.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnCallanan" hpid="Mr. Callanan Mr. Callanan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Callanan</NameTxt>
      <P>No loan will be obtained for a calf that is saleable. Such beasts will be sold no matter what they go at and they are being sold every day at the mart.  The man who cannot sell a calf because of that animal's condition will get the road and the most he can do for six months is keep that animal alive.  That calf will not be saleable within six months to pay the loan and for that reason it <Col N="1211" /> is useless to give him a loan for six months.</P>
      <P>The Government should subsidise feedingstuffs instead of giving the proposed loan.  If people could purchase feedingstuffs at a price per ton they would be better off than obtaining any loan.  Unless something is done a lot of these cattle will die.  I am not saying that these animals are dying already, like others, because I do not believe they are dying but the Galway County Committee of Agriculture informed me that west of the Corrib in Galway 30 per cent of the required feedingstuff is all that is available while east of the Corrib there is between 55 and 60 per cent of the required amount to carry the stock there over the winter.</P>
      <P>I did not raise this question in order to have a crack at anybody but to give some facts to the Parliamentary Secretary.  I cannot understand why these slaughter premiums should only be available to people who kill five cattle.  This is wrong and it means that unless one is in this in a big way one cannot get the premium at all. The calf slaughter premium for the export of live cattle I understand relates to animals of seven-and-a-half cwt.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelPatMurphy" hpid="Mr. M.P. Murphy Mr. M.P. Murphy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M.P. Murphy</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Callanan</NameTxt>
      <P>I hope I am wrong but this has been told to a butcher. With regard to the slaughter premium on cattle going out of the country on foot I understand that it relates to beasts of seven-and-a-half cwt.  I hope I am wrong in this regard also because if we get an export trade for calves they will not qualify for this premium.  I hope the Parliamentary Secretary will outline the position or does anybody care about the farmer rearing calves?</P>

      <NameTxt>Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries (Mr. M.P. Murphy)</NameTxt>
      <P>I accept without reserve the sincerity of Deputy Callanan in raising the subject matter of this question tonight.  For the record the question raised last Thursday read:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1212" /> Mr. Callanan asked the Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries the steps he is taking to ensure that the intervention price and slaughter subsidy is passed on to farmers; and if he will ensure that the factories will take the cattle from the farmers.</P>
    <P>The discussion so far has been very wide of that.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnCallanan" hpid="Mr. Callanan Mr. Callanan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Callanan</NameTxt>
      <P>That was because it was discussed so fully last night.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelPatMurphy" hpid="Mr. M.P. Murphy Mr. M.P. Murphy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M.P. Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Crinion is not a newcomer so far as raising matters on the Adjournment is concerned.  Of course he is entitled to do so.  If I were in Opposition I would probably be raising questions too.  We must examine the Deputy's qualifications to look into the future. I would put much more value on the suggestions and recommendations made by Deputy Callanan than those made by Deputy Crinion.</P>
      <P>I remember that on 6th June last year, when young cattle were making exceptionally good prices, Deputy Crinion, when availing of his 20 minutes here, protested vigorously about what the Government were or were not doing to prevent young cattle leaving the country.  He wanted us to stamp down on the export of young cattle, keep them here, so that next year the prices would soar.  That was against the interests of the economy and Irish agriculturalists.  He claimed that the Department were lackadaisical by not preventing the Irish farmer from selling his cattle when he wanted to.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Deputy also asserted that it was not what the individual farmer thought should count but what he thought.  Deputy Crinion, the expert, said: &ldquo;Don't sell your cattle until I think it is right to do so.&rdquo;  How wrong he was.  No one disagreed with his views that night more than his colleague, Deputy Callanan.  Because of such statements made by Deputy Crinion and other Fianna Fáil Deputies around that time, many people held on to their young stock in the belief that the Deputies were some kind of prophets.  They believed <Col N="1213" /> cattle prices would soar and they would be well remunerated.  They have been proved wrong.  Events have proved that Deputy Crinion was very wide of the mark while Deputy Callanan, who held the opposite view, was on the ball.</P>
    <P>Tonight's question deals with slaughter premiums and interventions. While Deputy Callanan may say that both questions were sufficiently covered in the course of the replies given in the Dáil yesterday and on the Adjournment debate last night, Deputy Crinion asserts that the Government are not putting anything into the payment of slaughter premiums. The premium is made up of £10.78 from FEOGA funds and £10.16 from the Irish taxpayers' pocket.  Therefore there is an obligation on the Government and the Department to see that that money is paid only to the producer or seller of the stock. We were asked how we ascertained if the money was paid.  Payments are made on certification from the meat factories, together with certificates from departmental offices.  The Department also spot-checks occasionally to ensure that everything is in order. Spot-checks are an obligation imposed on us because of our receiving EEC funds and&mdash;&mdash;if I may repeat myself&mdash;&mdash; because £10.16 comes from the Irish taxpayers.  Therefore, it is not true to assert that we do not give financial assistance from national funds.</P>
    <P>This year the number of slaughterings is far in excess of last year.  Factories are working to capacity. According to the latest figures at my disposal, for the week ending 19th October total slaughterings were 30,582 compared with 17,463 for the corresponding period last year.  For the previous week the figure was 29,700 compared with 16,000 for 1973. The week before that the figure was 28,287 against 15,263.  As can be seen, slaughterings are increasing each week.  Because of this increase, it is difficult for factories to accept all offers of cattle.  Deputy Crinion suggested that they work around the clock.  As it is, they are working very long days.  There is only a limited <Col N="1214" /> number of men in each factory.  They cannot employ extra men for a few weeks while the sales are high and dismiss them when the peak is past and sales phase out.  As I said last night, I am satisfied that the peak period has been reached and in the next three of four weeks sales will decline.  According to information supplied by the factories there may come a time when they will be able to take all the cattle offered.</P>

      <P>The person referred to in the Deputy's question has no entitlement to retirement pension on his Irish insurance only, by reason of the fact that he does not satisfy the statutory pension condition which requires a claimant to have entered insurance before <Col N="1074" /> reaching age 55.  He did not become insured under the Irish scheme until 4th June, 1964, when he was already over age 55.</P>
      <P>By reason however of his employment from 1961 to 1963 in the United Kingdom his pension entitlement on a combination of British and Irish insurances is being investigated further under the provisions of the EEC regulations.  Details of his British pension position are necessary before his pension entitlement under these regulations can be finally determined by this Department.  The British authorities have been requested to expedite their examination of the matter and to notify this Department of the result so that the insured person's final position may be established without further delay. Pending final determination of his pension claim the insured person is receiving maximum rate disability benefit in respect of himself and his wife.</P>

    <P>NOTES:</P>
    <P>(1)  The last wage increase (Column 5 above) represents the first phase of the National Agreement 1974 in all cases except Gardeners and Lorry Drivers who received the second phase of that Agreement on 1st July and 1st October, 1974 respectively.</P>
    <P>The substitution arrangement under Clause 3 <i>(f)</i> of the National Agreement 1974 applies as indicated at Column 6 and the amounts shown are payable in four equal instalments commencing on 1st December, 1974 for employees other than lorry drivers whose commencement date is 1st October, 1974.  As the second phase of the 1972 Agreement was applied to the Gardeners prior to 1st April, 1974, the Substitution Clause 3 <i>(f)</i> of the 1974 Agreement does not operate in their case.</P>
    <P>(2)  All employees in the above grades qualify for service pay at the rate of £0.25, £0.50, £0.75 and £1 weekly after 5, 10, 15 and 20 years respectively.</P>
    <P>(3)  The Enginemen at the Munster Institute receives an additional weekly allowance of £0.75 during the heating season.</P>
