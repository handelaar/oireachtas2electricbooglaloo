    <Speaker pid="PatrickJLalor" hpid="Mr. Lalor Mr. Lalor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lalor</NameTxt>
      <P>When the House rose last evening a number of Deputies from this side of the House had been endeavouring to get across the message to the Minister about the danger involved in enabling a clerical officer to be a member of a local authority.  I listened to the Minister say that this was an exercise in local democracy, it was an arrangement whereby people should be given the opportunity of electing a clerical officer if they so wished.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1170" /> It would appear extremely attractive to the man in the street to support the candidature of a clerical officer.  There is no doubt that the elector would see, or could visualise, tremendous advantage, on a personal basis, by having a clerical officer in, say, the health or housing section as his representative at county council level.  I am speaking about a clerical officer, a man or a woman in that category, irrespective of the party he or she would represent.  I am not without experience of membership of local authorities but my experience has been that in the normal course, as a Deputy of this House and as a Minister, I have had occasion to call on or telephone the offices of a county council when, in fact, more than 50 per cent of the time I was conducting my business through a clerical officer. There is no doubt, irrespective of what the Minister may say in relation to the fact that the decision making at County Council level is done by the Manager&mdash;my experience of Urban Councils or Town Commissions is not anything as extensive as that at County Council level&mdash;the more senior officers take the decisions.  Very often, and in fact in most cases, those decisions are taken arising from the background information prepared and supplied by a clerical officer.  It is because of that that we, as a group here &mdash;the Opposition&mdash;are positively opposed to the enabling of a clerical officer becoming a member of a local authority.</P>
    <P>I and my Party feel extremely strongly on this.  We want to see the field for selection of membership to local authorities widened to the greatest possible extent.  But, nonetheless&mdash;and I think Deputy Brennan indicated other aspects of this here last evening&mdash;in cases where one has a situation that the clerical officer, at a Council meeting, as a member of the County Council, makes his case to the chairman of that County Council, he is inhibited in another way; there is a restriction in this regard: he cannot be as openly critical of the County Manager, the County Engineer or the various senior operatives and officers of the County Council as can the ordinary councillor.  Therefore, it <Col N="1171" /> militates against him in that regard. But he does not need to be critical; he has his inside way of trying to get the job done without making the case, as would other councillors, at local authority level.  As well as that, it can create a friction between councillors of the one party.</P>
    <P>We all have experience enough of local government to know that that is an every day risk one takes.  I am standing for the local elections and there is no doubt if I become a councillor and if a colleague on the Fianna Fáil panel, who is a clerical officer and a housing officer in the County Council, also gets elected I feel I am at a disadvantage.  I write a letter to the County Council.  That person is dealing with the correspondence and I know in the scramble for votes from the electors within my area if that person has some good information it will be rushed out to his or her supporters. I have a lot of experience of this.  It is very hard to keep up with a colleague of mine, Deputy Flanagan, and trying to get out good news is not very easy.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickJLalor" hpid="Mr. Lalor Mr. Lalor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lalor</NameTxt>
      <P>I learned in a hard school and I am conscious of the fact that a clerical officer who will write to me this evening or prepare the letter which will be signed by the county secretary giving me a list of six successful applicants for six vacant houses will have an advantage over me.  It is natural for him to write six letters to those people telling them he is pleased to inform them, arising from his representations on their behalf, that they have got the vacant houses.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lalor</NameTxt>
      <P>It is the type of thing we are trying to get away from.  The Minister, when referring to this yesterday, said he had his mind made up, he was standing over this and that this was what he proposed to do.  I am glad that in some instances we have been able to get around this.  Deputy <Col N="1172" /> Molloy has some amendments in for Report Stage which I understand the Minister is willing to accept.  This is the problem of last minute legislation. I believe the Minister sees the logic of the argument on this side of the House in regard to this but that the time factor in order to put in an order is the deterring factor in accepting the logic of that argument.  I ask the Minister, even at this stage, to accept the fact that it will not be beneficial to the structure of local authority and the democratic system on which local authorities are made up to include the clerical officer grade into the local authority scene.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not want to hold up the House but I want to say that the time factor has nothing at all to do with this.  I made a decision that clerical officers should be in.  I gave the reasons on a number of occasions yesterday.  I think every argument that could be made for and against this has been made.  I accept the fact that the Opposition appear to think that it is wrong and we think it is right.  There is a clash of opinion here and further argument by me will not alter that situation.  It is as simple as that.</P>

      <P>In the Constituencies Bill the Minister said we could like it or lump it, that the Government would guillotine the Bill through. That was his attitude then when there was all the time in the world to have a revision of the constituencies.</P>

    <Speaker pid="LiamCunningham" hpid="Mr. Cunningham Mr. Cunningham">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cunningham</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister is trying to get this section through because he feels it is necessary that there is a time limit and that we must make an <i>ad hoc</i> decision.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cunningham</NameTxt>
      <P>If he wants us to discuss logically and reasonably in this House, with him and for the benefit of the House, our points of view and if the time limit to the 18th of June is not sufficient let him add a week to it.</P>

      <P>Deputy Cunningham, we are on amendment No. 1 in the name of Deputy Molloy. I am anxious that the Deputy would address his remarks to that subject and nothing else.  He has made no reference to the amendment up to now despite the admonition of the Chair.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LiamCunningham" hpid="Mr. Cunningham Mr. Cunningham">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cunningham</NameTxt>
      <P>The amendment seeks to delete a certain type of candidate who can be elected on the 18th of June.  My point is we are entitled to discuss our amendment on the desirability of selecting or deleting certain types of candidates.  If the Minister says we have not got the time <Col N="1174" /> to discuss it then the 18th of June is not sacrosanct.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanTreacy" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Seán Treacy">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LiamCunningham" hpid="Mr. Cunningham Mr. Cunningham">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cunningham</NameTxt>
      <P>I am making the case that in order to discuss the amendment to section 24 we need time.  The Minister has already said that there is not any time.  We think it is necessary to have time to discuss this amendment very fully.  To allow us time to discuss it he should change the date of the elections.  I know that due to legislation they must be held in the month of June.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanTreacy" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Seán Treacy">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy is straying far from the amendment. I shall have to bring him back to it again.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LiamCunningham" hpid="Mr. Cunningham Mr. Cunningham">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cunningham</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not suggesting that the elections be postponed for another year.  I am only suggesting that they be postponed from one date in June to another.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanTreacy" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Seán Treacy">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>That is a separate matter altogether.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LiamCunningham" hpid="Mr. Cunningham Mr. Cunningham">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cunningham</NameTxt>
      <P>It is statutory that they be held in June.  As already stated we do not agree that clerical officers who become county councillors should be allowed to remain in the employment of county councils and work in different sections of them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In a county council office the allocation of houses is dealt with as well as supplementary grants for new houses, reconstruction grants, water and sewerage supplementary grants and a variety of other grants and housing loans.  In those circumstances I certainly do not think it right that <Col N="1175" /> a clerical officer in a county council housing section or grant section should be a member of the county council.  The Minister argues the rate collector is out because he handles money and because he is dealing intimately with the public.  If the Minister cannot see the logic of the case we are making, could he insert something on Report Stage to the effect that, in the event of a clerical officer being elected, a clerical officer dealing with the kinds of matters referred to by Deputy Molloy yesterday and Deputy Lalor today, in certain sections of the county council he will be transferred to a section where he will not deal with matters like these?  That will only be a stopgap of course.  The proper approach is to do what the amendment seeks to do, namely, put him in the same boat as rate collectors and others.</P>
    <P>Consider the situation in which a motion might be put down to have the salary or emoluments of the clerical manager stopped.  If the clerical officer, a minor employee under the manager, votes to have the manager's salary stopped, where will that clerical officer find himself?  Will the manager be big-hearted enough to overlook it?  There are endless possibilities.  There are numberless areas in which there will obviously be a clash of interests between the clerical officer and the county manager. Personally, I do not think any clerical officer is going to be a candidate in this election.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanTreacy" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Seán Treacy">

      <P>I would ask the Deputy to address his remarks to the Chair rather than directly to the Minister.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LiamCunningham" hpid="Mr. Cunningham Mr. Cunningham">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cunningham</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not know where in the clerical scale a town clerk comes; he is not excluded according to this and a clerical officer is.  Can a town clerk become a member of (a) his own local authority and (b)&mdash;I am sorry.  I think the Minister can gather from the discussion so far and the points we have put forward that we are trying to avoid a situation which could become very awkward for everybody.  I will not go over the points Deputy Lalor made except to say that they are very valid points.  I know myself that when a housing scheme is allocated a lot of county councillors get on their bicycles and very quickly become the bearers of the good news.  The clerical officer, if this goes through, will have a head start.  He can be on his bicycle a week, or even longer, before any county councillor.</P>
      <P>He can deliver by word of mouth, or by telephone, or by any other means, the glad tidings to the lucky tenant appointed.  He can be the bearer of the good news of the supplementary grant of £230 through his efforts as a county councillor and not as a clerical officer.  He can say: &ldquo;Through my good offices as a county councillor, and due to the influence which I used on your behalf and on behalf of your family, a supplementary grant will be paid to you inside a very short time.  As a matter of fact, I will see to it that it will go out on Friday next.&rdquo; Of course, the unfortunate applicant will not know that Friday is the day on which county councils send out all supplementary grants.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This is ludicrous.  I appeal to the Minister to amend legislation which will create that situation all over the country, not in one office but in many offices.  He will remedy that situation if he accepts the amendment now before the House.  The same situation could apply in the health office where a clerical officer is processing <Col N="1178" /> medical card applications prior to forwarding them to the county MOH.  He knows the recommendations. He probably writes out the cards himself, the manager having Okayed the list of successful medical card applicants.  It is the clerical officer who does the spadework.  He writes out the medical cards and sends them to the clerk typist who sends them out by post.</P>
    <P>Again he gets out the bicycle.  He is a county councillor and the poor widow on the side of the hill is notified that, due to his activities as a member of the county council, and due to the pressure he put on, he was able to get her and her children a medical card.  The other county councillors will be notified by letter a week later.  They will send a letter from the county council to the widow and she will say: &ldquo;Thank you for nothing.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Getting away altogether from clerical officers in the employment of the county council, what about clerical officers in other Departments, or officers in other Departments of the same standard as the county council?  Take for instance, a clerical officer in the Department of Agriculture and Fisheries, or a man in the field equal in status to the clerical officer who is dealing with farmers' grants.  Will that person be allowed to become a candidate?  The Minister's proposal seeks to allow clerical officers to be candidates.  The amendment tries to remedy something which we think is wrong and to delete clerical officers.</P>
    <P>Has the Minister consulted with other Ministers?  What we feel about clerical officers in the employment of a local authority may have the same validity.  Will clerical officers in the Department of Lands, or the Department of Agriculture and Fisheries, or in the Minister's own Department be eligible?  I should like to have that clarified.</P>

      <P>I think I am entitled to give the preamble to that actual expression.  We consider this to be an extremely reasonable amendment. I am trying to get to the <Col N="1180" /> psychology of the Minister's refusal to accept it.  When I use the expression &ldquo;this great liberal&rdquo; I mean that when he is put on the horseback of Government he grinds the Opposition. He refuses to accept the amendment so reasonably put by the Opposition. When I used the expression: &ldquo;Put a beggar on horseback&rdquo; in the first instance, that is what I meant.</P>

I am trying to convince the Minister that he should accept the amendment in Deputy Molloy's name and argued so well by Deputy Molloy, Deputy Lalor, Deputy Cunningham and others. There is another expression in the English language.  I am sorry to be using cliches but sometimes they help in getting to the basis of why an amendment will not be accepted.</P>
      <P>During the course of an interchange between himself and the Minister, Deputy Crinion indicated that the Minister had a specific interest in some person, a clerical officer who may be running on the Labour ticket.  Therefore, not only had he let the cat out of the bag but he had let a pal out of the bag.  That is one of the many reasons why the Minister will not accept the amendment. He has a pal, a clerical officer &mdash;I do not know the man's name and I do not want to know his name&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>There is another aspect of Deputy Molloy's amendment which has not been discussed or which certainly has only been touched on, that is the matter of a clerical officer who is actually elected to a local authority. He then finds himself in the position of writing to himself.  What happens in such a case?  You have councillor Seán Andrews writing to clerical officer Seán Andrews, and <i>vice versa.</i> Here you would have a confused and confusing situation.  You have a councillor writing on behalf of himself to a clerical officer who is himself and the clerical officer writing on behalf of himself as a clerical officer to himself as a councillor.

      <P>The Minister is not being serious about this matter.  We are in no way reflecting on the capacity or ability or capability of clerical officers.  They are a worthy group of citizens doing a very good job within their own terms of employment. I think I have made it clear that it is our view, under all the circumstances, that they should be precluded from local authorities.  I believe that the vast majority of clerical officers do not wish to be candidates or to have the opportunity of being candidates at local elections.  Unquestionably they are a group of men who do a very good job.  The position that they hold is a position of trust.  It is the ratepayer who pays them.  It would seem to me and I believe to the vast majority of this group of people that they should not be asked to seek election to local authorities. The reality of the position is as we have outlined it.  The Minister, a former liberal, now seeks to grind the Opposition.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidAndrews" hpid="Mr. Andrews Mr. Andrews">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Andrews</NameTxt>
      <P>I am just summing up my arguments.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanTreacy" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Seán Treacy">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>I have heard that point made at least three times before.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidAndrews" hpid="Mr. Andrews Mr. Andrews">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Andrews</NameTxt>
      <P>The first point is that the Minister just will not accept the Opposition's amendment.  It is an Opposition amendment and consequently is not acceptable.  The second reason, as we have said, is that the pal is out of the bag, that the Minister has a pal, a clerical officer, running for election to the local authority in his own area or in some part of the country&mdash;just to take the pressure off the Minister's own area, so as not to personalise it or narrow it down to an individual who can be identified.  The third point is that you have a clerical officer in fact dealing with himself.  That is the most <Col N="1185" /> serious aspect.  The Minister made the point that a person would write to the secretary of the local authority and that a councillor would write to the secretary of the local authority. Suppose there is a problem which concerns a clerical officer in his capacity as clerical officer which he alone can deal with, arising out of a query from himself as a councillor.  What is the position in that case?  The query comes from the secretary to the local authority and it is passed down the conduit pipe of administration and comes back to the secretary and then goes back to the councillor who has submitted the problem in his capacity as councillor.  There you have an extraordinary position.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We do not want to be hard on the Minister.  We do not want to put him in the position of upsetting himself. On the contrary we want to make life easy for him and to make things as pleasant as possible for him.  On a number of occasions here we have got the impression that the Minister does not want to make things easy for the Opposition.  Here you have a very reasoned amendment put down by the Opposition.  We are discussing the Report Stage and here the Minister has a further opportunity of showing his intention to give the Opposition an opportunity of showing that they are as concerned as he is about legislation which is passed by the House. We feel strongly about this section and about the amendment to the point where it might be considered that by standing up minute after minute, hour after hour, we are filibustering. Nothing could be further from the truth.  The reasons we are pursuing this matter are: (1) we feel strongly about it; (2)&mdash;not necessarily in order of priority&mdash;we believe it makes for good order in the structure of local authority, and (3) we believe that clerical officers who hold very important positions in local government administration and elsewhere&mdash;positions of trust&mdash;should stick rigidly to the principle of trust and not be asked to accept an added burden&mdash;and indeed honour&mdash;of being a local councillor. A councillor's position is extremely onerous.  Deputy Belton spoke <Col N="1186" /> of the clerical officer posting correspondence as clerical officer to himself in his capacity as councillor and said he would have free postage.  The sooner local councillors have free postage the better.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanTreacy" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Seán Treacy">

      <NameTxt>Mr. Andrews</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BenBriscoe" hpid="Mr. Briscoe Mr. Briscoe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Briscoe</NameTxt>
      <P>When I first read this section, I remarked that it was scandalous.  First, I believe that there is a conflict of interest involved.  I can visualise a situation where, say, a colleague of mine from a different party on the council was working in the housing section and I had to go to him or a letter of mine to the chief allocations officer is handed down to him to see what the position is in regard to a person allocated a house.  He will get the very latest information appertaining to somebody in my constituency and I have no guarantee that he will not whisper in the ears of one of his colleagues in my constituency &ldquo;By the way, so-and-so has an extra child now and <Col N="1187" /> qualifies for a house.  You had better get up there because Briscoe is just getting the information out in a letter.&rdquo;  That is one of the abuses that could happen.  It might be a Fianna Fáil clerical officer and it might operate the other way.  It could happen with any party.  There is that possibility of abuse unless the county manager were to say: &ldquo;This is a very sensitive department.  We shall have to transfer you elsewhere.&rdquo;  The county manager would not necessarily do that because there is no law that says he should.</P>
      <P>In a conversation with a member of the Minister's party whose name I do not intend to repeat he agreed there can be a conflict of interest. There might be a situation where a clerical officer who is a member of the council said something at a council or committee meeting.  Afterwards, the county manager might well say to him: &ldquo;Whose side are you on?&rdquo; A nod is as good as a wink and this fellow might feel that if he does not toe the establishment line promotion may be very far off.  I know that when he is promoted above a certain grade he can no longer be a councillor.  I think it is pretty certain that nobody will refuse promotion to stay on a county council which is an unpaid job.  Yet, there may be that conflict of interest.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Frequently, when I am talking to groups and I am asked to say what is the role of a public representative I have said that we act as a buffer between the people and the bureaucrats to see that bureaucracy does not become too impersonal and remote from the people.  We can go in and say: &ldquo;This man got an explanation; he is not satisfied with it.  We want to know why.&rdquo;  We can get that personal attention which the person himself might not get.  Here we have a situation where a bureaucrat is allowed to seek election under this Bill and therefore you have a bureaucrat acting as a buffer between the people and himself.  There is a basic contradiction here.  I am genuinely unhappy about this.  It is not a political matter with me.  I am not interested in the argument <Col N="1188" /> that if these people are in, rate collectors should be in.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LiamCunningham" hpid="Mr. Cunningham Mr. Cunningham">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cunningham</NameTxt>

      <P>I felt that even when Deputy Molloy was making the point yesterday that there was no reason to exclude rate collectors if clerical officers were being included, he was not making a case for their inclusion. I do not want my argument diluted by bringing in what somebody else said.  Other speakers can explain what they themselves mean.  To summarise, I believe there is a conflict of interest; I believe this is fundamental to democracy, and a clerical officer, as a member of a council, may well be afraid to oppose his county manager.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Briscoe</NameTxt>
      <P>He is scarcely likely to tell the manager to do anything like that because his future promotion may be affected.  There is a conflict of interest between the people and their public representatives and the bureaucracy and there is a conflict of interests between the manager and his employee or the man he is subject to. This could lead to considerable embarrassment.</P>

      <P>If the Minister examines our amendment he will see that it is a most reasonable one. Being an intelligent man he must be as conscious as we are of the dangers and abuses that his proposal can bring about.  The Minister in his statement last night tried to convey the impression that a clerical officer is not really in a position of influence; that he is working under instructions or orders and has not any power to make decisions that would be relevant. Those of us who know the position agree in principle with what the Minister is saying that <i>per se</i> they do not make decisions but they have a <Col N="1189" /> tremendous influence on any decisions that are made.  Any research or spade work that has to be done in a department of a local authority is generally carried out by the clerical officer. That officer presents his report to the staff officer who, in turn, presents it to the superior.  The clerical officer could slant that report in any way he wished.</P>
      <P>I do not think a clerical officer should be in a position where he would have a conflict of interests.  We have also the situation where other councillors would be making representations to the department that the clerical officer works in.  That clerical officer would be able to see all representations made by every other councillors.  That is most unfair to the other councillors and, again, it is putting the clerical officer in a most invidious position.  For a long time we in Cork County Council have tried to get rid of and stamp out as much as possible a councillor getting a housing list and going around telling the people who succeeded that he was successful in getting them a house.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>Nobody believes that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FlorenceCrowley" hpid="Mr. Crowley Mr. Crowley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Crowley</NameTxt>
      <P>Maybe not but, nevertheless, it was done but we brought about a situation in Cork where no councillor has access to a housing list until the people themselves have been informed.  Now we are creating a situation where this whole system, this despicable system, can again become rife as a result of clerical officers being in a privileged position and having access to this type of information.  A clerical officer will be in a position to inform people if they are successful.  The clerical officer may not say outright that he was the cause of a person obtaining a house but he might imply that it was as a result of his representations that that person was granted a house.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I know many clerical officers in Cork County Council and I do not think they would wish to have this facility made available to them.  I cannot believe either that because there is a clerical officer going in the Minister's own constituency that is the <Col N="1190" /> reason he is pushing this but it is very hard to get any other reason for it. The Minister is a reasonable man in most cases and he must see that the arguments put up by us are very valid arguments and ones that can sincerely hold.</P>
    <P>I would concede to the Minister that if he were allowing rate collectors and home assistance officers to stand there would equally be a case for allowing clerical officers to stand.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>How would the Deputy make that argument?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FlorenceCrowley" hpid="Mr. Crowley Mr. Crowley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Crowley</NameTxt>
      <P>Because they are in very similar positions with access to the public.  I agree with the Minister's reasons for not allowing other officers to stand but he must be consistent and say that clerical officers are in a similar position because they have access to privileged, and in some cases, highly confidential information. In the planning department, where no councillor has access to the full facts in regard to any planning application, a clerical officer, if he were a councillor, would have access to this type of information.  Such an officer would be in a position to tell an applicant for planning permission that if he changed his application in some way by, for instance, adding wooded land or shrubbery, he would be granted planing permission.  That information would not be available to the ordinary councillor.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">

    <Speaker pid="FlorenceCrowley" hpid="Mr. Crowley Mr. Crowley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Crowley</NameTxt>
      <P>The facts are that no councillor has access to planning files by right.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>There is a way in which he can gain this access.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FlorenceCrowley" hpid="Mr. Crowley Mr. Crowley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Crowley</NameTxt>
      <P>I accept that a councillor may gain access to them but only in exceptional cases.  The clerical officer who is a councillor has no trouble in getting access to them but the ordinary councillor has to go through a very rigid procedure and then he can only gain access to these files in exceptional cases.  The point <Col N="1191" /> I have been making with regard to housing and planning is equally valid for medical cards.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">

    <Speaker pid="FlorenceCrowley" hpid="Mr. Crowley Mr. Crowley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Crowley</NameTxt>
      <P>It is the situation. We can equally have the situation which applies with regard to housing and planning and medical cards, a very emotive issue.  Because of his position and knowledge of circumstances of people a clerical officer, if he were a councillor, could easily go along to a person who has made application and inform him that now that there has been an increase in his family or a change in his circumstances he is entitled to a medical card.  This clerical officer could tell such a person to apply for this card and as a result that person could be granted one.  If the Minister is consistent why should not the clerical officer on health boards be allowed to stand?</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>Perhaps Deputy Crowley would permit me a moment to explain something.  I want to point out that Deputy Molloy's amendment says:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1193" /> ... shall not exclude an employee who is a member of the administrative staff ...</P>
    <P>If I accepted Deputy Molloy's amendment, it would not make one bit of difference to the position.  I could do that and just pass it over afterwards but I am not prepared to do that.  I would rather put the facts on the table.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FlorenceCrowley" hpid="Mr. Crowley Mr. Crowley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Crowley</NameTxt>
      <P>That is fair enough. Would the Minister accept an amendment?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Mr. Molloy Mr. Molloy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>On a point of explanation, in the document which the Minister circulated and in which he indicated the extent of the proposed orders he intended making if this Bill passes, he states under the heading &ldquo;Local Authorities&rdquo; (Section 24(1)):</P>
      <P>The intention would be to exclude from the operation of section 21, (1), of the Local Government Act, 1955 all employees who are not officers and all officers except the following:</P>
      <P>(1) All administrative staff down to but not including the rank of clerical officer and all town clerks.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>My information is that clerical officers are not accepted as administrative staff and therefore are not included at all.  Anyway, whether or not that is included, I could easily have accepted the thing, said nothing about it and brought in an order. But that would be unfair to the House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FlorenceCrowley" hpid="Mr. Crowley Mr. Crowley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Crowley</NameTxt>
      <P>I would agree that that would be unfair.  If the Minister considers that that would be deceitful, he should not do it and I know he would not do it.  Nevertheless the proposed orders under section 24 of the Local Elections Bill are exactly what Deputy Molloy's amendment means and, as he said, under section 24, subsection (1) the intention would be to exclude from the operation of section 21, subsection (1) of the Local Government Act, 1955, all employees who are not officers and all officers except the following&mdash;all administrative staff down to but not including the rank of clerical officer <Col N="1194" /> and all town clerks.  In wording this is practically identical to Deputy Molloy's amendment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Mr. Molloy Mr. Molloy">

The Minister should clear up his facts before he corrects anybody else.  It is not good enough to treat this House in this fashion.  Because, as I said earlier, we are just as responsible for legislation passing through here as is the Minister; and if shoddy or loose legislation gets through it can be a reflection on the Opposition as much as on the Government.</P>

If the Minister could give me just one good reason <Col N="1197" /> why he wants to put clerical officers into the position of standing for election to local authorities, I would be quite prepared to accept his amendment. Indeed one is forced to the conclusion that the only reason he has for pushing through this petty legislation is because he has got somebody going into his own area on his own ticket, because I know of no other&mdash;&mdash;</P>

Any reasonable man wondering why a Minister for Local Government would try to push through this piece of legislation would be very hard pressed to find a reason for it because it is a totally inconsistent piece of legislation. From our side of the House we are not opposing it because it has any political advantages or kudos for us; it has not.  We are opposing it because it is unfair and discriminatory.</P>
      <P>The Minister should be reasonable. He should tell us why he has selected clerical officers for this treatment, because otherwise one is forced to the conclusion that because he has a Labour Party clerical officer going up in his own constituency he has presented this document to the House.  He must be a very influential man if he can get the Minister to introduce special legislation in order to allow him to stand for the local elections.  If the Minister wants to get on quickly with the other sections of this Bill he should give us valid reasons why he wants to include clerical officers in this legislation or else accept our amendment, which is very reasonable.</P>

However, as a member of a local authority for a great number of years, I want to say <Col N="1198" /> there is no public demand I am aware of in this city and, I am sure, throughout the country that people involved in the very responsible work of administering local authority affairs should become members of of local authorities.</P>
      <P>I can visualise that it could be a great embarrassment to clerical officers to be elected to local councils or corporations.  There are a number of functions reserved to local authorities.  I want to refer particularly to section 4.  From my reading of the provincial Press I see that certain county councils exercise their rights in compelling the county manager to carry out certain functions.  I am sure it would be a disadvantage to a clerical officer if he were put in the position of having to take a decision against his own manager.  No elected representative, who is in a dual capacity of public representative and administrator, should be put in that position by any legislation.  A clerical officer could be discussing policy with the city manager and he could come in conflict with the points of view put forward in relation to certain matters of administration.  I cannot understand why the Minister introduced this section.</P>
      <P>Many clerical officers working in local authorities have graduated to higher posts.  I do not think they want this legislation.  I am sure I am speaking for many of them when I say they do not want to be involved in public affairs on the lines suggested in this section.  A clerical officer in a county council or a corporation could be working in what has been described this morning as a sensitive area such as planning, housing or sanitary services. If that person is elected to a council and the public know that he can be seen in his office at the local council or corporation they could go in and discuss administrative matters in which he is involved.  This is a most undesirable trend.  I do not wish to deny anybody the opportunity of being elected to a county council or corporation but we should draw the line and ensure that the people engaged in administration are not put in the position I have outlined.</P>

      <P>I should like, speaking in favour of the amendment, to correct the erroneous impression which the Minister has endeavoured to create on the liberalisation of the worker in relation to elections.  Our party are in favour of that provided there is no conflict, and the Minister should realise this.  The various speakers have indicated very clearly where the conflict lies.  This is purely a propaganda effort by the Minister to work up clerical officers against the Opposition party and so cause a division between members of local authorities and members of the Opposition.  The Minister knows that any reasonable Opposition would endeavour to indicate clearly where the conflict lies.  The Minister tries to paint a different picture, tries to show that the Opposition are anticlerical officer; but this is not so.</P>
      <P>The politically free now are in greater numbers than they were some years ago.  It is time an effort was made to free many more people from the shackles that bound them for so long and give them an opportunity to participate in political affairs.  It is wrong to say that we have no regard for this section of the workers.  Is there a demand from the various trade unions or the clerical officers for permission to participate as candidates in the local elections?  My information is that there appears to be no demand from them in this regard.  The question of making more people politically free is a matter which has been long delayed, but I think the present effort by the Minister is propaganda to work up the staff of local authorities against the Opposition.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister probably feels that this will pay off in the coming years, that it will be mentioned that the Opposition party were against this. There will be no rush of candidates and I am sure the Minister knows that most of the candidates have already been selected.  The conflict which has arisen could be solved by acceptance of Deputy Molloy's amendment.  I believe the Minister feels this is proper.  If it is the intention to work up members of local authorities <Col N="1200" /> against members of the Opposition the Minister will rue this at some stage because I am quite sure it will backfire.</P>
    <P>Would a clerical officer on a country council, if elected, bring all the staff problems to the county council chamber and by-pass the union?  Does the Minister want to create a situation where trade unions are by-passed by clerical officers, that they would bring staff matters to the council floor and discuss them there?  This would mean that every time there is a conflict between the clerical officer and the manager that manager would be threatened with the council.  It is a very serious situation that the manager could be threatened with the council and that the clerical officer would be in a position to bring the matter to council level and so by-pass decisions made by the manager or force decisions in the council either by means of section 4 or other means.</P>

      <P>Who would be the boss?  Would it be the manager or the clerical officer?  Remember, the latter will have more power than the manager in some respects.  The manager has certain managerial powers but the clerical officer elected as a member of the council will have more powers than the manager.  If he is elected chairman of the council what will be his position in relation to the manager?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister spoke at some length about workers' democracy.  He has not a clue.  If he wants to introduce workers' democracy he and his Government can do it by bringing in the necessary legislation here.  What the Minister talks about is not workers' democracy.  Workers' democracy is much more than the election of someone to a county council.  Workers' democracy connotes decision making. The Minister is trying to confuse the situation by suggesting we are anti-workers' democracy.  The go-slow in workers' democracy has come from the Minister's own party and from other members of the Government <Col N="1201" /> parties.  One wants workers' democracy and others say we are going too fast and it should not be introduced until it has been fully examined.  If the Minister is so concerned let him introduce workers' democracy.  We will give him all the assistance we can. We believe there should be workers' democracy and participation, but participation at that level is completely different from participation at a political level.</P>
    <P>There is no comparison between workers' participation in a workers' democracy and participation as public representatives.  I am rather surprised the Minister would even attempt to speak about such a matter at this stage when other members of his own party have been so loud in their condemnation of efforts to impose workers' democracy on employers. They say we are going too fast and people should have time to think. Then the Minister comes in here and says this is what this Bill is about.  It is not and the Minister should not confuse the issue and all the grinning in the world will not get the Minister out of this situation.</P>

      <P>I was dealing with the Minister's allegation last night that we are anti-workers democracy and that we have shown this by our action here.  I was pointing out that the Minister is very confused in regard to this particular matter.  His statements clearly indicate that he either does not know what workers' democracy is all about or he is deliberately trying to confuse the issue. If the Minister is as concerned as he appears to be he should set up a system whereby members of local authorities would have proper workers' democracy introduced in staff matters.  That is quite a simple thing to do and we hope the Minister will now pursue the course he charted <Col N="1202" /> last night.  But, remember, it is different from the political situation where servants of local authorities are concerned in participation.  The Minister knows that perfectly well.</P>
      <P>As has been pointed out, the logical development may well be an entire takeover of local authorities by the staffs of those authorities.  That would create a peculiar situation. These people would be in a position to acquire information which would not be available to public representatives and they could, in fact, have an advantage as against outsiders presenting themselves for election.  This would be very wrong and such a situation should not be allowed to develop.  They would also be in a position to convey information to others, information which would not be available to the ordinary public representative. This would be a very serious situation.</P>
      <P>How serious would the Minister regard the situation in which there was an entire takeover of council seats by members of the staff of the county council?  What would be the situation then?  There would be no democracy inside or outside the council.  The question of public representation is important.  People must represent the community on a very broad basis.  The Minister's intention must be to see a situation develop in which the staff could take over and do the job.  I do not know what will be gained by that.  It would cause confusion and eliminate democracy in the councils.</P>
      <P>The cost of getting this Bill through must be fairly substantial.  The cost of the discussions which took place up to now on this Bill must be fairly substantial.  If this is the cost of a friend, that friend is a fairly expensive one.</P>

      <P>The indications are that a clerical officer has been nominated in some section of the country and that this Bill is an effort to ensure his survival as a candidate.  If there were a large-scale demand from the unions that these people should <Col N="1203" /> participate as candidates, I could well understand it.  I have been in touch with a number of union members in Dublin and I asked them has there been any such demand and no one seemed to know of any demand either at his own branch level or at national level.</P>
      <P>This is purely a propaganda effort by the Minister to try to work up servants of a local authority against people who oppose the Minister's proposal in principle.  The Minister has to answer the various questions posed by Deputy Briscoe, Deputy Crowley and Deputy Timmons.  It will be interesting to hear the Minister's reply.  The question I would pose is in connection with the topic the Minister introduced on many occasions last evening, that was, workers' democracy.  This is not workers' democracy.  The Minister has a very confused idea of workers' democracy. I am sorry for him.  He is probably sorry himself that he introduced this Bill because I am quite sure that, when it is analysed, he will be the laughingstock of the Labour Party. If the Minister has some form of workers' democracy other than the generally accepted form of workers' democracy, we hope he will indicate what it is.  If it is that workers' democracy is a system which will involve political representation together with ordinary representation at the staff level or supervisory level, we would like to hear that from the Minister.</P>
      <P>Already there have been comments inside this House and I am sure there will be comments outside the House when the Minister's speech is studied. This was just thrown in to create confusion. When he gets in no doubt the Minister will endeavour to blow hot and cold on some of the statements made.  If he is sincere in what he says, we hope he will introduce a Bill at the earliest possible moment to give these people the type of representation he feels they should get.  He will certainly get plenty of support in evolving a system.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Even members of his own party who cried very loudly in Opposition <Col N="1204" /> about worker participation and workers' democracy are now saying that this should be thought about a second time.  Possibly these statements were somewhat of an embarrassment to the Minister and he is now trying to salvage the situation as other Ministers have done in the course of the past week.  So conflicting have been the reports of the views of Ministers on some aspects of Government that the public do not know exactly what the true situation is.  Every Minister appears to be a law unto himself.</P>

The question of the conflict has been dealt with at great length by many speakers. Deputy Molloy covered it extensively. The Minister should give some consideration to this rather than giving a dogmatic refusal to a constructive amendment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister must know that it is the duty of the Opposition to ensure that reasonable arguments are put forward against his proposal if they feel so inclined.  On this occasion Deputy Molloy feels that this conflict is of major importance and he has put forward his views and his amendments. The Minister should at least consider this amendment, having listened to the many speakers who put forward many points of view.  I hope the Minister will answer clearly the questions posed in relation to this conflict and let us know what the situation would be if the entire staff <Col N="1205" /> of a local authority because the entire membership of that authority.</P>

      <P>Deputy Dowling raised so many points which have no relevance to the matter under debate that it is very difficult for somebody like myself to answer them.  The last one he raised&mdash;and I think he mentioned it three times&mdash;was that the entire county council could be taken over by the staff.  He seems to think in some peculiar way&mdash;I would not like to try to imagine how Deputy Dowling thinks &mdash;that the staff of the county council could all be elected and that the elector's views would not enter into it at all.  I do not think I need to go any further on that.  It is the electorate who elect the council.  They select the councillors they want.

He mentioned in this House a person who he knew was not here to defend himself&mdash;a very decent man.  This person was not a clerical officer at the time the decision was taken.  He has since been promoted.  That is beside the point.  Can anybody in his sober senses suggest therefore that the decision taken by the Government had relation to something which happened subsequent to that decision being taken?

      <P>In the Fianna Fáil benches there is a very decent man who was employed as a staff officer by the county council.  That man asked me particularly if he went back to the grade of clerical officer would there be any difficulty about his standing? I am quite aware that with the pulls here and there in Fianna Fáil and the difficulty they have in agreeing between any two as to what they stand for or who should be in any particular place, maybe somebody might not like him to stand.  I would not like to judge what the effect would be.  This decent man asked me the question and I told him that as far as I was concerned if he was a clerical officer I could see no reason <Col N="1207" /> why he should not stand and most certainly I would not put any obstacle in his way.  This being so, it amazes me, unless there is something that I do not know anything about inside the workings of the party, that objection is being made to this grade of clerical officer being allowed to stand for the local authority.  Clerical officers throughout the country&mdash; Deputy Dowling seems to have interviewed them all and says that they do not want to stand; I did not do that.

It all depends on what way Fianna Fáil feel about him when the election comes and, as a sensible man, he did say to me, &ldquo;I feel it would not be right that I should go back.  If I were a clerical officer it would be all right and&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;I am making this case&rdquo;.  I think the man was right and I respect him for it.

    <P>We have had the question of who should be entitled to stand and who should not.  Deputy Crowley, an intelligent man, usually fair-minded, went back to something that Deputy Molloy said yesterday but which he did not mention this morning.  Deputy Crowley felt that if clerical officers were to stand then rate collectors should stand.  Things cannot be gauged in that way.  If it is all right to leave rate collectors out, which apparently it is this morning with everybody except Deputy Crowley, what bearing has that on clerical officers?  Every clerical officer in the country must be delighted with the status they have got from the Fianna Fáil Party in this House, a status they did not get so easily when the Fianna Fáil Party were in power.  They did not think so much of them then.  Now <Col N="1209" /> they are wonderful people.  They can, in fact, push the county manager around.  Deputy Dowling was afraid of a section 4 motion affecting staff issues on a council.  He should know that section 4 could not be applied in a case like that and he need have no fear.  Issues referred to the county manager will be dealt with by the county manager and the trade unions and will not be a matter which can be discussed at the council level.  He should know that.</P>

If Deputy Dowling wants to talk about workers' democracy, for Deputy Dowling's information I consider that it is a step towards democracy if an employee of a board is allowed to sit on that board and to make decisions and the election of certain employees of the local authority on to the ruling board, which is the county council or the corporation, is a step towards workers' democracy.  It is giving the workers employed in the job a say in the running of the job. The only clerical people are those from clerical officer grade down.  I believe <Col N="1211" /> the clerical people are entitled to that little say if the public elect them.  They do not just elect themselves.</P>

      <P>This, I think, meets the point which Deputy Molloy discussed with me. Deputy Molloy has an amendment down which is slightly different but my amendment was put down according to what I understood was his agreement with me on the debate.</P>

      <P>My amendment No. 3 reads as follows:</P>
      <P>To add to the section a new subsection as follows:</P>
      <P>(6) Where an order under this section is proposed to be made, a draft thereof shall be laid before each House of the Oireachtas and the order shall not be made until a resolution approving of the draft has been passed by each House of the Oireachtas.</P>
      <P>I want to point out the fundamental difference between the amendment I have put down and the Minister's amendment.  There was some reference to this on Second Stage but we have given further consideration to this matter and the amendment standing in my name is the provision which the Opposition party want written into this Bill.  The weakness of the Minister's amendment, which did make an effort to go some way towards meeting the situation we were speaking about, is in the last line which states:</P>
      <P>... but without prejudice to the validity of anything previously done thereunder.</P>
      <P>One must first of all examine the Bill that the Minister brought before the House where he gave himself, and other Ministers, sweeping powers without the necessity at all to refer the orders which he could make under this Bill to the Oireachtas.  These sweeping powers could have been and, in fact, would have been exercised by the Minister had we not made reference to it here the last day and exposed the dangers contained therein.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1215" /> When one is referring to section 24, one is speaking about the power that three Ministers have to make orders&mdash; the Minister for Local Government, the Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries and the Minister for Education. Any of those three Ministers, under the Bill as it stands without the amendments, would have been empowered to make an order and by the making of such order disqualify certain categories of employees from being eligible to stand for election to local authorities without any reference whatsoever to the House.  The Minister has gone some way towards meeting our point, but not adequately, in suggesting that an order made under the section: &ldquo;shall be laid before each House of the Oireachtas as soon as may be after it is made and, if a resolution annulling the order is passed by either such House within the next twenty-one days on which that House has sat after the order is laid before it, the order shall be annulled accordingly ....&rdquo; but anything done before the annulling of that order shall continue to be deemed to have been done validly.</P>
    <P>That is not at all satisfactory.  I gave an example on Second Stage and I have given a similar example again. Under the Bill a situation can arise, even with the Minister's amendment, where a person, an employee of a local authority, is nominated by his party to stand as a candidate at a local election. Up to the time that his party selected him at their convention it was known, under the orders and Acts made up to then, that the person would be eligible to stand for election to that council.  The nomination having been made public, a situation could arise where the Minister, merely by the stroke of a pen, could disqualify that person subsequently from standing.  It could happen in a certain category there might be one candidate only from one party standing and by making an order disqualifying that category the Minister in fact, would be disqualifying that person.</P>
    <P>That is a situation to which we object.  We feel that should not be allowed to happen.  As the Minister's amendment stands, the Minister can <Col N="1216" /> disqualify that person by disqualifying the category in which he is employed and what the Minister does can be deemed valid even though this House could subsequently annul the very order the Minister has made if the annulment took place after the nomination date.</P>
    <P>Our amendment is a much clearer one and has a precedent in the Electoral Acts.  We are asking that where any order is made under section 24 it be a draft order only until such time as it has been approved by both Houses of the Oireachtas.  That would eliminate the possibility of any unfair action against any particular individual. In all of our contributions we have been anxious to ensure that we achieve perfection as far as we can in the legislation we have been asked to accept.  Certainly, the Bill as presented to us, was far from satisfactory.  Even this amendment does not meet the obstacles and dangers we see in it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sorry that Deputy Molloy, having discussed this matter with me and, to a certain extent, reached agreement should try now to bring in by amendment something which would not work out.  Let me quote from the Official Report, Volume 272, No. 3 of Tuesday, 30th April, 1974, column 419.  Deputy Molloy said:</P>
      <P>The Minister may not have seen this; I concede that it was not done intentionally but because of the power that can be wielded under these orders I think they should be placed before the Houses of the Oireachtas and we should have an opportunity of debating them here if we feel that is necessary.  I appeal to the Minister before we take Committee Stage tomorrow to have an amendment to these various orders in section 24 and any other relevant orders under this Bill to provide that they be placed before each House of the Oireachtas.</P>
      <P>This I have done.  Deputy Molloy continued to say at column 419:</P>
      <P>Generally, we welcome the expansion of eligibility for local election to the various categories of employees...</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1217" /> I have done what I was asked to do. Deputy Molloy is objecting to the tail end of the amendment: &ldquo;without prejudice to the validity of anything previously done thereunder&rdquo;.  This is general, standard practice.  Either Deputy Molloy is prepared to accept that I did in good faith what I had promised to do&mdash;and which was acceptable to him on that day&mdash;or, alternatively, he is not prepared to accept it in which case we do not seem to be able to reach agreement. It is simply a question of interpretation. Deputy Molloy made a certain comment.  I agreed that I would put in the amendment and I have done so.  What Deputy Molloy wants to do is to hold up the making of any order until such time as the matter has been debated by the Houses of the Oireachtas.  We cannot do that at the moment.  The order can be debated and can be annulled at a later stage but it would be unreal to do this because one would have somebody who would go forward as a candidate under the Bill; he would have been accepted as a candidate; he would be elected and a debate would take place subsequently which could, in fact, debar him from membership.  If he did something during the period he was accepted as a member&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>It was acceptable to Deputy Molloy on the 30th April, 1974.  Deputy Molloy was explicit on this.  He did not say then that he wanted it debated before the order was made because, in fact, what he said was:</P>
      <P>I appeal to the Minister before we take Committee Stage tomorrow to have an amendment to these various orders in section 24 and any other relevant orders under this Bill to provide that they be placed before each House of the Oireachtas.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>That is just too bad because we have voted on the Bill here and we have voted in a certain way.  That is how law is passed in this House.  The majority of the Members of the House vote in a certain way and that is what rules.  What Deputy Crowley is trying to say is that there should be a second chance afforded in this sort of situation&mdash;that for instance, somebody who has been ruled out under section 24 should come back in again under another section.  I think I went a long way as far as I was asked by Deputy Molloy the last day and I think it unfair that he should now come along and attempt to have it reversed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Mr. Molloy Mr. Molloy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister's proposal would create a situation where a person could be debarred from standing as a candidate.  In other words, the returning officer would not accept his nomination if the Minister had made an order stating that that person's category of employment debarred <Col N="1219" /> him from standing as a candidate at a local election.  Therefore, the returning officer would not accept his nomination some days before the close of nomination day.  Yet what the Minister is suggesting is that a debate could take place, after the close of nomination day, at which this category of person could qualify to stand as a candidate.  But the damage would have been done.</P>
      <P>The danger we see in the legislation is that the man could be debarred by a stroke of the Minister's pen and the only way in which what the Minister has done can be negatived afterwards is by a resolution annulling it here in the House.  But the time at which that would take place would be too late to allow that person's nomination to be accepted.</P>
      <P>The election may, in fact, be over. Certainly nomination day would have passed.  We feel that is very loose legislation.  We gave this some thought before we put down this amendment and we feel what we have done is right.  If the Minister can tell me that what I am saying now is wrong there may be room for me to reconsider, but I cannot see from what he has said so far that what I am saying is wrong.  He seems to be confirming the belief we have in the weakness in the Bill and in the amendment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I refer the Minister to section 82 of the Electoral Act, 1963, which deals with the conduct of elections.  It provides for the making of regulations dealing with nominations, deposits by candidates, death of candidates, duties of returning officers, staff of returning officers, taking of polls and counting of votes, use, free of charge, of schools and public rooms, arrangements for postal voting, the voting by persons in the employment of returning officers, advance polling on islands, maintenance of secrecy of voting, removal of persons misconducting themselves in polling stations, and so on.  These concern most of the main regulations dealing with the running of elections. The first one deals with nominations. We are speaking about the effect on a person seeking a nomination, <Col N="1220" /> whether he was eligible or not and whether he should be accepted for nomination as a candidate.  All of the important regulations set down in section 82 of the 1963 Electoral Act are governed by subsection (5) of that section, which states:</P>
    <P>Where regulations under this section are proposed to be made, a draft thereof shall be laid before each House of the Oireachtas and the regulations shall not be made until a resolution approving of the draft has been passed by each House.</P>
    <P>There is the precedent which we are following.  The Minister is introducing a completely different method of dealing with nominations and control over who is or is not qualified to be accepted.  We are the people who are speaking of the precedent which has been established by this House, not the Minister.  We suggest to him that our amendment must be accepted if this Bill is to stand up in law.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">

      <P>Deputy Molloy is dealing with two different things.  He is dealing with regulations and I am talking about orders.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>No, they are dealt with in a different way.  Deputy Molloy has quoted from the 1963 Act but the section, as originally drafted, did not include provision for bringing the order before the Oireachtas because it was modelled on a similar provision in the Health Act, 1970, Article 7 of the Second Schedule.  I am sure the Opposition will agree that this is quite recent legislation brought in by the Fianna Fáil Government when in office.  To find something wrong with it now, when less than four years ago it was all right when they brought it in, looks a little bid odd.  We are going further than that.  In an effort to please Deputy Molloy, because of the fact he kicked up such a row about it the other day, I agreed I would have the matter debated before the House.  I put in an amendment as I promised.  The position is that a draft must first be laid before the House and approved by both <Col N="1221" /> Houses of the Oireachtas.  That is one way of doing it.  The other is that an order must be laid before the Houses and can be annulled within a specified period but without prejudice to the validity of anything done thereunder.</P>

      <P>I cannot because the draft which is discussed beforehand is one way and an order which I am proposing must contain this because if it does not it makes for an impossible situation.  A situation could be created whereby people could be elected to a council and the council could consider they had taken part in something which would make invalid things which had been done.  We could not accept that.  I have been anxious to assist in this.  The Deputy has been complaining about good manners and saying that I was not being helpful.  I am making an effort here to facilitate the Opposition and they are still not satisfied with it. I want to make it clear that I cannot and, therefore will not, alter this thing because I believe it is the right thing to do.</P>

      <P>The Minister foolishly quoted the Health Act as a precedent. Any fair-minded person would agree with me that the correct precedent would be one from the electoral law of this country and not from the Health Acts, which are not dealing with the election to local authorities.  The Minister's argument is not a valid one.  His amendment does not overcome the difficulty which we foresee, because as it stands anything he does by way of an order is valid until that order is annulled.  Therefore he can disqualify a person before nomination day who after nomination day can be deemed to have been eligible, but it is too late. That is where the weakness is in the Minister's amendment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As far as election is concerned this amendment is useless because if either of the other Ministers, not necessarily the Minister for Local Government, could disqualify a certain person by excluding some days before nomination day the category in which he was employed, the returning officer could not accept his <Col N="1222" /> nomination.  Then if this House disagreed with the Minister's action and subsequently annulled that order, it would be too late for that person to be qualified to stand for the election. The Minister would have done the damage and the House would not be in a position, even on annulling the order, to restore to that man his right to stand in the election because the date would have passed by.  The amendment is useless to meet the situation we are talking about.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>

      <P>I am only giving the facts.  The action taken by the late Peadar Cowan in the High Court meant that the appeals section which was there completely disappeared. Therefore the law as such does not exist and has not existed since 1961.  We are now attempting to put it in order.  This being so, Deputy Molloy's opposition falls flat on its face.  If we did not introduce this Bill the people he is talking about as having been deprived of their right to stand would not have a right to stand anyway.  I have introduced something here and I am standing over the way it is being done.  If Deputy Molloy feels strongly enough about any particular order he is entitled afterwards to introduce a motion, have a debate here and, if he can carry it, to have it annulled.</P>

Within the statutory period, which would be after the decisions were taken, there could be a discussion which could result in the annulment of the right of one person.  Unless we cover up, everything the council have done up to then is null and void and they are in serious trouble.  It is a protective clause.  What we are talking about is most unlikely to happen, but it is a protective clause.  I would not be doing my job as Minister for Local Government if I did not protect the local authorities by insisting on that clause being included.</P>

      <P>May I interrupt the Deputy for a moment?  At column 424 of Volume 272 of the Official Report the following appears:</P>
      <P>Mr. Molloy: Can the Minister give an indication now whether he will bring forward an amendment that all these orders be placed before each House of the Oireachtas?</P>
      <P>Mr. Tully: I will have a look at it but I would not like to give an undertaking.</P>
      <P>Mr. Molloy: If the Minister would do that it would not be necessary for me to do it.</P>
      <P>Mr. Tully: What Deputy Molloy has in mind is a non-statutory order?</P>
      <P>Mr. Molloy: I would rather a statutory order.</P>
      <P>Mr. Tully: I would not be prepared to put down a statutory order because this would mean upsetting the whole procedure.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Mr. Molloy: A statutory order would create difficulties now because <Col N="1225" /> it would disqualify all those people from standing in the forthcoming local elections.  In view of that, for the present I would be prepared to accept that they be laid before each House of the Oireachtas.</P>
    <P>Mr. Tully: I do not see much objection to that.  I will tell the Deputy tomorrow.</P>
    <P>In view of that, it is ludicrous now to continue this argument.  Deputy Molloy asked for something and he got it.  Let him be big enough now to accept it.</P>

If the Minister had done his job in time this question would not arise and we would not be worrying about any 21 days after an order is made.  We would have had plenty of time and we would not now be suggesting the avoidance of a situation which a decision of this House will create. First of all, it would be too late to allow the candidate to stand.  Had we dealt with this three months ago the Minister would have had his 21 days to remedy the situation and the House would have had an opportunity of debating the order here, as we are now debating the Bill itself, and the decision of the House would put the matter beyond doubt.  Instead of that the Minister is now going full speed into the fences; he has not sufficient time to take them and he is coming a cropper.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Esmonde</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Molloy accepts the amendment except for the last few words&mdash;&ldquo;without prejudice to anything done thereunder&rdquo;. I have been a little confused listening to Deputy Cunningham because it seems to me there are two voices on this on the Opposition benches.  Indeed, for a few moments, it was rather like the Tower of Babel.  May I bring Deputies' minds back through quite a volume of statutory law?  I think this clause appears in the Succession Act of 1965, which became law in 1967.  I shall take a simple instance we can all understand.  When a person dies, either intestate or having made a will, and representation is made to that person's estate, those seeking representation&mdash;an executor or executors &mdash;are handed a legal document which gives him or them the sole right to deal with the estate.  Suppose by some accident or contrivance, criminal or innocent, that document was wrongly issued and the person or persons holding the document had dealt with the estate, there is a provision in the Act that anything done under that document shall not prejudice the dealing under the document.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FlorenceCrowley" hpid="Mr. Crowley Mr. Crowley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Crowley</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="JohnGrattanEsmonde" hpid="Mr. Esmonde Mr. Esmonde">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Esmonde</NameTxt>
      <P>That is the whole point.  For instance, the Deputy might buy property from the executor so acting and borrow money for that purpose from a bank or building society and subsequently the document used in the transaction upon which the Deputy acted is found to have been wrongly issued, that will not prejudice the Deputy's position if a court subsequently revokes it. Exactly the same situation arises in relation to this section.  It is really quite simple.  This type of phraseology appears all the way through our statutory history.  It is an absolute must.</P>

It could arise in something like striking a rate.  This is an absolute must.  It has been recognised right down from the dim and distant past.  There is no other way of dealing with the problem other than by using these words.</P>

This will affect every party, because I am quite sure all parties are in the same position.  There is one other point which I did not make and I will make it now.  If we could do it next week, that might be a way of dealing with it, but we cannot do that.  If it was done in the way Deputy Molloy is suggesting and somebody was elected because of the fact that, because of an order which was made he was entitled to stand, and if this was not put in and he was subsequently disqualified as a result of an annulment in the House, this man would have lost his job because he was not entitled to stand.

      <P>The problem is created because the Minister brought this Bill forward close to the nomination date.

In that way one individual could be discriminated against by the Minister making such an order.

Passing a motion <Col N="1231" /> afterwards annulling it would have no effect on the elegibility of a certain person to be a candidate.  I accept that an awkard situation has been created due to the Minister's timing in bringing forward this Bill and the fact that the nomination date for the pending local elections is 16th May, which is a short while away.</P>
      <P>This creates a certain problem, but we are not legislating for the 1974 election only.  This Bill will affect all future local elections unless the House amends it, or annuls it, or changes it. The House is being placed in an invidious position in being asked to accept legislation in one way because it would be awkward to accept it in any other way due to the fact that the 1974 local elections are close to hand. This is a great weakness in the Minister's approach in bringing forward this Bill at this late stage.  It will be reflected as a weakness in the Bill itself if it is allowed to go through in that form.  I am stating quite categorically that the precedent for what I am suggesting is established in the Electoral Acts.  There is no point in Deputy Esmonde quoting EEC regulations.</P>

      <P>A Cheann Comhairle, we are not disputing the principle.  We agree with the principle that it can be applied in certain circumstances. We had accepted it in certain circumstances in previous sections.  We do not see that it should be accepted in regard to this section.  It gives extraordinary powers to one man in the whole State where, acting for whatever reasons he may deem fit, he can disqualify an individual from standing for election to a local authority.  That is an obvious weakness which we are pointing out.  We have succeeded in pointing out other weaknesses in the Bill.  I accept that the Minister is in a spot.  He might be prepared to accept my amendment were it not for the fact that he is up against it.</P>

      <P>This question of timing falls back on the Minister's head and on his Chief Whip and on his Government. It is not our fault.  If the Minister is saying that, even in circumstances where there was no election in 1974 and if the special problem that he has created for himself now did not <Col N="1233" /> exist and the election was not coming until 1975, he would adhere to the amendment as it is worded now, I again must emphasise that I could not agree with him that that would be fair and just or that any Minister should be given that type of power where he could deprive an individual of his right to stand and that the Minister could be deemed in the 21 days to have been wrong in his decision but the wrong could not be redressed because the man's opportunity had passed and the nomination date had closed.  It is a bit much that the Minister should be given such power.  The greatest protection of democracy and of the rights of the individual is the authority given by vote of both Houses of the Oireachtas.  That is a principle that is long established. Deputy Esmonde must accept that principle.</P>

If he wants to come to some arrangement with us in relation to the pending election, because of special difficulties, perhaps something can be worked out but I do not think this provision should be contained in legislation which will govern future elections. If the Minister wants to make special arrangements to deal with the 1974 local elections, we are open to discussion on that either in the House or outside it, and to come to some arrangement to meet the special problems the Minister has elaborated in relation to printing and getting certain literature to returning officers. We will accommodate the Minister in relation to that if he can devise some way, but we object strongly to <Col N="1234" /> this provision being written in for all elections.

      <P>Deputy Crowley is now getting into the same confusion as <Col N="1236" /> Deputy Molloy was in a few moments ago.  The position very simply is that if I make an order that order will apply to those who can stand.  Deputy Molloy has at the back of his mind somebody or some section who he thinks should be entitled to stand.  If he brings in an annulment motion and carries it that does not bring in the section he has in mind.  It can annul the order which has been made and I assume a new order will have to be made for the purpose of bringing in.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FlorenceCrowley" hpid="Mr. Crowley Mr. Crowley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Crowley</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>I know, but does the Deputy suggest that if the order were annulled here that would persuade me to go back and bring in somebody else who could not even be debated in the House when the annulment was going through, because all that may be debated is the order and those who are in it?  Let me make it very clear that I will not allow an order to be made which will put a local authority in the position that because of something that has happened&mdash;if eventually an annulment is made&mdash;that somebody who has acted on the council and who has participated in council decisions when serious financial matters have been dealt with, the council should be liable because I failed in my duty to include the very words that Deputy Molloy wants to take out.

      <P>Suppose a convention is held and among the candidates known to be selected by a particular group or party is a clerical officer. This comes to the Minister's notice and if, for the sake of my example, there is only one such clerical officer in the country who has been nominated, if the Minister wishes to debar that clerical officer, having made him eligible in the first order, from standing for election all he has to do under this Bill is write an order and the man is ineligible.  The annulment of <Col N="1237" /> that order can only take place within 21 days.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not accept the Minister's plea to accept his amendment. The only grounds on which he could make any justifiable plea is that he is in a spot and that time has caught <Col N="1239" /> up with him, that he has left it too late to bring in this and that it will create problems for him in making proper arrangements for the procedure in the pending local elections.  That is something we could discuss separately.  But we are talking about legislation that is to go on our Statute Book.  I have given an example of what could happen under the Bill even with the Minister's amendment and the Minister has conceded that this could happen but seems to accept that such a situation should be allowed to happen.  It would be bad legislation if we allowed that situation to develop.</P>
      <P>My point&mdash;I repeat it because some Deputies have come in&mdash;is that the Minister can make an order under the Bill.  He proposes to include clerical officers and a clerical officer is qualified to stand.  The Minister can subsequently disqualify a clerical officer by making an order for which he is answerable to nobody until it is too late.  Nomination day is on 16th May and if there is somebody of a different political party that the Minister does not like who is known on the 14th May to be a candidate for the Fianna Fáil Party and that person is the only clerical officer standing in the whole country, the Minister by a stroke of his pen can disqualify that person and remove his eligibility to be a candidate in that election.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>His decision can only be remedied after the important nomination day has passed.  A decision of the House can annul the Minister's order within 21 days but 16th May would have long passed and although the person again becomes eligible for election in the normal course he would not have an opportunity of standing for election for another five years.  We think that provision, as the Minister has proposed it, does not make every citizen equal in the law.  It is an extraordinary power to give any Minister. The only authority to do such a thing is the Houses of the Oireachtas.  We appeal to the Minister to accept the amendment we offer.  Because of the difficulty he has got himself into in regard to the elections this year, we are prepared to accept an agreed <Col N="1240" /> arrangement to meet the problem but we want our amendment included in the long-standing legislation.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>Take this clerical officer. I make an order which makes him eligible to stand and he is elected. Subsequently, the order is debated in the House and annulled.

      <P>Deputy Molloy wants me to accept an amendment which he has put in but the annoying part about this is that during the Second Reading of the Bill the Deputy suggested that an amendment similar to mine should be put in and I agreed to put it in.  The Deputy said he was not insisting on a statutory order and I told him I would consider it.  I put in a statutory order to be debated within 21 days but now Deputy Molloy is not prepared to accept <Col N="1241" /> what he asked for.  He now wants another amendment accepted.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Mr. Molloy Mr. Molloy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>What about the 21 days and the last sentence in the Minister's amendment?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>There was no question of 21 days at the time the discussion took place.  We are in the situation that Deputy Molloy is prepared to accept my amendment if I leave out the portion which states:</P>
      <P>... the Order shall be annulled accordingly, but without prejudice to the validity of anything previously done thereunder.</P>
      <P>I would not be doing my duty if I did not insist on putting that in because of the fact that it would mean that I would be leaving local authorities, in the event of an annulment taking place, in a very serious position.  I have been asked to give a promise to include this in the next legislation. I could say that I would do that and that would be all right with Deputy Molloy, but I do not think it would be fair for me to do so.  In my own opinion and the advice I got the amendment I have suggested is the correct one.  However, I would be prepared to have a look at it again. That is not promising that I am going to bring in immediate legislation in order to deal with it.  That is as far as I can go.</P>
      <P>I would be prepared, when amending legislation is being introduced, to have another look at it but I would not be prepared to go any further because it would be unfair to promise something which I do not believe in.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Mr. Molloy Mr. Molloy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>It is practically impossible for us to accept the argument the Minister has made as to why it would not be possible to accept our amendment.  If the Minister came clean with us and told us that the only problem he had was the immediate one in relation to the local elections that we are facing but that our amendment in the long-standing legislation would be acceptable, we could consider that position.  The Minister is asking us to accept that his amendment be included not just to meet his <Col N="1242" /> immediate problem this year but to be included in legislation to govern the running of these elections for as long as these Acts are there.</P>
      <P>Either the Minister has failed to understand the point we have been making or else he is seeking extraordinary powers for any individual in the amendment.  I am not anxious to continue repeating myself because the points are simple and I have given examples of what can happen.  I have given examples of the weakness of the 21 day provision where a person could be disqualified for the operative period and become qualified after the operative date, something which is of no value to him.  That person could be deprived of rights which the Oireachtas deemed he should have.  If the Minister thinks about this again he will agree that what he is saying is not valid and will not stand up to any examination.</P>
      <P>What we are asking is that the Oireachtas be the one to give authority to these orders, that no Minister has the right to make these orders off his own bat and that the only authority to make such orders rests with the Oireachtas.  We are asking-also that the order not come into operation until that authority is given by the Oireachtas.  I am talking in the long-term now and about the inclusion of this Act on the Statute Book, not about this year.  It is a bad principle that the Minister is asking for and we could not agree to it. We will agree to meet the Minister's special problems in some way this year if the Minister can suggest a way, but he should not ask us to agree to the inclusion of that amendment as it stands.</P>

    <P>I have had inquiries made however about waiting lists for various out-patient clinics at this hospital and am satisfied that delays are a problem at present.  I understand that additional clinics have been introduced for some specialties in recent months in an attempt to improve the situation. I understand also that further improvement is anticipated when a second surgeon, already approved, is appointed to Ennis County Hospital and when additional ophthalmic clinics are introduced.  These developments should improve the situation <Col N="1245" /> but I shall keep the situation under close review.  If however the Deputy has problems in specific areas I would be glad to hear from him.</P>

    <P>At present three new welfare homes are under construction&mdash;one each at Newcastlewest, Nenagh and Roscrea. It is expected that these will be completed in the period 30th June to September, 1974.  These will between them provide an additional 120 beds. The Mid-Western Health Board is keeping the question of institutional care for geriatric patients under review, but I think that the provision <Col N="1246" /> of these three new welfare homes will alleviate the present problem considerably.</P>
    <P>I should mention that the provision of extra beds in institutions is not always the best solution to the problem of the care of the aged.  In many cases it is much better to try to help old people to continue living in their own homes, with the assistance of home helps, meals-on-wheels, etc.  I am endeavouring to improve these and other community services as part of the development of our community care programme.</P>

      <P>No proposal has been submitted to my Department for the construction of a third bridge to relieve traffic in Sligo.</P>
      <P>I have given an approval to the corporation to seek revised proposals from their consultants for a review of certain aspects of the Sligo traffic study in the light of changes that have occurred in recent years and from this review to make recommendations as to the measure required to provide the borough with an adequate roads system, including, if necessary a new bridge.</P>

      <P>As the Deputy knows, a study was carried out in 1968.  Because of the development of the new industrial estate in the south western section of the borough, approval was given to the corporation to update certain aspects of that study in a letter dated 9th April 1974.  The reference to the consultants included that the consultants were to report on the atmosphere of the eastern by-pass and river crossing, combined with the additional traffic management measures in providing relief from congestion in this area and adequate circulation of traffic over a 25-year period. In the event of two bridges not being adequate, the consultants are to investigate and report on an alternative traffic system with particular regard to the western relief road via Main Street, Adelaide Street and Union Street, a new river crossing near the Custom House.  It is expected that the conclusions will include <Col N="1258" /> a recommendation for the provision of a new river crossing in Sligo.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. R. Ryan)</NameTxt>
      <P>I have seen reports of a reduction in lending by the Agricultural Credit Corporation this year. Such reports are not correct and are highly irresponsible.  With an approved budget of £45.0 million for 1974-75 the corporation can increase the high level of business which they had in 1973-74.  The budget approved for ACC for the period April to December, 1974, is £34.0 million compared with actual lendings of £29.0 million in the corresponding period in 1973, an increase of over 17 per cent.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>The ACC are charged, by statute, with responsibility <Col N="1261" /> in these matters, not the Minister for Finance.  From time to time the ACC vary the conditions which they attach to applications or to the type of applications they are prepared to meet. Of course, in the changing circumstances of modern agriculture, these are more than likely to change, not in this year alone, but in future years as well.  All these changes are occurring for the purpose of bringing greater benefit to the agricultural community because it is acknowledged that agriculture in Ireland must be restructured and loans will be paid accordingly to achieve these goals.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Labour (Mr. M. O'Leary)</NameTxt>
      <P>One of my main concerns, as Minister for Labour, is the improvement of the position of working people in this country and this includes constant efforts to upgrade their status. The resources of my Department are being continuously used with this aim in mind.</P>
      <P>To this end legislation already passed in this House includes:&mdash;</P>
      <P>(a) Giving all industrial workers the right to three weeks paid annual leave and an extra public holiday on New Year's Day;</P>
      <P>(b) Giving all industrial workers the right to have minimum notice in the case of termination of employment of up to eight weeks depending on their years' service:</P>
      <P>(c) Substantially improving the redundancy payments scheme by</P>
      <P>(i) extending weekly payments in the case of older workers;</P>
      <P>(ii) giving workers the right to 100 per cent of pre-redundancy pay;</P>
      <P>(iii) bringing 35,000 more hitherto ineligible non-manual workers into the scheme.</P>
      <P>Further proposals to give statutory backing to the concept of the dignity of all who work whatever their ranking in the firm are under consideration. These include proposals for legislation on unfair dismissals to outlaw the unfair dismissal of workers and to provide for compensation where necessary; hours of work legislation to provide for minimum hours of work and to end the exploitation of children; worker participation legislation to give workers a say in the decisions of their firms; and general antidiscrimination legislation, of which that relating to the pay of women is a beginning.  I hope to have all this legislation passed by the end of the year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Enhancing the status of the worker <Col N="1268" /> in his workplace will make little difference to the economic position of Irish workers unless they are provided with extra skills.  Accordingly, as I have already announced, it is intended to expand our direct training capacity fourfold by 1978.  In over 75 per cent of the country at the moment, no place is more than 30 miles from a training centre.</P>
    <P>Similarly the National Manpower Service of my Department is continuing to expand in keeping with the demand for its services.  Four new offices were opened in the last year at Longford, Tralee, Castlerea and Clonmel and further offices will be opened at Bantry, Nenagh and Tullamore in the near future and one in Carrick-on-Shannon later.</P>
    <P>I might mention finally that in discussions in Brussels the interest of Irish working people is brought to bear in formulating social policy in the Community.  In adopting the Social Action Programme 1973-76 last year notable advances were made in improving the provisions in the Commission's original draft in regard to worker participation, women, safety, health and welfare of workers and the European Social Fund and at the instance of the Department of Social Welfare in regard to the underprivileged and the handicapped.</P>

        <i>(Cavan):</i> In my opinion the legislation and the regulations that are there are adequate to divide commonages provided one gets the goodwill and co-operation of the owners.  I do not think any legislation would improve the situation unless it were possible to devise legislation which would change the human approach to things and I doubt if legislation would be helpful in that respect. It is a human problem.</P>

        <i>(Cavan):</i> We have adequate compulsory powers and, if compulsion would solve the problem, everything would be all right.  In my opinion, compulsion never solves problems; it only leads to further problems, with bad feeling and endless trouble.  I had an opportunity of seeing some commonages in the Erris district of Mayo, three large tracts of commonage, and I am pleased to be able to tell the Deputy that in two out of three of these&mdash; there were about 30 people involved in each case&mdash;full agreement was reached.  The Land Commission is now stripping the ground and providing money for fences and so on.  In the third commonage, about two out of approximately 30 involved are not willing as yet to co-operate, but negotiations are continuing.  There is a massive community job to be done by voluntary organisations and, indeed, by Deputies and others in those areas in which you have this commonage problem.  I am convinced from my short experience, and it is short, that it will not be possible to divide commonages and leave behind one a reasonably happy state unless one gets the goodwill of those involved.</P>

I wish to take considerable note of the question put down by Deputy Timmons because I believe it was motivated by serious concern.  I am sorry it was exploited in the way it was.  There is a great deal of vandalism and we are very concerned about it.  That vandalism has grown out of the great neglect of the urban problem which has prevailed over nearly two decades in the past.

      <NameTxt>Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. Keating)</NameTxt>
      <P>Particulars of all price increases recommended to me by the National Prices Commission are available from the commission's published monthly reports which are in the Oireachtas Library <Col N="1277" /> and which are also circulated to each Deputy.  On the days on which the monthly reports were published I indicated in a Press statement that, with certain specified exceptions, I had accepted the commission's recommendations for price increases for the firms concerned and that I would raise no objection to the implementation of these increases.</P>
      <P>Separate announcements were made in the cases where I did not accept the National Prices Commission's recommendations. Only four such cases arose in the period in question.</P>
      <P>Every application for a price increase is examined to ensure that any increase in price is fully justified by actual vouched increases in materials or overhead costs or by actual wage and salary increases which conform to Government guidelines.  In addition the National Prices Commission have had in-depth studies of proposed increases carried out by consultants in about 70 cases since March, 1973.</P>
      <P>In several of their reports&mdash;for example, for August-September, 1973 &mdash;the National Prices Commission have analysed the main reasons for price increases and have commented on them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EugeneTimmons" hpid="Mr. Timmons Mr. Timmons">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Timmons</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="JustinKeating" hpid="Mr. Keating Mr. Keating">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>I certainly do not refuse to give the number.  If we take a specific example the Deputy will see that in actual addition, some of what is contained in the annual NPC Reports could come out very differently, depending on the assumptions made.  Let us take a case in point where there is a particular product and there are a number of different listed brands.  Let us take an increase in the price of petrol.  Do you count the increase which is listed in the NPC Report for each brand of petrol as one price rise, or do you count it four or five times?  If you do not <Col N="1278" /> set out exactly the criteria of selection, it is possible to move the figure up and down almost at will.  I have indicated that these are published in the NPC Reports and that, according to the criteria they wish to apply, people may do the simple addition sum.  To answer the Deputy's question, it simply is not possible to give a single figure without dozens of pages of definitions as to exactly what the basis of selection was in each case.</P>

Is it not true that over 2,000 items have been increased in price in that period and that the Minister is so ashamed of his performance as Minister for Industry and Commerce that he is not willing to reveal that number to this House?

      <P>As they have been in the past, yes, and as was given in a reply on my behalf in my absence last Thursday.  In the matter of the number, the Deputy can make any tot he likes according to the criteria he chooses to use.  The number of price increases is very large but it is impossible to put an exact figure on it for the reasons I have stated.  It is simply a matter of definition.  If, for propaganda purposes, the Deputy wants to put the figure of 2,000 on it he is welcome.</P>

      <P>I was asked if any in-depth study had been made to identify the controllable element.  I said that the NPC had in-depth studies of proposed increases carried out by consultants in about 70 cases.  Some of this material has been published in the special reports of the NPC which are circulated to Deputies, some in the monthly reports.  In fact, there is a vast amount of information and there has been a very substantial barrage of activity as a result of that information which very considerably exceeds the amount of price control activity in most of the countries of Europe at this time.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JustinKeating" hpid="Mr. Keating Mr. Keating">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not quite clear that I grasped the question entirely. Perhaps the Deputy will correct me if I misunderstand him.  There are, indeed, circumstances where inefficiency on the part of firms does contribute to inflation but one is always faced with the prospect that it is very easy in such circumstances to cause bankruptcies and, indeed, to cause unemployment and if one is excessively ruthless in the application of price control one produces that result which I am sure nobody wishes.  The question of producing the optimum of efficiency in all of the firms which are supplying the Irish retail market is an enormous question for which there is no simple solution although there have been initiatives in the area of management expertise going back over 20 odd years by the IMI and many other organisations.  It is a real problem but not one easy of solution and it is easy to produce bankruptcies and to produce unemployment.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JustinKeating" hpid="Mr. Keating Mr. Keating">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>This is moving very far away but I will try to help the Deputy.  From the insurance companies' point of view the manner of presentation is that they try to balance the amount gathered in premiums against the amount paid in claims and if the latter is the bigger figure then they say they are making a loss but, of course, insurance companies have large amounts of funds accruing from premiums and in other ways at their disposal from which they earn investment income and that would certainly be taken into account, if not in the publicity of the insurance companies, in the calculations of the NPC and my Department.</P>

      <P>In the absence of Deputy Enright I should like to ask the Minister is he aware that the Vice-President of the European Parliament announced in Portlaoise in March last that a suitable alternative industry had been procured for those premises in Portlaoise, whereas a week later his colleague, Deputy Flanagan, announced that there was not a prospect of its coming?  Is the Minister aware that as a result of these conflicting statements made by Government Deputies in the constituency in relation to a replacement industry for the industry mentioned in the reply, the former workers and generally the people of Portlaoise are in a state of bewilderment because recently the IDA indicated that the party that were originally interested and who were subsequently reported to have gone elsewhere are still interested?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JustinKeating" hpid="Mr. Keating Mr. Keating">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>We have an example here of the danger of saying too much at an early stage.  I would, of course, reject the suggestion that members of the Opposition had no part in the existing unfortunate confusion.  The fact of the matter is that negotiations did reach an advanced stage in March of this year in regard to a firm which was to take over the premises but the negotiations did not end in the signing of an agreement and in the going ahead of that firm.  The negotiations were advanced but did not go to completion.  There was some publicity about this and I can understand that there is some uncertainty in Portlaoise as a result, which I regret.  But, the effort, as I have said, to find a replacement industry is continuing vigorously <Col N="1282" /> and if I do not say more it is not because of indifference but because I am not anxious to provide information at a time when things are uncertain.  Were I to do that I might contribute more to the sort of insecurity that the Deputy refers to and which I very well understand.  It is not a matter of indifference; it is certainly not that the situation is hopeless but sometimes premature disclosure is unhelpful.</P>

      <P>I fully accept and fully agree with the Minister that I should not press him for further information if that would in any way interfere with prospects.  What the Minister said would in a way indicate that the premature announcement did interfere with prospects.  The Minister indicated that the Opposition&mdash;in this case I would be 50 per cent&mdash;did contribute to the confusion.  Is the Minister alleging that I in any way contributed to this confusion?  I am fully conscious of what the IDA are doing and am always extremely pleased with what they do.  I did not contribute to the confusion.

The Department considered this a favourable proposition and the manager was so informed. There was a question of building a road on portion of the site and it now appears that the county council will CPO an 11-acre site adjoining the St. Brigid's school and give four acres to the parish in exchange for the football field.  Until the site proposals are resolved no further accommodation can be provided at the school other than one pre-fab classroom which is now being planned to meet, at least in part, the immediate problem.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. Bruton Mr. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>The position is that the Department's primary inspectors who are the Minister's expert advisers in relation to this matter have advised against recognition on a number of grounds, which I could, if the Deputy wishes, summarise.  As regards developments since, I think one important factor is the development in relation to the recognition for degree purposes of the existing primary teachers training course.  This will have a considerable effect on the standard which will be required in relation to the preparation of primary teachers which would in turn affect the standard that would be applied in deciding any question regarding the recognition of the Montessori course for primary teaching training.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DavidAndrews" hpid="Mr. Andrews Mr. Andrews">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Andrews</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. Bruton Mr. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>The grounds on which the primary inspectors of the Department advised on this matter are as follows:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>(a) The new curriculum for primary schools has been designed in accordance with modern ideas on child development to provide them with the kind of variety of opportunities they require to achieve the fullest personal development.  It takes account of the <Col N="1287" /> results of educational research, especially in the fields of language teaching and mathematics, and urges the adoption by teachers of a flexible, eclectic approach to teaching methods.  The Montessori teacher is trained exclusively in accordance with the principles of education and teaching methods formulated by Dr. Montessori. This rather rigid dependence on one approach to teaching is contrary to the spirit of the new curriculum. The difference between the two approaches is so pronounced that it is not considered that both could operate side by side in an ordinary national school without creating confusion for both teachers and pupils.</P>
    <P>(b) It is considered that the Montessori system allows excessive freedom to pupils to chose what subjects appeal to them, that there is excessive individualism with corresponding lack of emphasis on the pupil's place as a member of society.</P>
    <P>(c) There are doubts about its efficacy in language teaching and in the teaching of mathematics.</P>
    <P>(d) The equipment necessary is very expensive, and</P>
    <P>(e) The academic content of the training course has not been demonstrated to be on the level obtaining in the training colleges for national teachers.</P>
    <P>This is the professional advice of those competent to advise the Minister on such matters and I hope that in setting it out in this way as requested by Deputy Andrews it will prove helpful to those concerned, including the Deputy.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cooney</NameTxt>
      <P>Normally, when a person in public service is moved to a new post there is a higher initial allowance to cover the first period in the new post because there may be extra expense involved until the person can settle into a permanent or semi-permanent residence at a different rate.</P>

      <P>There are some cases where a permanent residence is not available and these gardaí have to go to the nearest hotel.  Should that not be regarded as being in the same category as the first 14 days?  If the garda goes to a hotel or guesthouse during his first 14 days and if, due to circumstances he is compelled to stay there, surely there is a case to be made that the subsidy for those 14 days should continue if the conditions are the same, and they are the same.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMarkCooney" hpid="Mr. Cooney Mr. Cooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cooney</NameTxt>
      <P>Consultation refers mainly to other interested Government Departments.  For example, there was a recommendation in the report that maintenance allowances would become payable by the local authority or the Department of Social Welfare.  This raises matters of far-reaching implications and these Departments will have to be consulted fairly fully in relation to this.  There is the recommendation that a full-time solicitor should be appointed to act in maintenance cases. I have just now set up a working party to advise on legal aid and their recommendations will be pertinent to this. They may accept this recommendation or they may be offering variations on it.</P>
      <P>In addition, there will have to be consultation within my own Department on quite a novel legal proposition. For example, the proposal that the registration of a maintenance order could be registered as a lispendens. This would, in effect, be giving to the District Court power which up to now has only been available to the High Court.  Again, there is the question of excluding a spouse from the family home.  It is not clear if this relates to a spouse who has left the family home or a spouse who is in the family home and is an unworthy spouse.  If it were the latter case it would be tantamount to giving to the District Court power to make a separation order.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1291" /> The Deputy will appreciate that there are matters of considerable legal implication in this which would require careful examination because I would be anxious that the legislation would be effective when it would be finally passed.</P>

I am pleased to record that the discussions which Deputy Cunningham and I had with the Minister, and his officials, have been fruitful to a certain extent in meeting our point of view.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The difficulty at the time was that the Minister had placed himself in a position where the local authority elections were upon us and if our amendment, as such, was to be accepted it would create some difficulties in relation to the forthcoming local elections.  We indicated that we would be prepared to facilitate the Minister in regard to the elections this year but that we wanted a section in the Bill which would apply at all future elections.  The Minister has agreed to <Col N="1294" /> that suggestion and the insertion of the words which he now proposes into his amendment are satisfactory to us.  In other words, his amendment only has effect up to the 1st July, 1975.  That is to allow for the 12-month period after this election in which there could be a petition brought or a case stated for bribery following the local election.  That statutory period of 12 months is written into the sections which we have already agreed to.</P>

      <P>The disqualification for membership of a sanitary authority, or burial board, contained in section <Col N="1295" /> 270 of the 1878 Public Health (Ireland) Act, is being repealed.  This section provides <i>inter alia,</i> that a member of a sanitary authority, or burial board, shall cease to be a member of such authority or board where he (a) acts as counsel, solicitor, attorney or agent for the authority or board; (b) holds any office or place of profit under the authority or board or (c) is concerned in any bargain or contract entered into by or on behalf of the authority or board.</P>
      <P>The extent to which this provision is operative is not clear.  It is very vague.  Arising out of section 24 of the Bill it is necessary to repeal the provisions relating to employment and the provision as regards contracts does not appear to be operative.  I do not think it is a very important item.</P>

      <P>The Minister will appreciate that we would have some difficulty in researching the Municipal Corporations Act, 1882, and the Municipal Elections (Corrupt and Illegal Practices) Act, 1884, and for this reason we would like to have written into this debate what exactly is being repealed here.</P>

      <P>The basic provisions in relation to local election petitions were contained in these Acts and it is necessary to provide for their repeal in so far as they relate to petitions.</P>
      <P>Section 4 of the Local Authorities (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act, 1936, provides that the election of a particular member of a local authority cannot be questioned after one year from the date of the election.  Section 5 provides that an election cannot be questioned after one year from the date of the election.  A provision in section 18 which will have the same effect is contained in the Bill and accordingly these sections are no longer needed.</P>
      <P>Section 46 of the 1941 Local Government Act deals with matters consequential on an election petition. Section 16 of the Bill substantially reenacts the provisions contained in this section.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Section 21 (3) of the Local Government Act, 1955, provides that for the <Col N="1296" /> purpose of employment by a local authority of which he is a member or employment in a major office by a neighbouring local authority, a member is regarded as continuing to be a member for 12 months after he ceases to be a member or until his term of office expires, whichever is the shorter period.</P>
    <P>Under section 24 of the Bill I am declaring a class of employee not to be subject to the employment ban contained in section 21 (1) of the Local Government Act, 1955.  The 12 month rule will have no significance for such a class because they will be entitled to be members and employees at the same time.  The rule would, however, continue to apply to grades for whom the ban on employment had not been removed and would also continue in relation to employment of a member of a local authority in a major office under a neighbouring local authority.</P>
    <P>Another area where the rule would have effect would be if a member of a local authority employed in a grade exempted from the provisions of section 21 (1) were to be promoted to a grade which is not so exempted.  In such a case, even if the person resigned at once from membership of the local authority he would not be eligible for promotion for 12 months or until his normal term of office as a local authority member expired. As a corollary, therefore, to the lifting of the ban on employment of members of a local authority in relation to certain classes of employees it is proposed to remove the 12 months ban from section 21 (3) of the 1955 Act.  A similar ban in relation to VECs and COAs contained in section 70 (1) of the 1925 Local Government Act is also being repealed in section 24 of this Bill.</P>

    <P>This was a point we made in the course of the debate and I am happy to record that in the course of the discussion I had with the Minister when we adjourned at 2 o'clock he agreed to accept this amendment without discussion.</P>

      <P>We debated this for some hours yesterday and finally the Minister agreed that he would accept the amendment, which I had put in during the course of Committee Stage, when we got to Report Stage.  The Chair at that time stated that we would be allowed a Committee Stage discussion on this amendment.  I understand the Minister is agreeing to accept the amendment without discussion.</P>

    <P>(2) An order made under this section shall not exclude an employee who is a member of the administrative staff down to and <Col N="1298" /> including the rank of clerical officer from the operation of section 21(1) of the Local Government Act, 1955.</P>
    <P>This amendment repeats in most of its terms the amendment which stood in my name on Committee Stage and which was voted down by the Government. During the course of that discussion the Minister stated that my original amendment was couched in words which were too broad and that it would have effects other than the effect which I had intended when putting down the amendment which was to exclude the staff in the category of clerical officer in local authorities from standing for election to those local authorities.  We feel this is basic and fundamental to the continuance of proper local democracy at local government level.  We appeal to the Minister to accept this amendment.  We could then carry on without any further discussion on it. I explained my reasons for putting it down on Committee Stage.</P>

      <P>I have already told Deputy Molloy that I am not in a position to accept this amendment.  It was debated yesterday and voted on. I regret that I am not in a position to accept it.  I do not propose to accept it and I gave my reasons yesterday.  There is a very good reason for including the class of employee which has been referred to. Since they will be the only clerical grade who will be eligible I think they should be included.  I am not prepared to accept at all that clerical officers have the right to make decisions which is the really important thing and I am not prepared to agree that the fact that they have access to certain documents is as important as is being claimed by the Opposition.  I am rather surprised at the attitude of some people on the opposite side to those people, giving the impression that they are a very important section who would have very great influence on decisions.  The case was also made by Deputy Brennan yesterday that they would be very well informed members if they were appointed, that they would <Col N="1299" /> know everything and would pass it on to the people who would be making representations.  The day is long past when the fellow who is first with the news is accepted as the person who made proper representations.  If we accept that as being the norm, there are certain people who should be at the head of the poll on each occasion and are not.  I see no reason to change my mind on what I said yesterday.  I regret that I am not prepared to accept the amendment.</P>

      <P>The Minister says he gave reasons for not accepting our amendment yesterday.  I spent a considerable amount of time here and I did not hear him giving any reasons except that he wanted to encourage job democracy, he wanted the clerical officer to have a chance of partaking in the democratic set-up.  Of course, job democracy and election are two completely different things.  Job democracy has been working for a considerable length of time in local authorities.  Therefore, the Minister's principal argument falls completely flat because that has already been pretty well implemented.</P>
      <P>The Minister has dug in his heels on this amendment.  I must admit he has been very reasonable on the other ones.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FlorenceCrowley" hpid="Mr. Crowley Mr. Crowley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Crowley</NameTxt>
      <P>Not always, but the Minister has proved himself pretty reasonable on our amendments today. Of all the amendments, I cannot understand the Minister's attitude on this one.  A clerical officer has access to privileged, confidential information that could be of tremendous benefit to him as a politician or as a county councillor.  Does the Minister not see a certain threat to democracy in those areas where clerical officers stand for election and are elected? Perhaps the Minister would tell us later if he has had any demand from the Local Government Officials Association for the inclusion in this category of clerical officers specifically. Have official representations been made to him on the matter?  I suppose he would be in a position to <Col N="1300" /> say if unofficial representations were made.  If I were in the Minister's position, I would be very reluctant to go ahead with this proposal.  In fact, I would grasp at the opportunity of accepting our amendment.  Perhaps I may not be in agreement with some of my colleagues that home assistance officers, rate collectors and rent collectors should be debarred.  If we are consistent, clerical officers are in a similar category and, depending on what Department they are working in, they could be in a more powerful position to influence people than the categories I have mentioned.  I would ask the Minister to reconsider the matter.  If he has not made a commitment he will not lose face and, at the same time, he would be doing a good job for democracy.</P>
      <P>We must accept that the vast majority of clerical officers will not have any real interest in going forward for election, and of those who decide to go forward I am sure the vast majority would be very reluctant to abuse their position in their office to further their political career.  If I were representing the same electoral area as a clerical officer and if I had to write to him or to the Department in which he worked&mdash;&mdash;</P>

Frequently, in order to avoid waste of time a member will write <Col N="1301" /> directly to the official concerned.  This is normal practice in local authority operations, especially for county councillors. Perhaps the Minister did not do that.</P>

      <P>It is only a formality to write to the secretary. He does not see nine-tenths of the letters; he merely distributes them. It is naive of the Minister to make that statement or he must expect us to be naive to believe he has not made representations to anyone other than the secretary of a county council.  I am not saying I do not believe him, but I think he may be trying to have us on somewhat.  The Minister should seriously consider the dangers in the situation he is trying to bring about.  There are reports compiled by county managers and secretaries and by the various heads of Departments in each local authority but much of the spade work is done by clerical officers.  While the Minister may be accurate in saying they cannot make decisions&mdash;I accept that&mdash;I submit they can influence decisions by the slant they give to a query or to any report they may be asked to prepare. This should not be tolerated.  We want the best possible service for the ratepayers in our areas but we also want a fair and just service.  If we have a situation where a clerical officer becomes chairman of a county council&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="FlorenceCrowley" hpid="Mr. Crowley Mr. Crowley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Crowley</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister is long enough in politics to realise that a clerical officer could be an Independent candidate and hold the sway in <Col N="1302" /> deciding who would be chairman, as the Coalition have done in Cork Corporation and Cork County Council. As part of the package deal, the clerical officer could be offered the chair for one or two years.  A somewhat similar situation did arise, even though the Minister may be surprised at such shenanigans.  Possibly when he is another 26 years in politics he will realise that fact.  The Minister must accept this situation could arise. There would be the invidious situation where a clerical officer became chairman of a county council and directed the county manager to do certain things.  In turn the manager, being his boss, could put pressure on him not to do certain things.  The Minister has not made one solid argument to substantiate his proposal to include clerical officers except to say that for the sake of job democracy they should be included.  In addition, a situation could arise where clerical officers who were involved in the preparation of certain reports or in the drawing up of policy documents&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>The Minister is a man who believes in the independence of local authorities from the officials. This will be open to a lot of abuse.  It is all right to say that a clerical officer is way down the ladder, but there is the feeling abroad that you are better off to go to somebody in the office than to go to a public representative, even a county councillor.  I can see that the political parties will be recruiting these types of candidates.  We could eventually end up with the majority of the elected members on a county council being clerical officers. The county manager and the county engineer would be members of the county council too.  I would not like to see a clerical officer stand up against either of these bosses.  I would not like to be him when he goes back to his office in the evening.  I would hate to be a clerical officer and a county councillor and try to be independent. In such a case there would be a certain amount of reserve because of the two bosses sitting at the top of the table.  After all, the clerical officer is employed by them.  I cannot see why the Minister is excluding staff officers and other field officers.  By including clerical officers the Minister is leaving this open to abuse.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am surprised that the Minister is doing this.  I admire him for his views that public representatives should be independent.  Public representatives should not be under an obligation to anybody.  They should be free to stand up and have their say even if they are beaten in a vote, for that is democracy. This is a dangerous section in the Bill.  I do not know if it is too late to put down an amendment but I would not like to let this Bill pass through the House without expressing my opinion.  I express my opinions anyway and if anybody does not like them they can lump them.  I have no objection to a clerical officer or anybody else being on the Galway or any other county council but I fear the position <Col N="1305" /> in which they would find themselves if they spoke their minds while their boss was sitting at the top of the table.  The Minister should consider this point.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>I have listened to Deputy Callanan who, as a member of a local authority, is highly respected. He has devoted his life to the service of his fellow man and various organisations with a variety of interests. The Minister would travel a long road before he would find a man with the practical outlook and experience which Deputy Callanan has.  The Deputy put his arguments against the Minister's proposals in relation to clerical officers in a nutshell.  He also spelled out what, in his opinion, the dangers of such a move would be.  I would put twice as much store by the Deputy's opinion than I would put on the views the Minister has been expressing here today.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>I have great respect for Deputy Callanan and I would put more store on his views than I would on Deputy Molloy's.  That will not do Deputy Molloy or me any harm.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Mr. Molloy Mr. Molloy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister does not have to display his petty mind every five minutes.  We are entitled to speak in this House.  There is a danger that if I keep to this sort of talk I will be dragged down into the Minister's mire and I do not want to go down there.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We in the Fianna Fáil Party have made known some of the reasons why we are opposed to this.  We believe that most people in this House <Col N="1306" /> if asked to give an honest view on this proposal would agree with the stand we have taken.  We have been driven into a situation where the Minister is refusing to budge.  Because he is adopting an obstinate stand, he is blinding himself to the reasoned arguments against his proposals.  Before it is too late we are making a final plea to stop this deed being done.  We feel it is in direct conflict with the true principles which should apply in the operation of local government, the element of local democracy which we are anxious to sustain and the respect which we are anxious to encourage among the community for local authorities.  We have given instances of some cases where, because of the attitude displayed so far, there has been no reasoned reaction.  There has been no reasoned explanation for the Minister's stance.  It seems to be pure obstinacy.</P>
    <P>Several anomalous situations could arise if this was agreed to.  Take, for example, the Enniscorthy Urban District Council.  I am informed that there are two officials attached to that council, the town clerk and a clerical officer.  If, in the election of the elected members to that urban district council, the clerical officer decides to stand as a candidate and is elected, one will find oneself in the ridiculous situation where, at the first meeting of the council, the town clerk has no clerical officer because his clerical officer is facing him as an elected member.  No one can convince me that in such a circumstance there is no conflict of interest between the loyalty due by the employee of the urban district council to his senior officer, the town clerk, and his loyalty to the electorate who put him there to represent their interests on the council. The Minister seems to be arguing the point that such a situation would not create a conflict of interest.  We submit that it would.  It would create a ludicrous and laughable situation. We have been asked to legislate for it here.  We do not agree with it.  Therefore, we cannot be asked to support it.  The Minister is depriving the community of its right to elect representatives who will act as a buffer between them and the bureaucrats.  He is depriving <Col N="1307" /> them in that he is now encouraging the bureaucrats to fill the positions on the elected local bodies.</P>
    <P>I have knowledge and experience of an incident where an officer of a local authority was involved in a voluntary capacity in another organisation which had dealings with the local authority in which he was employed.  This man was chairman of that other body.  The body of which he was chairman decided at a meeting on one occasion to take certain steps because of the inactivity of the local authority in relation to the provision of certain facilities for them. The officer of the local authority, who was chairman of that body, was approached by his immediate senior officer, the town clerk.  He was reprimanded and approached by the county manager and told that he would expect more of a member of his staff.  In that situation the manager&mdash;to my way of thinking&mdash;acted unfairly in relation to that member of his staff who was within his rights as a citizen in acting in whatever way he could and the only way in which he could be challenged on it would be before the courts.  Because he was inhibited in this way he resigned from chairmanship of the voluntary organisation of which he was a member.</P>
    <P>If it happened in a simple case like that, would not the conflict be much greater where the officer of a local authority was an elected member and, with the information he would have from the office, he would know at meetings of the local authority whether the manager or any other official addressing the elected councillors was, in fact, telling the truth or the whole story?  He would be in a position to embarrass and challenge the officials at the head of the table sitting beside the chairman of the council.  It would create many situations which would be deplored normally by reasonable people.  It seems quite extraordinary that the Minister has persisted in his insistence that this provision remain in the Bill and that he opposes our amendment which allows him to include this provision <Col N="1308" /> in an order subsequently.  Our amendment is worded in such a way that no matter what order the Minister makes under this Bill he cannot include the clerical level of staff upwards.  Remember that in some authorities the total number of elected members can be as low as 12. Galway Corporation elects 12 members. I am nearly sure that there would be around 12 clerical officers working for the local authority in Galway.  One could extend that idea as allowed now by the law, as the Minister suggests, and imagine a situation where the 12 of them were elected as the 12 councillors.  It might be stretching the imagination a bit far but it is certainly not prohibited by the Bill or under any order the Minister would be entitled to make under it.</P>
    <P>Where are all the pious words said at various places by the Minister and other members of his Government before they were elected, at the time of their election and since their election encouraging the expansion of local democracy, encouraging people to take a greater interest in local authorities and the move, which both sides of the House support, to give more power to local authorities by devolving more responsibility from the Department of Local Government and allowing more decision making at local level?  If the purpose of all of this is to have the people's representatives replaced by bureaucrats, then we consider it to be a detrimental step.  The Minister, quite dangerously, stated yesterday that he was going only a short bit of the way now.  There seemed to be an implication that he might be tempted to go even further.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>I did not say now.  I said I would like to go further.  I am making no secret of the fact but we are not going further.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Mr. Molloy Mr. Molloy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>If we go further, we would end up with a much more laughable situation.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Mr. Molloy Mr. Molloy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>The argument that the Minister has made about clerical <Col N="1309" /> officers not being in this privileged position, which we claim they will be, cannot be substantiated.  Any one with the slightest bit of experience as a councillor or dealing with local authorities knows the privileged position in which such a member of staff finds himself.</P>
      <P>Again, I should like to ask the Minister whether, in fact, the Irish Local Government Officials' Union made an official request to him to grant this concession to clerical officers. And, if such a request was made, would he give me the date upon which it was made?  I occupied the office the Minister now holds from May, 1970 until March, 1973 during which time I had plenty of occasions to meet representatives of the Irish Local Government Officials' Union.  During that time meetings were being held continuously between the officials of that union&mdash;one of the finest in the country&mdash;and officials of the Department of Local Government with my knowledge and reports were given to me on those meetings.  During that period I do not recollect that there was ever any request from the official union which represents the workers in local authorities for the concession which the Minister seems anxious now to grant them.  I would give the Minister time in which to answer whether or not what I am saying is true but there has been silence on this challenge to the Minister.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>Lest there be any doubt about it, the Irish Local Government Officials' Union has made no request to me on this matter nor did I think it necessary for them to do so nor has any other trade union for that matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Mr. Molloy Mr. Molloy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>We have confirmation now of what we suspected all along&mdash; that there has been no desire on the part of the Irish Local Government Officials' Union that staff at clerical Officer level&mdash;members of their union working with local authorities&mdash; should qualify for eligibility to stand as candidates in local elections.  At the union's annual conferences, in the course of its discussions at meetings held in various places once a month up and down the country <Col N="1310" /> where many matters of interest to staff in local authorities are being discussed, where the officials in the union are being asked by the members to make representations in matters which are of concern to them, never on any of these occasions has it emerged that there was any desire whatsoever on the part of officials in local authorities for this concession. One is left with a very large question mark as to why and how this concession is now being granted.  It did emerge during the course of discussion here that a clerical officer working in the Minister's constituency intends standing as a candidate for the Labour Party&mdash;the Minister's own party&mdash;in an electoral area in the Minister's own constituency.  We have no wish to draw the conclusion that this concession is being asked from Parliament merely to facilitate this gentleman.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>It is no more than the Fianna Fáil TD who asked if he would be allowed to stand also.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Mr. Molloy Mr. Molloy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>We do not wish to imply that.  We sought, in the course of this debate, to find some reason why it is being done and that is the only one that has emerged.  If this is so then a most extraordinary and indeed depressing situation has arisen where the Minister is seeking to facilitate a member of his own party. He, very unfairly, has again made reference to a Deputy in this party, who was formally a member of a local authority staff but who on election to the Dáil had to give up that job.  Since his first election to the Dáil and his repeated re-election since he has not been in the daily employ of that local authority.  He has been seconded, as is customary in such cases.  I believe the Tánaiste, Deputy Corish, is probably seconded from the former position he held also.  I am sure there are other Deputies who have given up their employment in order to take their seats in this House.  The Member in question is considering standing as a candidate in his constituency in the local elections. The Minister by some twisting of words tried to convey to the House <Col N="1311" /> that a man, who was a former employee and is now a seconded employee, was in a similar position to the man employed with Meath County Council.  I submit no such comparison can be made.</P>

      <P>The facts are, and the Minister cannot deny them, that there was no such arrangement.  We were stuck on amendment No.2 and on amendment No.3, which I had tabled.  We sorted that out in discussion. I am grateful to the Minister for the manner in which it was sorted out, although it could have been done more quickly in the House.  He has been made quite aware that if he wants this Bill, if he wants agreement on it from the Fianna Fáil Party, all <Col N="1312" /> he has to do is accept this simple amendment standing in my name.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>Any reasonable person would support the stand we are taking on this.  If the Minister wants the Bill let him accept this small amendment which makes no difference to him.  The Bill can then pass from this House because we will make no further contribution to the debate. He can have the Report and Final Stage and it is finished with the Dáil. Amendment No.3 states:</P>
      <P>In page 12, between lines 44 and 45, to insert a new subsection as follows:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1313" /> (2) An order made under this section shall not exclude an employee who is a member of the administrative staff down to and including the rank of clerical officer from the operation of section 21 (1) of the Local Government Act, 1955.</P>
    <P>If the Minister says he wants the Bill we will agree to it and everything in it that has been agreed up to now if he includes that amendment.  It is well within the Minister's capacity to do this.  He has not been asked to make any major concession.  In his introductory speech on this Bill he assured us that the orders which he proposes to make provides that the vast bulk of local government or local authority employees are qualified to stand for election to local authorities when this Bill goes through, even with the exclusion of clerical officers.  The main purpose is to allow manual and other categories of workers, in particular, those not working in local authority offices, to stand for election.  We support that on the basis of the exclusion of anybody working in a local authority office.  Otherwise it is most unjust and unfair.  We believe it could be embarrassing to the Government. It is cutting across a basic principal of democracy and is introducing a new principle into local government law in this country which cannot but be detrimental to the interests of the whole community.</P>
    <P>We feel strongly about it.  The Bill, as accepted up to now, with the addition of this amendment could be agreed to.  We will conclude, there will be no further contribution from the Fianna Fáil benches and the Minister can have his Bill.  Let him not try to accuse the Fianna Fáil Party of holding back this Bill.  It was brought in at a very late stage.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Lands if his Department made any representations to the appropriate EEC institutions prior to the publication of the proposed Council directive on forestry advocating that this directive should apply to public and private forestry operations in Ireland in view of the declining employment prospects and the growing importance of timber; and if he will state the nature of such representations.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Lands (Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick,</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>Cavan):</i> The special position of State afforestation in Ireland has been stressed in the course of discussion with representatives of the EEC both before and since the publication of the proposal for a directive on forestry.  The proposal is still under examination and discussion.</P>
