      <NameTxt>Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Social Welfare (Mr. Cluskey)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="519" /> That the Social Welfare (Members of the Defence Forces) Regulations, 1974, proposed to be made by the Minister for Social Welfare and laid in draft before Dáil Éireann on the 7th day of March, 1974, under subsection (4) of section 10 of the Social Welfare (Pay-Related Benefit Act, 1973, be approved.</P>
    <P>The regulations which are the subject of the resolution which I have moved and those which are covered by the next resolution on the Order Paper deal with the question of bringing non-commissioned officers and men of the Defence Forces within the scope of the scheme of pay-related benefit under the Social Welfare (Pay-Related Benefit) Act, 1973.  I propose, therefore, to deal with both resolutions together.</P>
    <P>I have given details of the pay-related benefit scheme previously to the House but I will repeat briefly the main features of the scheme.  The pay-related benefit scheme is designed for persons whose social insurance covers them for disability benefit, maternity allowance and unemployment benefit.  Pay-related benefit will be paid as a supplement to these flat rate benefits during periods of incapacity for work or unemployment and the rate of pay-related benefit will be based on the claimant's weekly earnings between £14 and £50 in a previous income tax year.  The scheme will be financed by pay-related contributions levied on employers and employees. These contributions will be 3 per cent of the employee's current earnings up to a ceiling of £2,500 in the year, the employer paying 2 per cent and the employee 1 per cent.  They will be collected by the Revenue Commissioners through the income tax collection machinery.  Employees in industrial, commercial and services-type employments in respect of whom the ordinary rates of employment contributions (stamps) are payable were brought within the scope of the scheme by the Act.  Provision was made in section 10 of the Act to enable the scheme to be extended to other employees by regulations, and agricultural workers were recently included <Col N="520" /> in the scheme by such regulations, a draft of which was approved by both Houses of the Oireachtas.</P>
    <P>The position of commissioned officers in the Permanent Defence Forces under the Social Welfare Acts is similar to that of pensionable civil servants, local authority officials, pensionable teachers, <i>et cetera,</i> who are not insured for all the benefits of the social insurance system and who will not come within the scope of the pay-related benefit scheme.</P>
    <P>Non-commissioned officers and men, on the other hand, are covered for all benefits of the social insurance system.  They are not eligible, however, to draw disability benefit or unemployment benefit while serving in the Defence Forces but they pay flat rate social insurance contributions at a special rate while serving and these contributions enable them to qualify for disability benefit and unemployment benefit after they leave the Defence Forces.</P>
    <P>It has always been the intention that coverage of the pay-related benefit scheme should be as wide as possible. Following discussions with the Department of Defence, it was agreed that non-commissioned officers and men of the Defence Forces should be included in the scheme on a basis which would enable them to qualify for pay-related benefit should the need arise after they leave the service.  For this purpose the draft regulations which are the subject of the first resolution will apply the provisions of the Social Welfare (Pay-Related Benefit) Act, 1973, to members of the Defence Forces in respect of whom the special rate of flat rate social insurance contributions are payable.  This will be done by including pay derived from their employment in the Defence Forces in the definition of reckonable earnings for the purposes of pay-related benefit and contributions.</P>
    <P>As I have already mentioned, non-commissioned officers and men of the Defence Forces are not eligible to draw disability benefit or unemployment benefit while in service and, consequently, they will not be eligible, while serving, for pay-related benefit which will be payable <Col N="521" /> as a supplement to those benefits.  It would be inequitable that they should be charged pay-related contributions on reckonable earnings which they will not be able to use to get pay-related benefit.  Provision is therefore made in the draft regulations so that when the stage has been reached where the earnings of a member of the Defence Forces in a particular income tax year can no longer be used for pay-related benefit purposes because he has continued in the service, then an appropriate refund of contributions which were paid on reckonable earnings in excess of £700 in that income tax year may be made.  If, however, the man leaves the service while his earnings in an income tax year can still be taken into account for purposes of the scheme he will, of course, be eligible for pay-related benefit on foot of those earnings and no refund of contributions will be involved. The regulations which are the subject of the first resolution are being made under section 10 of the Act which requires that drafts of regulations must be laid before each House of the Oireachtas and that the regulations cannot be made until the draft has been approved by resolution in each House.  It is intended that these regulations should come into force on 6th April, 1974.</P>
    <P>In the case of persons already included in the pay-related benefit scheme, regulations have already been made to reduce their flat rate employment contributions payable with effect from 1st April, 1974. A draft of these regulations was approved by Dáil Éireann on 12th February, 1974.  It was explained to the House on that occasion that in order to facilitate the collection of pay-related contributions, it would be necessary to charge the 3 per cent pay-related contributions on all earnings up to the ceiling of £2,500 in a year.  The effect of this would be that pay-related contributions would be levied on pay up to £700 in the year which is the equivalent of £14 a week for pay-related benefit purposes. Since pay below £14 a week does not attract pay-related benefit, there would thus be what amounts to an overcharge of pay-related contributions <Col N="522" /> on that amount.  To compensate employers and employees for this overcharge, their flat rate contributions were reduced by 42p, the employee's part being reduced by 14p and the employer's part by 28p. Now that it is proposed to apply the provisions of the Social Welfare (Pay-Related Benefit) Act, 1973, to non-commissioned officers and men of the Defence Forces by regulation, it is proposed also to make similar reductions in the flat rate social insurance contributions payable in respect of them.  The effect of the regulations which are the subject of the second resolution will be to reduce the employee's element of those contributions by 14p and the employer's element by 28p from 1st April, 1974.</P>
    <P>These regulations which it is proposed to make under subsection (9) of section 6 of the Social Welfare Act, 1952, also may not be made until a resolution approving of the draft regulations has been passed by both Houses of the Oireachtas.</P>
    <P>I recommend both the draft regulations for the approval of Dáil Éireann.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PadraigFaulkner" hpid="Mr. Faulkner Mr. Faulkner">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Faulkner</NameTxt>
      <P>I understand we are discussing both regulations together.  I take it that the alterations in the rates of contribution in these cases are similar to those made in the rates of contribution relevant to persons already included in the pay-related scheme.  On a previous occasion I asked the Parliamentary Secretary if he could let me know what the income would be from the 3 per cent which is levied on the gross income of the employee and also what the reduction in the cost of the stamp would amount to.  I should now like him to inform me of the total amount of money which the 3 per cent earnings of members of the Defence Forces who will be included in the pay-related benefit scheme will bring into the fund in a full year and also what the total amount of the reduction in the cost of the stamp will amount to in a full year.  If he is not in possession of that information now, perhaps he will let me have it later.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Social Welfare (Pay-Related Benefit) Act, 1973, made provision for <Col N="523" /> including groups of workers other than those involved in the original measure-agricultural workers, for example.  Quite recently the House unanimously approved the admission of agricultural workers into the scheme.  I now welcome the inclusion of members of the Defence Forces. The greater the number of categories of people we can admit to this scheme the better because we are coming closer to what we all desire, that is, a comprehensive social security scheme for all.</P>
    <P>The pay-related benefit scheme was a very significant step on the road to this comprehensive scheme.  Anything we can do to further the interests of members of the Defence Forces is to be commended.  We are all very proud of our Army and whatever can be done to make service in the Army more attractive should be done.  I believe the change proposed here will help considerably.  In the definition of a member of the Defence Forces it is stated that his employment is mainly employment as a member of the Defence Forces.  What is meant by the word &ldquo;mainly&rdquo;?</P>
    <P>The Parliamentary Secretary pointed out that so long as a soldier is in the service he is not eligible to draw most of the benefits normally available under the scheme.  I understand from his speech that the pay-related contributions collected from him in a year in which he could not qualify will be returned to him.  When are they returned to him?  Is it at the end of the year?</P>
    <P>The Parliamentary Secretary also pointed out that there is a special rate in relation to the cost of the stamp for members of the Defence Forces.  This is right having regard to the fact that while they are in the services they are ineligible to enjoy some of the benefits which accrue from being insured.  The Parliamentary Secretary referred to the case of commissioned officers in the Defence Forces under the Social Welfare Acts and pointed out that they are in a similar position to that of pensionable civil servants, local authority officials, pensionable teachers <Col N="524" /> and so on who are not insured for all the benefits of the social insurance scheme and who will not come within the scope of the pay-related benefit scheme.  This is something which merits further consideration.</P>
    <P>The motion we are discussing deals with regulations which affect NCOs and men.  As the Parliamentary Secretary is aware, many serving officers must retire at an early age.  In fact, they retire at an age which in the context of 1974 is regarded as quite young.  Some of these officers get outside employment when they leave the services but we must also take it that many of them do not get employment or have to wait for quite a considerable time before getting employment. I am sure the Parliamentary Secretary will agree that at that young age the drop in income is quite considerable. There is justification for the inclusion of such people in a pay-related benefit scheme of some kind.  These officers must retire at an age below the normal retiring age in many other similar professions.</P>
    <P>Pensionable civil servants, local authority officials and pensionable teachers retire at 65 years of age but junior officers in the Defence Forces who only reach a certain rank retire at an earlier age.  I know there are difficulties here and that such men unlike the NCOs and men of the Army, are not insurably employed but I feel in the particular context in which these officers find themselves further consideration might be given to this matter to see if there is any way in which they could be included. Their situation is very different from that of people working in the other professions mentioned by the Parliamentary Secretary.</P>
    <P>A considerable number of the newer recruits to the officer corps have now the opportunity of attending university but this does not apply to the older officers nor does it apply to quite a number of the newly recruited officers.  In the explanatory memorandum it is stated:</P>
    <P>Under the scheme, pay-related benefit will be paid as a supplement to the appropriate flat rate benefit at a rate determined by reference to a <Col N="525" /> person's earnings in a previous income tax year.</P>
    <P>First, does this mean that the 3 per cent is not paid on current earnings but rather on the previous year's earnings, and, if this is so, does it mean that the extra amount payable will be based on the previous year's earnings? I ask that question because I feel that if the pay-related benefit is payable on the previous year's earnings in a situation where national wage agreements provide considerable increases in earnings, the relationship between the flat rate plus pay-related benefit would be considerably out of line with current earnings.  I asked the Parliamentary Secretary a question about this in the Dáil some time ago.</P>
    <P>There is another point I should like to have cleared up.  I think I know what the position is but I would prefer to have it clarified here.  I am aware that pay-related benefit contributions will be collected only up to £2,500 a year.  The Parliamentary Secretary has again stated that here.  Does this mean that payment of pay-related benefit will apply only up to £2,500?  Will the maximum benefit payable be the flat rate plus 40 per cent of £50 per week?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>This question may not be very relevant to the Order but has the Parliamentary Secretary any figure for the number of agricultural workers who will benefit under the scheme?  The number on the PAYE list was rather small when I was examining it.  I had a feeling there might be an occasional agricultural worker who would be as happy if he was not fished out at all.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJVMeaney" hpid="Mr. Meaney Mr. Meaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Meaney</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to join with Deputy Faulkner in saying that we are glad these regulations are being brought in.  They are essential at this time because it is not always easy to get young men to join the Defence Forces and we must offer every possible incentive when competing against industry.  We must at least give them the same conditions when leaving the forces as if they were working in industry during the time they serve in the Army.  We are very proud of our Defence Forces; they are doing a very <Col N="526" /> good job.  Too often in the past that fact was not recognised.  When many of these men retire at a very early age it is only right that benefits such as those being introduced today, and with which this party entirely agree, should be available to them.  It is very difficult for those retiring at an early age to get other positions.  I have always thought, and I should like to say very forcefully, especially when the Parliamentary Secretary is here, that there should be more concessions for ex-Army men when they apply for positions outside.  They should get some sort of priority but nowadays they do not seem to get it.  They must take their chance with everybody else and there seems to be no recognition of the fact that they have spent many years serving the country. There should be some scheme in the Department of Social Welfare or the Department of Labour under which they would get priority in applying for positions especially when they have an honourable discharge.  This would give a greater incentive to young men to join.  When joining many young men say they will only stay for so many years, whatever the contract is, and when they come out they have to seek jobs and they are just &ldquo;nobodies&rdquo;.  That is a ridiculous situation.  I should like the Parliamentary Secretary to do whatever he can in his own Department to ensure that such men get priority in applying for jobs.  We do not want to waste time. Deputy Faulkner has asked some questions and I have no doubt the Parliamentary Secretary will reply to them.  Like the other Deputies I welcome these regulations.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrankCluskey" hpid="Mr. Cluskey Mr. Cluskey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cluskey</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the approach to this matter by the Opposition speakers.  I thank Deputy Faulkner, the Fianna Fáil spokesman, in particular for his usual constructive contribution in matters of this kind and I shall reply as best I can to the points made.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Faulkner asked about the income from the 3 per cent to be levied and it is estimated that it will be approximately £12.5 million net and the loss of contribution income by <Col N="527" /> reason of the reduction in the stamps is also estimated to be approximately £12.5 million.  The Deputy also asked about the exclusion of Army officers and, indeed, other categories which are mentioned in the introductory statement.  As the Deputy said, certain difficulties are involved but I recognise the validity of the point he made, particularly in the case of junior officers who are required to retire at a much earlier age than people in other occupations.  This undoubtedly presents problems for them especially those who are not in the Army to avail of university courses that are now available to Army officers.</P>
    <P>We have a particular responsibility to those serving in the Forces, on whom we rely a great deal and anything that can be done to show our appreciation in a practical way for the services they give the nation should be done.  In the background of the difficulties which Deputy Faulkner has acknowledged to exist in this field I shall have the matter examined to see if there is any way of devising some means of allowing for the fact that Army junior officers have to retire at an early age.</P>
    <P>The Deputy also raised the question of the 3 per cent on current earnings. There is a ceiling in regard to pay-related benefit and it is £2,500.  A job will not attract pay-related benefit below £14 per week or above £2,500 a year.  The benefits are paid on reckonable earnings within the previous income tax year.  A concession is made in that on the reckonable earnings a 4 per cent advanage is built in; the £2,500 is divided by 50 instead of 52.</P>
    <P>There was some speculation regarding the figure at the cut-off point, whether it should be 80 per cent, 90 per cent or 100 per cent of reckonable earnings.  So far as pay-related benefit is concerned, it is intended that the figure will be 100 per cent of reckonable earnings.  This will compensate considerably, even allowing for advances in wages and salaries.</P>
    <P>It has been acknowledged that it is a tremendous improvement of the <Col N="528" /> present system.  It will ease the burden on insured persons who are unfortunate enough to become unemployed or ill and it will take into account the earning capacity of the person concerned. In the past a relatively long period of unemployment or sickness could leave a family in debt for years. We hope the introduction of the pay-related benefit scheme will prevent that situation arising in future.</P>
    <P>Deputy Brennan asked the number of agricultural workers who would be involved.  Approximately 30,000 such workers will be affected eventually by the scheme.  The Deputy mentioned that not all of them might welcome being included but I am sure the Deputy did not mean these people would try to evade income tax.  This scheme will be of considerable benefit to workers who are unfortunate enough to become ill or unemployed.  I have tried to deal with all the points raised. Deputy Meaney raised a matter which I answered in relation to people serving in the Defence Forces.</P>

      <P>I know that.  It was just for the purpose of enabling him to get wound up.  The &ldquo;appropriate officer&rdquo; is mentioned in section 7. I am rather worried about the position of &ldquo;appropriate officer&rdquo; because of the way in which it is proposed to reconstitute various constituencies. We have reached the stage where the Minister feels it is quite possible that the appropriate officer will be given power under this section over and above the power the Minister might consider it appropriate for him to have.</P>

      <P>&mdash;&mdash;than the Minister intends he should have.  The &ldquo;appropriate officer&rdquo; is spelled out here in section 7 (3) (a) and (b).  I want specifically to talk about (b).  In this context he is the secretary of the county council.  Because of the way in which the Minister proposes to reconstitute constituencies we have the situation in an area like East Monaghan where portion of East Monaghan will be in the Louth constituency. The appropriate officer for that specific area as a result of the new linear separation between the constituency of Louth and the Cavan-Monaghan constituency will be the secretary of the Monaghan County Council.  He will need to recreate portion of a polling district and he may have, in fact, to join that with parts of an adjoining polling district or districts.  The secretary of Monaghan <Col N="531" /> County Council in consultation with the returning officer for County Louth will have to recreate that polling district.  We could have a situation in which a polling district in East Monaghan may only have 20 or 30 voters left and that district will have to be re-allocated or joined with an adjoining polling district and that adjoining polling district may be in County Louth.  The appropriate officer for the adjoining polling district might be the secretary of Louth County Council while the appropriate officer for the segment of the old sliced up polling district might be the secretary of Monaghan County Council.</P>
      <P>I am very anxious about the situation in which you could have a polling district in County Louth carrying possibly 150 or 200 voters on the register being joined across the county boundary to portion of a polling district in which there may be 50 voters. It would appear quite rational and logical to me, in any case, to have the portion of the old polling district split in halves and the entire polling district in County Louth joined together but the difficulty here is that there will be two appropriate officers to create that unification of polling districts and there is no provision in the section to cover that kind of situation.  Under the section the Minister cannot interfere. We will have the returning officer for County Louth embracing a small portion of County Monaghan. There is one appropriate officer for the newly created constituency of Louth, but there is the possibility of two appropriate officers being involved and there is no arrangement built into the section to cover that contingency, even though in subsection (3) (a) and (b) there is provision, logically made, whereby if, for any reason, a county council has no county secretary duly appointed at the time or a corporation has no duly appointed manager, someone can act on his behalf or there can be a deputy county secretary or a deputy city manager.  There is, however, no provision for the kind of contingency I have outlined in relation to the breaking up of a polling district as provided for in subsection (1).</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="532" /> This situation can arise in a number of areas.  It can arise in the new Sligo-Leitrim constituency which embraces a small portion of County Donegal.  A most extraordinary incursion has been made into County Donegal.  There is the unnatural inclusion of the Ballyshannon area in an effort to preserve a particular Deputy there.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lalor</NameTxt>
      <P>There may be clashes in interest between the views of conflicting appropriate officers in the rearranging of polling districts following the revision of constituencies.  Some groups of local authority officials are very conscious of their powers and responsibilities. I do not want to see built into this Bill a type of omission where a strong-willed county council secretary of one county will clash with an equally strong-willed county council secretary of another county with the returning officer caught up in a battle of strength between them.  That is why I raised this matter.  I have already shown how this can happen when a small portion of a county is put into a full-sized county to make up a constituency because of the court decision a number of years ago.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The same type of situation can arise in County Louth which has a piece of Monaghan, in Sligo-Leitrim with a piece of Donegal and in South Kerry which has a small piece of West Cork. The appropriate officer in the bridgehead, Birr, is the secretary of the Cork County Council.  In conjunction and following discussions with the returning officer for the South Kerry constituency, he has to agree upon the <Col N="533" /> realignment of a polling district because a small portion of the old polling district of West Cork is now in the South Kerry constituency.  There could be a clash between the secretaries of the Kerry and Cork County Councils as to which of them is the appropriate officer in that instance.</P>
    <P>There is no problem when we are talking specifically about constituencies. At the end of this Bill, the appropriate constituency in which each polling district or section of a polling district is situated will be spelled out. There can be no argument about that. There is no question about which county a polling district is in.  This section is intended to clarify the situation temporarily until such time as the appropriate county councils exercise their statutory rights and create polling districts and cover the making of temporary arrangements in respect of split polling districts.  We are opening the gates for a confrontation between the two county secretaries of adjoining counties where there has been cross-border infiltration from one constituency to another.</P>
    <P>In his reply the Minister may say that this is the same type of section we had previously and that this problem has never arisen.  As I said last night, I do not want to itemise individuals but I can speak objectively on this because my own constituency was not changed.  We have not a problem&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I was dealing with <Col N="534" /> section 7 and pointing out that this section will have no effect on my constituency, which has not been changed. There would have been a clash if our returning officer had to consult with two different county secretaries in relation to the proposed revision which the Minister says Deputy Molloy had in mind.  We did not have a wrong reaction from this section in the 1969 Bill because of the ingenuity of the then Minister for Local Government.  It is on the cards that we can have it now.  I am anxious that the Minister should clarify that particular issue.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>Last night at approximately 10.15 p.m.  Deputy Lalor made what I considered to be a very good point.  He said that while the permanent arrangements allowed the Minister in the event of a dispute as to where people should vote to accept or reject and fix another polling place, in the temporary arrangement this was not provided for and I gave a guarantee that it would be dealt with.  The Deputy accepted that.  That is the only point at issue in this section.</P>
      <P>I do not know how far repetition is allowed in this House or if I am in order in repeating what I said last night in reply to what the Deputy said so well then.  He got so confused at the end of his speech this morning that he cut the ground from under his arguments.  I was inclined to change my mind by the time he was finished.  His point was so absurd that I was surprised he mentioned it at all. Here is the position.  When constituency boundaries span more than one county&mdash;and this occurs in a number of past revisions&mdash;a polling district cannot span a constituency boundary.  It cannot span a county boundary and it cannot span a local electoral area boundary.  Deputy Lalor knows that.  He talks as if we were introducing a new element which has not been introduced before.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should like to give a little bit of what is now history with regard to what happened the last time.  When the Bill was being drafted the last time, the then Minister for Local Government, Deputy Boland, did a <Col N="535" /> little bit of manoeuvring around the part of the country where I was born and reared.  He divided that portion of County Meath not into two constituencies but into three constituencies. Not only had he me in mind but he also had Senator Denis Farrelly in mind because he cut in two the village in which the then Deputy Denis Farrelly was living.  He gave half of it to Monaghan and the other half of it to Cavan.  A few miles away he gave a portion to Meath.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJLalor" hpid="Mr. Lalor Mr. Lalor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lalor</NameTxt>
      <P>Then there were three polling districts.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>No, Kilmainhamwood where Denis Farrelly lives was one polling district.  He divided it into three.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJLalor" hpid="Mr. Lalor Mr. Lalor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lalor</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister said that could not be done.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>I did not.  If Deputy Lalor cannot understand plain English, he cannot blame me.  I am spelling it out for him and if he listens to me as well as I listened to him he will understand a little better what the score is.  Last night I conceded that I thought Deputy Lalor had a good point.  I cannot see why we should have to discuss it for half an hour today.  Since Deputy Lalor wants it that way I should like to refute some of the rather foolish arguments he made.  Ballinlough which is in North Meath was divided between Meath and Cavan with 153 in Meath and 26 in Cavan.  Crossakiel which is in the same area had 186 in Cavan and eight in Meath.  Kilbeg which is in North Meath also had 192 in Monaghan and 52 in Cavan.  Kilmainhamwood had 258 in Monaghan, plus 24 from the Cavan end of it which made it 282 in Monaghan, and seven in Cavan.  He made a real good job of Carlanstown because he had 56 in Meath and 132 in Cavan but 52 of those came from the Monaghan end.  He split it completely and despite that there was no clash.  It worked perfectly because of the arrangement that each county secretary&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>I expected to get a telegram of thanks from Deputy Fitzgerald when he saw what I proposed. I know he has not mentioned it but I thought he would be overjoyed. Where there is a permanent change or a permanent re-arrangement of a polling station, the members of the local authority do that, and that is all right. Where there is a temporary change this is done by the county secretary following discussions with the returning officer.  The returning officer is responsible for the constituency and the county secretary is responsible for the county.  He is the person who fixes the polling station.  There is no doubt about that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Where there is doubt&mdash;Deputy Lalor made this point very well last night and I accepted it&mdash;is that in relation to the permanent ones, if it is considered by the Minister for Local Government that there is something wrong he has the right to alter them. In relation to the temporary ones he has not got that right.  Deputy Lalor suggested that he should have that right.  Having listened to him, I pointed out at 10.15 p.m. last night that I was prepared to have a look at it and to make the necessary change to ensure that he would have that right.  I also pointed out that members of the local authority, members of the county council, can decide at any time to change the electoral areas and the polling stations.  They are entitled to do that and, if they want to do it <Col N="537" /> immediately after a temporary arrangement has been made, they can have a new scheme introduced within a couple of months which supersedes the temporary arrangement made.  It is as simple as that.</P>
    <P>Having accepted what the Opposition wanted me to do and having said I would do it because I think it is a sensible thing to do&mdash;even though when they were in power they thought it was not a sensible thing to do because they left it that way from 1935 or 1936 until now&mdash;I should like to ask the Opposition what they want now.  Why should they continue the discussion on this section if it is not because of the fact that earlier on a statement was made from the Opposition benches that the Bill would be held up on every section, every line and every word.  If that is the reason I can understand what is happening. If that is not the reason, would somebody tell me, since I have agreed to do what they asked me to do, why should we still have people getting up and repeating it?  Last night Deputy Lalor was right on the point and explained it well.  Today he was not so good.  As a matter of fact, he confused himself a bit and I am afraid that he might confuse other people in the House and, therefore, prolong the discussion. I said before that I am prepared to tighten up what he considers wrong and what I consider to be a mistake so that it cannot occur again. We have had quite a long discussion on this section and on the two amendments and I consider it a complete waste of the time of the House to have repetition of what was already said.</P>

We believed that, such a statement having been made by the Minister, it would be reasonable to assume that he would agree to changes on the lines suggested by us. Deputy Molloy and I on one occasion, and Deputy Molloy and another Member on another occasion, set out the particular changes that embodied what we had been recommending only to find that the Minister on reconsideration of the matter decided that they were not good, correct or proper. As a result of the advice he received we were informed that the matters which he thought were acceptable and superior to what was there would not be accepted.</P>

If the Minister is prepared to do that and provided that what he is prepared to do is what Deputy Laior has been suggesting and which the Minister agrees is sensible, correct and an improvement on the section as it stands, we can leave that particular point.  The House will appreciate our difficulty in being told by the Minister that something suggested from this side of the House is bad and good and then we discovered a day or two later that the Minister is not prepared to accept it. I do not want that situation to arise again and that is why I am inviting the Minister to put the matter beyond any doubt and not to allow the situation which has arisen before to arise again.

      <P>A lot of this discussion could be avoided by the Minister spelling out the amendment he is prepared to make to this section at Deputy Lalor's suggestion.  As a result, Deputy Lalor, and other Members, will have to continue to argue the point even though it seems to be accepted generally that the point they have argued is valid and should be accepted.  If there are any complaints about the length of the discussion of this or any other section it can be seen at whose door the fault for that situation lies.  The whole argument on this particular point can be brought to an end by the Minister spelling out the amendment he is prepared to make.  I have already invited him on two occasions to do that.  I sat down to give him an opportunity to do so but he has arrogantly refused to do it.</P>
      <P>With regard to the section generally, one of the first matters that struck me about it was that in subsection (3), for some reason, the type of officer who is designated as the appropriate officer for a county borough and the appropriate officer for the county council area differs fairly significantly in the rank of the officer concerned.  In county boroughs the officer is the county manager but for some reason in county councils, according to paragraph (b) of subsection (3) the appropriate officer is the secretary of the county council.  I have no objection to the secretary of a county council acting as such because such men have acted properly in this capacity in the past, but on the face of it the difference between the officer appropriate for each of the two areas calls for some explanation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="542" /> If it is the city manager in a corporation area I fail to see why it is not the county manager in a county council area or, alternatively, if it is the county secretary in a county council area why it is not the official who would be appropriately of the same rank in the corporation, the assistant town clerk in most of the cities or, perhaps, the deputy manager.  No explanation has been given as to why we have this difference.  This can be of significance in the sort of situation which Deputy Lalor has been talking about where there is a dispute as between different appropriate officers within the meaning of this section.  We have many instances of it at present where two or part of two or more counties are in the same constituency. We have a number of instances where a city and a county or part of a county are in the same constituency.  We have that situation in Limerick where the whole of the county borough and part of the county are in the constituency of East Limerick where there are two appropriate officers who, if they are to make temporary arrangements under this section, have presumably to consult with one another and have also to consult with the returning officer. This means that three people are involved in making the decision.</P>
    <P>The same situation would arise in the proposed gerrymandered constituency of mid-Cork where a large section of Cork city is taken out of the city for Dáil elections and is put in with the already huge rural constituency of mid-Cork, which stretches diagonally across the whole length of county Cork and which, as a result of the acquisition of a large section of Cork city, will become the largest constituency in terms of population and probably in terms of physical length in this country.  You have a situation there where the county manager of Cork&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>It is significant that it is not even denied.  In the situation I have mentioned the appropriate officer for the County Borough of Cork is the city manager for Cork. The appropriate officer for County Cork is the county secretary although I understand that the manager of Cork County Council is also the manager of Cork city.</P>

      <P>If the situation were that the county manager of Cork city and the county manager of Cork county were, as they should be, the appropriate officers no problem would arise.  By coincidence in this particular case they are.  That is not the situation generally.  You have the extremely unsatisfactory situation in the proposed gerrymandered constituency of mid-Cork that the man who is the appropriate officer in his capacity as city manager of Cork has to confer with the man who is the appropriate officer in his capacity as county secretary for County Cork.  First of all, these men meet on unequal terms because the manager is clearly higher in rank than the county secretary.  In this particular case they meet on especially unequal terms because the county secretary of County Cork is directly under the control of the city manager of Cork in his capacity as county manager of Cork.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Both of those people have to consult in turn with the returning officer for the particular constituency.  I do not know which is the particular returning officer in Cork.  It may be the county registrar for the city or it may be the county registrar for the county. As far as I know, in Cork the returning officers are more normally the sheriffs either for the city or for the county.  Part of this constituency is in the city and part of it is in the <Col N="544" /> county.  I do not know who is to appoint the returning officer.  There may well be no problems in a situation like this because I am sure the people concerned are reasonable and will probably agree in practice.  On the other hand, if any of the various officials who seem to be involved in this rather complicated matter were to dig their heels in the ground you would then have an extremely difficult situation which, as has been pointed out by Deputy Lalor, is one which cannot apparently be resolved by the Minister.  While subsection (2) (a) states that any of these temporary arrangements shall be subject to the sanction of the Minister, it appears the only thing he can do is either sanction the scheme for the proposal or not sanction it.</P>
    <P>I suppose normally such a proposal is sanctioned.  If for some reason the Minister of the day decided not to sanction it, I do not know what the situation would be.  If, under this or some other measure, an electoral area is divided up so that it goes into two or three constituencies, as has apparently happened and can happen, and if the Minister declined to sanction the scheme of temporary arrangement made as a result of that division, then a situation could arise in which it is quite possible no election could be held in those constituencies because the people concerned would have nowhere to go. This apparently does not concern the Minister but it concerns a lot of people who do not want this situation to arise.  It should be a matter of concern for the House.</P>
    <P>I believe that situation is agreed by everybody to be wrong and undesirable. Its rectification is in the hands of the Minister but he refuses to commit himself to rectifying it.  He then complains that we continue to talk about it.  That is an unsatisfactory situation.  It is unsatisfactory, first of all, that we should have to continue to talk about it but it is also unsatisfactory that we have to do so simply because the Minister refuses to place it on the record of the House that he is agreeable to change or amend something which he agrees is wrong.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="545" /> When one looks at subsection (1) it is all the more regrettable that the Minister did not accept the amendments which Deputy Molloy proposed. They could only have clarified the matter and put it beyond doubt.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to quote from vol. 270, No. 10 of the Official Report, column 1651.  I asked:</P>
      <P>Why is the wording in subsection (1) better than my suggestion?</P>
      <P>The debate continued:</P>
      <P>Mr. Tully: Deputy O'Malley is being reasonable.  As a layman I consider his suggestion is a reasonable one, but my officials inform me that the section as worded is the correct phraseology.</P>
      <P>Mr. Molloy: Why?</P>
      <P>Mr. Tully: They consider that this wording has stood the test of time. If I was drafting the Bill originally and there was no Bill there which had this phraseology in it I would be inclined to say exactly as Deputy O'Malley has said.  However, if the wording in the Bill is the wording which has been in operation for nearly 30 years it is a different matter.  We do not know everything, and the officials who are the experts in this matter tell me that the wording in it is more correct than the wording which is proposed by Deputy O'Malley.</P>
      <P>I have not a closed mind on these things and if wording comes which appears better I have no objection to making a change either in this House or when the Bill goes before the Seanad, but if the existing wording is better I do not want to change it.  It is as simple as that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That brings me back to what I said at the beginning, that we had a situation before in relation to a section of this Bill in which the Minister agreed that the alternative wording, which was <Col N="546" /> proposed by me on that occasion, was better.</P>

The Minister agreed with him that they were incorrect, the Minister agreed with him that they should be changed and the Minister then got up and complained that he had said all these things&mdash;that they were incorrect and that they should be changed&mdash;and that, therefore, we should cease to talk about them.  I invited the Minister twice this morning, and I sat down on each occasion to allow him to do it, to spell out precisely what change he is going to make because I did not want to have the kind of situation that we had before when we gave up arguing a point because we understood it was going to be amended.</P>

It is clear from that quotation, and Deputy O'Malley can read it 100 times if he wants to, that I made no promise to change the section.  Deputy O'Malley is now well aware of that, having read the quotation, but despite that he continues, as he usually does, with a spiteful little whine to try to make out that there was something in it which I say was not in it and which everybody reading it will know was not there.

    <P>I would expect that Deputy O'Malley, having been a Minister for a period, would know a lot more about the way the Government is run, about electoral law and about the rules of this House.  Apparently he has missed out on a lot of things. I am sorry he is leaving because I would like to point out to him some of the things he does not know. <Col N="548" /> He said that the Cork city manager and the Cork county manager were one and the same.

    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>I mentioned this because Deputy O'Malley said that the Cork city and county managers were one and the same.  He also alleged that for that reason the county secretary would be at a disadvantage in deciding on matters which affected booths where the boundaries crossed because the city manager, being his boss, would be able to push him around.  Nothing like that could happen because the city manager is not the county manager and it does not arise at all but for the purpose of making an argument it suited Deputy O'Malley's purpose to say this or he did not know that this was not so.  He also posed a question about the county secretary in the county council and the city manager in the borough.  He made a lot of play about this.  I am sure Deputy Lalor knows that the city manager or borough manager is also the town clerk and since there is no <Col N="549" /> secretary the town clerk acts as secretary and, therefore, they are people of equal status.  I wish people, before they make statements here, would go to the trouble of checking on these things.  I came into this House as a young man and I had to find out a lot of things and I possibly made as many mistakes as the young fellows coming in today but people who have carried a portfolio in government for a period should not make those mistakes and should not try to make allegations about everybody.  The facts are as I have stated them.</P>
      <P>I told Deputy Lalor last night that he made one good point, the one about the temporary arrangement made following the change of a constituency, before a permanent arrangement is made about the new polling areas, and the fact that there is no way in which the Minister if he is dissatisfied can alter it, that all he can say when the proposal is made is &ldquo;yes&rdquo; or &ldquo;no&rdquo;.  I agree that Deputy Lalor is right but this is something which was not put in there simply because I wanted it put in.  It was put in by a Fianna Fáil Minister and was approved by this House on a number of occasions since 1936.  I compliment Deputy Lalor on being the first to pick out this and I am taking the necessary steps to have it altered.  Deputy O'Malley made a song and dance about it and was quite insulting because I was not prepared to spell out here exactly how I would change it. People like Deputy O'Malley might like this sort of instant legislation but it does not result in good law.  I want the matter fully considered and I want those who will eventually give me the wording of it to be sure that those words will do exactly what this House wants.  That is the right way to do it.</P>

I cannot understand what all the row was about but if people want to be abusive and insulting and create acrimony where there is none they can always find devices for doing this sort of thing. <Col N="550" /> We had quite a reasonable debate on the Bill apart from some divergences but the debate has gone on far too long.  Having discussed this matter on the amendment&mdash;we could not go over the full section&mdash;and having spent two hours discussing it last night and having begun to discuss it again at 11 o'clock today and when it is something on which both sides of the House agree, it is a bit much to delay the House by bringing in irrelevancies and making allegations. I am sure Deputy Lalor will agree that on a previous section I said that as a layman I felt Deputy Molloy had a point.  Subsequently, I checked and found there was a reason for the particular wording in the section and next day I told this to the House.  I was accused by Deputy O'Malley of breaking my word.  I gave no word to that effect; I said I would look at it and I did satisfy myself that the wording was correct.</P>
      <P>In this case I have satisfied myself, and my officials agree, that a slight alteration should be made to meet the case.  I want to have this done properly and I see no reason why we should continue to debate this section.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. R.P. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>We had a preliminary look at this last night and we had a certain amount of debate this morning on it.  There are a couple of points I am unhappy about.  I raised one of them last night and was fairly satisfied with what was said by the Minister.  It was the subject of the permanent arrangements regarding polling districts and polling places as distinct from the temporary arrangements. The temporary arrangements are in the hands of the appropriate officers but the permanent arrangements are in the hands of the council or corporation.  It was decided provisionally last night that as soon as the Bill was passed a letter would go to all local authorities informing them of the passing of the Act and telling them about the temporary arrangements and asking them to look at their own&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">

    <Speaker pid="RayBurke" hpid="Mr. R.P. Burke Mr. R.P. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R.P. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>This letter would tell the councils to look at the polling districts and places and revise them if found necessary&mdash;and it will be necessary in every area because of the massive changes in constituencies in the Bill.  I thought about this overnight and as the Minister was going to alter the section in any case by bringing in an amendment in regard to (2) (a), I thought he would also tighten up the instructions to local authorities and that there should be firm instructions, rather than leaving the situation as it is in the Bill, that the temporary arrangements operate until the local authority makes a decision on the matter.  It is important that the council should get a firm instruction to make these changes as soon as possible.</P>
      <P>Deputy Lalor's suggestion, on which I spoke also, was that there should be a provision in this section to the effect that the appropriate officers would decide on the temporary arrangements for a period of six months or until the local authority made permanent arrangements and that it would be written into the section that the local authority was duty bound to make these alterations within six months. There could be a time leg between the county council making the arrangements and the expiration of the appropriate officers' six months.  The local authority decision could go to the Department, the Minister might not agree with it and there could be debate and discussion on the matter and there could be a time lag before the permanent arrangements were confirmed by the Minister.  In any case, it is not beyond the ability of the parliamentary draftsmen to provide some wording that would tidy up the section and meet my suggestions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Being involved in politics for a long time and having been active at local level for many years, I think the Minister realises the importance of local democracy and of giving as much power as possible to local authorities.  I hope he will agree, in the light of his experience, to make some amendment in regard to local representation and the right of people at local level to make decisions.  I hope he will write <Col N="552" /> into the section an instruction to local authorities to consider within, say, six months permanent arrangements regarding polling districts and places.  If an election were held within the six months there would be no problem as the temporary arrangements would have been made&mdash;assuming they were sanctioned by the Minister&mdash;but it would be wrong to have polling districts on a temporary basis for three years, if this Dáil ran for three years &mdash;which I think highly unlikely.  We do not want a prolonged temporary period.  We have experience of employment in the Civil Service of the &ldquo;temporary&rdquo; tag being put on people employed for 20 or 30 years.  When is temporary, temporary and when is permanent permanent?</P>
    <P>We want a clear instruction to local authorities&mdash;not just a letter as was the former practice&mdash;to revise polling districts and places as soon as possible and within six months after the passing of this Act.  This would be a much better provision than the present one. There would not be a problem if the constituencies were within one county or city boundary.  The problem is that so many of the constituencies suggested by the Minister are crossing county boundaries.  While my constituency in Dublin crosses the city boundary in one place, in fact part of the old constituency of North County Dublin has gone back to the city.  We are losing part of the city in Baldoyle and are gaining part in Ballymun.</P>
    <P>I am worried about the two authorities and the permanent arrangements with regard to the siting and the decision on the polling districts.  While one authority might be very alert and make the changes suggested in the letter that will come from the Department of Local Government on the passing of this Bill, the other local authority might postpone debate and decision on the permanent arrangements. There might be a situation where one section of a constituency within a county area would have permanent arrangements while the other section&mdash;in North County Dublin it is a small portion that is densely populated&mdash;might have temporary arrangements. This is an unsatisfactory <Col N="553" /> situation when one is dealing with election of representatives to Dáil Éireann. This is loose legislation&mdash;&mdash;</P>

I assumed that a debate on temporary and permanent arrangements was relevant.  As the Minister is going to amend this section for Report Stage, I am requesting him to include the suggestions I am making.  We spent some time on this matter last night and it is worthy of consideration.  Not alone does it affect my constituency of North County Dublin but there are a number of areas throughout the country where the county boundaries are breached.  Last night Deputy Geoghegan mentioned the Galway-Clare constituency.  The Galway County Council could decide on the permanent arrangements within a certain time of receiving the letter from the Minister but, on the other hand, the Clare County Council&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>Deputy Geoghegan explained it very well.  I am not going to refer to Kinvara which he mentioned but will confine my remarks to general terms.  The Galway County Council could make permanent arrangements while the Clare County Council would operate under instructions of the county secretary and make temporary arrangements.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Permanent arrangements are subject to sanction of the Minister and he can alter them but temporary arrangements are subject only to sanction of the Minister.  This is stated in section 7 (2) (a).  There is a difference between sanction of the Minister and alteration by the Minister. The Minister may alter the permanent <Col N="554" /> arrangements but not the temporary arrangements.  This is wrong.  There could be a situation in two parts of a Dáil constituency&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>That was not my intention but I am guided by the Chair.  Section 7 states:</P>
      <P>(2) An arrangement made pursuant to paragraph (a) or paragraph (b) of subsection (1) of this section&mdash;</P>
      <P>(a) shall be subject to the sanction of the Minister.</P>
      <P>The Minister has agreed that this wording is not satisfactory and has stated he will alter it.  Deputy O'Malley asked the Minister to give some indication of the manner in which he would alter it.  The Minister told us he would not put forward the new wording until Report Stage because of the time involved&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>This debate will continue until 2.30 p.m. and there is a strong temptation for us to try to find out, even on an informal basis, what is in the Minister's mind with regard to the amendment he proposes for this section.  The sanction of the Minister is not strong enough; it should include power for the Minister not merely to sanction but to alter what is suggested by the paid officials of the county council.  He should be able to look at suggestions if there is an obvious anomaly.  This could happen if there were personality <Col N="555" /> clashes between two or three local authorities where county boundaries might be breached.  It is not beyond the bounds of possibility.  We sometimes have personality clashes even in this Chamber.</P>

The Minister should have the right to amend any proposals made by paid officials of county councils or corporations. Proposals for temporary arrangements made by elected representatives on these bodies can be altered by the Minister, but proposals made by the appropriate officers mentioned in this section can only be either sanctioned or rejected by the Minister.

      <P>It would save time because what we are afraid of is too much power in the hands of officials and not enough power in the hands of the Minister and elected representatives of county councils and corporations.  The difficulty with Report Stage is that one can only speak once.  The Committee Stage provides us with the only opportunity of teasing out amendments.  I would not expect the Minister to give us the exact wording but surely he could give us the bones of what he has in mind.  He must know what instructions he intends to give the parliamentary draftsman.  He agrees some alteration is necessary and we would like some indication as to what that alteration will be.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. R.P. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>That was not my intention.  Subsection (3) of this section provides:</P>
      <P>In this section &ldquo;the appropriate officer&rdquo; means&mdash;</P>
      <P>(a)  in relation to a polling district situate in a county borough, the manager for the purposes of the Acts relating to the management of the county borough (including a person duly appointed either as deputy for such manager or to act in the place of such manager during his absence or incapacity or during a vacancy in his office),</P>
      <P>(b)  in relation to any other polling district, the secretary of the council of the county in which the polling district is situate (including a person duly appointed either as deputy for such secretary or to act in the place of such secretary during his absence or incapacity or during a vacancy in his office).</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In Dublin the city manager appoints an assistant county manager.  The latter is under the city manager.  The city manager decides what will happen to the city in regard to constituencies which breach county boundaries.  The assistant county manager, nominated <Col N="557" /> by the city manager, operates within the county.  We have no county secretary in Dublin.  We have someone operating in his place.  In my constituency the city manager will operate, but the county boundary has been breached and the Ballymun end of the city now comes into the new North County Dublin.  The city manager will be responsible for deciding on the polling stations in the area within the city boundary.  It is a very small area, but it is very densely populated.  The vast bulk of the constituency is in the county council area. There you have a sub-officer of a sub-officer of the city manager negotiating with the latter in regard to the bulk of the area.  That is not good enough. There should be officers of equal standing to consult together and decide on these temporary arrangements. This reinforces my earlier argument that something should be written into the section to ensure these temporary arrangements will be for a limited period of six months and the relevant local authorities will then have the responsibility of deciding within a specified time on polling districts and polling stations.  Officers of different status should not be negotiating.  Deputy MacMahon is present.  What I have said applies also to his constituency.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. R.P. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>There may have been certain errors in his contribution but I am on firm ground in County Dublin.  A similar situation will arise in the new constituency of the mid-county in which you have part of the city area, part of the <Col N="558" /> county area and part of Wicklow. There is an even worse situation there than in the county and city. The city manager is operating the portion of the new constituency of mid-County Dublin which is within the city boundary.  He, in turn, is negotiating with a sub-officer of a sub-officer of his own, obviously not of equal standing, with regard to the siting of polling districts and polling places, and they, in turn, are debating and making decisions which will affect the electorate and the rights of citizens with the county secretary in Wicklow.  This means that there is a city manager, his sub-agent appointing a further sub-agent negotiating with the secretary of the Wicklow County Council.  This is a ludicrous situation which should be avoided.  It should be as temporary as possible.</P>
      <P>As the section stands, the word &ldquo;temporary&rdquo; means that the arrangements are temporary until the county councils or corporations decide to make them permanent.  The county councils can leave these temporary arrangements stand for as long as they like.  The Minister should bring in a second amendment on Report Stage which would instruct local authorities, immediately on the passing of this measure and having been informed by the Department of Local Government how it affects their particular areas, to decide on permanent arrangements with regard to the polling districts and polling places.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Let us discuss the constituency of mid-County Dublin.  The county council could make permanent arrangements, the Wicklow County Council could make permanent arrangements and the Dublin Corporation members might not have made permanent arrangements.  In other words, there could be a situation where two of the bodies concerned could have made permanent arrangements and the other did not.  Decisions are being made which affect the rights of the electorate.  There is nothing more sacred than the right to vote.  Decisions are being made sometimes by elected representatives <Col N="559" /> at local level, sometimes by city managers, sometimes by county secretaries and sometimes by sub-agents of sub-agents of the city manager for another part of the same Dáil constituency.  This is a ludicrous situation which should be tidied up and strengthened within this section.  The Minister should consider the example of mid-County Dublin which illustrates my point very well.  As elected representatives sent here to look after the interests of people in a democratic way, we must ensure that an instruction will go to the local authorities telling them to make alterations rather than have the situation which could arise in mid-County Dublin or within the city boundary in the North County Dublin area where the Ballymun constituency is situated.</P>
    <P>I realise the problem the Minister faces with regard to section 2 (a).  He does not want to promise something to the House and on Report Stage have to go back on it.  The Minister in reply should give an indication of what he has in mind with regard to the tightening up of section 2 (a).</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>We discussed this last night.  Since we started this morning no new matter has been introduced. In my opinion this is one of the troubles of carrying over a debate until a later date.  If this section were carried over until next week and we started on Tuesday at 4 o'clock, the Opposition would repeat all their arguments as they have been doing today.  Arguments were made last night and were replied to then. Deputy Lalor accepted that I would amend one section.  This section has taken up much of today's time. Deputy Burke last night accepted as reasonable my view that the local authority members have a right and duty.  I have the greatest respect for these members and I will not dictate to them and make them do things which they know should be done. The Deputy has been talking about temporary arrangements.  Local authority members can immediately start proceedings in order to ensure that the temporary arrangements cease <Col N="560" /> and the permanent arrangements are introduced.  There is no reason why we should lay down that this should be done because it is their duty.  As I said last night, local representatives are good people and do the job for which they are elected.  Deputy Burke accepted this as being reasonable. Yet he made the same argument today.</P>
      <P>Suggestions which have been repeated here that a row could occur between county secretaries and county managers across county boundaries, are too ludicrous to bother arguing about.  The county secretary looks after the county council area and he selects the polling station there.  The county manager does the same if a borough is involved.  There can be no question of a dispute.  This has been so since the mid-1930s.  We are talking about people who hold responsible positions.  If the county secretary or the county manager, or the person to whom Deputy Burke referred who is neither one thing, or the other but is designated to do the job, were so careless or irresponsible as to present to the Minister a scheme which would cause trouble, they would know that their own elected representatives would not take it from them.</P>

    <Speaker pid="FlorenceCrowley" hpid="Mr. Crowley Mr. Crowley">

    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>There could not be a dispute.  If they were stupid enough to do that, they would have to be dealt with.  It is true that the Minister cannot accept or reject in regard to a temporary arrangement as he can for a permanent one.  The permanent ones are there and can be made immediately by the council members. They have not got to wait any length of time.  I would not like to put a time limit on it or to write anything in.  They have been reminded.  They have been doing a very good job down through the years and, that being so, we should not interfere.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have not yet got to the meat of the Bill.  We have been dealing with technical matters which have been in previous Bills and have been dealt with over the years, and have <Col N="561" /> operated very successfully for a period of almost 40 years.  I am sorry to have to repeat this but, in my opinion, despite that the Opposition have been deliberately introducing a type of filibuster to hold up the Bill. They should not be allowed to do that.  We have taken much more time on this Bill already than was taken on either of the two previous constituency revision Bills, and we were supposed to be an awkward Opposition and we were supposed to be holding up the business of the House.</P>
    <P>I see no reason why we should continue on.  We are now on the fifth day of the Committee Stage of this Bill and we have dealt with only four sections. Last night we had reached a stage where we could easily have moved on. We had reached agreement on one amendment and it was generally accepted that the rest of the section was all right.  Yet, today the same thing is happening again.  This section has been before the House for too long. If we do not deal with it today, next week we will have the same situation and we will start the debate all over again on all the things that were said. I suggest that the question be now put.</P>

On section 8 what concerns me mostly is that it appears that, when this Bill becomes an Act, each of the major political organisations, not just the ones represented <Col N="564" /> in this House, the less supported organisations, will re-arrange their organisations to conform with the new constituency arrangements.  This is quite complicated and it creates problems. It goes back to the days of Parnell.  There are transfers of funds between new and old constituencies and there are debts in some cases. There is the question of halls and who has the entitlement to halls. There is a Labour Party hall in my constituency which is financed by a part which is going into the mid-county and which is actually situated in the part that will be staying in Dublin (Ballyfermot).</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoelTLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>These problems will arise.  Naturally agreement will have to be reached.  Assuming that the organisations are reconstituted in the new constituencies and that everything is working smoothly for the parties, we then run into the problem that if a by-election occurs they will have to start re-organising back into the old constituencies.  This can be the cause of a great deal of difficulty. Would the Minister consider providing that these areas would be the new Dáil areas on the date of the passing of this Act?  The Minister has been repeating over and over again that these sections have been agreed to by successive Fianna Fáil Governments.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have not prepared myself to speak on this section but I am concerned about this.  If my information is not correct the Minister can tell me in his reply.  The Minister has said that many of the arguments we have been having are needless, pointless and useless, because these provisions were in the various Acts introduced by Fianna Fáil Ministers.  That suggests to me that the Minister refuses to accept any new ideas or introduce any initiatives. The reason why there was less argument over previous Electoral (Amendment) Bills was that none of them was as drastic in the rearrangements and in the break-up of traditional county boundaries as this.  Therefore, the Opposition of today have found it necessary to examine all these provisions <Col N="565" /> in greater detail.  I would ask the Minister to look at the operative date of the Act.  I have been told that a constitutional provision is involved. If that is so, will the Minister say so?</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy has been told the truth.  Subarticle 4 of Article 16 of the Constitution lays down:</P>
      <P>any alterations in the constituencies shall not take effect during the life of Dáil Éireann sitting when such revision is made.</P>
      <P>That is the constitutional position and I want to keep within the constitution. Therefore, whether I like it or not there is nothing I can do about it.</P>

      <P>This section states that the Electoral (Amendment) Act of 1969 is repealed.  This Act when it came in in 1969 was the most abused piece of legislation ever introduced in the House.  Many things were said against it here and in the newspapers, that it was a gerrymander operated by the Fianna Fáil administration to keep them in power <i>ad infinitum</i> but the democratic way in which the constituencies were divided in 1969 was reflected in the decision of the electorate in 1973.  An Act under which Fianna Fáil had won a general election previously resulted in Fianna Fáil being put into Opposition and a new Government being elected in 1973.</P>
      <P>If this Act which was much maligned in 1969 was as bad as was claimed by the then Opposition, the two parties now forming the temporary Government, Fianna Fáil would be in Government and the Coalition Parties would be on this side of the House fighting publicly instead of privately as they are at present.  That Act had many good features.</P>

Surely that is an indication of how democratic that Act was.  Constituencies were divided in such a way as to give the electorate the opportunity to change the Government if they wished.  Under the new Bill the Minister is attempting to copperfasten the Coaltion but they will come apart <Col N="567" /> without too much more time elapsing. I am anxious to make the comparison between the Dublin representation in 1969 which is referred to in section 8. That section talks of repealing the 1969 Act.</P>

All our efforts have been concentrated on opposing this Bill.  On the last occasion when section 8 was reached the then Deputy Sir Anthony Esmonde asked the then Minister for Local Government what the position would be if the Dáil dissolved before the passing of the Bill. The obvious answer was that we would operate the 1961 Electoral Act.  Even if this Bill passes through the House and has not got to the Seanad when the present Dáil dissolves we will be operating the 1969 Act.  We are totally opposed to this Bill and will do our utmost to prevent its being passed.  We are doing our utmost to prevent the Bill being passed.</P>

By-elections between now and the dissolution of the Dáil will be conducted under the 1969 Act and, therefore, it is extremely difficult properly to discuss this section without referring to the dissolution of the Dáil which I think is reasonably imminent. I am anxious to ask the Minister if there is any order he can make which would provide for the election of 148 Deputies, as provided for in section 2 to the new Dáil, in the event of the Dáil dissolving before this Bill becomes law.</P>

I do not mind Deputy Burke who is only new here and I do not blame him too much: he will learn from his father who was fairly good at this sort of thing but people who have been here so long should know the facts of life.  The facts are that the Constitution lays down that following the last census the constituencies have to be changed.  It also lays down that we should have a certain number of Members, not 144. <Col N="578" /> That being so, we must repeal the 1969 Act whether we or Fianna Fáil like it.</P>

The Minister referred to the <Col N="580" /> Constitution and I should like to refer to a few matters regarding the necessity for this legislation.  Section 8 is a repeal of the 1969 Act.  How the 1969 Act and this measure were drawn up is related to particular directions in the clauses of the Constitution.</P>

I think we should test this particular section.  It is unfortunate the Leas-Cheann Comhairle has decided we cannot debate the section in the way in which we would like to debate it.  I accept the Chair's ruling, of course.

There was a hall mentioned&mdash;I think it was called &ldquo;Tully's Tabernacle&rdquo;&mdash;by Deputy Lemass.  The hall was situated in one part of the constituency but the funds coming into it were coming from another part of the constituency.  The provision in the Constitution specifies 12 years.

      <P>This section then should have been embodied in section 2.  In fact that has not been done.  I bow to the Minister's superior experience in these matters, but I believe we must give this section a full debate in <Col N="585" /> order to prove that it is a very important section.  Without it the Bill would not be effective.  We must discuss the section and all its implications. There is the possibility that it might result in a change of Government. Naturally we would welcome that.  In four or five years' time, as it stands, it could result in another change of Government.  It has tremendous force.  It is not a formal thing.  This is one of the greatest catalysts of democracy because it underlies the whole Bill.  We must examine it word by word to ensure that this most important section is given all the attention it deserves.</P>

      <P>I am genuinely confused about how I can debate the section without referring to the Act itself, without referring to the Act which is to replace it and, merely in passing, to refer to the changes in it. This is a fundamental act of democracy: if we cannot have elections we cannot have democracy.  Section 8 is fundamental to the whole democratic set-up of the country.  One side's interpretation could be entirely different from the other.  Nevertheless,&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>It is a very necessary amendment but it is not important enough to spend hours debating it. The Deputy probably cannot find any more to say about it.</P>

    <Speaker pid="FlorenceCrowley" hpid="Mr. Crowley Mr. Crowley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Crowley</NameTxt>
      <P>I can find a lot to say about it but I appear to have been put in a straitjacket by the Chair by not being allowed even to refer to the Act.  We are repealing something, we cannot refer to it and we have no guarantee that at a later stage we will be allowed to debate it because of the jackboot tactics by the Government. When we get an opportunity we are informed that we are constricted in the way in which we can discuss it.</P>
      <P>We were in favour of the 1969 Act and in agreement with the increase of four seats which was required by the Constitution because of the population.  We disagreed with the distribution of the seats.  The 1973 Act which would replace the 1969 Act, would ensure that this becomes law after the passing of this Bill.  Yet, on such a fundamental issue, we seem to be debarred from voicing our stronger opinions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Section 8 may be referred to as a procedural section and nothing else. Nevertheless, this mere bit of procedure <Col N="591" /> is fundamental to the Bill. This is the reason why we want to debate it, why we intend to oppose it, and why we intend to expose as much as possible every section and every line of every section for what they really are and the spirit and the views behind the Bill which are to copperfasten <Col N="592" /> the Government in power <i>ad infinitum.</i> If the Leas-Cheann Comhairle feels that I cannot go into the merits of the Bill, the new one or the old one, there is not very much left for us to say except that we oppose section 8 and intend to vote against it.</P>

A doctor may certify that a child suffers from a minor ailment and may be factually correct in so doing but we need to have a means of assessing objectively <Col N="600" /> and with the best professional advice whether that condition, as indicated in the certificate submitted by the family doctor, is such as would require transport to be granted in an exceptional way as in the case of the regulation.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. Bruton Mr. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>CIE have arranged to compensate contractors for the rise in fuel costs as follows: Firstly to the extent of 3p per gallon in respect of increases which came into effect in December, 1973.  Compensation is being paid in respect of operations from the reopening of the schools on 15th January, 1974.  The amount of 3p per gallon does not meet the full cost of the increase but was arrived at having regard to the point made that contractors would have been expected to provide for slight cost increases themselves under the normal terms of the contract; (b) compensation is being provided to the extent of 9p per gallon in respect of the increases authorised on 21st February, 1974.  The increase consists of (i) 7.5p per gallon to the oil companies and (ii) 0.77p per gallon to the retailers, plus VAT on these figures, bringing the total to 8.83p per gallon.  The compensation in that case which is being awarded by CIE is slightly above the actual increase in costs which has taken place.</P>

I also pointed out that it was the normal situation that these contracts were made on a 12-month basis and that normal increases in costs which took place in the past within that 12-month period were to be absorbed by the contractors and the initial contracts were entered into on that basis.  Because of the exceptional increases in fuel costs, exceptional compensation over and above that was made, as I indicated.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>There are 15 children in the Ballydesmond NS area who are eligible for free school transport in accordance with the rules, but they reside in scattered localities&mdash;eight in the Tureenglanahea/Glencollins locality south of the school, four in the Knocknaboul locality to the west and north-west, and three in the Tureenduve locality north-east of the school.  Each of these localities must be regarded as separate for school transport purposes.  All these children reside less than three miles from the school, and the establishment of a special transport service is not warranted.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ThomasJVMeaney" hpid="Mr. Meaney Mr. Meaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Meaney</NameTxt>
      <P>I understood that the whole aim of free transport was to <Col N="604" /> ensure that children in remote rural areas would attend school regularly. There are 15 qualified children in this remote rural area.  Would the Parliamentary Secretary look on that as an exceptional case?

    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. Bruton Mr. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>It has been standard practice that it is necessary that there be a minimum of ten children in a distinct locality on one side of a school for the establishment of a service. While there are over ten altogether in the school catchment area they are not in a distinct locality, they are scattered, and the fact that they are scattered would naturally greatly increase the cost of laying on such a service.  It is unfortunate but true that one of the reasons for a regulation such as this is to keep the cost of the service within reasonable bounds.</P>

      <P>With your permission, a Cheann Comhairle, I propose to take Question Nos. 19 and 20 together.</P>
      <P>I have already taken up with the Commissioners of Public Works the question of providing improved accommodation for the gardaí at Tallaght.  It is intended to erect a new station at Tallaght, but the project has to be co-ordinated with the overall planning for the new town there, which I understand has not yet been finalised.  In the meantime the Office of Public Works are examining the possibility of providing additional facilities at the existing station.</P>

      <P>The number of peace commissioners appointed during the period 1st April, 1957, to 14th March, 1973 was 2,492.  Many of them are now dead and others have resigned.</P>
      <P>In answer to a Parliamentary Question on 28th February I gave the names and addresses of those peace commissioners who were appointed by me since I took office.  I did so because they were recent appointments and because I did not wish it to be thought that by refusing to give the particulars sought I was trying to conceal anything.  These considerations do not apply in relation to the peace commissioners appointed before I took office and as the numbers involved are very large I consider that the work and cost involved in compiling a list of names and addresses would be excessive by reference to its usefulness.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Health if he has received the reports of the Cork Regional Hospital Board and Comhairle na nOspidéal concerning the satus of Nenagh County Hospital, County Tipperary; and, if so, if he will arrange to meet a deputation from the area as soon as possible.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Health (Mr. Corish)</NameTxt>
      <P>I have received the reports from the Cork Regional Hospital Board and Comhairle na nOspidéal, which are now being examined.  When the MidWestern Health Board submitted their recommendations in regard to future hospital developments in their area they also sent me a lengthy statement regarding Nenagh County Hospital from the Tipperary (NR) County Hospital Action Group.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am considering all these documents and, indeed, the various other <Col N="622" /> documents relating to health board areas which have been submitted to me.  In arriving at decisions I will, of course, take account of all that has been said.</P>
    <P>In so far as receiving deputations is concerned, I have had requests to meet deputations in respect of a number of county hospitals, which I am considering.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware that the Taoiseach has already received a deputation on this matter on both 27th February and 6th March?  If the Taoiseach can receive a deputation would the Minister not acknowledge that it would be much more appropriate for him to receive a deputation because he would be better armed with the facts and the arguments?</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrendanCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>I am aware the Taoiseach received a deputation.  The Deputy must realise there are deep local feelings about the proposed changes in the siting of hospitals throughout the country.  As far as I am concerned, there are thousands of requests for deputations and scores of representations and, with the best will in the world, and anxious to meet everyone and hear his view, I do not think the Deputy could expect that I could receive all of them.  I received the report within the last few weeks and I intend to study it over the next few weeks and then make a decision.  Now, if a representative local body want to meet me, I will certainly give that body every consideration, but the Deputy will understand there are certain sensitive areas in which feeling runs very deep about any change in status in the hospital in the area.</P>

      <P>With your permission, a Cheann Comhairle, I propose to <Col N="624" /> take Questions Nos. 27 and 28 together.</P>
      <P>While the list of long-term illnesses is under continuous review, I do not propose to extend it at present.  I have already indicated, in reply to similar questions, that there are a number of chronic conditions which can vary greatly in severity and are not always well defined, making it impractical to include them in the list.</P>
      <P>Hospital services are now available free, and drugs and medicines either free or at a maximum cost of £4 per family per month, to almost 90 per cent of the population, and, as the Deputy is aware, I propose to extend these services to the remainder of the community.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sure the Deputy has a particular interest in leukemia and the other illnesses mentioned. There are other illnesses which could be considered long-term illnesses.  As I said in my reply, about 90 per cent of the population have available to them free hospital services and can participate in the drug scheme at a cost of no more than £4 per family per month.  I also said in my reply, and in this House recently, that under the new scheme which I propose to introduce on 1st April, free hospital services, public wards and drugs to the maximum expense of £4 per month for all such people as the Deputy described in his question.</P>

    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>I have victims of both these diseases in my constituency. These children are hospital cases.  Therefore, the free hospital service does not apply to them.  They need expensive drugs.  When drugs cost more than £4 a month this can be an unjustifiable burden to place on the families unfortunate enough to have children suffering from these clearly definable long-term and incurable diseases.

I will consider the three diseases which have been mentioned but I am not prepared to do it now.  The Deputy knows that, as far as 90 per cent or more of the population is concerned, free drugs and medicines are available.  In what the Deputy terms as the middle income group, the maximum expense to them is £4 per month.  One pound a week may be a hardship on certain families in this group&mdash;&mdash;</P>

There seems to have been some misunderstanding between the North Western Health Board and the rehabilitation centre at Dún Laoghaire. According to the health board, they wrote to this gentleman on 25th May, 1973, sending him an admission ticket for the Dún Laoghaire centre for 1st June, 1973.  They told him that if he was unable to avail of the vacancy he should contact their office.  They heard nothing from him in June.  I concede that there has been some sort of a mix up, not on the question of means, as to whether or not this man was notified that he should appear at the rehabilitation centre in June.  The first real intimation he got was on 5th October.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy will be aware that I have circulated a draft of regulations under section 46 (3) of the Health Act, 1970, which provide for the abolition of the present income and valuation limits in so far as entitlement to hospital services at public ward level is concerned.  If these regulations are approved by the Dáil and Seanad, I will make regulations under section 72 of the Act of 1970 providing that, for the present, the services of consultants at inpatient or out-patient level will not be made available free to certain categories of persons.</P>
      <P>The limits in the latter respect will be defined in the regulations to be made under section 72.  Persons affected by the limits set will in the meantime require to make their own arrangements for consultant services. They will be entitled, however, to maintenance in public beds and to avail of the scheme of subsidies for maintenance in private and semiprivate accommodation in public voluntary hospitals and health board hospitals.  They will also be entitled to contributions if they choose instead to be treated in approved private hospitals or homes.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>With your permission, a Cheann Comhairle, I propose to take Questions Nos. 39 and 40 together.</P>
      <P>Under the Cruelty to Animals Act, 1876, experiments on living animals may be carried out only under licence.  Such licences may be granted only on the recommendation of the president of one of a number of recognised colleges or societies together with a university professor, and subject to certain conditions as to the location of the experiment and the manner in which it is to be carried out.</P>
      <P>In particular, it is provided that in any such experiment the animal must, during the whole of the experiment be under the influence of an anaesthetic of sufficient power to prevent it feeling pain from the experimental procedure, and if pain is likely to continue after the effect of the anaesthetic has ceased, or if any serious injury has been inflicted, the animal must be killed before it recovers from the influence of the anaesthetic.</P>
      <P>Where the necessity for any relaxation of these restrictions may arise, the Minister has discretion to allow such relaxation but there is provision in such cases for an elaborate system of certification by the persons referred to above that the particular experiments are absolutely necessary or that the conditions to be observed, if rigidly adhered to, would frustrate the object of the experiment.</P>
      <P>So far, therefore, as the Deputies' inquiry about instructions to minimise the use of live animals is concerned, I think the Deputies will appreciate from what I have said that the licensing system is designed to achieve not only this objective but also, of course, to minimise suffering.</P>
      <P>I have, as I promised the House, looked at the position in depth and I am satisfied that there are no abuses at present.  However, I will keep the entire system of control under review to see from time to time whether it is necessary to introduce any additional safeguards.</P>

      <P>The fuel scheme was introduced in 1942 when fuel of every kind was difficult to obtain particularly in the areas known as the &ldquo;non-turf areas&rdquo; in which the scheme operated. Its operation was and is confined to some 17 cities and towns mainly along the eastern and southern seaboards. Although the scheme has continued in operation, the conditions giving rise to it no longer obtain and in the circumstances its extension to other areas is not contemplated.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cluskey</NameTxt>
      <P>It was decided by a deciding officer that the person referred to in his question did not satisfy the conditions for the receipt of unemployment benefit because the insurance contributions on which he based his claim were not paid in respect of employment in this country which was genuinely insurable under <Col N="640" /> the Social Welfare Acts.  As the Deputy is aware, this decision was upheld by an appeals officer following an oral hearing at which the claimant attended and gave evidence.</P>

      <P>Recent claims to unemployment benefit made by the person in question were disallowed by decisions of a deciding officer.  In addition to his intermittent insurable employment, the insured person is a farmer.  Statutory regulations provide that where a person has another occupation, as in this case, from which the remuneration or profit is more than 50p per day, he cannot be paid unemployment benefit unless at least 78 employment contributions have been paid in respect of him in a given period of three years prior to his claim.  In this case the profit from the farm was well above the statutory maximum and the claimant did not satisfy the contribution requirement mentioned on any of the claims in question.  Unemployment assistance was, of course, paid for the period of the claims.</P>

      <P>While there is no trace in the Department of any earlier claim for a non-contributory pension the person concerned did claim a contributory old age pension about two years ago.  That claim was rejected because the statutory contribution conditions were not satisfied.  Since there appears to be some doubt as to whether the claimant fully understood the nature of the claim he made on that occasion, I am having inquiries made in the matter to see if there might be grounds to justify payment of the non-contributory pension from an earlier date.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Davern</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister agree that this seems to be punitive and very selective particularly in regard to those who for some reason do not choose to get married?  Many of those people are looking after an aged parent.  The Minister is being selective in his treatment of those people who when they leave the Army are at the loss of as much as £1,000. They may need gratuities more than married people because when they leave the Army they have to set up a house or provide some type of accommodation on their pensions.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Donegan</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not so agree with the statement of the Deputy. <Col N="646" /> Married rates of pay for officers of the Permanent Defence Forces are higher than the single rates but the married and single rates of retired pay are exactly the same for lieutenants, captains and commandants and not very different for the other ranks up to that of colonel.  Therefore, the maximum retired pay of a single officer represents a much higher percentage of pay than that of a married officer, for example, 61 per cent in the case of a single captain as against 48 per cent in the case of a married captain. There is a further difficulty.  It is the complication that the equalisation of married and single rates of pay in accordance with public policy for some considerable time should, as a corollary, result in equal pension terms also.  The first phase of equalisation, that is 17½ per cent of the difference in pay, has been implemented and the effects of this on the pensions of single personnel are now being examined.</P>

    <Speaker pid="NoelDavern" hpid="Mr. Davern Mr. Davern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Davern</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Donegan</NameTxt>

A gratuity is usually paid in regard to service to a particular Department and in this instance it is to the country.  They should be paid.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Meaney</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Defence if he will review the means test for the granting of special allowances in respect of holders of service medals for the 1916-21 period as the present system is now much too rigid.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickSDonegan" hpid="Mr. Donegan Mr. Donegan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Donegan</NameTxt>
      <P>The purpose of special allowances is to supplement the income of former members of prescribed national organisations who, by reason of age or permanent infirmity, are unable to support themselves. The means test has been progressively relaxed and is at present far from severe.  Social welfare benefits are only partially assessed as means and budgetary increases in these benefits are disregarded entirely or substantially.</P>
      <P>The purpose of a means test is to ensure that maximum benefit is directed to the persons whose need is greatest.  Any relaxation of the means test would benefit only those special allowance holders who have means and it would not effect any improvement in the most necessitous cases.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJVMeaney" hpid="Mr. Meaney Mr. Meaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Meaney</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not agree with the Minister that they are not too rigid.  Would he agree to get rid of the free maintenance clause under which it is incumbent on a son or daughter to support the father and mother and it is left to the discretion of the pension officer and he assesses it as such?  Would the Minister be so kind as to get rid of that clause?  It can be assessed at £100, £500 or £600. It is a very rigid and strict clause.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickSDonegan" hpid="Mr. Donegan Mr. Donegan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Donegan</NameTxt>
      <P>It is not rigid or strict.  There is a long list here which I will be glad to send to the Deputy of all the relaxations that have been granted over the years.  There were still 10,575 special allowances on pay on 28th February of this year and the cost in the financial year is estimated at £1,792,000.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Donegan</NameTxt>
      <P>A special allowance, as distinct from a military service pension, is meant to help necessitous people.  It would be better, if there were to be an improvement, that the really necessitous people would be helped by giving them more.  It would not be a very good step forward to change a position whereby we exclude people who have means from this really good scheme.</P>

      <P>The free maintenance clause is completely archaic particularly in view of the cost of living. Would the Minister not also consider that the investigations carried out by social welfare officers who regard money given by a son or daughter for their own food as profit are unjust?  If a son is giving £5 or £6 a week to an applicant for a special allowance who is providing him with food and bedding this is regarded as profit.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>The interest rate charged by building societies on mortgages is determined by the rate which they must pay to investors to attract and retain funds.  The present investment rate of 8 per cent tax paid would normally require a mortgage rate of 12½ per cent but the special subsidy introduced by the Government in May, 1973, enables the societies to keep the maximum rate charged on home loans at 11¼ per cent.  I am glad to say that, subject to review, the Government have decided to continue the subsidy for a further period of six months from the 13th March.  In the meantime, I will be keeping the matter under constant review in conjunction with the societies.</P>

This will not have the immediate effect of dealing with the matter Deputy Timmons has in mind.  So far as competition from outside financial houses is concerned, the Government are subsidising the building societies to the tune of 1 per cent in order to allow them to have some protection against other financial bodies.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>As I told the Deputy in my reply to his Question No. 24 of 14th November, 1973, I asked housing authorities last October to initiate a new vigorous campaign for the care of the aged, jointly with health and welfare authorities.  I suggested that the provision of suitable housing should be the focal point of this effort. Specifically, I asked that in each area an informal working party, representative of all the services involved should be set up to co-ordinate a new local campaign setting defined objectives; and that these objectives should include a planned programme for providing schemes of sheltered housing, and a formal system of community care and support for the elderly when they are rehoused.  I have repeated this call publicly several times since then</P>

The question of redevelopment of these buildings in conjunction with some adjoining property is being examined by the corporation.  In the second case there are approximately 150 families in the five remaining blocks and the city commissioners do not propose to demolish these buildings; they propose to lower the density of occupation and improve and repair the buildings as far as possible.

      <P>The Local Government (Planning and Development) Act, 1963, and the regulations made thereunder do not provide for the issue of certificates of exemption from planning permission.  A person may carry out exempted development without <Col N="682" /> approaching the planning authority.  If in doubt he should consult with the planning authority.  Any question as to what in any particular case is or is not development or exempted development may be referred to me under section 5 of the 1963 Act for decision.</P>

      <P>The person named has not been prosecuted in the circumstances outlined by the Deputy.  His son was, however, twice prosecuted in similar circumstances and I am assuming that it is to this that the Deputy is referring. The summonses related to the unauthorised use of rebated hydrocarbon oil.  If the landrover involved had been so modified as to entitle it to be regarded as an agricultural tractor, the use of rebated oil would have been permissible.  Such, however, was not the case and convictions were recorded in respect of offences committed on 21st November, 1972, and 12th June, 1973.</P>

      <P>The Exchequer and Local Financial Years Act, 1974, recently enacted, provides for a change of Exchequer and local financial years to a calendar year basis as from 1st January, 1975, with a transitional nine-months' financial period from 1st April, 1974, to 31st December, 1974. The Act does not, however, change the income tax year so that the next <Col N="684" /> income tax year will be the 12-months' period from 6th April, 1974, to 5th April, 1975, and not the nine-months' period ending on 31st December, 1974.  In the circumstances, the adjustment of tax allowances and reliefs to a nine-months' basis will not arise.</P>

      <P>Until such time as the tax year is changed the adjustment which the Deputy has in mind will not arise.

      <P>The White Paper on Capital Taxation issued on 28th February, 1974, was intended to give an outline of the Government's proposals in regard to capital taxation.  I would refer the Deputy to paragraph 90 (a) of the White Paper which proposes that winnings from lotteries and sweepstakes in excess of £15,000 a year would be liable to capital gains tax. Paragraph 87 of the same Paper indicates that a non-resident would not be liable in respect of any such winnings.

The question of our joining as full members of this organisation, or of the European Space Agency (ESA) which will be its successor body from 1st March next, is currently under consideration. Because of the considerable expenditure which would be involved, a close analysis is being made of possible benefits as against estimated costs.
