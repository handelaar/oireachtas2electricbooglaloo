      <NameTxt>Aire na Gaeltachta (Mr. O'Donnell)</NameTxt>
      <P>Tairgim:&mdash;</P>
      <P>Go ndeonófar suim nach mó ná £3,650,000 chun íoctha an mhuirir a thiocfaidh chun bheith iníoctha i rith na tréimhse dar tosach an lú lá d'Aibreán, 1974, agus dar críoch an 31ú lá de Nollaig, 1974, le haghaidh tuarastail agus costais Roinn na Gaeltachta, maille le deontais le haghaidh tithe agus ildeontais-i-gcabhair.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Ós é seo an chéad uair ó ceapadh mé mar Aire a fuair mé deis Meastachán Roinn na Gaeltachta a thabhairt go foirmeálta ós comhair na Dála, ba mhaith liom tuairisc a thabhairt don Teach ar a bhfuil déanta le bliain go leith anuas, ar an gcor atá ar chúrsaí faoi láthair agus ar an dóchas atá againn do na blianta atá romhainn.  Is féidir liom a rá gur beag áit sa Ghaeltacht nach bhfuil cuairt tugtha agam féin air ó tháinig mé i gcúram na Roinne agus tá cuairteanna i ndiaidh <Col N="684" /> a chéile tugtha agam ar na príomhcheantair theas, thiar agus thuaidh. Tá aithne curtha agam ar líon mór daoine sa Ghaeltacht, tá eolas agus tuiscint faighte agam ar na fadhbanna atá le réiteach acu agus tá gach iarracht á déanamh agam chun fónamh orthu agus chun dóchas agus misneach a thabhairt dóibh.</P>
    <P>Bhí áthas orm nuair a ghlac an Rialtas le moltaí uaim tamall ó shin chun ceantair nua&mdash;i gContae Chiarraí agus i gContae Phort Láirge&mdash;a chur isteach sa Ghaeltacht.  Tá lándóchas agam go mbeidh dea-thoradh an tsocruithe sin le feiceáil sna blianta atá romhainn.</P>
    <P>Ba mhór an chúis sásaimh dom féin agus do mhuintir Ghaeltacht an Iarthair na cuairteanna a thug an Taoiseach agus an tAire Airgeadais ar an dúiche sin i rith na bliana.  Léirigh siad arís an spéis atá acu i bhforbairt na Gaeltachta agus is ábhar misnigh do phobal na Gaeltachta Ceann an Rialtais agus Aire an Airgid a bheith ag tacú go toilteanach leis na hiarrachtaí atá ar siúl againn.</P>
    <P>Is eol dom chomh maith gur ábhar sásaimh do mhuintir na Gaeltachta&mdash; agus go háirithe i nGaeltacht an Iarthair&mdash;an Roinn féin a bheith ag teacht níos cóngaraí doibh.  Faoi mar a chinn an Rialtas, aistreofar oiread agus is féidir d'obair na Roinne go dtí na Forbacha i nGaeltacht na Gaillimhe; glacfar lánchomhairle le comhaltaí na foirne agus is dá dtoil féin a aistreofar iad.  Tá na socruithe don aistriú ag dul ar aghaidh faoi mar a ceapadh dóibh.</P>
    <P>Chomh maith leis an soláthar £3,650,000 atá sa Mheastachán tá airleacan £1.5 mhilliún á chur ar fáil do Ghaeltarra Éireann don tréimhse ó Aibreán go Nollaig i mbliana.  Taispeánann an t-iomlán de bhreis agus £5 mhilliún don tréimhse sin go bhfuil ráta bliantúil an tsoláthair ag dul i méid ó bhliain go bliain&mdash;i gcás na Roinne féin agus i gcás Ghaeltarra. Tá rian an airgid sin le haithint ar fud na Gaeltachta agus ba mhaith liom tuairisc a thabhairt don Dáil ar chuid den obair is tábhachtaí a rinneadh sa bhliain go leith ó thosach na bliana airgeadais seo caite anuas go deireadh Mheán Fómhair i mbliana.</P>
    <P>Faoi na scéimeanna tithíochta <Col N="685" /> críochnaíodh cásanna mar a leanas:&mdash; 320 teach nua; 250 feabhsú tí; 300 seomra folcaidh; 260 soláthar uisce; 300 saoráidí séarachais; 75 fheabhsú uisce agus séarachais; 60 méadú speisialta do chuairteoirí agus 33 shealla saoire.</P>
    <P>Beidh Bille nua Tithíochta á thabhairt ós comhair na Dála agam go luath chun éifeacht reachtúil a thabhairt do na deontais tithíochta atá á n-íoc le tamall.  Nuair a bheidh an Bille sin á phlé beidh deis againn dul isteach arís i gcúrsaí tithíochta sa Ghaeltacht.</P>
    <P>Tá forbairt na cuartaíochta ag dul chun cinn sa Ghaeltacht i gcónaí.  I mbliana tá suas le 900 teach iostais&mdash; a bhfuil breis agus 3,000 seomra leapa iontu&mdash;i leabhrán na Roinne &ldquo;Tithe Iostais do Chuairteoirí Gaeltachta&rdquo; agus beidh tuilleadh fós in eagrán 1975 atá á ullmhú faoi láthair ag an Roinn. Ón eolas atá ar fáil agam, go háirithe ó na hóstáin a bhfuil Gaeltarra páirteach iontu, is féidir liom a rá go raibh méadú mór ar líon na gcuairteoirí go dtí an Ghaeltacht i mbliana.</P>
    <P>Tá mórchuid feabhais curtha ar bhóithre áise sa Ghaeltacht cé go bhfuil sé le haithint le tamall go bhfuil deacrachtaí sa bhealach ar na húdaráis áitiúla maidir le hoibreacha a chur i gcrích.  Tá súil agam nach fada go socrófar na deacrachtaí sin.  Is ábhar sásaimh dom an dul chun cinn atá á dhéanamh ag coistí áitiúla Gaeltachta atá ag obair chun grúpscéimeanna uisce a chur i gcrích le cúnamh fial ón Roinn anuas ar dheontais ón Roinn Rialtais Áitiúil agus ó na comhairlí contae.  Is léiriú ar éifeacht ár scéimeanna feabhsúcháin obair mar a leanas a bheith déanta sa tréimhse atá i gceist:&mdash;</P>

    <P>Tá an obair ar ché Ros an Mhíl &mdash; a bhfuil deontas suas le £500,000 ceadaithe ina leith &mdash; ag dul ar aghaidh go maith agus tá muiroibreacha i gcuan an Daingin, Contae Chiarrai, geall le bheith críochnaithe ar chostas £230,000.  Tá deontais suas go £250,000 san iomlán ceadaithe do mhuiroibreacha eile i Machaire <Col N="686" /> Rabhartaigh, Árainn Mhór, Teileann agus Slad na bhFaigheog i gContae Dhún na nGall; i nDumha Éige, Port Durlainne agus Rinn Rua i gContae Mhaigh Eo; agus i gCill Éinne i gContae na Gaillimhe.  Tá suas le £380,000 íoctha ag an Roinn ar mhuiroibreacha Gaeltachta ó Mhárta 1973 i leith.</P>
    <P>Is cúis sásaimh dom cúrsaí soláthair leictreachais a bheith ag dul ar aghaidh go maith, le cabhair na Roinne, ar na príomhoileáin Ghaeltachta. Ba mhaith liom buíochas a ghabháil le Bord Soláthair an Leictreachais mar gheall ar an gcomhoibriú a fuarthas uathu san obair sin. Tá an leictreachas ag muintir Chléire le tamall maith; tá sé ag muintir Thoraigh agus Inis Oírr freisin; agus tá tús curtha leis an obair ar Inis Mór Árann agus súil leis an soláthar faoi Iúil na bliana seo chugainn.  Is áthas liom freisin go bhfuil 26 chomharchumann ag obair i gceantair Ghaeltachta. Bhí dóchas agam riamh go ndéanfadh gluaiseacht na comharaíochta mórán tairbhe don Ghaeltacht agus is mó fós mo dhóchas anois nuair a fheicim toradh an tsaothair atá ar siúl ag roinnt díobh.  Deontais suas le £75,000 atá íoctha againn le comharchumainn le bliain go leith.</P>
    <P>Is maith liom a rá go bhfuil comharchumainn ag comhoibriú le chéile chun an chomharaíocht a chur chun cinn ar fud na Gaeltachta.  Is cúis misnigh dúinn cónascadh éifeachtach dá leithéid sin agus beidh tacaíocht le fáil ó mo Roinnse.  Braithim go bhféadfaidh lucht na gcomharchumann cabhrú go mór le chéile ar an mbealach sin.  Tig leo bheith ag foghlaim as taithí a gcuid iarrachtaí, as a mhéad a éiríonn leo agus, go deimhin, as a mhéad a theipeann orthu.</P>
    <P>Sa bhliain go leith atá caite tháinig forbairt nua thábhachtach i gcuid den chomharaíocht sa Ghaeltacht.  Luaim mar shampla monarcha phróiseála éisc in Ailt an Chorráin agus stáisiún beathaithe uan in Acaill.  Is maith liom a rá freisin go bhfuil cabhair tugtha do thionscal na gcaorach i gContae Dhún na nGall, go bhfuil stáisiúin bheathaithe uan á mbunú faoi láthair i nDúiche Sheoigheach agus i gCorca Dhuibhne agus go <Col N="687" /> bhfuil marglann bheostoic á tógáil sa Daingean.  Tá dul chun cinn nach beag á dhéanamh i dTuaisceart Mhaigh Eo, áit a bhfuil Comhar Iorrais agus Gaeltarra Éireann i bpáirt le chéile i gcomhlacht nua chun roinnt mílte acra talún a fheabhsú. Is é seo an cineál praiticiúil comharaíochta a fhéadfaidh cabhrú go mór le cúrsaí forbartha ar fud na Gaeltachta.</P>
    <P>Tá tábhacht ar leith le hionaid phobail áitiúla chun an saol sóisialach a fheabhsú sa Ghaeltacht.  Ní féidir déanamh dá n-éagmais má tá áiseanna caithimh aimsire agus saoráidí eile le bheith ag an aos óg sna paróistí Gaeltachta.  Tá dul chun cinn sásúil déanta cheana ina lán ceantar Gaeltachta le cabhair scéim na hallaí atá á reachtáil ag an Roinn agus tá an obair ag dul ar aghaidh i gcónaí.  Bhí sé d'onóir agam ionad pobail a oscailt i mbliana i bhFánaid, Contae Dhún na nGall, agus ceann eile i mBaile Gib, Contae na Mí, agus beidh áras pobail eile le hoscailt go han-luath i Ráth Cairn, Contae na Mí.  Tá ionad á chur ar fáil le cabhair na Roinne ar an bhFáirche, Contae na Gaillimhe, agus táthar ag ullmhú do cheann i nGaoth Dobhair.</P>
    <P>I dteannta a bhfuil ráite agam anois díreach faoi áiseanna sóisialacha sa Ghaeltacht a dtugtar cabhair dóibh faoinár scéimeanna feabhsúcháin, tá scéimeanna eile cultúrtha agus sóisialacha á reachtáil againn nach leis an nGaeltacht amháin a bhaineann siad ach a théann chun leasa don Ghaeilge chomh maith.  Tá dea-thoradh ar an socrú a rinne an Rialtas chun deontas na mban tí Gaeltachta a dhúbhailt i gcás daltaí a dhéanann freastal ar chúrsaí Gaeilge sa Ghaeltacht.  Anuraidh chuaigh líon na ndaltaí i méid go 13,500 agus deontais na Roinne go £320,000; agus i mbliana tá líon na ndaltaí imithe thar 17,000 agus tá deontais £378,000 íoctha againn leis na mná tí.  Chomh maith leis sin d'íoc an Roinn deontais don chéad uair riamh&mdash;os cionn £14,500 i leith 1,500 dalta&mdash;i gcás daoine óga a rinne freastal ar chúrsaí samhraidh i gcoláistí áirithe Gaeilge lasmuigh den Ghaeltacht.  Is léir gur <Col N="688" /> fearr a mhairfidh an Ghaeilge ar an ngríosadh ná ar an éigeantas.</P>
    <P>Tá scéim nua tugtha isteach againn &mdash;an scéim scoláireachtaí do cheardcholáistí réigiúin&mdash;chun cabhrú le daltaí Gaeltachta cúrsaí oiriúnacha lánaimsire trí Ghaeilge a dhéanamh. Is i gcomhairle leis an Roinn Oideachais atá an scéim sin á reachtáil agus beidh deontais á n-íoc againn ar aon chaighdeán leis na deontais a bheidh ceadaithe de thuras na huaire ag an Roinn sin chun a chumasú do dhaltaí cúrsaí ardoideachais a dhéanamh in ollscoileanna nó i bhforais dá samhail.  Níl ach ceardcholáiste amháin ina bhfuil na deontais seo á dtuilleamh go fóill &mdash;Ceardcholáiste na Gaillimhe, áit a bhfuil cúrsa lánaimsire trí Ghaeilge ar staidéar gnó ar siúl.  Tá dóchas agam go dtabharfaidh an scéim nua uchtach do choláistí eile cúrsaí oiriúnacha a chur ar siúl do dhaltaí na Gaeltachta.</P>
    <P>I gcúrsaí gearrscannán, d'éirigh go han-mhaith leis an scannán daite &ldquo;An Ghaeilge Bheo&rdquo;.  Taispeánadh é i roinnt mhaith scoileanna ar fud na tíre agus níor bheag a chabhraigh sé leis na coláistí Gaeilge agus le gnóthaí cuartaíochta sa Ghaeltacht. Léiríodh ar an teilifís freisin é agus ba mhaith liom buíochas a ghabháil le húdaráis RTE dá chionn sin: táimid faoi chomaoin acu.  Rinneadh scannán eile&mdash;&ldquo;An Bodhrán&rdquo;&mdash; freisin agus táthar tar éis é a léiriú go poiblí cheana féin sa Ghaeltacht. Tá scannán eile fós ar láimh againn faoi láthair a léireoidh cuid den dul ar aghaidh sa Ghaeltacht agus tá súil agam go mbeidh sé ar fáil in earrach na bliana seo chugainn.</P>
    <P>Tá roinnt mhaith airgid á caitheamh againn ar thréimhseacháin Ghaeilge agus is ábhar imní dom cuid de na deacrachtaí&mdash;go háirithe deacrachtaí airgid&mdash;a bhaineann leo.  Ba mhaith liom ceist na dtréimhseachán a chur á scrúdú féachaint an féidir toradh níos fearr a fháil ar an airgead poiblí a chaitear orthu&mdash;breis agus £45,000 sa tréimhse ó Aibreán go Nollaig i mbliana.  B'fhéidir gurbh fhearr dúinn, mar shampla, ár n-iarrachtaí a thiomsú go láidir ar fhoilseachán nó dhó ná ár n-acmhainn a scaipeadh ag iarraidh bheith ag <Col N="689" /> freastal ar an iomarca san aontráth. Ar an taobh eile, is maith liom a fheiceáil go bhfuil ag éirí go maith le hirisí áitiúla Gaeltachta atá á bhfoilsiú le cabhair ón Roinn.  Ní baol do Ghaeilge na Gaeltachta má bhíonn sí á scríobh agus á léamh ag muintir na Gaeltachta féin.</P>
    <P>Bhí áthas orm go raibh ar mo chumas teacht i gcabhair, faoinár scéimeanna cultúrtha, ar dhá eagras a bhfuil spéis mhór agam iontu agus ard-dóchas agam go mbeidh toradh fónta ar a saothar go ceann na mblianta fada.  Táim ag trácht ar Chomhaltas Ceoltóirí Éireann agus ar Shiamsa Tíre.  Tá siad araon molta agus athmholta agam cheana agus is deímhin liom go n-aontóidh an Dáil liom gur chóir agus gurbh fhiú dúinn cabhrú leo.  Sa bhliain 1973-74 íocadh deontas £35,000 leis an gComhaltas agus tá £30,000 á íoc leo don tréimhse reatha.  I gcás Shiamsa Tíre tá £50,000 airgead caipitil geallta dóibh ón Roinn agus £50,000 eile ó Bhord Fáilte Éireann agus tá socraithe againn deontas reachtála in aghaidh na bliana a íoc leo chomh maith i gcomhar leis an mbord.</P>
    <P>Bhí sé d'onóir agam an chéad Teach Siamsa a oscailt go hoifigiúil i rith an tSamhraidh i bhFionnúig i gContae Chiarraí agus chas mé an fód don dara teach ar an gCarraig i gCorca Dhuibhne i nGaeltacht Chiarraí le déanaí.  Ba mhór an t-ábhar bróin dúinn uile ar an gCarraig an lá sin gur cailleadh Liam Tarrant go hobann i lár an cheiliúrtha. Ba rinceoir agus siamsóir den chéad scoth é a rinne breis agus cion fir chun obair Shiamsa a chur chun cinn: go gcúití Dia a shaothar leis.  Is mór an chailliúint a bhás.</P>
    <P>Is é mo thuairim féin gur i saothar Shiamsa Tíre atá an fhorbairt is suntasaí agus is tábhachtaí i gcúrsaí cultúrtha na tíre ó bunaíodh an Stát.  Ní sa bhaile amháin atá aitheantas faighte acu ach thar lear freisin mar is léir ón mórdhuais chultúrtha Ghearmánach a bronnadh orthu le déanaí.</P>
    <P>Tá an soláthair i gCiste na Gaeilge ag dul i méid ó bhliain go bliain. D'íoc an Roinn breis agus £200,000 <Col N="690" /> sa bhliain airgeadais 1973-74 le heagrais áirithe atá ag cabhrú le leathnú na Gaeilge ar fud na tíre.  Ar na heagrais a fuair deontais bhí GaelLinn, £65,785; Comhdháil Náisiúnta na Gaeilge, £55,000; Conradh na Gaeilge, £36,657; an Ghluaiseacht Náisiúnta Drámaíochta, £18,500; agus an tOireachtas, £11,000.  Toisc go mbraitheann méid na ndeontas i gcuid de na cásanna ar theacht isteach na n-eagras ó fhoinsí eile, níl na figiúirí iomlána ar fáil go fóill don tréimhse reatha.  Is féidir a rá, áfach, gur £46,000 atá ceadaithe do Chomhdháil Náisiúnta na Gaelige agus £16,000 don Oireachtas.</P>
    <P>Is dona liom nach bhfuil réiteach ar fáil fós san aighneas an dá thaobh sa Ghluaiseacht Náisiúnta Drámaíochta. Tá súil agam, áfach, gur gearr anois go bhfaighidh mé na moltaí ón gcoiste fiosraithe a bhunaigh mé sa chás sin agus, más réiteach agus comhar cairdiúil a thiocfaidh de na moltaí sin, is fiú fanacht leo.  Ní foláir don dá thaobh sprid an aontais a chothú eatarthu féin agus teacht ar shocrú ar mhaithe leis an drámaíocht Ghaeilge.  Is deacair domsa agus don Roinn cabhrú mar ba mhian linn leis an ngluaiseacht drámaíochta fad a bheidh míthuiscint nó easaontas idir na dreamanna atá páirteach inti.</P>
    <P>Ba mhaith liom focal molta speisialta a thabhairt do Ghlór na nGael.  Tá obair an-tábhachtach ar siúl acu le cumas agus le ciall.  Dá chomhartha sin, tá ag éirí leo mórchuid den phobal a tharraingt isteach sa ghluaiseacht chun an teanga agus an cultúr is dúchas dúinn a neartú. Ba chúis mhór sásaimh dom a fheabhas a d'éirigh leis an gClochán, Contae Chiarraí, i gcomórtas Ghlór na nGael anuraidh agus ní fhéadfainn moladh ró-ard a thabhairt do na díograiseoirí éifeachtacha a thug an chraobh go hEochaill i gContae Chorcaí i mbliana.</P>
    <P>Beidh páirt an-tábhachtach le glacadh ag na heagrais dheonacha teanga agus cultúir i bhforbairt na ngnéithe sin dár saol feasta.  Tá gá le comhoibriú níos dlúithe agus comhordú níos fearr idir iarrachtaí <Col N="691" /> na n-eagras éagsúil.  Mar shampla den rud atá in aigne agam ba mhaith liom tagairt a dhéanamh don chaint a rinne mé ag oscailt Féile Luimnigh i mí Feabhra seo caite nuair a d'iarr mé ar lucht eagraithe féilte ar fud na tíre lá amháin ar a laghad de gach féile bhliantúil a thabhairt d'imeachtaí teanga agus cultúir.  D'iarr mé comhoibriú na n-eagras éagsúil ina dhiaidh sin agus ba mhór agam an tacaíocht a fuair mé uathu.  Ba mhórchúis misnigh dom freisin freagairt lucht na bhféilte féin agus méid na n-imeachtaí Gaelacha a d'éirigh leo a chur sna féilte ar fud na tíre i mbliana.</P>
    <P>Chun comhordú ceart a dhéanamh ar iarrachtaí choistí na bhféilte ar fud na tíre agus iarrachtaí na n-eagras náisiúnta teanga agus cultúir, tá socraithe agam coiste speisialta ar bhonn náisiúnta a thabhairt le chéile ar a mbeidh ionadaithe ó na heagrais éagsúla, ó Bhord Fáilte Éireann agus ó na heagrais réigiúnacha chuartaíochta. Sna laethanta seo bíonn féile bhliantúil ag formhór na mbailte in Éirinn, idir mhór agus bheag, agus tugann siad sin scóip mhór agus deis bhreá dúinn chun tuiscint agus meas níos fearr a chothú ar thábhacht ár dteanga agus ár gcultúir.</P>
    <P>I dtús na bliana airgeadais seo caite, mar is eol don Teach, cheap mé cúig chomhalta nua ar Bhord Ghaeltarra Éireann ar a raibh triúr ón nGaeltacht&mdash;thuaidh, thiar agus theas&mdash;feidhmeannach ceardchumainn agus feidhmeannach sinsearach ón Údarás Forbartha Tionscail.  Is chun teagmháil níos dlúithe a choimeád le pobal na Gaeltachta agus forbairt na Gaeltachta a thabhairt isteach i mórshruth na forbartha náisiúnta a rinne mé é sin.</P>
    <P>Thug mé údarás ginearálta don bhord deontais do mhiontionscail a cheadú suas go £40,000.  Cuireann sé seo ar chumas Ghaeltarra cabhrú le tograí níos mó gan scaireanna a ghlacadh sna comhlachtaí&mdash;rud a oireann go háirithe do mhiontionscail a raibh cuid mhaith fáis tagtha fúthu agus breis cúnaimh de dhíth orthu d'fhonn an gnó agus an fhostaíocht a mhéadú tuilleadh.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="692" /> Is áthas liom a rá go bhfuil ag éirí le Gaeltarra i gcónaí dul chun cinn maith a dhéanamh i gcúrsaí tionscail. Is mór an chreidiúint dóibh é sin go háirithe ó thús na bliana seo ag féachaint do na deacrachtaí atá ag cur isteach ar chúrsaí eacnamaíochta i gcoitinne.  Le bliain go leith anuas ceadaíodh cúnamh do 20 togra nua comhthionscail&mdash;a mbeidh Gaeltarra féin páirteach iontu&mdash;agus do 75 thogra nua miontionscail.  Ach na tionscail seo, idir bheag agus mhór, a bheith faoi lánseol, cuirfidh siad fostaíocht ar fáil do thart ar 1,500 duine ar fad.  Tá os cionn 2,500 duine fostaithe go lánaimseartha sna tionscail uile ar chabhraigh Gaeltarra leo ó tugadh cumhachtaí forbartha dóibh agus sna tionscail atá á reachtáil ag Gaeltarra féin.  Ach na tionscail sin ar fad a bheith faoi lánseol meastar go gcuirfidh siad suas le 2,000 post breise ar fáil san iomlán. Ní beag le rá an chéim sin i dtreo na lánfhostaíochta sa Ghaeltacht.</P>
    <P>Bhí sé de phribhléid agam féin seacht dtionscal nua a oscailt go hoifigiúil ar fud na Gaeltachta le tuairim is bliain anuas.  Chomh maith leis sin d'oscail an Taoiseach biúró ríomhaireachta de chuid Ríomhaire Teoranta sna Forbacha le déanaí; cuirfidh sé sin seirbhís ríomhaireachta nua-aimseartha ar fáil in Éirinn agus sa Bhreatain tríd an gcóras teileagrafaíochta.  Is comhartha muiníne é as an infheistíocht sa Ghaeltacht comhlacht mór poiblí Éireannach a bheith sásta anois páirt a ghlacadh sa chomhthionscal sin.  Tá súil agam go ndéanfaidh a lán comhlachtaí eile aithris orthu.</P>
    <P>Is é Ríomhaire Teoranta an dara mórchóras ríomhaireachta atá bunaithe sa Ghaeltacht le cabhair ó Ghaeltarra. Is amhlaidh atáimid ag iarraidh níos treise ná riamh tionscail seirbhíse a thabhairt isteach sa Ghaeltacht d'fhonn go mbeidh raon fostaíochta níos leithne don lucht saothair agus rogha poist ar fáil do gach duine más féidir.  Chun daoine a bhfuil oideachas den dara leibhéal agus den tríú leibhéal acu a choinneáil sa Ghaeltacht ní foláir poist ardréime a bheith ann a mheallfaidh agus a spreagfaidh chun fostaíochta sa bhaile iad.</P>
    <P>D'fhonn cabhrú le hiarrachtaí Ghaeltarra <Col N="693" /> chun tuilleadh tionscal a fháil, thug mé cuairt lena gcuid oifigeach ar naoi gcathair sa Ghearmáin agus san Iodáil le déanaí.  De thoradh an turais sin táim sásta go bhfaighfear ar a laghad trí thionscal nua don Ghaeltacht agus go bhfuil seans maith go bhfaighfear trí cinn eile freisin.  Ghabhfadh fostaíocht do 650 go 800 duine leis na sé thionscal atá i gceist agam.</P>
    <P>Chabhraigh Gaeltarra le sprid na fiontraíochta i gcúrsaí tionscail a mhúscailt tuilleadh i muintir na Gaeltachta&mdash;go háirithe i gcás na ndaoine a raibh miontionscail bunaithe nó á mbunú acu ar a gconlán féin.  Mar chuid den tseirbhís sin eagraíodh cúrsaí oiliúna éagsúla agus seimineáir.  Is trí mhiontionscail fhiúntacha dá gcuid féin a bhunú agus a mhéadú is fearr is féidir le muintir na Gaeltachta páirt a ghlacadh i bhforbairt eacnamaíoch na Gaeltachta.  Is ar mhuintir na Gaeltachta féin a bheifear ag brath cuid mhaith chun an lánfhostaíocht a thabhairt i gcrích sa Ghaeltacht agus is féidir a rá go bhfuil a gcion féin á dhéanamh acu: ach na miontionscail atá idir lámha acu a bheith faoi lánseol beidh suas le 1,500 post nua iontu. D'fhonn cabhrú le pobal na Gaeltachta agus leis an tionsclaíocht a chur chun cinn thug Gaeltarra níos mó aire ná riamh do chúrsaí oiliúna. Chuir siad feabhas ar a gcuid socruithe agus ar na cláir oiliúna i gcomhairle le hAnCO.  Cuireadh cúrsaí traenála ginearálta agus cúrsaí ar leith ar siúl san ionad atá ag AnCO ar an eastát tionscail i nGaoth Dobhair.</P>
    <P>Tá aire ar leith á tabhairt do chur chun cinn na ceardaíochta, rud a oireann go maith do chultúr agus do thraidisiún na Gaeltachta toisc go ngabhann ardscil agus mórchuid oiliúna lena leithéid.  I gcomhairle leis an gCoiste Ceardaíochta, a bunaíodh i dtús na bliana, táthar tar éis buntreoracha a leagan amach i dtaobh a mbeadh le déanamh chun na tionscail éagsúla sin a spreagadh agus chun clár oiliúna do na hoibrithe a chur le chéile.  Tá i gceist ionaid cheardaíochta a bhunú i gcúig áit ar fud na Gaeltachta.  Faoi láthair tá idirbheartaíocht ar siúl faoi ocht dtionscal <Col N="694" /> nua lámhcheirde a bhunú a mbainfeadh roinnt acu le potaireacht, seodra, fíodóireacht, oirnéisí ceoil agus obair mhiotail.</P>
    <P>Is léir óna bhfuil ráite agam go bhfuil raon leathan forbartha ar siúl ag Gaeltarra&mdash;mórthionscail, miontionscail agus tionscail lámhcheirde. Tá ag éirí leo tionscail a bhunú ar acmhainn nádúrtha na Gaeltachta, mar atá, próiseáil éisc agus adhmaid, próiseáil ghrianchloiche in Acaill agus céimeanna éagsúla forbartha ar an talmhaíocht agus ar an ngairneoireacht. Le tamall anuas tá aire ar leith á tabhairt acu d'fhorbairt na n-acmhainní nádúrtha sna ceantair Ghaeltachta, cúrsaí a bhfuilim féin ag tacú go fonnmhar leo.  Tá Bord Ghaeltarra tar éis clár forbartha a leagan amach agus foireann a chur ar fáil chun taighde agus tionscnamh a dhéanamh. Tá an talamh, an t-uisce agus an timpeallacht san áireamh agus beifear ag iarraidh feidhm iomlán a bhaint as cumas mhuintir na Gaeltachta fein Beifear ar lorg tionscal buanmharthana lena mbunú ar mhianraí&mdash;cré, iathchloch, miotail luachmhara, ábhair thógála, agus mar sin de&mdash;agus ar chothú beithíoch, fás plandaí agus forbairt ghnóthaí mara ar a n-áirítear iascfheirmeoireacht agus an chuartaíocht.</P>
    <P>Tá sé d'aidhm ag Gaeltarra go rachaidh an fhorbairt shóisialach ar aghaidh céim ar chéim leis an bhforbairt eacnamaíoch sin.  Tá an scéim duaiseanna pobail ar cuireadh tús léi i rith na bliana ag dul chun cinn go maith: tá an pobal i 42 cheantar ag glacadh páirte sa chomórtas cheana agus tuilleadh ceantar ag cur isteach air fós.  Bronnfar duaiseanna don chéad uair i gceann bliana nó mar sin.  Is é is cuspóir don scéim seo ná an pobal a spreagadh chun tionscnaimh d'fhonn tionscadail a bhunú a chuirfidh feabhas ar gach gné dá saol sóisialach.  Tá cúnamh á lorg ó dhaoine eile ón taobh amuigh a bheadh sásta tacú leis an scéim.  Bhí an cuspóir céanna le seachtainí forbartha a cuireadh ar siúl i dTuar Mhic Éadaigh, i gCorr na Móna agus i dTír an Fhia agus táthar ag ullmhú do sheachtain den saghas sin i mBaile na Finne.  Tá i gceist tuilleadh <Col N="695" /> seachtainí dá leithéid sin a reachtáil in áiteanna eile i rith na bliana seo chugainn.</P>
    <P>Ghlac Gaeltarra páirt i roinnt taispeántas d'fhonn eolas a scaipeadh faoin dul chun cinn a bhí á dhéanamh sa Ghaeltacht agus daoine taobh amuigh den Ghaeltacht a tharraingt isteach san obair.  Orthusan bhí &ldquo;An Ghaeltacht Beo&rdquo; i mBaile Átha Cliath; Féile Chiarraí; Mórshiúl Lá Fhéile Pádraigh agus an tOireachas i gCois Fharraige.  D'éirigh go maith leo sna hiarrachtaí sin.</P>
    <P>Faoi mar is eol don Teach, is minic a luaigh mé an géarghá atá le cláir fhorbartha ar leith do na príomhoileáin Ghaeltachta atá scartha go maith ón mórthír.  Rinne Gaeltarra suirbhéireacht iomlán ar na hoileáin sin agus tá oifigeach forbartha ag cabhrú go lánaimseartha leis na daoine atá ina gcónaí orthu.  Ba chúis mhór sásaimh dom a fhógairt le déanaí gur éirigh le Gaeltarra tionscail nua a fháil do dhá cheann díobh &mdash;Árainn Mhór i gContae Dhún na nGall agus Inis Mór Árann na Gaillimhe.  Tá ar intinn ag Gaeltarra clár réalaíoch forbartha a chur i gcrích ar na hoileáin Ghaeltachta.</P>
    <P>Ní foláir dúinn a mheabhrú agus na cúrsaí forbartha sin á bplé againn gur réigiún iargúlta ar fhorimeall na hEorpa an Ghaeltacht agus nach iad na hoileáin amháin ach an chuid is mó den Ghaeltacht ar an mórthír fein atá scoite iargúlta agus i bhfad ó láthair na bpríomh-mhargaí.  Bíonn forbairt na réigiún imeallach ag brath go mór ar chúrsaí iompair agus cumarsáide agus dá bhrí sin rinneadh cúram ar leith den ghné sin den scéal le bliain anuas.  Faoi mar is eol do na Teachtaí, ghlac Gaeltarra páirt, i gcomhar le hAer Árann agus le comhlacht Éireannach eile, i bhfeabhsú aersheirbhísí ar fud na Gaeltachta agus go háirithe i gcás na n-oileán.  Tá eitleán breise a ceannaíodh ó shin ag feidhmiú le tamall agus beartaítear an tríú heitleán a cheannach sa bhliain 1975.  Tá úsáid á baint cheana as na haerstráicí ar Inis Mór agus ar Inis Meáin agus tá an t-aerfort nua i gCarn Mór i nGaeltacht na Gaillimhe ar oscailt <Col N="696" /> anois.  Tá obair á cur i gcrích ar aerstráice nua i mBaile an Sceilg agus táthar ag súil leis go gcuirfear tús leis an obair go luath ar aerstráicí ar Inis Oírr agus i nGaoth Dobhair.  Ni amháin go ndéanfaidh scéim choimsitheach aersheirbhísí freastal ar mhuintir na Gaeltachta féin ach chabhródh sí go mór le leas eacnamaíoch agus sóisialach na Gaeltachta a chur chun cinn.</P>
    <P>Is mór an trua nár ghlac Comhphobal na hEorpa le beartas réigiúnach go fóill agus nár bunaíodh ciste réigiúnach as a mbeifí ag súil le cúnamh d'fhorbairt na Gaeltachta agus an Iarthair.  Is cúis sásaimh é, áfach, go bhfuil airgead á fháil don Ghaeltacht ó chiste eile de chuid an Chomhphobail.  Tá deontas caipitil £58,000 a iarradh anuraidh ceadaithe as an gciste FEOGA do Chomhar Iorrais Teo., comharchumann a bhfuil Gaeltarra páirteach leo sa chomh-chomhlacht Forbairt Talún Iorrais Teo., agus tá trí hiarratas curtha isteach faoi scéim 1974.  Tá cúnamh á fháil ag Gaeltarra féin d'oiliúint oibrithe ó Chiste Sóisialach na hEorpa. Táthar ag súil le £97,000 i mbliana i leith na bliana anuraidh, tá glactha i bprionsabal le hiarratas ar £150,000 don bhliain fhéilire seo agus tá iarratas curtha isteach ar £240,000 don bhliain seo chugainn.  Thug feidhmeannaigh shinsearacha de chuid an choimisiúin, go háirithe iad siúd ar chúram dóibh an ciste sóisialach, roinnt cuairteanna ar an nGaeltacht.</P>
    <P>Faoi mar is eol don Dáil tá socraithe ag an Rialtas Údarás nua Gaeltachta a bhunú faoi scáth Roinn na Gaeltachta.  Beidh cumhachtaí leathana ag an Údarás agus rannpháirtíocht ag pobal na Gaeltachta ann chun clár uileghabhálach don Ghaeltacht a chur i ngníomh.  Beidh eagrú, structúr feidhmeanna agus cumhachtaí an Údaráis nua ag teacht leis na príomhmholtaí atá i <i>nGníomh don Ghaeltacht.</i> Glacfaidh an tÚdarás nua chuige feidhmeanna forbartha atá faoi láthair ag Roinn na Gaeltachta agus ag Gaeltarra Éireann agus tabharfar dóibh freisin aon fheidhmeanna nua is gá ar mhaithe le forbairt eacnamaíoch, shóisialach, theangaíoch agus chultúrtha na Gaeltachta. <Col N="697" /> Tá an Bille a bheidh ag teastáil á ullmhú agus, nuair a bheidh glactha ag an Rialtais leis, tabharfar faoi bhráid na Dála é.</P>
    <P>Mar gheall ar a dheacra atá sé an rannpháirtíocht is dual do phobal na Gaeltachta féin san Údaras a shocrú bhunaig mé coiste speisialta tamall ó shin chun comhairle a chur orm. Beidh molta ar fáil ón gcoiste go han-luath agus beidh ar mo chumas díriú ar an ngné sin den scéal.</P>
    <P>Faoi mar a d'fhógair mé tamall ó shin, tá socraithe ag an Rialtas Bord reachtúil&mdash;Bord na Gaeilge&mdash;a bhunú agus cumhachtaí feidhmiúcháin aige chun leas na Gaeilge a chur chun cinn; ullmhófar Bille cuí agus, sula mbeidh sé ina Acht, bunófar an bord ar bhonn <i>ad hoc.</i> Tá an cinneadh sin ag teacht leis an tuarascáil <i>Feidhmiú Polasaí Teanga</i> inar mhol Comhairle na Gaeilge go sannfaí feidhm ghinearálta leathnú na Gaeilge do bhord reachtúil ar leith a dtabharfaí Bord na Gaeilge air.</P>
    <P>Is í Roinn na Gaeltachta a bheidh freagrach i mBord na Gaeilge agus is uirthi freisin a bheidh an phríomhfhreagracht i bhfeidhmiú an bheartais ghinearálta atá ag an Rialtas chun an pobal a spreagadh ar thaobh úsáid na Gaeilge ar fud na tíre.  Is é seo an chéad uair a cuireadh an fhreagracht sin ar aon Roinn áirithe.  Ranna eile a bhfuil freagracht orthu i ngnéithe áirithe de bheartas an Rialtais don Ghaeilge leanfaidh siad don fhreagracht sin a chomhlíonadh ach aistreofar chuig Roinn na Gaeltachta aonaid áirithe a bhfuil feidhmeanna sonracha acu&mdash;Bord na Leabhar Gaeilge, mar shampla.</P>
    <P>Tá súil agam go mbeidh ar mo chumas ainmneacha comhaltaí Bhord na Gaeilge a fhógairt go han-luath.  Tá i gceist agam go rachaidh siad i mbun oibre a luaithe is féidir ina dhiaidh sin.</P>
    <P>Anois nuair atá beartas soiléir agus socruithe cinnte leagtha amach againn don Ghaeltacht agus don Ghaeilge, feicim ré nua faoi rath agus faoi ghradam i ndán dóibh i 1975 agus sna blianta ina dhiaidh sin.  Tuigeann an Rialtas gurb í an Ghaeltacht foinse agus tobar ár dteanga agus ár gcultúir. Beidh de phríomhchúram ar Údarás na <Col N="698" /> Gaeltachta, mar sin, aire speisialta a thabhairt do neartú agus do leathnú úsáid na Gaeilge sa Ghaeltacht.</P>
    <P>Tá lándóchas agam freisin go n-éireoidh le Bord na Gaeilge spreagadh mór chun cinn a thabhairt do bheartas an Rialtais i leith na Gaeilge, is é sin, meas ar an nGaeilge a chothú agus an teanga féin a chur chun cinn.</P>
    <P>Tig liom a gheallúint go ndéanfaidh mé féin agus Roinn na Gaeltachta gach dícheall chun go mbeidh an dá eagras atá le bunú ina ngléasanna éifeachtacha chun beartas an Rialtais don Ghaeltacht agus don Ghaeilge a chur ar aghaidh.</P>
    <P>Tá geall an Rialtais d'fhorbairt Gaeltachta agus do chothú ár dteanga agus ár gcultúir léirithe go follasach acu ó tháinig siad i gcúram oifige trí na socruithe móra fadraonacha atá déanta acu agus atá á gcur i ngníomh anois.  Na socruithe i dtaobh an t-éigeantas a bhaint as an nGaeilge i scrúduithe iar-bhunoideachais, i dtaobh Údarás na Gaeltachta agus Bord na Gaeilge a bhunú, i dtaobh freagracht i leathnú na Gaeilge ar fud na tíre a thabhairt don chéad uair do Roinn amháin Stáit, Roinn na Gaeltachta, agus i dtaobh oiread agus is féidir d'obair Roinn na Gaeltachta a aistriú go dtí Gaeltacht na Gaillimhe &mdash;is socruithe móra fadraonacha iad a mbeidh tionchar tábhachtach acu feasta ar an nGaeltacht agus ar ár dteanga agus ár gcultúr agus tá dóchas agam go gcuirfidh siad tús le ré nua athbheochana.</P>
    <P>Tuigeann an Rialtas gurb í an Ghaeltacht foinse agus tobar ár dteanga agus ár gcultúr.  Aithnímid gur i gcomhluadair inmharthana shócmhainneacha Ghaeltachta atá an deimhniú is fearr go mairfidh an teanga.  Mar atá ráite go minic agam: gan obair, gan daoine, gan Ghaeltacht, gan teanga.  Agus ar an ábhar sin tá cláir phraiticiúla réalaíocha á leagan amach agus á gcur i ngníomh againn ar mhaithe le forbairt eacnamaíoch, shóisialach agus chultúrtha sa Ghaeltacht&mdash;ina n-áirítear talmhaíocht, gairneoireacht, miontionsclaíocht, mórthionsclaíocht, iascaireacht, cuartaíocht agus lámhcheardaíocht, agus béim ar leith againn ar fhorbairt acmhainní nádúrtha <Col N="699" /> na Gaeltachta, ar bhunú ionad pobail agus ar spreagadh pobal-fhorbartha trí sheimineáir etc.  Tá bun maith láidir leagtha anois faoi na cláir fhorbartha sin agus beidh d'fheidhm agus de chúram ar Údarás na Gaeltachta na pleananna sin a chomhdhlúthú agus iad a thabhairt chun críche i gcomhar agus i gcomhairle iomlán le pobal na Gaeltachta a mbeidh guth láidir acu san Údarás nua.</P>
    <P>Is mian linn an Ghaeltacht a fheiceáil ina lánchuid mhórthábhachtach den náisiún iomlán agus a tionchar ag leathnú amach thar a teorainneacha féin ar fud an náisiúin go léir. Na taispeántais ar samplaí díobh &ldquo;An Ghaeltacht Bheo&rdquo; i mBaile Átha Cliath agus léiriúcháin eile i Luimneach, Trá Lí agus áiteanna eile mar aon le léiriú scannán Gaeltachta, is bealaí simplí praiticiúla iad chun an Ghaeltacht a chur in aithne do mhuintir na hÉireann.  Tá ar intinn againn leanúint den bheartas sin sna blianta atá romhainn.  Beidh sé mar mhóraidhm ag beartais an Rialtais spreagadh praiticiúil a thabhairt chun go bhféadfaidh an oiread daoine óga agus is féidir tréimhse a chaitheamh sa Ghaeltacht le linn saoire an tsamhraidh ar ghearrchúrsaí Gaeilge agus téarma i rith na scoilbhliana ar chúrsaí níos faide.  Is mian linn freisin go dtabharfadh muintir na hÉireann cuairteanna ar an nGaeltacht agus go gcaithfidis laethanta saoire ann.  Tá riachtanas leis an dlúth-theagmháil sin idir daoine laistigh agus lasmuigh den Ghaeltacht chun go mbeadh rath feasta ar ár dteanga agus ar ár gcultúr ar fud na tíre ar fad.</P>
    <P>Beidh de fhreagracht agus de dhúshlán ar Bhord na Gaeilge an teanga a chur chun cinn ar fud na tíre. Bhí ceist athbheochan na Gaeilge ina hábhar fairsing do chur agus cúiteamh i gcaitheamh na mblianta.  Ón mórchuid taistil atá déanta agam ar fud na tíre agus ón bhfreastal atá déanta agam ar mhórán imeachtaí laistigh agus lasmuigh den Ghaeltacht táim sásta gur tháinig den socrú Rialtais i dtaobh éigeantas a bhaint as an nGaeilge i scrúduithe go bhfuil rabharta nua dúthrachta agus bá bhreise ag an bpobal i bhfábhar na <Col N="700" /> Gaeilge le haithint anois.  Tá a dheimhniú sin sa mhéadú mór atá i líon na ndaoine óga a dhéanann freastal ar na cúrsaí samhraidh Gaeltachta, sa bhreis daoine atá ag caitheamh a gcuid laethanta saoire sa Ghaeltacht, sna sluaite a dhéanann freastal ar na taispeántais éagsúla Ghaeltachta ar fud na tíre, sa mhéadú spéise atá ag coistí féilte ar fud na tíre tuilleadh imeachtaí teanga agus cultúir a bheith acu ina bhféilte bliantúla agus sa líon iontach daoine a dhéanann freastal ar na himeachtaí Gaelacha sin.  Tá sé á léiriú freisin sa tslí ina bhfuil níos mó daoine ag lorg ranganna geimhridh sa Ghaeilge agus ag freastal ar na ranganna sin ina lán áiteanna.  Tá sé le feiceáil arís sa bhreis suime atá á cur ag an bpobal i gcomórtais Ghlór na nGael agus i gcomórtais eile ar nós Slógadh, díospóireachtaí scoile, agus ar aoile.</P>
    <P>Níl aon amhras in aon chor ná go bhfuil mórchuid dea-mhéine don teanga go fairsing ar fud na tíre. Caithfear an dea-mhéin sin a mhéadú ón spéis neamhghníomhach go dtí an beart éifeachtach i labhairt na teanga. Is gnó é sin do Bhord na Gaeilge agus do na heagrais dheonacha Ghaeilge.  Níl aon amhras orm ná go dtiocfaidh linn&mdash;as tuairimí agus tuiscint nua, as na beartais réalaíocha agus as méid na gcomhiarrachtaí uile &mdash;an dúshlán sin a fhreagairt agus a shárú.  Anois nuair atá an t-éigeantas i leataobh is é aidhm an Rialtais spéis sa Ghaeilge agus grá di a chothú. Ní bheidh aon áit sa Ghaeilge feasta don mhioscais ná don searús.</P>
    <P>Ó ceapadh mé mar Aire na Gaeltachta táim tar éis mórán mílte a thaisteal agus casadh ar mhórchuid daoine sa Ghaeltacht agur ar fud na tíre.  Ba mhaith liom glacadh leis an deis seo chun buíochas a ghabháil leis na daoine ina mílte a roinn a gcineáltas liom go pearsanta, leis na heagrais líonmhara ar fud na tíre a chuir comaoin aíochta orm, leis na comhaltaí de gach páirtí i nDáil Éireann a thug cúnamh agus misneach dom agus leis an lucht nuachta a scaip go fial agus go fairsing scéala faoin nGaeltacht agus faoi imeachtaí Gaelacha le bliain go leith anuas. Agus mé ag gabháil buíochais le <Col N="701" /> Teachtaí ó gach páirtí ba mhaith liom a iarraidh orthu leanúint de sprid sin na dea-thola i ngnó ar chóir dó dul thar choimhlint pháirtithe polaitíochta agus aicmí creidimh, is é sin, caomhnú ár dteanga agus ár gcultúir agus ár n-ionannais dhílis náisiúnta sna blianta atá romhainn.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesCTunney" hpid="Mr. Tunney Mr. Tunney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tunney</NameTxt>
      <P>A Cheann Comhairle, ar an gcéad dul síos ba mhaith liom mo bhuíochas a ghabháil leis an Aire. Oíche aréir, cé go raibh sé saghas déanach, chuir sé chugam cóip den óráid atá tugtha aige anois.  Is maith liom go ndearna sé é.  Tá mé buíoch de. B'fhéidir go mb'fhiú focal nó dhó a rá faoin cheist ghinearálta a bhaineas le meas an Fhreasúra, mar a tugtar air.  Tá mise anseo agus deirtear liom gur mé an taobh eile den scéal nó an leath eile atá ann chun lámh cúnta a thabhairt d'Aire ar bith nó chun a chur ina luí air im thuairimse cén áit a bhfuil dul amú air.  Measaim go bhfuil sé seafóideach iarraidh ar dhuine ar bith é sin a dhéanamh.  Tá a fhios agam nach dtarlaíonn sé a bheith amhlaidh le linn an Comhrialtas a bheith ann.  Bhí an sceal mar an gcéanna agus Fianna Fáil i réim. Ach tá an tAire ann, bail ó Dhia air, agus suas le céad oifigeach sa Roinn agus neart eile i nGaeltarra agus áiteacha eile mar é agus iad go léir chun lámh cúnta a thabhairt dó.  Agus táthar ag súil ansin go mbeadh duine amháin, agus b'fhéidir cara nó dhó aige in ann an bunachas sin, mar a déarfá, a ionsaí.  Tá sé deacair. B'fhéidir gurb é sin an fáth go hiondúil nach mbíonn an méid a deireann an Freasúra chomh dearfa sin.  B'fhéidir gurb é sin an fá go hiondúil go mbíonn clamhsán agus cnáimseáil ar an dtaobh seo den Teach.  Más mar sin a bheidh an scéal tá súil agam go maithfidh sibh dom é.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Anois maidir leis an óráid féin caithfidh mé a rá go fírinneach go bhfuil díomá orm nach bhfuil níos mó ann.  Tá díomá orm nach bhfuil aon rud nua ann.  Ó tháinig an Rialtas seo i réim tá roinnt mhaith taistil déanta ag an Aire.  Tharla&mdash;agus is maith an rud é&mdash;gur chuaigh an Taoiseach chun na Gaeltachta.  Tá nuachtáin <Col N="702" /> agam faoi rud a fógraíodh anseo nó ansiúd.  Ní gá dhom ach ceann amháin a léamh anseo.  Mí Eanáir na bliana seo&mdash;&ldquo;Gaeltarra plans nine new projects costing £3.4 million&rdquo;.  Eanáir na bliana seo freisin&mdash;&ldquo;Gaeltacht changes hint by Cosgrave&rdquo;.  Sin mar a bhí sé sa pháipéar.  Tá an tAire an-ghníomhach. Caithfear bheith buíoch de go ndearna sé é.  Chuaigh sé timpeall i measc muintir na Gaeltachta agus daoine eile nach iad agus thug sé anchúis dóchais dóibh.  D'ardaigh sé meanma na Gaeltachta.  Tá a fhios agam féin agus mé ina measc go raibh muintir na Gaeltachta, suas go dtí, abair, lár na bliana seo, ag súil go raibh ré nua tagtha.  Ach tuigeann siad anois, agus sílim gur chruthaigh siad é le linn toghcháin áitiúil, gur thuig siad nach raibh ann ach taisteal b'fhéidir agus caint.</P>
    <P>Tá súil agam go bhfuil dul amú ormsa, ach ní fheicim san óráid seo aon rud nua.  An chuid is mó de na rudaí sin, fiú amháin na rudaí is tábhachtaí, bhí siad ann sular tharla an Comhrialtas nua seo ar chor ar bith.  An cnámharlach, agus níos mó ná sin, mar bhí roinnt mhaith feola air, bhí sé ann.  Níl a fhios agam cén fáth gur tugadh an oiread sin dóchais do mhuintir na Gaeltachta agus gan aon rud anseo lena thaispeáint go rabhamar dáiríre faoi.</P>
    <P>Pointe amháin atá tábhachtach agus a chruthaíonn céard atá á rá agam&mdash;sa Dáil i Mí Iúil chuir mé ceist ar an Aire mar gheall ar an bhfógra a rinne sé maidir le haistriú Roinn na Gaeltachta go dtí Gaillimh. D'fhreagair sé mé, go béasach agus go cúntach mar a dheineann sé i gcónaí. Dúirt sé ag colún 1307 den Tuairisc Oifigiúil don 17ú Iúil: &ldquo;Faoi mar a d'fhógair mé an mhí seo caite, is é atá beartaithe ná oiread agus is féidir d'obair na Roinne a aistriú go dtí na Forbacha i nGaeltacht na Gaillimhe. Táimid ag dul ar aghaidh leis na socruithe faoi láthair.&rdquo;  Ní fheicim in óráid an Aire inniu tagairt amháin fiú do na socruithe atá déanta.  An bhfuil siad ann?  B'fhéidir go bhfuil mé tuirseach den cheist seo go léir ó bheith ag breathnú uirthi; ach ní fhaca mé go bhfuil sé ann, go bhfuil aon dul chun cinn déanta maidir le haistriú na Roinne go dtí an Ghaeltacht. <Col N="703" /> Gabh mo leithscéal, tiocfaidh mé ar ais chuige ar ball.  Cén áit a bhfuil sé?</P>

Caithfimid a bheith cúramach nach bhfuil rud amháin á rá againn le muintir na Gaeltachta, nach bhfuilimid ag tabhairt le tuiscint dóibh go bhfuil an-obair á dhéanamh againn agus gan á dhéanamh againn ach iad a threorú isteach ar bhóithrín an díomá.  Bheadh sé i bhfad níos fearr dá bhfanfadh an tAire anseo agus gan aon taisteal a dhéanamh ná aon teagmháil a bheith aige leo mura bhfuil sé cinnte an &ldquo;setting&rdquo; nua atá taobh istigh den &ldquo;set&rdquo; nua atá i réim sásta cuidiú leis ar ball agus na focail go léir a chur i ngníomh.</P>

Chun é sin a thaispeáint tá mé anois chun tagairt a dhéanamh don mhéid a dúradh san dTuairisc Oifigiúil ar an gCéadaoin an 27ú lá de Mhí na Márta, colún 956. Labhair an tAire atá in aice leis.  Bhí an tAire Poist agus Telegrafa ag cur síos ar an bpolasaí a bhí ag an Rialtas seo maidir leis an nGaeilge.  B'shin é ábhar na díospóireachta.  Is é a dúirt sé i mBéarla:</P>
      <P>I believe these realistic policies are based on (1) intelligent and active commitment to the development of the Gaeltacht and the preservation of its heritage and, (2) basing the Irish language policy on a concept of the role of Irish in the kind of society we actually live in and are likely to live in.</P>

      <P>Anois, mar a thagair mé ansin, sin é polasaí an Rialtais, de réir mar a thuigimse é.  D'inis an tAire Poist agus Telegrafa an fhírinne faoin bpolasaí sin.  Polasaí é a bhaineas leis an nGaeltacht, é a choinneáil mar atá sé, nó feabhas a chur ar shlí mhaireachtála, caighdeán maireachtála mhuintir na Gaeltachta.  Rud anmhaith é sin, ar ndóighe.  Taispeánann sé go soiléir polasaí an Rialtais.  Ach ní hé sin an polasaí atá Aire na Gaeltachta ag iarraidh a nochtadh.  Dúirt an tAire Poist agus Telegrafa nach raibh aon difríocht idir é féin agus Aire na Gaeltachta, go rabhadar beirt ar aon aigne maidir leis an bpolasaí. Tá mé ag iarraidh ar Aire na Gaeltachta a rá an bhfuil sé féin sásta leis an bpolasaí sin, polasaí a chuirfeadh teorainn le ceantracha Gaeltachta, agus polasaí a bheas oiriúnach &ldquo;to the kind of society we actually live in and are likely to live in&rdquo;.  An é sin an fáth go raibh an tAire féin thar a bheith cúramach gan focal a rá in áit ar bith gurb é polasaí an Rialtais seo an Ghaeilge a athbheochan?  Níl sé ansin.</P>
      <P>Chuir mé ceist ar an Taoiseach an tseachtain seo caite an raibh aon dualgaisí nua curtha ar Aire ar bith.  Dúirt sé go raibh cúramaí nua ar Aire na Gaeltachta.  I mBéarla atá sé: &ldquo;for the implementation of the Government's general policy of popularising the use of the Irish language throughout the country.&rdquo;  An ionann é sin agus a rá&mdash; áit ar bith ina bhfuil an Ghaeilge go mbeidh siad sásta lámh cúnta a thabhairt do na daoine sin ach nach bhfuil sé i gceist acu aon leathnú a dhéanamh air?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Measaim go bhfuil an tagairt seo an-tábhachtach, mar tá sé bunúsach ar fad do cheist na Gaeltachta.  Maith dhom é má chaithim an oiread sin <Col N="706" /> ama leis.  Tiocfaidh mé chuig pointí eile níos déanaí.</P>
    <P>Creidim go bhfuil sé amaideach bheith ag iarraidh cur ina luí ar éinne go bhfuil tú amach is amach i ndáiríre maidir leis an Ghaeltacht mura n-aithníonn tú é mar thobar na gluaiseachta a bhí ann, atá ann agus a bheas ann go dtí go mbeidh an Ghaeilge mar mheán cumarsáide ginearálta agus nach é an t-aon mheán amháin a bheas ann ach ar a laghad go mbeidh sé sin ag muintir na hÉireann.  Mura bhfuil an aidhm nó an t-idéal sin againn ní fhéadfaimid an tábhacht a thabhairt don Ghaeltacht atá tuillte aici.</P>
    <P>Ní aithním anseo go bhfuil glactha leis sin fós ag an Rialtas seo.  Tá siad sásta screamh áirithe a chur ar na himeachtaí. Tuigeann siad gur ar mhaithe leo féin nach ceart go gcuirfeadh siad i n-aghaidh na Gaeilge, ach nuair a smaoiníonn tú air, cheana féin tá roinnt mhaith acu atá an-amhrasach faoi ghnéithe eile a bhaineann le h-oidhreacht agus traidisiún na tíre seo.  Seo an eagla atá ormsa.  Má éiríonn leo sa mhéid sin, go bhfuil duine, beirt, triúr nó ceathrar b'fhéidir agus go mbeidh an-áthas orthu leathnú a dhéanamh ar an bpolasaí sin atá leagtha amach ag an Aire Poist agus Telegrafa, leagtha amach go fírinneach agus go beacht aige: gurb é polasaí an Rialtais seo an Ghaeilge a choinneáil sa Ghaeltacht, slí bheatha níos fearr a thabhairt do mhuintir na Gaeltachta agus, mar a deireann siad ansin, bheith sásta glacadh le héinne eile in aon chuid eile den tír a dteastaíonn uaidh nó uaithi an Ghaeilge a labhairt, nach gcuirfidís isteach air nó uirthi.  Sin mar atá ráite acu.</P>
    <P>It might be appropriate not to continue in Irish lest anyone would charge me with making a special point of the fact that English has been spoken in matters referring to the Gaeltacht.  It is highly desirable that that should be the position and that we should indicate to the people of Ireland, initially at least, whether they are in Dalymount or Croke Park, whether they are Catholic, Protestant or Presbyterian, whether they are poor or wealthy, that our first concern should be that they would accept the Irish language as the best <Col N="707" /> sign available of our identity and a continuing interest and example by all of how the interest which they have in the Irish language has perhaps made them slightly more tolerant, slightly more considerate than those who have not got it.  That would be a worthwhile exercise in the case of those of us who claim to have an interest in the language.</P>
    <P>Many miles have been travelled by the Minister and he has got great publicity.  Personally, I am very happy that such publicity has attended his efforts; he has at least succeeded in focussing attention on the Gaeltacht but simultaneously he succeeded, at least up to some months ago, perhaps, in raising the hopes of the people of the Gaeltacht to a point never reached before and unless he is able and prepared to stand and deliver now he will have done an injustice to those people rather than rendered them any assistance.</P>
    <P>I now refer to a point which I think needs careful examination.  It is in respect of the proposal of the Minister to extend the Gaeltacht, to give certain areas adjoining the Gaeltacht, or not necessarily adjoining the Gaeltacht, Gaeltacht status.  Ultimately, we all look forward to the day when all 32 counties will be a Gaeltacht in that the vast majority of the people will be able and anxious to express themselves in the Irish language.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesCTunney" hpid="Mr. Tunney Mr. Tunney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tunney</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not visualise it happening in my lifetime or in 100 years time, perhaps, but that does not prevent our having the expectation. This is a point on which I think the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs and I would disagree.  I think the Minister is attracted to ideas that are likely to have immediate implementation and that he does not treat of other matters which can only be cautious and careful not to advance ideas that at the moment are, perhaps, politically expedient and at the same time cast aside or attempt to relegate to nothingness ideals that can be realised in <Col N="708" /> the long-term.  To talk and think about ideals having immediate implementation is not to understand correctly their function.  I have said before that ideals refer to things which, perhaps, we can see through the mist; they are not necessarily for immediate implementation.  It would be very easy to destroy the case being made by anybody for this long-term aim, objective or ideal by indicating that it was not capable of immediate implementation.  But I do not think that is fair.</P>
      <P>The history of Ireland refers to an ideal and to the striving after an ideal both in language and politics.  We could take consolation from the fact that our neighbours who did not share our ideals but were more attracted to the philosophy of immediately satisfying instincts and who, in pursuit of that policy, travelled the whole world subjecting other races, have not been vindicated.  History, as I see it, shows that in the long-term their policy was much inferior to ours and it would seem that we shall be victors while they will fail.  They had this great empire that was opposed to any expression of ideals or identity by other people and to their desire to look after their own affairs.  The great empire which opposed and destroyed that ideal and which, I suppose, was at one time the most powerful empire in the world, is now reduced to the point where within its own land mass people are claiming to be&mdash;if I might use that description&mdash;an ethnic group or at least people who can claim to have a special tradition and are now anxious to express themselves alone outside the conglomerate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not intend to pursue the point. I am suggesting to the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs that perhaps with his outlook which deals in the satisfaction we get from the ephemeral&mdash;as we all do&mdash;you must blend the desire for the satisfaction you get from pursuing an ideal notwithstanding that it can only be achieved in the long-term.  If there is anything the people of the world need today more than anything else it is the replacement of the materialism and self-interest which have ruled for decades <Col N="709" /> and, perhaps, for the last half-century, by a worthwhile ideal.</P>
    <P>Turning to more practical and mundane but equally important matters in regard to this Estimate, the Minister referred to the work being done by Gaeltarra Éireann.  If the Chair will permit me to digress for a moment to complete the point I hope to make in respect of what is before us now, this is the first offering we have had from Roinn na Gaeltachta in respect of their duties and responsibility. We did have a discussion some time ago on matters connected with the Department but again that arose from promptings on our part.  This is their first voluntary offering to this House and I think that is not good policy when one recalls all the announcements that have been made outside the House.  I am glad the Parliamentary Secretary is not here to remind me that this was the fashion when Fianna Fáil were in office.  I am not concerned with the fashion when anybody was in office; I can only speak on my own behalf.  As far as I am concerned it is regrettable this House has been neglected so much by Roinn na Gaeltachta.  Furthermore, let me say how disappointed I am that this House has been neglected so much by Gaeltarra Éireann.  In May of this year the Minister brought before the House what was described as a small Bill asking us to give power to Gaeltarra Éireann to exceed the £6 million limit and allow them to move to £10 million.  The House agreed to that request, but at the time I expressed reservations, especially as we had been promised An tÚdarás, which we understood would take over from Gaeltarra.  Four million pounds is a considerable amount, and there was an obligation on the House to be concerned as to how Gaeltarra were spending this extra sum.  I put the question to the Minister, but apart from an expression of hope and a general idea as to how the money might be spent, I got very little information about it.</P>
    <P>Here we are now discussing the Estimate for Roinn na Gaeltachta, and Gaeltarra Éireann have not yet, as is required of them under the 1967 <Col N="710" /> Act, placed before this House the report for 1973.  We have here the last report&mdash;and I must thank the Minister for supplying this during the year &mdash;for 1972.  This is a very serious matter, especially considering that when we remove Roinn na Gaeltachta from what is being discussed here, we see that the responsibilities of Roinn na Gaeltachta refer nearly more to those people who speak Irish outside the Gaeltacht than inside; I do not like to call them smaller schemes, but the vast amount of money is spent by Gaeltarra Éireann.  The 1957 Act stipulates that:</P>
    <P>The Board shall in each year at such date as the Minister may direct make a report to the Minister of its proceedings under this Act during the preceding year, and the Minister shall cause copies of the Report to be laid before each House of the Oireachtas.</P>
    <P>It is over a year since we got this report. It came to us in July, 1973.  Why has the Minister not seen to it that the other yearly report was placed before this House?  Maybe I am culpable to some extent in that it was only yesterday afternoon when I was trying to collect my thoughts on this Estimate that I contacted the Department to discover the reports were not there.  However, there is a greater obligation on the Minister, who has such an efficient secretariat, to ensure that the requirements of the Acts are complied with, than on the spokesman for the Opposition.</P>
    <P>As to the 1972 report, I believe reports should be presented in such a way that any citizen could discover the extent to which he has contributed to the moneys of any company and how those moneys have been spent.  I am concerned that the interest the people have in the Gaeltacht and the preparedness which they have always expressed to make money available for economic, social and linguistic development of the Gaeltacht, should not be abused by us.  I am hoping that we shall continue to present to them our statements as to how their money is being spent.  The report should show clearly what the amounts to date are and how they have been spent.  We <Col N="711" /> refer here to many companies.  It is very difficult for me&mdash;again a non-accounting type, I admit&mdash;to get the picture I would like to get as to what is the position of Gaeltarra Éireann <i>vis-á-vis</i> all these companies, what the position is regarding Gaeltarra, who represent the people in the matter of moneys which have been invested, ostensibly in the Gaeltacht but which now have found their way into the hands of what are private companies.</P>
    <P>I do not think I am being unfair to the Minister when I alert him to the need for that statement being presented in accordance with the Act under which Gaeltarra Éireann were established. The presentation of these accounts at the appropriate time would certainly encourage the rest of the community to extend the generosity they have shown in making money available to the Gaeltacht.  I do not intend dwelling on that any longer except, perhaps, to say how displeased I was to discover that in some of these operations&mdash;and I am not merely talking about the depressed times in which we live&mdash;there has been a certain feeling in parts of the Gaeltacht that people are being recorded nominally as being employed in certain industries in the Gaeltacht; they are reporting in and doing their five, six, seven or eight hours a day, but that the productivity of that company is not satisfactory.  In certain parts of the Gaeltacht, even now, the report I get is that&mdash;I will not say that money is being wasted&mdash;money which has been directed into certain areas could be more gainfully employed elsewhere. I am talking about the position which occurred in CP Plastics in Carraroe where is was known locally that there were 30 people on the payroll and that they were not working.</P>
    <P>Need I go any further?  I am talking about a situation which was known locally, where some of these people were in an adjoining factory doing non-productive work.  Are these the figures I am getting when I am told so many people are gainfully employed? I want, and I should have, in respect of all these industries information about the amount of money invested and the number of people employed.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="712" /> I realise that certain efforts will fail and I am prepared to accept that.  If they fail we must accept that they have failed, discover why they failed and perhaps move to a new and better area. I do not think there is any point in our trying to live a lie.  I will not be critical of any venture.  I might express certain doubts, for instance, in respect of the computer in Furbo; I can have doubts about the real cost, the real value for £750,000: I can wonder whether the money could be better expended on improving roads or other such work; I wonder about the opportunity costs if it had not been spent in that way: it might have been spent on developing some small pier.  However, it has been spent and indications are that it is hoped it will give employment to second and third level muintir na Gaeltachta.</P>
    <P>Más mar sin atá sé, táim sásta leis. Ar an dtaobh eile, más rud é nach bhfuil ach triúr nó ceathrar daoine fostaithe ann agus ag fáil tuarastal mór gach seachtain, tá amhras orm.  Tá mé sásta rud ar bith a thriail.  Glacaim go mbíonn dua agus teip ann ach má bhíonn teip ann teastaíonn uaim go mbeadh daoine sásta a rá liom gur mar sin atá sé.</P>
    <P>Ní féidir liomsa labhairt ar son gach éinne atá anseo ach comh fada is a bhaineann sé liom féin, ní dhéanfaidh mise casaoid ar bith. Déanfaidh mé tagairt d'áit ar bith ina mbeidh teip agus déanfaidh mé iarracht a thaispeáint go mb'fhéidir gurb amhlaidh a b'fhearr an t-airgead sin a chaitheamh i mbealach éigin eile, ach ní dhéanfaidh mé aon chasaoid ná cáineadh.  Ach déanfaidh mé an-chasaoid agus an-cháineadh agus an-chleamhsán má fheictear dom go bhfuilimid ag iarraidh teip a thaispeáint mar rud gur éirigh leis, nó mar bhua.  Ní gá dom níos mó a rá faoi sin.</P>
    <P>Maidir leis an Ghaeltacht féin, bhí mé ar tí ráiteas a dhéanamh faoi leathnú na Gaeltachta&mdash;leathnú limistéar na Gaeltachta.  Ní fíor a rá gur Gaeltacht nua an chuid seo nó siúd den tír mura bhfuilimid in ann a thaispeáint go bhfuil an chuid sin den tír cosúil le háit ar bith eile san fhíor-Ghaeltacht. Tá súil agam go nglacfaidh an tAire an míniú sin uaim.  Más í an Ghaeltacht í, sí an Ghaeltacht í.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="713" /> Tuigimse go bhfuil áiteanna eile ann a bhfuil roinnt Gaeilge á labhairt iontu.  B'fhéidir go bhfuil na háiteanna sin cóngarach don Ghaeltacht.  Tá áiteanna eile nach bhfuil cóngarach do Ghaeltacht ar bith agus Gaeilge iontu agus atá ag iarraidh aitheantas a fháil mar Ghaeltacht.</P>
    <P>Maidir leis an gcéad cheann, measaim féin nach ceart aitheantas Gaeltachta a thabhairt d'áit ar bith ar imeall na Gaeltachta mura bhfuilimid sásta gur Gaeltachtaí iad&mdash;go gcaithfidh siad cruthú dúinn go leanann siad traidisiún Gaeltachta.  Tá sé sin thar a bheith tábhachtach.  Ba cheart dúinn socrú a dhéanamh go gcuirfeadh muid muintir na háite sin ar triail. B'fhéidir go mbeadh muid sásta leathaitheantas a thabhairt do limistéar mar sin, nó b'fhéidir ceathrú cuid d'aitheantas, agus b'fhéidir go dtabharfadh muid 10, 15 no 20 bliain do na daoine i limistéar mar sin agus a rá leo: &ldquo;Má chruthaíonn sibh go bhfuil sibh chomh maith le áit ar bith eile, tabharfaidh muid an t-aitheantas daoibh, an t-aitheantas atá tuillte agaibh&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>Mura ndéantar mar sin é, tuigfidh an tAire gur saghas magaidh a bheas ann&mdash;go mbeidh daoine ag rá: &ldquo;Sin Gaeltacht agus níl aon Ghaeilge ann. Faigheann siad sin deontaisí, faigheann siad seo agus siúd, tá siad in ainm a bheith sa Ghaeltacht ach tá a fhios ag Dia agus ag an diabhal nach bhfuil Gaeilge ar bith acu.&rdquo;  Caitheann sé sin drochmheas ar mhuintir na Gaeltachta agus chomh cinnte agus atá muid sa Teach tá muid ar an mbealach ceart chun an Ghaeltacht a bhriseadh ar fad.</P>
    <P>Bíonn áthas orm i gcónaí nuair a chloisim faoi dhaoine ag iarraidh dul isteach sa Ghaeltacht, ach teastaíonn uaim a bheith cinnte cén fáth.  Má tá daoine as limistéir ar bith ag iarraidh dul isteach, mar a tharla ins na blianta atá thart de bhrí go bhfuair siad an deontas seo nó an deontas siúd, measaim nach ceart go ligfí isteach iad.  Is é mo thuairimse, agus molaim don Aire agus don Roinn é, go mba cheart dúinn a bheith cúramach nach ndéanaimis magadh faoin Ghaeltacht.</P>

      <P>Agus seans go mbeadh áiteanna eile.  Sé an pointe atá á dhéanamh agam go mb'fhearr liom go bhfaigheadh siad seans iad féin a chruthú.</P>
      <P>Luaigh mé níos luaithe sa mbliain faoi thaisteal a dhéanamh sa Ghaeltacht. Dúirt mé nuair a tháinig mé abhaile go raibh díomá orm faoin méid Béarla a chuala mé ó na scoláirí.  Seo í an fhírinne ghlan, agus éinne eile a bhí sa Ghaeltacht i rith na bliana caithfidh sé admháil go bhfuil an ceart agam.  Deirim seo agus aithne mhaith agam ar na daoine a reachtáileann cúrsaí na Gaeltachta.  Caithfidh mé an fhírinne a inseacht agus fios agam nach mbeidh na daoine seo thar a bheith cairdiúil liom nuair a chasann siad orm amach anseo.  Ar an dtaobh eile, tá a fhios agam go gcuireann daoine a bhfuil suim acu sa Ghaeilge agus ins na Gaeltachtaí fáilte roimh an fhírinne. Mar a deir mé, i mBéal Átha an Ghaorthaidh tráthnóna amháin agus mé ann, tháinig ar a laghad 80 gasúr agus an t-amhrán &ldquo;A long way to Tipperary&rdquo; á ghabháil acu.  Ba chuma liom faoin teanga mar ní thuigeann gasúir mar sin mórán faoin amhrán sin, ní thuigeann siad an bhaint atá aige leis na saighdiúirí a ndearna an Rúnaí Parlaiminte trácht orthu&mdash;saighdiúirí Sasanacha sa chás seo.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Ach gan trácht air sin, Béarla ar fad a bhí ar siúl ag na daoine sin.  Is cuma céard déarfas an tAire Oideachais nó an Taoiseach nó aon duine eile faoin nGaeilge a dhéanamh suimiúil agus na daoine a mhealladh isteach.  Roimhe seo bhí dhá rud ann: Thuig na gasúir agus thuig a dtuismitheoirí go raibh orthu staidéar a dhéanamh ar an nGaeilge mar ábhar, go raibh sé éigeantach.  Mar sin chuireadar na daoine óga chun na Gaeltachta ag iarraidh an Ghaeilge a fhoghlaim.  Níl mé ag iarraidh a rá gur mhotivation ceart é sin nó narbh ea, ach sin mar a bhí.  Chuireadar na daoine sin chun na Gaeltachta ag iarraidh an Ghaeilge a fhoghlaim. Chomh maith le sin, bhí daoine eile ann agus thuigeadar go raibh rud éigin, rud faoi leith, ag baint leis an <Col N="715" /> nGaeilge.  Chuadar féin go dtí na Gaeltachtaí.  Bhí dúthracht éigin iontu. Mhothaigh siad go raibh sé dlite díobh an Ghaeilge a fhoghlaim.  Bhí daoine den dhá shaghais sin ann.</P>
    <P>Deirtear linn nach bhfuil an Ghaeilge éigeantach tábhachtach maidir le scrúdúcháin.  Chun a bheith loighiciúil caithfear a ghlacadh nach dtéann an dream a deir sin chun na Gaeltachta.  Tá a fhíos agam go bhfuil sé ann mar ábhar, ach tá cúiseanna eile agamsa a thaispéanann nach é sin a mheallann níos mó daoine chun na Gaeltachta.  Na daoine eile a cheap gur chuid den traidisiún agus oidhreacht ársa na tíre seo an Ghaeilge, tá siad ag éisteacht le Airí á rá nach mar sin atá.  Seans nach mbeidh an cíocras céanna ar an dream sin ach oiread.</P>
    <P>Ag an am céanna tá líon na gcuairteoirí ag fás.  Tá mé ag teacht ar ais anois go dtí an pointe a rinne an tAire Poist agus Telegrafa; Aithníonn daoine rud maith nó margadh nuair a fheiceann siad é.  Tuigeann na tuismitheoirí gur féidir leo na gasúir a chur ansin agus go mbeidh scíth dheas acu i measc comhluadar deas, go mbeidh daoine ansin chun aire a thabhairt dóibh agus go bhfuil sé i bhfad níos saoire ná Butlins.  Sin mar atá.  Chomh cinnte is atá mise anseo, má leantar leis na scéimeanna seo agus má mhéadaíonn bliain ar bhliain ar líon na ngasúr a thriallfaidh go dtí an Ghaeltacht, ní bheidh Gaeltacht ann.</P>
    <P>Feicim féin é sin ó thosaigh mé ag dul chun na Ghaeltachta agus feiceann muintir na Gaeltachta é.  Fiú amháin iad sin atá ar na coisti seo i rith na cúrsaí seo.  Tuigfeadh duine ar bith é.  Má tá bean a' tí ansin agus í ag iarraidh aire a thabhairt do dhosaen nó scór gasúr, cén chaoi gur féidir léi bheith ag labhairt Gaeilge leis na gasúir sin?  Chuala mé in áit nó dhó é.  Chuala mé é seo i gCiarraí.  Dúirt duine ansin liom gur chuala sé faoi bhean tí amháin: chuir sí a gasúirí féin isteach go Trá Lí nó áit éigin, ina labhartar Béarla is dócha, ionnas go mbeidh áit aici cuairteoirí a ghlacadh.</P>
    <P>Molaim don Aire, mar a rinne mé anuraidh, ní haon mhaith na ghasúir seo bheith ag dul chun na Gaeltachta <Col N="716" /> mura mbeidh teagmháil acu le muintir na Gaeltachta.  Mura bhfuil ann ach iad bheith ag dul ann le bheith ag freastal ar chúrsaí i gcoláiste, ag dul abhaile ag labhairt Béarla i gcónaí leo féin gan caidreamh a bheith acu le muintir na tíre sa Ghaeltacht b'fhearr na cúrsaí sin a bheith ar siúl sa Churrach nó in áit ar bith eile. Bheadh sé i bhfad níos fearr, mar ní bheadh an dochar á dhéanamh don Ghaeltacht.</P>
    <P>Theastaigh uaim nach mbeadh ag dul chun na Gaeltachta ach daoine atá díograsach don Ghaeilge.  Tá a fhios agam féin agus ag daoine eile cad a tharlóidh.  Usáidfear droch-Ghaeilge agus beidh orthu, b'fhéidir, Béarla a úsáid.  Nuair a bhíomar féin ann níor theastaigh uainn riamh Gaeilge a labhairt le muintir na háite sa teach, sna siopaí ná in áit ar bith eile.  Níor usáideamar Béarla, áfach, ach i gcásanna an-éigeantach.</P>
    <P>Molaim don Aire gan glacadh le moltaí a thaispeáinfeadh go raibh an ceart ag duine éigin eile a chuir deireadh leis an nGaeilge éigeantach sna scoileanna.  Sin rud a d'fhéadfadh muid a phlé uair éigin eile.  Níl mise a rá go raibh sé mícheart deireadh a chur leis.  Is é atá á rá agam ná nach gcruthaíonn na figiúirí anseo go bhfuil suim níos mó tagtha chuig muintir na hÉireann maidir leis an Ghaeilge &mdash;a mhalairt ar fad a chruthaíonn siad.</P>
    <P>Seo pointe beag maidir leis na scála.  Once-and-a-half times the appropriate allowance I would give to the bean a' tí and to the householder prepared to take only two students as against the amount I would give to the lady who is anxious to take ten or twenty students.  I am not critical of the lady who wants to treat the thing as an economic proposition.  If the attraction is there it is difficult for her to allow it to pass her by, but what I am concerned about is the fact that the scheme is so attractive as to invite to the Gaeltacht people who have absolutely no interest in the Irish language.</P>

On the contrary it encourages me to suspect that he is not as vitally interested in the Gaeltacht as I thought he was.  The Minister has traversed the Gaeltacht.  He has spoken to people and he has listened to people and, if he is not prepared to accept that the increased number of students visiting the Gaeltacht is in certain areas doing damage to the Gaeltacht itself, he has not been speaking to the people who are really interested in the Gaeltacht.  He may have been speaking to those who are administering these courses.  I can understand their reluctance to accept that any injury is being done, but I would suggest that if he wants to discover whether or not some of what I say is correct&mdash;we all at times exaggerate slightly&mdash;if he wants to discover whether the point I am making is worthwhile, I suggest that he should make inquiries generally in the Gaeltacht areas in which I have been, and the reaction he will get is that the Gaeltacht cannot accommodate the numbers and simultaneously retain its identity.</P>

      <P>Seo an <i>Connaught Tribune.</i> Dé hAoine, 15 Márta.  An Ghaeltacht agus an suim atá againnne i muintir na Gaeltachta.  Nuair a bhí muide i réim sílim go raibh sé mar pholasaí againn gur i nGaeilge a dhéanfaí gach a ndéanfaimis féin nó a dhéanfadh an Stát sa Ghaeltacht.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Seo ceann de na dáinséiri a fheiceann sé atá ann maidir leis an nGaeilge, maidir leis an nGaeltacht agus maidir leis an náisiún seo.  Bhí cúis cúirte sa Spidéal agus ós comhair na cúirte bhí duine de mhuintir na háite agus thuig an Roinn Dlí agus Cirt agus na breíthimh sna Gaeltachtaí go mba cheart gach ar féidir leo a dhéanamh trí Ghaeilge.  Sílim nuair á bheadh duine de mhuintir na háite ós comhair na cúirte gur i nGaeilge a thabharfadh na gardaí fianaise.  Tharla sa chás seo a bhí ós comhair na cúirte&mdash;ní luafaidh mé ainm an bhreithimh ar eagla go gceapadh aon duine go raibh rud mícheart á dhéanamh aige &mdash;an breitheamh seo, cosúil le <Col N="719" /> breitheamh ar bith eile: &ldquo;The justice asking defendants if they could speak and understand Irish on being told that they did not have any Irish ordered garda witnesses to give their evidence in English.&rdquo;  Mura miste leath léighfidh mé sin arís.  Tá a fhios agam gur athrá atá ann ach an breitheamh seo a bhí ós comhair na cúirte sa Spidéal duine a dúirt nár thuig sé an Gaeilge agus mar sin dúirt an breitheamh go gcaithfeadh an garda sa Ghaeltacht a chuid fianaise a thabairt i mBéarla. Athrú a bhí ansin.  Is dóigh gurb é seo polasaí an Rialtais nua.

        <i>The Connaught Tribune</i> of 15th March na bliana seo. Cad tá i gceist agam?  Bhí nós ann go mbeadh obair na cúirte i nGaeilge. Tháinig fear ós comhair na cúirte. Dúirt sé nar thuig sé an Ghaeilge. D'ordaigh an breitheamh ansin go mbeadh an rud i mBéarla agus dúirt: &ldquo;It is an elementary principle of justice that a defendant should understand everything that is going on.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>If that is an elementary principle of justice, what happens in the case of the people of the Gaeltacht who do not understand English?  Has the Minister seen this reference?  Has he drawn the attention of the Department of Justice to this statement made by the learned judge that it is a fundamental principle of justice that the defendant, meaning the plaintiff, I am sure, should understand everything that is going on?  Here we are with a Government who are indicating their concern for the Gaeltacht and the people of the Gaeltacht, their concern for rights of all kinds, and they are moving away from a situation which obliged the judge to hear the evidence of the gardaí in Gaeltacht areas in the Irish language.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have not seen any note or any statement from the Government Information Service, which is so prolific <Col N="720" /> in issuing statements, that Aire na Gaeltachta, Aire Poist agus Telegrafa, an tAire Garret FitzGerald are concerned at the fact that they live in a time when many people are being denied a fundamental principle because of the fact that they are not prepared in those areas to have the business of the courts carried out in the language which those people understand.  To me that is a much more important and much more fundamental point than giving the number of bathrooms or toilets which were provided in the Gaeltacht.  I appreciate that they are significant, too.</P>
    <P>I hope that at some future date when the Minister is at a Cabinet meeting he will express his concern for the situation existing in the Gaeltacht, the area for which he is responsible. He could indicate his real concern by insisting that in future no judges, no gardaí, would be appointed to any Gaeltacht area who were not able and prepared to discharge their duties in the language which the people of the area best understand.</P>

      <P>An rud deireanach anois&mdash;An tÚdarás.  Arís tá díomá orm nach bhfuil aon chéim nua anseo maidir leis an Údarás.  Tá sé geallta. Tá an oiread sin páipéir agamsa faoi na geallúintí atá tugtha anseo.  Dúirt an tAire liomsa an bhliain seo caite <Col N="721" /> go raibh sé tar éis é seo a dhéanamh tar éis sos na Nollag seo caite.  Is fada ón Nollaig seo caite go dtí anois agus níl aon rud nua anseo maidir leis an Údarás.  Is maith liomsa go mbeidh a leithéid ann ach tá súil agam go mbeidh obair fhónta á déanamh agus tá súil agam go dtabharfaidh sé aitheantas do mhuintir na Gaeltachta. De réir mar a thuigim, tá sé ainmneacha ag an Aire agus triúir ag Muintir na Gaeltachta, representations of three from what has been described as provincial boards.  The Minister is aware that in 1971 it was arranged that in Gaeltacht areas there would be boards elected democratically by the people of the Gaeltacht and it was hoped that these boards would have representation on An tÚdarás.  It is now suggested that the representation will come from parish councils and other local bodies not democratically elected.  I think that the people of the Gaeltacht, the people whose honour it is to have Deputy Coogan, Deputy Geoghegan and Deputy Molloy representing them, will understandably be disappointed.</P>

      <P>Más mar sin atá sé, tá mé sásta agus deirim go bhfuil an rud ceart á dhéanamh ag an Aire.  Níl a fhios agam cad a dhéanfaidh an Teachta bocht anois mar níor theastiagh uaidh go mbeadh vóta ar bith acu.  Is maith liom freisin go bhfuil sé ráite go mbeidh Bord na Gaeilge ann <Col N="723" /> ach sílim go nglacfaidh an tAire uaim go raibh an dá rud sin geallta a bheith réidh sul ar tháinig sé i réim. Tá sé ag gníomhú anois le breis agus bliain go leith agus measaim nach bhfuil aon fheabhas tagtha ar an scéal idir an dá linn.  Shílfeá ón méid atá anseo gur áit nua ar fad í an Ghaeltacht anois ó tháinig an Comhrialtas i réim.  Ní féidir, agus tú i láthair na ndaoine sin, an t-athrú sin a aithint ná a fheiscint in áit ar bith.  Tagaim ar ais go dtí an pointe a luaigh mé i dtosach.  Tá siad ag éirí amharasach ann.  An dá rud bunúsach d'fhéadfaí a dhéanamh, an dá chéim ar aghaidh fónta d'fhéadfaimis a dhéanamh, tá sí ansin anois le dhá bhliain agus tá sé in am anois imeacht ó na rudaí beaga agus luí isteach ar na rudaí móra.  Is fánach an áit a bhfaighfeá gliomach. Feicim anseo píosa de pháipéir.  Chím go n-aithníonn an tAire Poist agus Telegrafa é, <i>Liberty</i>, September na bliana seo.  Glacfaidh an tAire nach páipéir é go bhfuil clú air a bheith níos fábharaí dúinne ná don taobh thall.  Agus an méid sin glactha aige seans go nglacfaidh sé anois uaim mar thacaíocht ar an méid a dúirt mé maidir leis an damáiste nó an dochar a dhéanfaidh sé má leanann déagóirí dul chun na Gaeltachta, ón iomad daoine nach bhfuil suim acu sa Ghaeltacht ach teach Samhaidh a bheith acu ann, daoine nach bhfuil ach ag breathnú air mar ionad saoire. Seo é <i>Liberty,</i> September na bliana seo:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>... níl an Ghaeilge riachtanach níos mó mar ábhar, fa choinne an Árd Teist agus le dhul chuig ollscoil. Ar ndoigh ba sin go díreach an rud a bhí ag coinneal Colaistí Samhraidh an Chonartha ar a mbonnaí agus ní grádh agus dílseacht do'n Ghaeilge.  Ní raibh ins na colaistí seo ach campaí saoire de chuid an mheanaicme i gceanntracha in a mbéadh gléas ar a gcuid páistí snás a chuir ar a gcuid Gaeilge.  Chuaidh siad chun an Gaeltachta le cuid de shaibhreas an phobail a thabhairt ar shiubhal leo agus gan aon rún acu cur le cultur an phobail; ach caithfidh muid neamh-iontas a dhéanamh de sin féin ins an alt seo nó cé gur ar mhaithe leo féin a bhí <Col N="724" /> an dream seo ag labhairt na Gaeilge, b'annamh uair a labhairfeadh siad Béarla sa Ghaeltacht, gan caint ar an teanga sin a bhrú ar na daoine.</P>
    <P>Téann sé ar aghaidh agus tagann sé go hiomlán san alt sin le rud atá scríofa ag fear darb ainm Seán Ó Cearnaigh.</P>

      <P>Ní raibh tú anseo.  An té a bhíonn amuigh fuarann a chuid. Ní raibh tú anseo agus an pointe á dhéanamh agam.  Té mé arís ag léamh as an bpíosa seo:</P>
      <P>Níl a dhath fágtha chun daoine a spreagadh le dul chun na Gaeltachta a fhoghluim Gaeilge....</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Níl a dhath fágtha&rdquo; ach amháin go bhfuil saoire le fáil acu níos saoire ansin ná mar a gheobhaidís in áiteacha eile é.  Agus ar an bpointe sin tá sé ar intinn agam críochnú anois lena bhfuil le rá agam go fóillín. Beidh mé anseo ag éisteacht le chuile dhuine a labhrann ar an Meastachán seo.  Beidh áthas orm foghlaim uathu. Tá súil agam go nglacfaidh siad uaim, agus is féidir leo nó muna bhfuil siad sásta&mdash;ní orm atá an locht&mdash;go gcreidim go hiomlán san méid atá á rá agam i dtaobh na Gaeltachta.  Tá dul amú orm, b'fhéidir, mar a bhíonn ar chuile dhuine corr uair, ach tá súil agam nach mbeidh na cainteoirí eile sásta rud ar bith a rá ar son na polaitíochta dhe.  Baineann an Meastachán seo leis an rud is luachmhaire atá againn&mdash;an Ghaeltacht agus an Ghaeilge agus tá a fhios agam agus tá súil agam agus mé ag éisteacht gur tuairimí daoine atá dáiríre agus dúthrachtacht faoin gceist a gheobhaidh mé agus nach aon chaimiléireacht pholaitíochta a bheidh ann.</P>

      <P>Ba mhaith liom mo bhuíochas a ghabháil leis an Aire de bhárr an méid atá déanta aige don Ghaeltacht agus go mór mhór an méid atá déanta aige i mBaile Mhic Óda agus i gCnoch an Dúin ó ceapadh é mar Aire.  Thug sé trí chuairt ar an ndúthaigh seo cé nach bhfuilimid sa Ghaeltacht fós ach de bhárr na spéise, na taithíochta agus an misneach a thaispeáin an tAire féin sa cheantar seo ó thaobh na <Col N="725" /> Gaeilge, ó thaobh an chultúir agus an tradisiúin dhe tá borradh nua tagtha ar an bpobal uile i gcúrsaí Gaeilge i láthair na huaire.</P>
      <P>Sé mo thuairim gur cúis áthais don Aire go bhfuil níos mó ná 300 duine, idir óg agus aosta, ag freastal ar ranganna na Gaeilge faoi láthair i dtrí ionad, Baile Mhic Óda, Coilleach agus Gort Rua.  Ní hamháin sin, ach bíonn imeachtaí Gaelacha, mar atá céilithe, agus teacht le chéile go rialta, acu gach seachtain.  Má leanann an tsuim agus an dáiríreacht atá ag na daoine atá sa cheantar seo i gcursaí na Gaeilge mar atá á léiriú acu i láthair na huaire, tá geallta ag an Aire go dtabharfaidh sé aitheantas oifigiúil don dhúthaigh seo go luath, fiú amháin laistigh de 12 mhí.  Bhí áthas an domhain ar na daoine uilig sa cheantar seo agus ba mhór go léir an onóir nuair a chaith Aire na Gaeltachta deireadh seachtaine iomlán leo le déanaí.  Bhíodar thar a bheith buíoch den Aire gur thaispeáin sé an oiread sin suime agus tuiscinte dóibh agus d'iarr an-chuid daoine ormsa a mbuíochas a chur in iúl don Aire.</P>
      <P>Tá áthas pearsanta ormsa go bhfuil an gheallúint seo tugtha ag an Aire mar go raibh an Ghaeilge agus cultúr na Gaeilge go láidir sa dúthaigh sin tráth agus go bhfuil an spiorad seo le mothú, fiú amháin san lá atá inniu ann, i ngach baile agus i ngach baile fearainn san áit.  Ní gá domsa tagairt do Phádraig Piarais Condúin, Piarais Mac Gearailt agus Risteárd Ó Foghludha&mdash;Fiachra Éilgeach&mdash;a rugadh agus a mhair sa dúthaigh sin.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I mbliana, bhuaigh Eochaill trófaí Ghlór na nGael agus an chéad áit in Éirinn i gcomórtas Ghlór na nGael. Is íontach an rud é seo.  Bhronn an tAire 300 fáinní óir ar na daltaí i Eochaill freisin.  Tá moladh speisialta ag dul don Sáirsint Pádraig de híde de bharr a chuid oibre agus a chuid dúthrachta don teanga, a chabhraigh go mór chun an duais seo a thabhairt go hEochaill.  Ní hamháin sin ach tá an spiorad nua seo i mBaile Mhic Óda curtha ar aghaidh go mór mar gheall ar a shaothar.  Ní féidir béim mhór go leor a chur ar na himeachtaí seo ó thaobh na Gaeltachta dhe agus ó <Col N="726" /> thaobh Galltachtaí a mhealladh isteach sa Gaeltacht go mór mhór san aois atá againn i láthair na huaire&mdash;aois an Chómhphobail agus an Chomhargaidh &mdash;nuair atá nósanna ó thíortha iasachta go mór ag goilliúint ar ár dtírín beag féin.</P>
    <P>De bharr tionchar na Gaeilge agus de bharr na daoine ó na Gaeltachtaí ag obair ina n-áit dhúchais agus ins na monarchana atá ag dul ar aghaidh faoi Ghaeltarra Éireann agus de bharr an chaidrimh agus an ghnáthchomhrá laethúil, cabhróidh sé go mór le staid na tíre ó thaobh na Gaeilge agus ní baol go dtréigimid ár gcultúr agus ár n-oidhreacht traidisiúnta féin a tháinig chugainn faoi shár-iarrachtaí agus dúthracht ár sinsir féin.</P>
    <P>Tá áthas mór orm an deis seo a bheith agam labhairt ar Mheastachán Roinn na Gaeltachta agus go bhfuil an tAire ag cur san áireamh an staid faidréimneach laistigh den bhliain atá i gceist sna Gaeltachtaí agus sna ceantair go bhfuil seans acu a bheith áirithe mar Ghaeltacht oifigiúil san tréimhse atá luaite.  Rath Dé ar an obair.</P>
    <P>It is with regret that my knowledge of the language is very limited.  I am a farmer and it is many years since I learned my native tongue.  Because of an effort made in a district near me I have begun to learn the language again, I hope with as much honesty, goodwill, and proper motives as I give Deputy Tunney credit for having.  I may not agree with everything he says but I give him credit for honesty in his remarks.</P>
    <P>In my short time in public life I have been convinced there is more to the Gaeltacht than just the language. Our traditions and way of life have been preserved in these areas. No doubt there is a danger that a huge influx of people into these areas may have a damaging effect but it is a risk well worth taking.  I should not like to limit the numbers or question the motives of the children who spend their holidays in the Gaeltacht.  I should not like to prevent them enjoying the beautiful area around Ballingeary and the lovely areas in Cork and Kerry.  Even if their motive was just to have a good holiday, why not?</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="727" /> It is well to remember that the traditions and the language in those areas have survived worse storms than this; they have survived the storm of foreign rule for hundreds of years and indeed the 50 years of native Government. The children who come on holiday will not change the people of the area. Recently I met a number of them and was deeply impressed.  I should be much more worried about the nation as a whole, that we might be influenced by the traditions of places such as Brussels, France and America, and by the effect of television.</P>
    <P>More than ever it is essential that every effort be made to foster the Gaeltacht and in this connection I should like to compliment the Minister for his efforts.  We must seek areas where Irish was spoken up to recently but which, for one reason or another, was allowed to die.  These weak plants should be nurtured and cherished and put into such good shape that the Minister will be empowered to declare them Gaeltacht areas.  There are many such areas throughout the country.  The one with which I have been involved in a small way is but one of many that could be resurrected if for no other reason than to keep the Irish way of life intact.  Even though an outsider might not agree, I am convinced we have much to contribute to the people of Europe by way of culture, standards and our Cristian way of life.  If we preserve our heritage it may be that at some future date we will be able to contribute something to the European Community which they will appreciate in years to come.  We did it before.</P>
    <P>I should like to compliment the Minister on his progressive approach. We must accept that anyone who has a progressive approach and takes on a difficult task cannot please everyone; I am sure Deputy Tunney will accept that.  Even though he may make a mistake it is better to do that than to do nothing.  The Minister will not go down in the records as having done nothing; he will be remembered as having accomplished quite a lot.  His name is a by-word in schools and other <Col N="728" /> places and this is as it should be.  The Department has been made a most important one, largely because of the personality and efforts of the Minister.</P>
    <P>The fact that Irish is no longer compulsory has helped to enhance the language.  The less compulsion in anything the better.  With the approach of the Minister for Education the language will go from strength to strength.</P>
    <P>The co-operative movement as it operates in the Gaeltacht must be mentioned.  It is all very well to say that we must have a Gaeltacht purely for the sake of having one but we must be realists.  If the Gaeltacht areas are entitled to special industries and aids why not avail of them?  They will help to encourage and foster the language.  The co-operative movement is concerned with keeping communities intact and I should like to see this course of action adopted in many areas.  A small co-operative effort, perhaps boat building, textiles or even a food-processing plant might be encouraged. The fact that Gaeltarra Éireann will help the people to form the co-operative movement and will help them financially is extremely worthwhile.  When such a State interest is forthcoming it ensures that when the going is rough the essential aids are given to the enterprise in question.</P>
    <P>I should like to see more facilities for children who are anxious to spend their holidays in the Gaeltacht.  There has been a certain amount of overcrowding during part of the summer and perhaps there is need for more private individuals to provide accommodation. My own children have been there every year and have benefited considerably.  Not only do they learn Irish; they learn quite a lot from meeting the people of the area who are a people apart from the Gaeltacht areas.  Perhaps they are a more religious and more innocent type of people but they are a people who have succeeded in preserving our native language and culture.</P>
    <P>I compliment the Minister on what he has done since assuming office and in particular I compliment him on what he has done in my own small area, an area which I hope will grow <Col N="729" /> to be a very large one.  It is my wish that during the Minister's term of office he will have the honour of declaring that area a Gaeltacht area.</P>
    <P>Again, I compliment Deputy Tunney on his speech.  The fact that I understood all of what he was saying is a compliment to him also because sometimes I have difficulty in understanding Irish as spoken by, for instance, some of our newsreaders and by gaeilgeoirí who have a knack of switching on a type of west of Ireland blas.  I pay tribute both to the Minister and to Deputy Tunney for the simplicity of their Irish.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Faulkner</NameTxt>
      <P>Labhair an Teachta deiridh a labhair anseo as Gaeilge ar feadh cuid den óráid a thug sé agus dúirt sé gur thosaigh sé ar an nGaeilge a fhoghlaim arís.  Ba mhaith liom traoslú dó agus a rá go mbeidh sé ina chuidiú mhór dá dtosódh muintir na hÉireann uilig an Ghaeilge a athfhoghlaim agus í a labhairt.  Tá an deacracht ceánna agamsa, caithfidh mé a rá, agus a bhí ag an Teachta Tunney sa mhéid nach bhfuil mé róchinnte de goidé an polasaí atá ag an gComhrialtas i leith na Gaeilge. Cionns go bhfuil polasaí na Gaeilge agus polasaí na Gaeltachta fite fuaite ina chéile tá sé deacair a bheith cinnte ar goidé an polasaí atá acu i leith na Gaeltachta ach an oiread.  Nuair a bhí an Teachta Tunney ag caint labhair sé faoin méid a bhí ráite cheana féin ag an Aire Poist agus Telegrafa agus ní raibh sé ag dul, mar a dúirt sé, leis an méid a bhí á rá ag Aire na Gaeltachta.  Ach ins an óráid atá curtha ar fáil ag Aire na Gaeltachta inniu, mar a dúirt an Teachta Tunney, níl tagairt ar bith ann d'athbheochan na Gaeilge agus tá súil agam nach ionann seo agus go bhfuil Aire na Gaeltachta anois ag glacadh le fealsúnacht ón Aire Phoist agus Telegrafa.  Má chailltear an teanga leis an nglúin seo, tá an baol ann go mbeidh sí caillte ar fad agus beidh an locht orainne agus cúis náire do mhuintir na hÉireann a bheidh ann go deo.  Má táimid dáiríre faoin méid atá á rá againn chomh minic sin gur daoine ar leith muid, gur náisiún ar leith muid, caithfimid deimhin a dhéanamh <Col N="730" /> de ní amháin, go gcoinneoimid an teanga slán ach go leathnófar í ins an dóigh go mbeidh achan duine sa tír seo ábalta úsaid a bhaint aisti.</P>
      <P>Duine ar bith a bhfuil suim aige ins na cursaí seo tuigeann sé nach dtig an teanga a athbheochan gan an Ghaeltacht.  Is í an Ghaeltacht tobar fíor-ghlan na Gaeilge agus is tríd an Ghaeilge a neartú sa Ghaeltacht féin agus trí iarrachtaí a dhéanamh ar an Ghaeilge a leathnú ar fud na tíre leis an Ghaeltacht mar bhun-chloch a éireoidh linn an teanga a athbheochan. Ní shílim go dtig an Ghaeilge a athbheochan gan an Ghaeltacht.  Is féidir an Gaeilge a theagasc ins na scoileanna agus rinneadh sin leis na blianta. Anois agus ag cur na ndeacrachtaí uilig san áireamh, caithfimid a adhmháil go ndearnadh go maith é.  Ach bhí an baol ann i gcónaí sa Ghalltacht go bhféachfaidh na scoláirí ar an Ghaeilge mar ábhar scoile amháin, nach dtuigfeadh siad gur teanga bheo a bhí inti agus nach bhfaigheadh sí áit níos airde ina saol ná mar a bheadh ag matamaitic nó stair nó tíreolas.  Is eagal liom gur mar sin a tharla sé go minic agus gur fhág na páistí an Ghaeilge i leath-taobh nuair a d'fhág siad an scoil sa dóigh ar fhág siad i leath-taobh na hábhair eile nach raibh de dhíth orthu i cibé slí bheatha a ghlac siad chucu féin.</P>
      <P>Ach na scoláirí a chuaigh go dtí an Ghaeltacht bhí dearcadh eile ar fad acu siúd.  Chonaic siad sin don chéad uair gur theanga bheo a bhí sa Ghaeilge, teanga ar bhain achan duine ins na ceantracha Gaeltachta úsáid aisti, daoine léannta agus daoine gan léann.  Mhothaigh siad don chéad uair nach ábhar scoile amháin a bhí sa Ghaeilge ach gur córas cumarsáide a bhí inti.  Sé mo bharúil féin ón taithí atá agam air ó thaobh cuid mhaith de na páistí sin d'athraigh an dearcadh a bhí acu.  Tháinig dearcadh úrnua chucu agus thuig siad níos fearr mar a dúirt mé cheana féin, gur theanga bheo a bhí sa Ghaeilge agus nach ábhar scoile amháin agus sílim gur thuig na páistí a cuireadh go dtí an Ghaeltacht, gur thuig siad níos fearr an fáth go rabhamar ag iarraidh an teanga a bheoú.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="731" /> Mar sin mar a dúirt mé tá athbheochan na Gaeilge ag brath ar an nGaeltacht ach ba mhaith liom a rá fosta go bhfuil an Ghaeltacht ag brath go mór ar athbheochan na Gaeilge sa Ghalltacht.  Ní fiú bheith ag iarraidh ar mhuintir na Gaeltachta an teanga a labhairt agus a chaomhnú mura bhfeiceann siad go bhfuil fáth leis agus go bhfeiceann siad go bhfuilimid sásta sa chuid eile den tír a thaispeáint dóibh go bhfuilimid féin dáiríre faoi athbheochan na Gaeilge agus ní shílim go dtig línn sin a thaispeáint dóibh mura ndéanaimid iarracht ar an Ghaeilge a fhoghlaim agus a labhairt. Tuigeann siad sin agus tá a fhios acu go maith go dtuigeann muidne fosta gur beag an mhaith a bheith ag iarraidh an Ghaeilge a choinneáil beo i roint ceantracha beaga scartha ón a chéile timpeall na tíre mura bhfuil an aidhm againn an Ghaeilge a athbheochan agus mura nglacaimid leis gurb é an t-aon dóigh amháin a dtig linn a thaispeáint gur náisiún muid.  Ar an ábhar sin, faoi mar a dúirt mé, tá leas na Gaeilge ag brath ar an nGaeltacht agus tá an Ghaeltacht féin ag brath ar an méid atá muintir na hÉireann uilig taobh amuigh den Ghaeltacht sásta an Ghaeilge a fhoghlaim.</P>
    <P>Tá moladh mór ag dul do mhuintir na Gaeltachta a choinnigh an Ghaeilge beo ach ní thig linn, agus ní ceart dúinn a bheith ag brath orthu seo a dhéanamh go deo mura gcuirimid slí bheatha agus caighdeán maireachtála ar fáil dóibh atá ar a laghad chomh maith leis an gcaighdeán maireachtála atá sa tír uilig. Sin é an rud atá á phlé againn anseo nuair atá meastachán Roinn na Gaeltachta á phlé.</P>
    <P>Tá a fhios agam go bhfuil daoine ann a deir gur trua nach ndearnadh an oiread ar son mhuintir na Gaeltachta blianta fada ó shin agus a rinneadh le 10 mbliana anuas ach nuair a smaoinímid go raibh formhór mór na ndaoine sa tír bocht ag an am sin, ní hé amháin formhór mhuintir na Gaelgo raibh an imirce chomh tiubh ó áiteanna eile san tír agus a bhí sé ón Ghaeltacht, go raibh an caighdeán maireachtála íseal áit ar bith a raibh an talamh bocht, is féidir na deacrachtaí <Col N="732" /> a bhain leis an gcás a thuigbheáil níos fearr agus na deacrachtaí a bhí roimh na daoine a bhí ag iarraidh an Ghaeltacht a chaomhú a thuigbhéail.</P>
    <P>Is é ré na ndéantús agus na monarchan is mó a thug an seans dúinn níos mó a dhéanamh ar son mhuintir na Gaeltachta, níos mó oibre a chur ar fáil dóibh, agus thug sé an seans dúinn deireadh a chur leis an imirce as na Gaeltachtaí.  Sílim nach dtógfaidh an tAire orm é má abraim gur doilgh a dhéanamh amach go cinnte cad tá déanta aige le cuidiú leis an nGaeltacht agus le muintir na Gaeltachta ó tháinig an Rialtas seo i gcumhacht.  Tá an Rialtas seo fíormhaith i ngné amháin, agus sin i gcursaí poiblíochta agus bolscaireachta.  Ní thiocfadh liom a rá go bhfuil siad chomh maith anois nuair atá na deacrachtaí rompu.</P>
    <P>Ins an am atá thart tháinig ráiteasaí chomh tiubh le gaineamh na trá, chomh tiubh sin gur deacair coinneáil suas leo, agus b'fhéidir níos tábhachtaí ná sin, go ndearna sé níos deacra é a bheith cinnte go raibh bun ar bith leo. Ní thógfainn an cheist seo ar an Meastachán seo ach gurab é go bhfuil faighte amach againn i gcás na Ranna Stáit eile a laghad is a bhí taobh thiar de na ráitis.  Bhí cuid de na hAirí i dtús a ré cosúil le réaltaí úra a tháinig sa spéir.  D'imigh sin agus, mar a deir siad sa Ghaeltacht, tháinig seo.  Mothaímid nach bhfuil taobh thiar de na ráitis ach bolscaireacht.  Ar an ábhar sin, mar a dúirt mé, tá súil agam nach dtógfaidh an tAire orm é má bhím amhrasach go dtí go bhfeicim rudaí concréideacha déanta aige.</P>
    <P>Caithfidh mé féin a admháil go mba mhaith liom bun a bheith faoi na ráitis uilig, ach mar dúirt mé, os rud é gurb é leas na Gaeltachta atá i gceist againn caithimid a chinntiú gur sin díreach an rud atá ann, nach cur-i-gcéill atá ann.  Tá a fhios agam, mar a dúirt an Teachta Tunney ó thaistil an tAire an Ghaeltacht ar fad gur chuidigh sé le suim na ndaoine a dhíriú ar chás na Gaeltachta agus, mar a dúirt an Teachta Tunney, tá moladh ag dul dó dá bharr sin.  Tá súil agam go bhfuil níos mó ná sin ann mar ní rachadh sé chun leas na Gaeltachta dá mba rud é nach raibh rud fiúntach taobh thiar den méid atá ráite aige.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="733" /> Mar is eol don Teach is fada ó chuir mé féin aithne ar an Ghaeltacht &mdash;i bhfad sul ar ceapadh mé mar Rúnaí Parlaiminte d'Aire na Gaeltachta. Bhí an-dúil agam i gcónaí i muintir na Gaeltachta, ní hé amháin chionns gur thuig mé a dtábhacht i saol náisiúin ach chomh maith leis sin chionns gur aithin mé iad mar dhaoine chomh cineálta is a bhuailfeadh leat in áit ar bith.  Bhí sé soiléir dom gur forbairt tionsclaíochta an seans is fearr a bhí againn chun muintir na Gaeltachta a choinneáil sa bhaile.  Mar a dúirt mé cheana, nuair a bheartaigh mé, ag dul taobh amuigh de na sean-saghsanna tionscail a bhí faoi chúram Ghaeltarra Éireann, bhí cuid mhaith daoine ag cur i m'éadan á rá nach dtiocfadh as an fhorbairt seo ach Béarla a thabhairt isteach sa Ghaeltacht. An dearcadh a bhí agamsa nach mbeadh teanga de chineál ar bith ann sa Ghaeltacht mura mbeadh daoine ina gcónaí ann agus gur beag duine a bheadh fágtha ann mura mbeadh obair ar fáil agus gurb é an t-aon dóigh amháin a dtiocfadh leat obair a chur ar fáil don oiread daoine agus a raibh sé de dhíth orthu ná sin a dhéanamh trí mheán na tionsclaíochta.</P>
    <P>Tá áthas orm a fheiceáil, ins an méid a bhí le rá ag an Aire ina óráid, go n-aontaíonn sé liom sa mhéid sin.  Cuireadh an tEastát Tionsclaíochta i nGaoth Dobhair nuair a bhí Fianna Fáil i gcumhacht. Tógadh réamh-mhonarchain ann agus is mór an dul chun cinn a rinneadh sna Gaeltachtaí ó shin i leith agus is mór go léir an méid oibre a cuireadh ar fáil do mhuintir na Gaeltachta sa Ghaeltacht.  Is mó duine a d'fhan sa bhaile sa Ghaeltacht chionns go raibh an obair sin ar fáil in ionad dul thar lear le slí bheatha a fháil thar lear.</P>
    <P>Sílim féin gurb é an t-athrú is mó a tháinig i ndiaidh na forbartha tionsclaíochta a cuireadh ar siúl le linn Fianna Fáil a bheith i gcumhacht, ná an t-athrú meoin a bhí le feiceáil go mór-mhór sa Ghaeltacht is fearr a raibh aithne agamsa air.  Go dtí sin is í an bharúil a bhí ag muintir na Gaeltachta sa Ghaeltacht sin den duine nach ndeachaigh thar lear ach a d'fhan sa bhaile sa Ghaeltacht ag <Col N="734" /> iarraidh sli bheatha a bhaint amach dó féin ná gur duine gan mhaith é a bhí ann, duine nach raibh cnámh droma ann.  Is mór an dochar a rinne an dearcadh sin.  A mhalairt ar fad atá le feiceáil ann le tamall de bhlianta anuas.  In ionad na málaí a dhrod agus tabhairt fúthu go hAlbain is sa bhaile atá siad ag plodadh.  Tá sé fíor-thábhachtach ins na laethanta anróiteacha seo ina bhfuilimid faoi láthair go leanfaí ar aghaidh go tréan leis an fhorbairt tionsclaíoch, ní hé amháin i leith na dtionscal mór ach i leith na miontionscal chomh maith. Tá sé íontach tábhachtach go bhféachaimid chuige, ní hé amháin go mbeidh tionscail úra ar fáil don Ghaeltacht ach go dtabharfaidh muid aire ar leith do na tionscail atá ann i láthair na huaire le cinntiú go dtiocfaidh siad as na deacrachtaí.  Tá rompú faoi láthair slán sábhalta.  Tá cuid díobh i mbaol agus tá súil agam go bhfuil an tAire ag coinneáil súil ghéar orthu sin agus go bhfuil an t-airgead ar fáil atá de dhith le hiad a choinneáil ag obair.</P>
    <P>Do labhair mé tamall ó shin ar chúrsaí tréanála agus oiliúna, go mór mór oiliúint i gcúrsaí bainisteoireachta. Más Gaeilge a labhrann an fhoireann bainistíochta i monarchan ar bith sa Ghaeltacht tig leat a bheith cinnte gur Gaeilge a labhrann na hoibrithe eile sa mhonarcha go gineralta.  Ar a taobh eile de, tá sé comhair a bheith cinnte go gcaillfear an Ghaeilge más Beárla gnath-theanga na foirne bainisteoireachta.  Is fíor, mar sin, aire ar leith a thabhairt gur daoine a bhfuil Gaeilge acu a dtabharfar traenáil bainisteoirí dóibh le haghaidh áiteacha seachas an Ghaeltacht féin.  Ina theannta sin ní foláir dlús a chur le oiliúint fiúntach a thabhairt do teicneoiri a bhfuil Gaeilge acu agus arís na teíchneoiri sin a fháil, chomh fada agus is féidir é, as an nGaeltacht féin.  Tá sé seo thar a bheith táchtabhtach.  Nuair a chuaigh mé thart ar na monarchana éagsúla mhothaigh mé féin chomh mór agus a chuaigh an sampla a thugann an fhoireann bhainistíochta i gcionn ar chúrsaí Gaeilge ins na monarchana. Thiocfadh liom a rá go raibh an rud céanna le tabhairt faoi <Col N="735" /> deara agam nuair a thug mé cuairt ar na monarchana san Bhreatain Bhig agus gur mhothaigh mé ansin, chomh maith, go raibh an Breatanais slán sábháilte sna monarchana arb í an Bhreatanais a labhrann an fhoireann bhainisteoireachta iontu.  Tá áthas orm, mar sin, a fheiceáil go n-abrann an tAire anseo ina óráid go bhfuil sé ag cur an-suime san obair atá á déanamh ag AnCO i nGaoth Dobhair.</P>
    <P>Tig liom a rá, ní hé amháin ó thaobh na Gaeilge, go dtugann sé céim suas do mhuintir na Gaeltachta nuair a fheiceann siad go dtig lena muintir féin tabhairt faoi an oiread sin cineálacha oibre, go dtig leo ní amháin a bheith ina n-oibrithe monarcha ach go dtig leo an bhainistíocht a dhéanamh chomh maith.</P>
    <P>Nuair a bheidh an tAire ag freagairt ba mhaith liom go n-inseodh sé dúinn faoi mar atá cúrsaí iascaireachta sa Ghaeltacht faoi láthair.  Sílim féin gur beag tionscal taobh amuigh de na tionscail deantúsaíochta a dtiocfadh leis an Roinn a fhorbairt chun tairbhe mhuintir na Gaeltachta agus go dtiocfadh leo tionscal na h-iascaireachta a fhorbairt.  An dtiocfadh leis an Aire a insint dúinn cad é an dul chun cinn atá á dhéanamh ó thaobh bail a chur ar na céadhanna agus báid fhoirsteanacha a chur ar fáil?  Tá an t-iasc ann, tá an margadh ann, agus mheas mé i gcónaí gur gné amháin é seo den fhorbairt sna ceantair Ghaeltachta nach ndearnadh an oiread agus ba cheart nó nach ndearnadh an oiread agus a thiocfadh leo a dhéanamh. Thart faoin gcósta blianta fada ó shin bhí tionscal na h-iascaireachta ar fheabhas in áiteacha ach inniu, is beag bád atá le feiceáil sna háiteacha sin anois.  Tá a fhios agam go raibh cúiseanna eacnamaíochta ag baint le seo ach sílim go bhfuil athrú tagaithe ar an saol anois agus gur fearr an seans atá ann anois sa Chomhargadh forbairt a dhéanamh ar an iascaireacht.</P>
    <P>Ba mhaith liom a rá go bhfuil cúrsaí oideachais fíor-thábhachtach sa Ghaeltacht.  Caithfimid scolaíocht trí Ghaeilge a chur ar fáil do mhuintir na Gaeltachta ní hé amháin sna bunscoileanna ach sna meánscoileanna, sna ceardscoileanna, sna coláistí réigiúnacha agus sna hollscolta.  Ar an ábhar sin, <Col N="736" /> fáiltím roimh an scéim scoláireachtaí a luaigh an tAire san óráid ach ag an am céanna caithfimid a admháil gur beag an úsáid atá dá baint as na scoláireachtaí go fóill.  Sílim go mba cheart don Aire a aire a dhíriú go mór mór ar na coláistí réigiúnacha mar is ansin a gheobhas na daoine óga an oiliúint teicniúil agus an oiliúint bhainisteoireachta atá de dhíth.  Ní bheadh ann ach cothrom na Féinne do muintir na Gaeltachta go mbeadh teagasc le fáil acu i nGaeilge.  Déarfainn féin go mbeadh muintir na Gaeltachta ag braith ar dháríreacht an Rialtais agus go mbeidh muintir na hÉireann uilig ag braith go mór ar an méid a dhéanfar le teagasc tré mheán na Gaeilge a chur ar fáil sa dara agus sa tríú leibhéal.</P>
    <P>Ní fiú bheith ag caint faoi bhainisteoirí a mbeidh Gaeilge acu nó faoi teicneoirí a mbeidh Gaeilge acu mura bhfuil teagasc trí Ghaeilge ar fáil do mhuintir na Gaeltachta.  Ba mhaith liom go ndíreodh an tAire a shúile ar an ngné thábhachtach seo de shaol na Gaeltachta.  Sílim gur cuidiu mór a bheadh ann dá mbeadh níos mó pobalscoileanna ar fáil sa Ghaeltacht. B'fhéidir go inseoidh an tAire dúinn cad é mar atá an scéal faoi láthair i nGaoth Dobhair i dtaobh den phobalscoil ansin agus cad é an dul chun cinn atá déanta i leith pobalscoil a chur ar fáil do mhuintir na Gaeltachta i gCorca Dhuibhne.</P>
    <P>Déanfaidh mé tagairt gairid anois do ghné eile.  Nuair a luaim Corca Dhuibhne deirtear liom go bhfuil ceathrar páistí de mhuintir na háite ag freastal anois ar an mbunscoil i nDún Chaoin.  Cathain a chuirfear deire leis an amaidí seo?  Tá ceap magaidh déanta de mhuintir na Gaeltachta, agus de mhuintir Dhún Chaoin go háirithe, dá bharr.  Tá sé scannalach go bhfuil Aire ar bith sásta oideachas scaifte beag páistí a mhilleadh.  Ní racfaidh mé isteach arís ag an am seo fán scéal uilig.  B'fhéidir go ndéanfaidh mé am éigin eile é.  Tá sé curtha ar pháipéar agam san óráid a thug mé tamaill ó shin ar chúrsaí oideachais sa Dáil seo.  Dúradh ag an am sin go raibh cúiseanna sóisialta agus cultúra i gceist nuair a chuirtear dhá scoil náisiúnta le céile.  Ní thiocfadh leat a rá go raibh cúrsaí <Col N="737" /> cultúra ar bith i gceist sa chás seo, mura bhfuil tú sásta a rá nach bhfuil Gaeilge Bhaile an Fheirtéirigh chomh maith le Gaeilge Dhún Chaoin.  Chuala mé an oiread sin faoi iarrachtaí lena chruthú gurbh é an ceart an scoil sin a oscailt, ach ó thaobh oideachais de, ní thig liom a rá ach go raibh sé millteanach agus nach bhfuiltear ag thabhairt cothram na Féinne do pháistí óga na háite sin.  Chonaic mé ar na mallaibh go raibh duine de na tuismitheoirí go raibh páiste óg léi le dul ar scoil agus nach raibh sí sásta an páiste a chur ar an scoil sin.</P>
    <P>Tógadh raic úr sna páipéir, agus thug an tAire Oideachais ráiteas amach nach raibh sé ar intinn aige an scoil sin a dhúnadh.  Nuair a ceistíodh an tAire anseo sa Dáil fá daobh de éifeacht scoileanna aon-óide, is é an freagra a thug sé ná go raibh sé chomh holc sin ó thaobh oideachais nár cheart go mbeadh páiste ar bith ag freastal ar scoil dá leithéid sin, agus ag an am céanna tá an magadh seo ag dul ar aghaidh go fóill.  Ba cheart athsmaoineadh ar seo agus seans réasúnach a thabhairt don cheathrar páistí atá fágta ansan i dtús a saol oideachais.</P>
    <P>Tá áthas orm a fheiceáil go bhfuil oiread sin páistí ag freastal ar na coláistí Ghaeilge sa Ghaeltacht, gidh go n-aontaím le roinnt den méid a dúirt an Teachta Tunney.  Sin an áit a dtig leo an Ghaeilge a chloisteáil á húsáid go nádúrtha mar mhean cumarsáide i measc na ndaoine uilig.  Ní aontaím leis an Aire Oideachais nuair a deireann sé go dtagann níos mó páistí go dtí an Gaeltacht cionn is gur athraigh seisean na rialacha agus nach bhfuil anois de dhíth ar pháistí pas a fháil sa Ghaeilge le pas a fháil san ard-teistiméireacht.  Tá fáth amháin go bhfuil an oiread páistí ag plódadh isteach sa Ghaeltacht agus sin gur féidir maireachtáil ansin ar chostas níos ísle ná mar a thiocfadh lena dtuismitheoirí iad a choinneáil sa bhaile.  Ní hé amháin go bhfuil siad ag fáil loistín sa Ghaeltacht ar tháille atá íseal ach bíonn cúrsaí Gaeilge ann dóibh leis an nGaeilge a fhoghlaim agus tugtar aire dóibh ann chomh maith.</P>
    <P>Is cuma liom cé cúis atá leis.  Is <Col N="738" /> maith liomsa an oiread sin daoine a bheith ag dul go dtí an Ghaeltacht. Is iad na daoine óga a choinneos an solas lasta don chéad glúin eile.  Ag an am céanna, aontáim leis an Teachta Tunney go bhfuil baol ann.  Ba cheart súil ghéar a choinneáil ar na coláistí Gaeilge fá dtaobh de labhairt na Gaeilge an fhad is atá deontas á fháil ag na páistí seo sa Ghaeltacht.  Is beag rud a mhillfeadh an Ghaeltacht agus an Ghaeilge le scaiftí móra den aos óg ag dul ansin agus Béarla ar siúl acu an t-am ar fad.  Tá sé sin cruthaithe cheana féin.  Bhí an taithí céanna agamsa agus a bhí ag an Teachta Tunney nuair a bhí mé ag dul thart ar an Ghaeltacht i rith an tsamhraidh, gur mhothaigh mé go raibh an-chuid Béarla á labhairt i measc na bpáistí.  Sílim go bhfuil dóigheanna chun deireadh a chur leis an mbaol díobhála sin.  Tá fhios agam go bhfuil riail an Bhéarla ar na billeóga a chuireann na coláisti amach chuig na tuismitheoirí ag míniú dóibh cad iad na rialacha a gcaithfidh na páistí glacadh leo más mian leo freastal ar choláiste Gaeilge.  Deirtear go gcuirfear abhaile páiste a labhróidh Bhéarla an fhad is a bhíos sé sa Ghaeltacht.  Is beag coláiste a chlaíonn leis an riail sin agus is mór an trua é, ní amháin i leith na Gaeltachta ach i leith an pháiste féin.  Níl cothram na Féinne á fháil ag an Ghaeltacht, ag na tuismitheoirí ná ag an bpáiste féin.  Tuigim an gnó seo go rí-mhaith.  Mar is eol don Aire, is dócha, bhí mé im rúnaí ar Choláiste Bhríde, Rann na Feirste, ar feadh na mblianta.  An tAthair Lorcain Ó Muireadhaigh, go ndéana Dia maith air, a bhunaigh an coláiste ansin tar éis dó an coláiste in Oméith a dhúnadh toisc gur tháinig meath ar an nGaeilge ansin. Thuig sé go mbeadh deireadh leis an Ghaeltacht i Rann na Feirste dá mbeadh na sluaithe daoine agus Béarla ar siúl acu ag plódú isteach gach bliain.  Eisean a chur tús leis an riail faoin mBéarla.  Claíodh go daingean leis an riail sin ó shin agus sílim gurb é sin an fáth go bhfuil an Ghaeilge chomh beo bríomhar agus a bhí sí ariamh sa cheantar sin.  Ceantar ana bheag atá ann.  Níl an oiread sin teach ar fad ann.  I rith na mblianta bhí scaiftí an-mhór páistí ag dul ann.  Níl mé ag rá nár labhair páistí ariamh Béarla ann <Col N="739" /> ach tá mé cinnte am ar bith a rugadh ar pháiste ag labhairt Béarla gur cuireadh an riail i bhfeidhm.  Bíonn sé trom ar pháiste é sin a dhéanamh leis agus bíonn sé an-trom ar an duine a bhíos i mbun an choláiste é a dhéanamh. B'éasca go mór dó féin dá dtiocfadh leis a rá &ldquo;Níor chuala me é&rdquo; nó &ldquo;Déanfaimid eisceacht as an t-am seo.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Sílim féin dá n-iarrfadh an tAire ar lucht stiúrtha na gcoláiste iarracht a dhéanamh an riail seo a chur i bhfeidhm i gceart agus gan a bheith ag ligint orthu go bhfuil siad á dhéanamh, dhéanfadh sé maitheas cinnte, ní hé amháin ó thaobh na Gaeilge a choinnéail beo sa Ghaeltacht ach ó thaobh an méid Gaeilge a bheadh le fáil ag na páistí sa Ghaeltacht.  Bheadh an spioraid i bhfad níos fearr acu ná mar a bheadh dá rachadh siad ansin agus go bhfanfadh siad ansin ag siúl thart ina scataí agus an Béarla ar siúl acu.  Ní thiocfadh leo spioraid ar bith a bhaint as sin.</P>
    <P>B'fhéidir go gceapann an tAire go bhfuil seans ann go bhfuil sé éasca do na páistí dul go háiteanna eile&mdash;ní hiad na háiteanna uilig eile, anois&mdash;ach go dtí áiteanna eile agus gan riail ar bith a bheith i bhfeidhm iontu, go rachadh na páistí go dtí an áit is éasca, mar a déarfá.  Ach má bhreathaíonn tú ar na huimreacha ó Rann na Feirste chífidh tú go bhfuil an áit sin lán go doras ar feadh dhá mhí gach bliain.  Ar an ábhar sin, tá sé soiléir go nglacann tuismitheoirí leis, go nglacann na páistí leis an riail agus go ndéanann an riail sin dea-obair chun an Ghaeilge a chaomhnadh ins an gceantar beag sin. Tá muintir Rann na Feirse féin an bhródúil gur choinnigh siad an Ghaeilge chomh glan agus atá sé sa cheantar sin.  Bíonn míle nó níos mó páistí ag freastal ann chuile bhliain. Is é mo bharúil féin gur chuidigh riail an Bhéarla go mór leis seo.  Níl mé ach ag rá go ndéanfadh sé maitheas d'áiteanna eile Gaeltachta dá leanfadh siad an riail sin.</P>
    <P>Ba mhaith liom dá dtiocfadh leis an Aire níos mó eolais a chur ar fáil dúinn faoi Údarás na Gaeltachta. Mhínigh sé dúinn tamall ó shin faoi mar a bheidh baill an Údarás ceapaithe ach ba mhaith liom dá dtiocfadh <Col N="740" /> leis a insint dúinn an dóigh ina dtoghfar na daoine san Údarás féin agus na cumhachtaí a bheidh acu. Ba cheart go mbeadh barúil ag Teachtaí Dála roimh ré faoin gcrot a bheidh ar an Údarás chun go mbeidh siad in ann, nuair a chuirfear an Bille ós comhair na Dála, a mbarúil a thabhairt níos cruinne.  Mar is eol don Aire, is é an rud a bheidh de dhíth orm agus ar Theachtaí i gcoitinne ná go mbeadh an tÚdarás bunaithe ar an dóigh is fearr chun maitheas na Gaeltachta.  Beidh an tÚdarás níos éifeachtaí má tá Teachtaí in ann smaointe an Aire a bheith acu.  Níl mé ag iarraidh air an t-eolas cruinn a thabhairt dúinn ach ba cheart go mbeadh a chuid smaointe againn sul a gcuireann sé an Bille ós comhair na Dála amach anseo.  Tá an aidhm chéanna againn uilig&mdash;maitheas na Gaeltachta agus mhuintir na Gaeltachta.</P>
    <P>Fógraíodh go bhfuil sé ar intinn ag an Aire agus ag an Rialtas limistéaraí na Gaeltachta a leathnú. Caithfidh mé a rá go bhfuil mé iontach imníoch faoi seo.  I 1956 nuair a bhí an Comhrialtas deiridh ann, leag siad amach teorainn nua Gaeltachta. Bhí a fhios ag an saol mór ag an am sin nach raibh an teorainn sin ceart i dtaobh na Gaeltachta, go raibh cuid mhór de na ceantair taobh istigh den Ghaeltacht ina nGalltacht amach is amach.  Nuair a ceapadh mé mar Rúnaí Párlaiminte, rinne mé an rud sin go léir a scrúdú.  Shíl mé go mb'fhéidir go gcuideodh sé le cúis na Gaeilge é a fhágaint mar a bhí.  Níl mé chomh cinnte faoi sin anois agus b'fhéidir go dtiocfadh leis an Aire é sin a insint dúinn nuair atá sé ag tabhairt freagra.</P>
    <P>Shíl me ag an am, i dtaobh na ndaoine a bhí ag labhairt Béarla ins na ceantrachaí sin, nuair a fheicfeadh siad na deontais a bhí le fáil dá mbeadh an Ghaeilge acu go dtosnódh siad ar an nGaeilge a labhairt. Níor tháinig an feabhas air a shíl mé.  Ní bheinn in éadan limistéirí na Gaeltachta a athrú.  Ní bheinn in éadan an Ghaeltacht a leathnú mar sin dá mbeinn cinnte gur daoine le Gaeilge, cainteoirí ó dhúchas, a bheadh ag dul isteach, nó go mbeimis <Col N="741" /> measartha cinnte go dtosnódh siad ag foghlaim Gaeilge agus go mbeadh Gaeilge ó dhúchas ag na páistí.  Níl a fhios agam an dtuigeann na daoine a bheidh ag teacht isteach nach bhfuil mórán le fáil acu go pearsanta mura bhfuil an Ghaeilge acu&mdash;nár tháinig athrú ar bith ar an riail sin. A fhad is a bheinn sásta go mbeadh sé ag cuidiú chun an Ghaeilge a athbheochan, ní bheinn ina éadan, ach más rud polaitiúil nó a leithéid atá ann beidh mé go mór ina éadan. B'fhéidir go mbeidh an tAire, agus é ag freagairt, in ann níos mó eolais a thabhairt dúinn faoi sin.</P>
    <P>Más airgead amháin a bhí de dhíth ar na ceantrachaí a tugadh isteach le forbairt a dhéanamh iontu agus gurb é sin an t-aon fhath amháin chun an t-athrú a dhéanamh, b'fhearr liomsa an t-airgead sin a thabhairt dóibh ó chiste éigin eile.  Ach mar a dúirt me, beidh mé ag brath ar an méid a bheas le rá ag an Aire i dtaobh na rudaí sin.</P>
    <P>Sílim fosta go bhfuil se níos tábhachtaí ná mar bhí sé, anois nuair atá an tAire chun Údarás na Gaeltachta a bhunú, go mbeadh an Ghaeilge mar theanga sráide ag muintir na Gaeltachta.</P>
    <P>Ba cheart fosta go dtuigfeadh na daoine a thiocfaidh isteach sa Ghaeltacht faoin leathnú seo nach mbeidh a dhath le fáil acu ach deontais ghinearálta mar deontais fá choinne bóithre a dheisiú agus deontais déantúsaíochta. An cás atá á dhéanamh agamsa ná go mba cheart na deontais seo a chur ar fáil do na ceantracha seo is cuma ann nó as iad agus an Ghaeltacht a choinneáil ina Gaeltacht.  Ní thig le duine ar bith atá ina chónaí sa Ghaeltacht faoi láthair deontais phearsanta a fháil&mdash;deontais tithíochta, deontas £10 7rl. mura bhfuil an Ghaeilge mar ghnath-theanga caidrimh acu.</P>
    <P>Tá airgead curtha ar fáil, mar is gnách, do na heagrais Ghaeilge agus do na hirisí Gaeilge, ins na meastacháin seo.  Ba mhaith liom a iarraidh ar an Aire cuidiú ar leith a thabhairt don pháipéar seachtainiúil <i>Amárach</i> lena choinneáil beo.  Tá a fhios againn go bhfuil sé iontach doiligh páipéar <Col N="742" /> seachtainiúil a choinneáil beo fiú i mBéarla i láthair na huaire.  Tugann <i>Amárach</i> scéala dúinn ar imeachtaí sa Ghaeltacht féin agus tá sé iontach cosúil leis an pháipéar seachtainiúil áitiúil sa mhéid sin.  Ceannaíonn formhór mór mhuintir na hÉireann páipéar laethúil, ach ceannaíonn an chuid is mó díobh páipéar áitiúil amháin ar a laghad achan seachtain mar cuireann siad uilig suim ins na nithe áitiúil a tharlaíonn ina gceantar féin.  Tá géarghá ann go mbeadh a leithéid le fáil do mhuintir na Gaeltachta agus tá <i>Amárach</i> ag iarraidh sin a chur ar fáil. B'fhéidir nach bhfuil an páipéar sin chomh maith is ba mhaith linn í a bheith ach níl an locht sin ar fad ar na daoine atá ina bhun.  Mura bhfuil an nuacht áitiúil uilig suas chun dáta is minic ceal airgid le tuairisceoirí ins na Gaeltachtaí éagsúla a íoc is cúis le sin. Mura dtig le muintir na Gaeltachta an nuacht áitiúil a fháil trí mheán na Gaeilge léifidh siad é trí mheán an Bhéarla agus ní thiocfadh le duine ar bith a rá gur rud sásúil sin.</P>
    <P>Ní dhearn mé tagairt do <i>Inniu</i>, mar tá <i>Inniu</i> go ginearálta ag déileáil le cúrsaí níos leithne ná cúrsaí na Gaeltachta amháin agus ag déanamh job maith de, agus tá mise sa chás seo ag leagadh béim ar nuacht áitiúil.  Thiocfadh a rá b'fhéidir go dearn mé féin faillí sa ghnó seo fhad agus a bhí mé i mbun na Roinne.  D'admhóinn go mb'fhéidir go dtiocfadh liom níos mó a dhéanamh. Níl a fhios agam caidé an díol atá ag <i>Amárach</i> sa Ghaeltacht féin.  Mura bhfuil sé chomh hard agus ba cheart dó a bheith ba cheart an scéal a iniúchadh lena fáil amach cad chuige nach bhfuil.  Níl mé á rá anseo ach amháin go bhfuil géarghá sa Ghaeltacht le páipéir dá leithéid.</P>
    <P>Chím ins an óráid a thug an tAire go bhfuiltear le Bord na Gaeilge a bhunú ach ní thiocfadh liom a bheith sásta leis an méid a bheidh faoi chúram an bhoird sin ón méid atá le fáil ar a laghad as óráid an Aire.  B'fhéidir go dtiocfadh leis níos mó eolais a thabhairt dúinn mar dúirt sé ina óráid más cuimhin liom i gceart go mbeadh na cúramaí a bhí ag na Ranna eile go fóill acu agus dúirt sé go mbeadh rudaí áirithe faoi chúram Bhord na Gaeilge agus i mbraicéidí bhí Bord <Col N="743" /> na Leabhar Gaeilge.  Sílim go mbeadh níos mó cúramaí ar Bhord na Gaeilge go díreach ná Bord na Leabhar Gaeilge ach chionns go bhfuil mé ag labhairt faoi Bhord na Leabhar Gaeilge ba mhaith liom dá gcuideodh an tAire an oiread agus a thig leis le níos mó leabhar as Gaeilge a chur ar fáil do mhuintir na Gaeltachta.  Arís tá na deacrachtaí céanna ann ó thaobh leabhair Ghaeilge agus atá ó thaobh nuacht a fháil as Gaeilge ins na páipéir.  Mura bhfuil leabhair Ghaeilge ar fáil níl dul as ag muintir na Gaeltachta acht leabhair Bhéarla a léamh, agus ba mhaith liom dá mbeadh an oiread leabhar ar fáil agus a thig leis an Aire a chur ar fáil dóibh.</P>
    <P>Nuair atá mé ag caint faoi sin is cuimhin go ndeachaigh mé isteach nuair a bhí an Fo-Thoghchán ar siúl i dTír Chonaill go ndeachaigh mé isteach i dteach iargúlta ar fad.  Bhí an teach seo suite i ngleann scaite i bhfad amach ó achan áit.  Bhí sé andoiligh teacht ar an teach féin agus nuair a chuaigh mé isteach ann bhí fear méanaosta ina shuí leis féin sa teach agus lampa gáis aige agus é ag léamh <i>The Decline and Fall of the Third Reich</i> agus dúirt mé liom féin is trua nach raibh oideachasa saor ar fáil nuair a bhí tusa óg agus rachfá fada go leor sa tsaol.  Arís ba mhaith liom a rá leis an Aire go bhfuil an aidhm chéanna againn uilig, an Ghaeltacht a chaomhnú, a leathnú chomh fada agus is féidir, an Ghaeilge a chur ar fáil do mhuintir na hÉireann uilig agus tig leis a bheith cinnte fhad is atá muidne sásta leis an méid atá á dhéanamh aige go bhfaighidh sé pé cuidiú is féidir ón taobh seo den Teach.</P>

      <P>My contribution to this debate will be in the English language and I should like to say why.  First of all, I mean by this no disrespect either to the Irish language itself&mdash;quite the contrary&mdash;or to the other speakers who in this debate have intervened either in the Irish language only or in both languages. There have been good reasons for them in all cases to do that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the case of the Minister for the <Col N="744" /> Gaeltacht who is using the Irish language regularly as part of his official work and is responsible for the Irish language, it is entirely reasonable and right that his statement here should be in the Irish language. For those also who have equal facility in English and Irish, who can express themselves equally well in either language, it is also reasonable that they should do that, and I know that Deputy Tunney and others are in that position.</P>
    <P>I have myself spoken in the past in Irish on this Estimate but I have reached the conclusion that there was a certain falsity in so doing and, as I think we should try to cut down the elements of humbug in our society and life, I have decided to use here now the language which I use better than the other one, in which I can express my thoughts more freely, easily and precisely, the language in which I am at home.</P>
    <P>I do so also for another reason which is this.  The question of Irish language policy, the whole cultural context of that, is too important to be left exclusively to the care of a very small number of gaeilgeoirí.  I do not want my words to be distorted as they often have been in this area. There seems to be a distorting chamber here, though not in this debate.</P>

      <P>The Deputy is very kind to my Irish but, let us say, it is not quite as good as my English which is fairly efficient.  I wanted to say this.  I am very glad the Deputy intervened as he did.  It was reasonable in the early days of the Irish language movement, or revival movement, for people to say: &ldquo;Maybe if we use a little bit here and there, if we say `A chara' here and `Mise, le meas' there and give a `deashampla' there and a `slán abhaile' here we are giving the language a little bit of a push and it will get on and it will grow from there; it will get better.&rdquo;  Only it has not.  I am afraid that these little salutations and little ritual usages do not really help people to think about their attitude to Irish, or to think whether they want seriously to start working on Irish and using it as some of our young people are inclined to do.</P>

      <P>The Deputy asks me what I meant by a bog oak monolith and I am very glad he asked that question.  I will try to answer it. I was not referring to the Irish language as a bog oak monolith, though some of the Deputy's friends have abbreviated my remark in that helpful way.  I was referring to a certain way of dealing with the language as a sort of venerable relic: you do not actually use it much but you keep it there in the back room and you trot it out on ceremonial occasions and then you put it away.  That is what I meant by a bog oak monolith.  What I meant was that it was a way of being fundamentally &ldquo;unserious&rdquo; about this question. I had been explaining why&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I was making the point that the question of the Irish language, its role in our culture, its significance for us, for our civilisation, if I may say so, should not just be left to the people who use Irish and know Irish.  It is a question for all our people, into which they should be drawn.  Indeed, Deputy Tunney recognised that when in the second part of his speech he went into English.  That is partly why I am speaking in English, the other reason being that I speak English better than I speak Irish.  I am not afraid to say so in this House because I know a few other Deputies who are in the same position&mdash;not those who are in the Chamber now but, perhaps, quite a few others.</P>
      <P>I should now like to turn to Deputy Tunney's remarks.  I should like to pay tribute, first of all, to two things.  The first is the sincerity of his own commitment to the Irish language which is known to all of us here.  We know that for him it is not a matter of the occasional ritualistic observance, that he speaks it whenever he can, that he loves this language and speaks it very well indeed.</P>
      <P>The other aspect of his remarks to which I should like to pay tribute is the moderation which he brought into the discussion on this matter, moderation which often does not mark discussions on this subject.  I freely admit that I myself have occasionally departed from moderation and I shall try to be more moderate in future and to follow the Deputy's example in that matter as far as I can.</P>
      <P>There has also been a much greater lack of moderation, in my view, on some of the fringes of what is called the Irish Language Movement.  So far, so good.  I also noted with care Deputy Tunney's admonition that we should keep party politics out of this.  The party political note has been subdued in this debate and it is right that we should keep it subdued, but let us, please not pretend it is not there, because it is.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When Deputy Tunney speaks on this subject he is speaking both as a man who is sincerely devoted to the Irish language and as a man who is spokesman on this subject of a party who <Col N="747" /> are at the moment in Opposition and who&mdash;and the best of luck to them&mdash; would very much like to get out of Opposition and come over here and put out this Government.  There is nothing to be ashamed of in that.  It is a perfectly good and democratic process but it has its effects.</P>
    <P>Deputy Tunney will probably recognise in &ldquo;a chroí istigh&rdquo;, if I may make a ritualistic use of the language, that my friend on my right, Deputy O'Donnell is a very good Minister for the Gaeltacht indeed.  If Deputy O'Donnell had the honour, which he has not, to be a member of Fianna Fáil and a Fianna Fáil Minister, the report of the solid work he has been putting into this would have been received by Deputy Tunney with the greatest of enthusiasm.  He would have said: &ldquo;This is the best Minister we have ever had in this area.&rdquo;  I believe this is the case.  I also believe that Deputy Tunney believes it.  I do not blame him for not saying it.</P>
    <P>If the shoe were on the other foot and I was in Opposition and I had seen a great performance by a Fianna Fáil Minister, I would not be running through the streets cheering.  I hope I would not be knocking too hard either.  These are realities.  There is politics in this and we cannot keep it out.  We are not some kind of impartial Areopagus sitting around sagely and impartially judging.  This is also a debate between two sides and there is some element of artificiality in any parliamentary process.</P>

I do not wish to make a dinner out of that because there is not a lot involved here except that, as I said, we should recognise that it is also necessarily a political debate.  I will be making some political points also and I hope I will make them with the same moderation Deputy Tunney showed.</P>
      <P>Deputy Tunney criticised the Minister on the ground that he has not yet implemented his decision on the transfer of his Ministry, or a large part of it, to the Gaeltacht area.  If I remember rightly&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Tunney</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Cruise-O'Brien</NameTxt>
      <P>The point I wished to make was that a former Fianna Fáil Minister, former Deputy Ó Morain, announced, I believe in 1963, a decision to transfer the Ministry to the Gaeltacht and that promise was still unfulfilled when that Government left office.  I hope it will be ten years or so before this Government leave office but I am quite certain that when this Minister comes to report again on this Estimate next year he will have concrete progress to report on this.  My view will be on the record of the House and if it is wrong Deputies opposite will have every right to reproach me with it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Tunney quoted, in order to take me mildly to task, my definition last March of what I understood Government policy in this area to be. Here again I should like to express some appreciation because Deputy Tunney took care to quote what I actually said.  He quoted the relevant part in full and he took it on as what it was and not what one might, if one feigned misunderstanding, pretend it was.  It may be said that that is normal <Col N="749" /> but I wish that in this area it was normal because since I became involved in this debate&mdash;I have no apologies to make about stimulating a public discussion about where exactly the Irish language fits into our culture, what its exact position should be, what it can hope to be and what we can realistically expect in this area&mdash;I was very depressed by the lack of good faith manifested by many of those who most vociferously took part in this including, I am sorry to say, officials of the Gaelic League. They repeatedly said that I had said &mdash;something I never said&mdash;that the proportion of Irish in broadcasting should be reduced.</P>
    <P>When I put that correction on the record they ignored that correction and repeated again and again that I had said what they knew I had not said.  That is sad.  It is an uncivilised mode of controversy and it tends to discredit the cause for which these gentlemen speak.  It has been among the causes why the love and enthusiasm for the Irish language which existed fairly widely before the foundation of the State has on the whole tended to diminish in the meantime until fairly recently.  I should like to make it clear at this stage that I am not making a party political point.  The Deputies opposite have not done that and I am not saying that they have done it or implied it; it is a different thing.</P>
    <P>I found, apart from Deputy Tunney's critique of what I had to say, it moving but I am obliged to criticise it intellectually.  Deputy Tunney cherishes the ideal of an Ireland in which Irish will be the general vernacular.  He spoke of the whole island of Ireland becoming one day a 32-county Gaeltacht.  When I questioned him as to how soon he thought that could be achieved he said he did not expect it in his lifetime, and, perhaps, not in 100 years; that these were long-term ideals which he discerned through the mist. He contrasted the holding of such an ideal with narrow, crass materialism of grab everything one can in terms of material advantage and he spoke of striving after an ideal as being good in itself.  If I say that this is a <Col N="750" /> romantic view I must, above all, not be taken as sneering at it.  I am not doing so.</P>
    <P>I know Deputy Tunney genuinely cherishes this ideal, and there are a few others who do, but very few do and there is a danger here.  We were brought up to some extent on the cult of the dream, a dream identified with nobility and chivalry as distinct from the sordidness of much of daily life.  In my view there is power in that concept but there is also a time when the power begins to run down, when things go sour.  Deputy Tunney speaks of striving after an ideal but he knows too well, as all those concerned with the Irish language must know, that after 50 years of self-Government it is abundantly clear that the majority of the people are not striving towards this ideal.  It is an ideal for which they have sympathy.  They are content to see the State help the Irish language but they are not disposed to give much help themselves.  They are not striving.  The danger is when we set ourselves an ideal that we know cannot be achieved in our lifetime, that we think probably cannot be achieved in 100 years and that many of us feel cannot be achieved at all because we are not making any progress towards it whatever, then discouragement and cynicism set in and we are prevented from developing that degree of support for the Irish language, that degree of understanding of what the Irish language means in our culture which would be real.  A dream is very good but there comes a time when one has to wake up, and after 50 years, perhaps that time has come.</P>
    <P>I should like to extend very warm congratulations indeed, to the Minister, Deputy Tom O'Donnell, for what he has done.  There is a very solid balance sheet there and not just promises as is suggested.  There is work there.  I am not going to recapitulate what is there in the bringing of new industries to the Gaeltacht and in many other ways. The Minister has covered that ground himself.  I should like to say something about what he cannot refer to so easily &mdash;he is, in any case, a modest man and would not refer to it if he could&mdash;to the fact that he has brought a new <Col N="751" /> spirit into this thing.  People have tended to make rather light of the amount of time this Minister for the Gaeltacht has spent in the Gaeltacht since he took office.  I have no exact statistics but I suspect that he has already spent more time in the Gaeltacht on official business than did all of his predecessors.  That may well be so.</P>
    <P>This Government showed their seriousness on this issue, a seriousness which does not go with flag-waving but with a realistic approach, by appointing a fulltime Minister for the Gaeltacht. I do not want to attack the Minister's predecessor&mdash;Deputy Colley is a man who does genuinely care about the Irish language&mdash;but the whole concept of making the Minister for Finance also the Minister for the Gaeltacht was supposed to have the effect of raising the Gaeltacht by putting it in with so important a Ministry. Of course, it had exactly the reverse effect because a Minister for Finance simply does not have time to be Minister for the Gaeltacht.  The last time we were debating this Estimate under the previous Government, the then Minister, through no fault of his own, was not even able to be here for that discussion.  That silence and absence speak for themselves.  I do not want to labour that either.</P>
    <P>But it was not just a question of appointing a fulltime Minister; we appointed the right Minister, the Minister who was not only prepared to spend so much time in the Gaeltacht and who so obviously likes spending so much time in the Gaeltacht&mdash;and that is very important too&mdash;but a man who is prepared to listen carefully, attentively, to what he hears from the people of the Gaeltacht and to try to bring the people of the Gaeltacht into running the affairs of the Gaeltacht, which is part of the principle underlying his approach to this Údaras na Gaeilge.  I think that is very good because there was a tendency&mdash;and I will not say just under the previous Government because it goes back a long way&mdash;to treat the Gaeltacht with a somewhat, let us say, colonial approach.  We sit here in Merrion <Col N="752" /> Street, Leinster House and so on and decide what is good for them.  Here is one Minister who did not do that.  He got out of Dublin, went to the Gaeltacht and listened to people.  He stayed with the people, enjoyed their society &mdash;and they know it&mdash;and there was a new, live contact with the Gaeltacht which he got going.  I know that this has greatly impressed a great many people and has made people, not only in relation to the Gaeltacht but people generally, feel that the whole subject is more &ldquo;for real&rdquo;, as young people say, or used to say&mdash;these things come in and out&mdash;than they felt it to be before.  Of course, if we believe that this time the promise of moving to the Gaeltacht is going to be delivered&mdash;I believe it firmly&mdash;that will be even more evidence of what he is doing.</P>
    <P>I should like to say a word about broadcasting policy.  As an introduction to what I want to say about broadcasting policy and the Irish language, I should like to say this: it has been suggested that there are divisions between myself and the Minister for the Gaeltacht.  Deputy Tunney made some points about that. I recognise some force in these points &mdash;the formulations that the Minister has used, the formulations I have used are not identical; you cannot bang one off the other and say: &ldquo;ah, ah&rdquo;. I should like to say two things about that&mdash;the formulations are not identical but the spirit of the approach is identical, or at least sufficiently in common for us to understand one another, and fully support one another. The other thing is this: there is a difference in area of responsibility. My cultural responsibility is a general one in relation to broadcasting policy; the Minister's is in relation to the Gaeltacht and the Irish language.  It is natural enough that, when a Minister for the Gaeltacht, speaking in Irish on his Estimate says &ldquo;ár gcultúir&rdquo; he is understood as referring to the culture of the Irish language and the Gaeltacht.  But, if I refer to &ldquo;our culture&rdquo;, I have to do so in consciousness not just of the Irish-speaking strand in it but of the English-speaking strand, of the fact that most of us here represent people, the overwhelming <Col N="753" /> majority of whom use English most of the time and that proclivity of theirs&mdash;which is very durable&mdash;is naturally reflected in broadcasting. Therefore, if the emphasis appears to differ to some extent, it is very largely due to that but, certainly, partly also due to the fact that we are both human beings and no two human beings in a one-party Government or in a Coalition Government, think exactly alike.  Therefore, if they are speaking sincerely on such subjects, there will be some element of divergence but a small one.  Certainly there is not a single thing that the Minister, Deputy Tom O'Donnell, has done that I do not wholeheartedly support and I also wholeheartedly support the entire spirit, style and character&mdash;and profoundly democratic character too&mdash;of his approach to this question.</P>
    <P>On broadcasting policy, I should like to get in a few points.  I know that time is running out.  It has been suggested, as I mentioned, that I want to reduce the time given to Irish in Broadcasting.  That is quite false and there is no justification for it in anything that I have said and there never has been.  However, it is a fact that I recognise that you cannot give very much more time in Irish, in broadcasting, until you are beginning to build up&mdash;and by other means&mdash;a wider demand for it.  There is no point in putting on programmes that people simply switch off.  The Controller of Broadcasting, Mr. Seán Mac Réamoinn, who has done a great deal to promote real interest in Irish, said he was not so much interested in more programmes or more time in Irish as in better programmes.  The heart of the matter is there because, if the programmes are better, they will begin to interest more people and, if they interest more people, then you can have more use of Irish, with people listening to Irish and watching Irish language programmes.  That is the problem and the heart of the matter.</P>
    <P>I should like to say something too, about the general philosophy of an approach to the Irish language within our culture.  Deputy Tunney talked well about this subject.  I think there <Col N="754" /> is a good deal of common ground between us; common ground between us although we are politically divided, and divided certainly very considerably in emphasis on this matter.  I do not want to exaggerate the common ground either.  There is more common ground between us than there is between us and another school of so-called Irish revivalists, those who do so on a kind of exclusivist basis, the kind of people who write &ldquo;Bas don Bearla&rdquo; on public walls.</P>

      <P>Separate details of the numbers of local authority houses completed within individual constituency areas are not available in my Department.  Returns submitted to my Department by Dublin County Council and Dún Laoghaire Corporation indicate that at 30th September, last the number of local authority houses completed since 1st September, 1973, in schemes in the general area of south-east Dublin was 166.  A total of 542 houses were under construction in that area at 30th September, 1974, and I understand that a further 23 houses had been completed by the 22nd of this month.  The housing authorities estimate that an additional 41 houses should be completed in the area before the end of the current year.

    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>The provision of traffic signs is a matter for each road authority, acting at the request or with the consent of the Garda Commissioner. I assume the Deputy's question relates to informative or directional signs.  Bord Fáilte operated a scheme for the provision of these signs to road authorities under the provisions of the Tourist Traffic Act, 1952, but in 1970 they took a decision to phase out this activity, on the grounds that they had completed the programme which they had undertaken. <Col N="760" /> I might add that the question of prescribing a new informative sign-posting system is under consideration in my Department.  In the meantime, I have, by circular letter, recently asked all local authorities to take whatever action is necessary to rectify deficiencies in the existing signs.</P>

    <Speaker pid="LorcanAllen" hpid="Mr. Allen Mr. Allen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Allen</NameTxt>

      <P>Why has there been such a long delay in deciding this issue, having regard to the fact that the work done by the town clerks was executed in a period prior to and shortly after the local elections that were held in June last?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy must be aware that for years, particularly during the periods of Fianna Fáil Government, the town clerks have been asking for this payment but so far a case has not been established that could be met.  At least the matter is now being discussed with the union concerned so as to ascertain whether there is a case for granting the payments. If it is found that payments should be granted, that course will be taken but if the findings are to the contrary, it follows that no such payments will be made.  At least we are doing something about the issue whereas Fianna Fáil did nothing about it for years.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ThomasJVMeaney" hpid="Mr. Meaney Mr. Meaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Meaney</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for the Public Service if he is aware that widows of civil servants whose husbands died prior to 1968 receive approximately one-quarter of their husbands' pension; and if he will have this rate updated in line with the present system.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Civil servants who retired or died prior to the introduction of the contributory widows' and children's pension scheme on 23 July, 1968, made no contribution towards pensions for their widows and accordingly were not members of that scheme.  Their widows do not, therefore, benefit from the scheme.</P>
      <P>A scheme of ex-gratia pensions was provided with effect from 1st October, 1969, for the widows of established civil servants who retired or died prior to 23rd July, 1968.  No contributions are charged and the benefit amounts to one-half of the pension which would have been payable under the contributory scheme.  As a widow in the contributory scheme receives one-half of her husband's actual or notional pension entitlement the benefit for an ex-gratia widow is, in all cases, one-quarter of that pension. The benefits are increased from time to time as the pension rates of retired civil servants increase.  The ex-gratia pensions were, for instance, increased by 9 per cent approximately with effect from July 1st last.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It was estimated, following an actuarial survey, that the capital cost as at 31st December, 1972, of bringing existing and future ex-gratia pensions for the Civil Service alone up to the level of the contributory pensions was £7,353,000.  Any concession to the Civil Service would have to be extended to the rest of the public service and this would raise the capital cost to approximately £22 million.  In terms of the current annual rate of expenditure on ex-gratia pensions in the public service, including the Civil Service, doubling the rate would entail <Col N="778" /> an extra annual charge of almost £2,200,000 on already over-burdened Exchequer resources.  In addition, there could be claims by other groups for compensatory concessions.</P>
    <P>When the results of the actuarial survey became available, the staff associations were asked for their comments on the question of existing members of the contributory scheme making higher contributions towards the cost of increasing ex-gratia pensions. The replies received did not indicate agreement to pay increased contributions.</P>
    <P>In all the circumstances I regret it has not been found possible to further improve the provisions of the ex-gratia pensions scheme.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>May I ask the Minister if, having regard to the fact, of which I am sure he is well aware, that the category of widow involved in this includes quite a number of people who are living in very difficult circumstances, he would consider or has considered that an approach to this matter might be based on the payment of some contribution by the people to benefit coupled with a formal guarantee or insurance to the Exchequer in respect of those who might die prematurely, guaranteeing the continuing payment of contributions to bring these people into the same position as those who are now benefiting?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>The capital sum to be paid by a widow to meet in full the cost of doubling her pension would depend on her age and the amount of her pension.  But if she paid on the basis of the husband's contributory scheme, 1 per cent of the husband's <Col N="779" /> salary at the rate applicable from 1st July, 1974, for each year of his service, which would be a maximum of 40 years, the amount paid would purchase as from the current date only the following proportions of the additional pension that would have been paid: at age 40, 39 per cent; at age 65, 51 per cent and at age 80, 70 per cent.  I think it would be a very bad bargain to make a contribution to purchase such an inadequate benefit.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, but the Minister will appreciate that a contribution situation could be worked out which would relate to payment of the additional pension from a current date rather than on the date on which the scheme commenced or on which the widows concerned would become entitled.  I certainly could not suggest across the floor of the House a detailed method by which this could be done but could I ask the Minister to have the matter further examined on the lines I have outlined to see if some kind of compromise arrangement would be possible?</P>

Any formula yet divised has had quite significant, and I think unacceptable consequences, but I shall certainly continue my search for a solution.</P>

      <P>Savings amounting to almost £6 million, or two-thirds of the additional allocation of £9 million capital for the local authority house purchase loans scheme, announced by the Minister for Local Government on 19th July last, have been identified over the range of Government spending programmes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As the Deputy is aware, expenditure allocations are kept under continual review over the course of the budget period and, from time to time, they may be varied in response to sectoral needs and resource availability. Because of the element of <Col N="782" /> seasonal fluctuation in these variations it is not the practice to give details of them in advance of the publication of actual expenditure figures at the end of the financial period.  The savings made available to finance the extra spending on house purchase loans have been integrated into the overall budgetary review process and I do not, therefore, propose to detail the individual expenditure headings involved.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>May I ask the Minister if he would agree that the relatively lengthy reply amounts to saying that either he does not know or cannot say what savings are involved?

    <Speaker pid="TimothyOConnor" hpid="Mr. O'Connor Mr. O'Connor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Connor</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Finance the steps taken to inject more capital into the building industry in order to maintain the same level of employment as in the past in the allied sectors as well as in the building trade itself.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>More money than ever before is being made available by the State for private enterprise housing, for expanding the local authority housing programme and to finance housing for workers in new or expanding industries and in Gaeltacht areas.  Furthermore, State investment in schools, hospitals, sanitary and environmental services and other building and construction works is at all time record levels.</P>
      <P>The public capital programme originally provided £18.7 million, or 46 per cent more under the heading &ldquo;Building and Construction&rdquo; for 1974-75 than was spent in the previous year.  This provision was significantly increased since then in regard to housing when the Government decided in July last to allocate an additional £9 million for the local authority house purchase loan scheme.  The total provision of £144.7 million for 1974-75 contrasts more than favourably with a provision of £81.7 million for 1972-73.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Public capital programme finance was further supplemented in August by the Associated Banks' loan of £5 million to enable the building societies to expand their commitments for house loans approvals.  The loan was arranged <Col N="784" /> by the Government through the Central Bank and carries an interest subvention and guarantee by the Exchequer.  It was in addition to the £6 million similarly provided in the period October, 1973, to June, 1974.</P>
    <P>As announced this month, the Government are continuing in operation until the end of 1974 the special temporary interest subsidy on building societies' shares and deposits.  This subsidy, which cost the Exchequer £2.4 million a year, is intended to encourage increased investment with building societies and at the same time to cushion borrowers from the societies against rising interest rates.  The Government have also this month relaxed the conditions attached to the making of house purchase loans by the building societies.  The various tax reliefs and interest subsidy afforded to building societies are currently costing the Exchequer £9 million annually.  Building society advances for the first nine months of this year amounted to £29.5 million and loan approvals in the same period to £31.3 million.</P>
    <P>In recent years assurance companies investment in housing had been on the decline.  I am glad to say, however, that as a result of approaches made to them there has been a 62 per cent improvement in their housing investment performance. Loans totalling £11.35 million were advanced by the companies in the year ended 30th June, 1974, compared with £7.04 million in the preceding year.  These measures will have the effect of stimulating the housing market with consequential beneficial effects on employment.</P>
    <P>The Government will continue to keep the employment situation in the industry under special review and will introduce such further supportive measures as may be considered necessary.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TimothyOConnor" hpid="Mr. O'Connor Mr. O'Connor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Connor</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware that it is the opinion of all people connected with the building trade that there will be a further 10,000 to 15,000 unemployed at the end of March, that is between the building, allied and general supply sectors?  Would the Minister take this into account and try to keep available the expertise we <Col N="785" /> have had down through the years until the building industry gets on its feet again?  There are far too many firms closing up at the moment and there will be more.  I would ask the Minister again to take that into consideration because&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy may be assured of the Government's continuing concern and active help for the construction industry.  The figures I have quoted clearly reflect this concern and the active support we are giving.  It is not in any way a diminution of our concern to point out that the decline in operations here is marginal compared with the massive decline that has occured in other countries like the United States, Britain, Germany and France, where the decline has been of gigantic proportions.  That we have been able to maintain the level of activity here is something which, I will not say we can be complacent about but, should give us confidence that we will be able to avoid the decline which has occurred elsewhere.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>Having regard to the fact that the rate of cost increase in the building industry is considerably in excess even of the general rate of inflation, would the Minister agree that quoting the amounts of money made available one year as against another is unrealistic, that it does not give a clear picture, and that a more accurate picture is got by having a look at the output.  In this connection is the Minister aware that the sales of cement have decreased at an increasing rate in the second and third quarters of this year as compared with the corresponding periods last year?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not saying for one moment that there are not difficulties. Of course there are difficulties, but they have to be looked at in the context of what is happening across the world at present.  Our performance here is unique compared with the very serious decline that has occurred in other economies in the western world. We have maintained a much higher level of activity than other economies <Col N="786" /> have.  I would accept what Deputy Colley says about the need to compare costs one year with another, but even bearing that in mind it is obvious that the injection which the Government have given, which is far beyond any previous contribution by a Government here, shows that the Government are actively concerned and are endeavouring to provide an injection here to maintain the level of this industry, because we accept the need to maintain it so that when money becomes more generally available at a lower cost than it is at the moment the industry will be able to go into full production again.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>Arising out of the Minister's reference to the situation in other countries, would he agree that in the building industry the vast bulk of the materials involved and, indeed, the amount of demand involved, is largely under our own control and, unlike other areas, is not dependent on what happens abroad? Would he further agree that the indication of a drop in cement sales to which I referred is a matter of serious concern and obviously does not relate to only one sector of the industry such as private housing?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I think the Deputy will accept that the decline, while it indicates a trend which is naturally one that causes us concern, is not substantial, particularly when one bears in mind that there were purchases last year of an exceptional and extraordinary kind which were out of pattern.  If this year's activity were to be compared with that of what might be regarded as a normal year it would be found that the sales this year were well above average.</P>

      <P>The Deputy is aware that it is the normal practice to comment on the broad implications of the Exchequer figures for the whole financial year in the annual budget statement.  I propose to adhere to this practice.  If, however, the Deputy puts down a question on a specific aspect of a particular Exchequer statement, I will endeavour to answer it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister agree that there is nothing at all in practice or precedent to prevent the Minister commenting on any unusual trends appearing in the figures in question?  Would he further agree that the figures in question, although he has not given them in this reply, would suggest an unusual trend in the buoyancy of revenue which he anticipated in April last year?  That being so, would he not consider it advisable, and perhaps valuable from his point of view, to comment on the implications of what the figures seem to suggest?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy knows well from his previous responsibility that it is not the practice to provide interim statements, and I see no good reason to depart from this well-established practice or non-practice. The budgetary policy this year was such as to give to the economy a boost in the latter part of the year when we expected a decline to develop due to circumstances beyond our control, and reflecting world trends. Therefore it would be quite wrong to assume that the pattern of a few months would necessarily be carried through for the full year.  When the full year's picture is available it will be appropriate to make comment.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Finance the amount of VAT that has been collected on sales of electricity for each quarter since 31st March, 1974.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>There are practical difficulties in furnishing the information sought by the Deputy for the following reasons:</P>
      <P>(1)  The returns furnished to the Revenue Commissioners by the Electricity Supply Board state the total receipts and tax from sales of electricity and of appliances and from contract work and installation and repair services carried out by the board.  Receipts from electricity sales would be included in the gross figures;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>(2)  In the value-added tax system <Col N="790" /> the tax invoiced by the board is deducted by registered traders from their own tax liability on goods or services.  Therefore the tax paid by the board is not the amount collected from electricity because part of it is subsequently credited by individual traders against their liability;</P>
    <P>(3)  Because of the two-monthly accounting system of VAT the receipts in one quarter of the year may bear little relation to the receipts in the following quarter.  For instance, in the June quarter the ESB made one payment in respect of transactions in March and April while in the September quarter two payments were made &mdash;one in July for the months of May and June and another in September for the months of July and August.</P>
    <P>During the six months ended 30th September, 1974, the ESB paid a total of £2.33 million in respect of VAT but, as I have explained, this is a gross figure which includes VAT borne by traders registered for VAT, and also the VAT in respect of sales of appliances, contract work, and so forth.  In addition, where the ESB itself incurs VAT payments in respect of purchases, the amount involved would be deducted by the board in paying over VAT to the Revenue Commissioners.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>When value-added tax was introduced in November, 1972, all medicines were subject to the tax.  In September, 1973, when food was being zero-rated it was considered necessary to extend the zero-rating to oral medicines as it was not practicable to distinguish between certain oral medicines and foods.</P>
      <P>Value-added tax is essentially a broad-based tax on the consumption of the general public.  It is therefore necessary that the extent of zero-rating be limited; otherwise the purpose of the tax would be eroded substantially.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Finance if he will give details of each visit to a foreign country undertaken since 31st March, 1974, including the overall cost of such visit and the advantage for this country arising therefrom.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>In the period since 31st March, 1974, I have made six visits to foreign countries at an overall net cost of £196.  The details are as follows: to The Hague from 21st April to 23rd April for a meeting of EEC Finance Ministers at a cost of £116, to Luxembourg on 6th June for a meeting of EEC Finance Ministers at a cost of £119, to Washington from 11th June to 13th June for a meeting of the Committee of 20 of the International Monetary Fund at a cost of £418, to Brussels from 14th July to 15th July for a meeting of EEC Finance Ministers at a cost of £100, to Brussels from 15th September, to 16th September for a meeting of EEC Finance Ministers at a cost of £133, and to Washington from 28th September to 4th october for the annual general meeting of the International Monetary Fund at a cost of £910.  The total cost of these visits was £1,796 of which £1,600 has been or will be recouped from the EEC or the IMF as appropriate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My visits abroad have arisen principally out of Ireland's membership of the EEC and other international organisations. Attendance at meetings of the Council of Finance Ministers is an obligation and a privilege of EEC membership.  The benefits of attendance cannot always be quantified but as a minimum these meetings are a valuable source of information on Community economic, financial and monetary problems and on similar problems in the other member states and the likely <Col N="794" /> effects in both cases on this country. There is also the opportunity of ensuring that the Irish viewpoint gets a fair hearing and that where contributions to the Community budget or otherwise are involved Irish circumstances are taken into account.  To give a specific example of benefit I mention the loans obtained from the European Investment Bank which constitute a very welcome source of finance to this country.</P>
    <P>The position is similar as regards the International Monetary Fund, the Committee of 20 on International Monetary reform and the World Bank whose meetings I have attended.  My contacts with the International Monetary Fund and the Committee of 20 have been most useful in providing information on the trend of international monetary developments.  This country has obtained a number of loans from the World Bank which as well as being a supplemental source of development finance is also a source of up-to-date technical expertise in different fields.</P>
    <P>The Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Finance made two visits to foreign countries during the period in question, one to Vienna from 19th June to 3rd July for a Joint Conference of the International Federation of Landscape Architects (IFLA) and the International Federation of Park and Recreation Administration (IFPRA) at a cost of £593 and the other to Brussels from 24th September for an EEC Finance Ministers Meeting to discuss the Community Budget for 1975, at which he represented me, at a cost of £134 of which £74 was recouped from the EEC.  The main advantages of attendance at the IFLA/IFPRA Conference were that it enabled the Parliamentary Secretary to keep abreast of park developments in other countries, to meet colleagues engaged on similar work elsewhere and to benefit from their experience.</P>

Is he fully satisfied that as the building now stands it is possible to improve it adequately to accommodate the gardaí who are there?  Is the Parliamentary Secretary aware that even before the additional security which involved doubling the number of gardaí in the town the accommodation was completely inadequate and it cannot be made adequate by the provision of these additional prefabricated buildings which, in their own way, are accepted as not being adequate?

      <Col N="807" /> The cause of flooding in the Clonown area of County Westmeath arises from the inadequacy of the river channel between Athlone and Meelick.  In order to give maximum relief at flood periods the sluices at Athlone are always fully closed while the sluices at Meelick and Keelogue are fully opened. I am satisfied that there is adequate co-ordination in the exercise of the controls by the ESB and the Commissioners of Public Works.</P>

      <NameTxt>Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries (Mr. M.P. Murphy)</NameTxt>
      <P>With the permission of the Ceann Comhairle, I propose to take Questions Nos. 58 to 68, together.  I am aware that there are record numbers of cattle on farms at present and that many small farmers have been unable to sell them at reasonable prices.  In many cases these farmers are unable to provide feeding stuffs from their own resources to carry their stock over the winter.  This problem is not confined to any one area but is most acute in counties west of the Shannon and in some midland counties.</P>
      <P>To meet this exceptional situation I am introducing a scheme of short-term loans at a very low interest rate to enable the farmers concerned to buy feeding stuffs to enable them to carry their cattle over the winter. These loans will be confined to farmers whose rateable valuation on land does not exceed £50.  Under the scheme an eligible farmer will be able to borrow up to a maximum of £500 at an interest rate of 4-5 per cent which will be repayable after a period of six months, or if the cattle are sold, before the termination of that period.  The scheme is, of course, subject to clearance by the EEC Commission which I hope to get very shortly.</P>
      <P>I would also like to refer to the recent agreement by the meat processors to create a fund to be used to assist small farmers to buy feeding stuffs at reduced prices.</P>
      <P>I am in principle opposed to additional national aids for agriculture. They are calculated to lead to counter action by other members of the EEC which are better placed to undertake such aids.  In any event I am satisfied that the measures I have referred to will relieve cases of real hardship.  I am also satisfied that the provision of credit is an appropriate measure to this end.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TimothyOConnor" hpid="Mr. O'Connor Mr. O'Connor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Connor</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Parliamentary Secretary aware that it is next to impossible for the type of small farmer who needs assistance to borrow money and that even in the process of borrowing, if he is able to, it takes so <Col N="810" /> long that any help that may come will be of no assistance to him?  It is necessary to import large quantities of grain and this should be subsidised. The cattle people believe that up to £100 million worth of cattle are in danger this year because we have not the food or the quality of food available to feed them.  There is a necessity for immediate aid by way of subsidy and I ask the Parliamentary Secretary to convey this to the Minister and the Government.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelPatMurphy" hpid="Mr. M.P. Murphy Mr. M.P. Murphy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M.P. Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister has already dealt with this question sympathetically.  As indicated in the course of my reply, the Minister is making available to small farmers loans of up to £500 through the Agricultural Credit Corporation and the State is subsidising the interest rate by 8 per cent.  In my view this is a very reasonable gesture and coupled with the aids that can be secured through the meat exporters' levy of 1p per lb to help in the purchase of feedingstuffs both should measure up to the special requirements that exist at present.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TimothyOConnor" hpid="Mr. O'Connor Mr. O'Connor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Connor</NameTxt>
      <P>May I convey to the Parliamentary Secretary that the opportunity of borrowing further money for people who have already borrowed from the Agricultural Credit Corporation is practically nil?  This is the message I am trying to get across. As far as we know, anything up to 6,000 cattle are doomed to die in Kerry this year alone.  I would ask the Parliamentary Secretary again to convey to the Minister the urgency of this and the necessity of trying to subsidise feedingstuffs.  First, you have to get the material in and it would take so long to arrange loans the material would not be in the country in time to save those cattle.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelPatMurphy" hpid="Mr. M.P. Murphy Mr. M.P. Murphy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M.P. Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>I am satisfied that the Agricultural Credit Corporation will deal with such applications sympathetically.  The proposed loans will not extend over a period of more than six months.  The interest rates will be somewhere in the region of 4-5 per cent so far as the farmer is concerned, as the State is bearing the <Col N="811" /> greater burden of 8 per cent.  I am well aware of the anxiety of the Deputies who tabled the 11 questions being replied to and of the position of small farmers who are anxious to hold on to young cattle until, possibly next March or April in the hope that prices will improve.  I know it is difficult for farmers in Counties Kerry and Galway and in the other counties represented by the Deputies who have tabled questions.  However, as indicated in the reply, I think the Minister's aids&mdash;the maximum £500 loan together with the meat exporter's levy of 1p in the £ further to help in the provision of feedingstuffs&mdash;must be taken in conjunction with the direct payments to many of these farmers from the Exchequer.  The reason I mentioned direct payments is because in several of the questions, Deputies asked for direct payments from the Exchequer to the farmers themselves. Many farmers in such areas are already in receipt of direct payments from the Exchequer and such payments were increased substantially within the past 17 or 18 months. Therefore, such payments, together with the aids mentioned in the reply&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>This is a most important item so far as the small farmers are concerned.  I should like to ask three or four questions together and I hope the Leas-Cheann Comhairle will allow me some time on them.  Might I ask the Parliamentary Secretary if he is aware that the <Col N="812" /> majority of farmers involved in the over-stocking of cattle are already working on borrowed money?  Is he aware that he is putting a further millstone around the necks of those farmers if they borrow further, even at a low interest rate?  Is he further aware that if, say, three farmers go to buy feedingstuffs with borrowed money&mdash;unless the Minister implements the suggestion contained in Deputy O'Connor's Question, No. 59 &mdash;at a market where feedingstuff is now £60 per ton, it will automatically go to £100 per ton immediately? Therefore, it will go beyond their means.  I hope the Parliamentary Secretary is aware of this because there is no use fooling ourselves; the stuff just is not there at present unless money is got somewhere and that is why these questions are so important. The Parliamentary Secretary spoke about increases in social welfare.  He is right up to a point because it is a sad thing&mdash;and the Parliamentary Secretary is aware of it&mdash;that so many of our farmers are on social welfare at present.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M.P. Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>As I indicated, the Minister is well aware of the hardship on farmers, by virtue of the recession in prices, particularly of small cattle.  Of course, it is no harm to state here that such reductions in the prices of small cattle are in no way due to internal circumstances but to the external circumstances referred to here by the Minister for Finance in the course of replies to questions earlier today.  Deputy Callanan is assuming that all small farmers have to borrow money and that they are all in the red, so to speak.  I do not agree with him in that respect.  I am particularly mindful of small farmers &mdash;possibly as much as is any other Deputy here&mdash;but we shall leave that question for the moment.  This is a <Col N="813" /> help on the part of the State to those farmers who, as indicated in the reply, are anxious to hold on to their cattle for six months longer.</P>

      <P>I indicated, that they are likely to get a sympathetic hearing from the Agricultural Credit Corporation.  Now the State is subsidising the loans to the extent of 8 per cent.  I think that is reasonably generous, particularly if Deputies Callanan and O'Connor take into account that, once we were approved as a member of the EEC, national aids and subsidies to agriculture were to disappear.  That was one of the main advantages.  At a time when there is a general world depression&mdash;one need not say a European depression&mdash;the Minister is making a special gesture so far as the small farmers are concerned. I ask Deputies to accept the good faith of that gesture and, if there is a change in circumstances, the position undoubtedly will be reviewed by the Minister because he is most sympathetically disposed towards the small farmers.</P>

      <P>The Parliamentary Secretary speaks of short-term loans of £500 but, if he knows anything about farming he must know that £500 would not buy many cattle or very much hay at present.  Hay is bringing in £1 per bale at present.  On a short-term loan of six months&mdash;the maximum about which the Parliamentary Secretary was speaking&mdash;if the farmer were feeding his stock hay alone, the animals would be emerging with the hair standing on their backs; certainly, next March or April they would not be in a fit condition to be sold on the open market.</P>

      <P>With the permission of the Cheann Comhairle, I propose to take Questions Nos. 70 to 74, inclusive, together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="819" /> The meat factories generally are working to capacity with all-time record slaughterings, but there is an excess of cattle offering at this peak stage of the season.  I expect the position to improve in the months ahead as the peak season passes and having regard to factors such as the rising rate of minimum price assured by the meat factories to the end of January, the increase in the EEC slaughter premium up to the end of February and the steps being taken to assist farmers in the matter of feed supplies for over-wintering cattle.</P>
    <P>Apart from the assured minimum prices which I have referred to, the prices at which cattle are bought by meat factories is a matter for settlement between the factories and the sellers.</P>
    <P>The purpose of the EEC slaughter premium is to encourage the orderly marketing of slaughter cattle.  My Department requires proof from the factories and home slaughterers, through which the scheme is operated, that the premium has been paid to the sellers in addition to the market price.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanCrinion" hpid="Mr. Crinion Mr. Crinion">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Crinion</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Parliamentary Secretary aware that some factories are paying to the farmers a slaughter premium of 24p to 26p per lb. and are then putting all the cattle into intervention at 35p a lb?  Would he not agree that they are thereby making exorbitant profits?  I am aware that the factories are making a profit of up to £50 per head in respect of every beast killed in the factories.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Crinion</NameTxt>
      <P>If the Parliamentary Secretary will peruse the official returns that were published in the papers a couple of weeks ago in relation to the percentage of the killings that went into intervention he will see that the figure was between 95 and 98 per cent.  The farmers who supplied these cattle to the factories received only a slaughter premium of between 22p and 25p per lb. but all the beef went into intervention.  Would the Parliamentary Secretary not agree that the factories should have paid the intervention price for the cattle?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M.P. Murphy</NameTxt>

      <P>My question was to ask the Minister whether he would intervene in the present crisis that has arisen because of the factories refusing cattle.  The Parliamentary Secretary has stated that the farmers control 45 per cent of the factories. That is of no significance.  The factories are controlled by a crowd of what I would call new-breed dealers or the new FF&mdash;by that I do not mean Fianna Fáil but factory favourites. These are a crowd of gangsters. I know of one of them who took 15 cows from a local mart and put them into a factory and who boasted within a couple of days that his profit on the deal amounted to £450 or £30 per head.</P>

It is not often that I lend my voice to the various topics that are being discussed here&mdash;be they mining or otherwise&mdash; but this is one occasion on which I must speak out.  I assure the Parliamentary Secretary that at present one might as well send a mad dog to a factory gate as to send a cattle producer. These factories are sending their agents to the marts.  They are robbing the farmers.</P>

There is only one family factory in this country and that is owned by a decent family, the Lyons of Longford, and they are taking cattle from the producers.

When I say a short period I mean within three or four weeks.  One big meat processing firm, who also own a mart, made it quite clear that they buy 20 per cent of their intake through the marts.

      <P>While there are of course a number of imponderables in the situation, I am confident that the prospects for cattle/beef next Spring should be reasonably good, assuming that the present sensible EEC policy of curtailing third country imports is continued as long as I believe it should be and as I shall certainly press for.  Other factors that will help are those mentioned in my reply to other questions today by Deputies H. Gibbons, Callanan, MacSharry, Sheridan and Crinion.</P>

      <P>Neither the cattle population nor the national breeding herd are expected to be permanently affected by the increase in cow slaughterings this year, which is essentially of a short-term nature arising primarily from the very low culling rates of the past two years.

      <P>asked the Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries if his Department will pay compensation to a farmer (name supplied) in County Meath whose cows have become infected with ergot; or whether this farmer will qualify for any low-interest loans on the ground that ergot is a rare disease which farmers are not aware of and are unable to recognise in rye grass.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelPatMurphy" hpid="Mr. M.P. Murphy Mr. M.P. Murphy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M.P. Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>My Department do not operate any scheme of compensation or loans at a subsidised interest rate which would cover a case of this kind.  The herdowner should be advised to get in touch with the Agricultural Credit Corporation Ltd. to ascertain whether he would qualify for any of the facilities which they offer.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrendanCrinion" hpid="Mr. Crinion Mr. Crinion">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Crinion</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Parliamentary Secretary not agree that this is a very rare disease and one that the Department have never notified farmers in the public Press to be aware of?  In view of the hardship on this farmer, losing ten cattle from his herd, would the Minister consider giving a grant or a low-interest loan so as to help him over this difficult period?</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelPatMurphy" hpid="Mr. M.P. Murphy Mr. M.P. Murphy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M.P. Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>Fortunately ergot is a rare disease, possibly so rare that it is not scheduled to be dealt with under the Diseases of Animals Act.  It is unfortunate that this man's herd was affected and the only suggestion that could be made is that he should try to get help from the ACC.</P>

      <P>While I have discretion, under the Motor Vehicles (Registration of Importers) Act, 1968, which regulates the importation of new and used motor vehicles, to authorise the importation of a motor vehicle by a non-registered person, the grant of such facilities is confined to special cases.  These are normally cases involving permanent change of residence. As the Act was introduced to protect the motor vehicle assembly industry I would not be prepared to exercise my discretion by extending such facilities to allow the importation of used diesel landrovers by non-registered persons.</P>

      <P>The person referred to by the Deputy was not qualified for payment <Col N="840" /> of disability benefit on his Irish insurance record at the date of his claim.  As he had also worked in England inquiries were made to the British Ministry of Health and Social Security regarding his insurance contributions there so as to determine if these contributions would qualify him on his claim.  Details of his British insurance which qualified him for benefit were received in my Department on 24th October, 1974, and payment of the amount of disability benefit due on the medical certificates received was issued to him on 25th October, 1974.</P>

      <P>Representations have not been made to my Department that there is a general shortage of text books, although it may happen that there may be a temporary shortage in the case of individual text books due to publishing delays.</P>
      <P>School text books are provided through the activities of the various private commercial publishing companies. In the case of prescribed text material close liaison exists between my Department and the publishers so as to ensure an adequate and timely supply of text books.  With regard to non-prescribed material teachers are free to choose from a wide range of publications.  This freedom of choice is essential both for teacher and pupil. Therefore, any general control or direction regarding the production of text books would be undesirable.</P>
