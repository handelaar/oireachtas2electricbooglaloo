      <NameTxt>Mr. Andrews</NameTxt>
      <P>Last night I was speaking about Garda Síochána cars and the necessity to have proper squad cars.  I made my point at some considerable length and it is important <Col N="742" /> that it should be on the record of the House.  I also mentioned the condition of Garda stations.  The Minister in his speech revealed that the Garda Commissioner has furnished him with a rather horrifying figure in the matter of Garda stations.  He said that 150 new stations are needed immediately, in other words 150 existing stations need replacement immediately.  In addition, he mentioned a figure of 250 in need of major repair.  We expect the best from the Garda Síochána. Therefore we must give them every help.  To do their job well they must have proper working conditions.  We in this House must be open to some criticism when the Minister can produce from the Commissioner a figure of 150 Garda stations in need of replacement and 250 in need of major repair.  They are telling figures.  It is not fair to have people in any area of endeavour in this community working in such conditions.  I have some small experience of the William Street Garda Station in Limerick.  This is a deplorable station.  How we can expect people to live in and work from that station is beyond my comprehension. The Minister has indicated that he intends to have it-replaced.</P>
      <P>I see that the building programme is to cost £2½ million over the next five years.  I consider that the programme should be dealt with immediately and that a five-year period is too long.  It should be cut down to two or certainly three years at the very most.  I know there are other problems which could necessitate the extension of the building programme to five years but I would urge the Minister to re-consider the possibility of cutting down the Garda station building programme to three years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister told us that contracts have been placed for major improvement schemes to Enniskerry and Naas Garda stations and that schemes have been approved for Finglas, Mountjoy and Whitehall Garda stations in the Dublin area and for the Garda stations in Mullingar, Lusk, Cabinteely and Ballyconnell and for MacCurtain Street in Cork.  I hope the MacCurtain Street station will be dealt with <Col N="743" /> urgently and that the Watercourse Road station in Cork will also be dealt with.  I note that the Minister has not mentioned the Watercourse Road one.  Perhaps he would take that one into consideration.  Cabinteely Garda station in my constituency is representative of the Garda stations that are in need of replacement or improvement.  This one is certainly in need of replacement.  Cabinteely Garda station is a disgrace.  There are 25 or 30 gardaí operating from that station.  The Garda Síochána must have, in the interests of the community, the best possible accommodation.</P>
    <P>Another matter which concerns me is the rates of pay.  My information is that a garda reaches the maximum in nine years and that this is bad in comparison with other similar endeavours in the public service.  I know it is harmful to make comparisons but I have an example of the type of comparison that could be drawn.  In my view gardaí are asked to wait too long to reach the maximum.  We believe it should be reached in six years.</P>
    <P>The Minister mentioned the Sunningdale communiqué and the matter of the police authority under the Council of Ireland.  We would refer specifically to the part of the Minister's speech where he says he has been in constant consultation and will be in constant consultation, with the Garda Síochána in connection with the setting up of a police authority.  We welcome the setting up of a police authority.  We cannot over-emphasise the need for the Minister and his public servants to keep in constant contact with the Garda Síochána until a full police authority has emerged. Unfortunately, the Minister, in his speech, did not set out his own thinking as to the type of police authority he would wish for; perhaps he was limited by the fact that the matter has not resolved itself fully yet and that he has to do considerable research into the matter of a police force for this part of the country.  He may be restricted by lack of full knowledge.</P>
    <P>This is fair enough; it is not said by way of criticism; one has to glean <Col N="744" /> experience from the experience of others and the Minister, I am sure, is searching out that experience.  My information is that some of his own civil servants may have gone to Britain. If so, I would ask the Minister to set out what investigations are being conducted into police authorities elsewhere. To my own knowledge, there is a figure of 84 police authorities in Britain, in England and Wales.  Scotland have their own special position having regard to the form of law they have there which is distinct in many respects from the common law system in England and Wales.  Therefore, I would ask the Minister particularly to take account of our concern on the matter of the setting up of a police authority.</P>
    <P>The Garda Síochána, unlike the RUC, enjoy the total public support of this part of the country and, indeed, in public relations.  It must be made clear that any new authority will strengthen the Garda and that they should be fully consulted at every stage in its development.  We believe that the setting up of a police authority provides an opportunity for an examination of the structure of the force, as recommended by the Conroy Report and, in particular, its relationship with the Department of Justice. I would refer the Minister to the Conroy Report which, in addition to reporting on remuneration&mdash;which is a rather long word for the word &ldquo;pay&rdquo;&mdash;and conditions of service of the Garda Síochána made other comments. This was a report presented to the then Minister for Justice in January, 1970.  In fairness to the outgoing Minister for Justice, much of what is in the report has been implemented to the satisfaction of the Garda but there are a number of points which remain to be implemented and which the present Minister might implement.</P>
    <P>Going back to the matter of the police authority and examining the relationship between the Department of Justice and the Garda, I do not wish in any way to criticise either the Garda or the Department of Justice, but, going through the agreed communiqué following the conference <Col N="745" /> between the Irish and British Governments at Sunningdale on the 6th, 7th, 8th and 9th December, 1973, one detects, reading that in conjunction with the Conroy Report, a thread indicative of a need for some type of separation between the Department of Justice and the Garda Síochána. We believe the Garda Síochána could be left to themselves to a greater extent, at all times subject&mdash;need I say, and the gardaí would agree with me, as, indeed, I know would the Minister for Justice&mdash;to Dáil Éireann and to the control of Dáil Éireann. Nevertheless, there is that thread, that suggestion, going through anything I have read in the last six to nine months of a need, a desire or a wish to separate the inter-dependence between the Department of Justice and the Garda Síochána.</P>
    <P>I have no personal experience of the Department of Justice or great experience of the Garda Síochána; the Minister has me at a disadvantage in that respect.  He has been Minister for Justice for a year.  My friend and colleague, Deputy O'Malley, was the Minister for Justice for three years. They would be more experienced in relation to first hand workings of the Department.  Anyway, I think to criticise public officials is rather a cowardly form of effort by public representatives and any criticism that might have to be made of public officials, by Dáil or, indeed, Oireachtas representatives, should be directed at the Minister of that Department.  It is not my intention to pillory any body or group of individuals in public, quite the contrary; anything I would say would be I hope considered to be constructive.</P>
    <P>To come back to the Conroy Report and this thread that runs through it and other reports on the matter of the separation of the inter-dependence between the Garda Síochána and the Department of Justice, having concluded on the matter of pay and conditions the learned judge and his colleagues on the commission felt constrained to add a final paragraph which was, in fact, outside their terms of reference and it was an extremely important paragraph.  It is paragraph 1266 and it reads as follows:</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="746" /> We would be failing in our duty to the Minister if we did not strongly urge that an examination be carried out by appropriately qualified people into the role, organisation and personnel policy of the Force and, in particular, its relationship with the Department of Justice.</P>
    <P>It goes on to say, in paragraph 1267, sub-paragraphs (a), (b) and (c):</P>
    <P>For example:</P>
    <P>(a)  There was evidence of an unclear definition of roles as between the Department of Justice and the Garda Síochána.  Specifically, there was a vagueness, causing uncertainty and ineffectiveness, about the relationship between the Department and the Commissioner. There seemed to us to be a lack of delegation from the Department to the Force.  This lack of delegation permeated the Force.  Authority&mdash; particularly in relation to financial resources&mdash;was not commensurate with responsibility, causing an unhealthy &ldquo;them and us&rdquo; attitude.</P>
    <P>(b)  There was no comprehensive planning based on research.  No one was specifically charged with this function.  The result was reaction to circumstances and <i>ad hoc</i> decision making.</P>
    <P>(c)  There was no clear personnel policy.  We found it disturbing that, in a Force of this size, there was no one with specific responsibility for developing an on-going personnel policy, including training and retraining.</P>
    <P>The Minister mentioned in his Estimate speech the matter of Garda training and his concern that the training is not comprehensive enough.  As I understand it, the new Garda recruit goes to the Garda training centre for 18 months of his training.  He then goes out into the world for 12 months and returns after that period for phase two of his training which, I believe, is four weeks.  I understand that at the moment phase two is not being operated.  This is a matter for concern and the Minister in fairness, has expressed concern and we share it.  The Garda recruits should <Col N="747" /> have a full training programme that should not be interrupted.</P>
    <P>However, I will return to the Conroy report.  Paragraph 1268 states:</P>
    <P>These are some of the areas requiring further examination.  They are akin to the weaknesses found in the Public Service as a whole by the Devlin Group.</P>
    <P>The Minister's Estimate speech is literally littered with commissions, working parties and consultations with this, that, or the other person.  If the Minister is in that form, he might consider taking into account the observation in the Conroy report where they said they would be failing in their duty if they did not bring to the attention of the Minister the matters expressed by them.  Would the Minister consider calling for an examination by appropriately qualified people into the role, organisation and personnel policy of the force and in particular its relationship with the Department of Justice?  The Minister might consider the possibility of setting up such a body.  Perhaps now is not the proper time to do so having regard to the delicate security position.  Perhaps it is not appropriate to urge the Minister to take immediate action and thus upset the security situation in any respect.  All we are asking for is an examination as recommended in the Conroy report. It is not an unreasonable request.  I believe that the Garda Síochána and the Department of Justice would welcome such an examination.  It would clear the air.</P>
    <P>In addition to the proposed Police Authority under the Council of Ireland, as suggested in the Sunningdale communiqué, this examination must, and should take place.  Will members of the Garda Síochána be on the Police Authority?  The Minister might give us some idea in his reply. The problem in regard to his speech is that it is vague in certain areas.  It is not fair to the Members of this House when the Minister does not come clean on matters of national importance.  The community relies on the Garda Síochána for security as, <Col N="748" /> indeed, it does on the Defence Forces. Forces.</P>
    <P>The Police Authority is referred to at paragraph 15 of the Sunningdale communiqué:</P>
    <P>With a view to improving policing throughout the island and developing community identification with and support for the police services, the governments concerned will cooperate under the auspices of a Council of Ireland through their respective police authorities.  To this end, the Irish Government would set up a Police Authority, appointments to which would be made after consultation with the Council of Ministers of the Council of Ireland.  In the case of the Northern Ireland Police Authority, appointments would be made after consultation with the Northern Ireland Executive, which would consult with the Council of Ministers of the Council of Ireland.  When the two Police Authorities are constituted, they will make their own arrangements to achieve the objectives set out above.</P>
    <P>Paragraph 16 goes on:</P>
    <P>An independent complaints procedure for dealing with complaints against the police will be set up.</P>
    <P>We will support the Government in this matter of the Police Authority, if the Sunningdale communiqué comes to fruition.  We have expressed concern about a number of items in the communiqué, but I am dealing specifically with the Police Authority. It is the Minister's function, and our function in Opposition, to present the Garda case clearly and their reaction to paragraph 15 and 16 of the Sunningdale communiqué.</P>
    <P>The new <i>Garda Review</i> is an excellent magazine.  I should like to be associated with the welcome extended to this informed and informative magazine.  It is very helpful to those who are concerned with the running of and up to date information on the Garda Síochána.  Its editorial reported in <i>The Irish Press</i> on 23rd January, 1974&mdash;I have not a copy of the magazine but I have <i>The Irish Press</i>&mdash;<Col N="749" /> stated under the heading &ldquo;Sunningdale: Garda Caution&rdquo;:</P>
    <P>The setting up of a police authority for the Garda Síochána, as outlined in the Sunningdale communiqué, is described in the current issue of the <i>Garda Review</i> as &ldquo;the most important development&rdquo; since the foundation of the force.</P>
    <P>The editorial says that under the terms of the Sunningdale Agreement the gardaí will in some measure be answerable to the new Council of Ireland, as will the RUC, and that this will bring the two forces considerably closer than they have traditionally been.  Moreover, the Garda will henceforth be administered in a different way with the creation of the proposed new police authority.</P>
    <P>&ldquo;It is important,&rdquo; the editorial continues, &ldquo;that the Garda should not lose its lead in its relationship with the community and that it should not find itself cast in the role of a gendarmerie or a frontier militia.</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Brought to its essentials this means that the Garda Síochána does not want to assume the functions which circumstances thrust upon their counterparts in the North.  Nor does the Garda Síochána want to be an armed police force.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The concept of the unarmed city policeman has been one of the most valuable achievements of the State, says the editorial, and the future of the Garda and the role it will play in the Ireland of tomorrow will be decided within the next few weeks.</P>
    <P>The &ldquo;next few weeks&rdquo; have come and gone and no decision has been reached.  The Minister may have further information on the police authority and other matters to which he will refer in his reply</P>
    <P>To conclude the general reference on the matter of the Sunningdale communiqué and the reaction of the editorial of the <i>Garda Review</i>, that editorial pointed out that the Conroy Commission reported that any structural improvements which bettered the efficiency of the force and brought <Col N="750" /> them closer to the people must be welcomed.  One hopes that the Government will take advantage of the opportunity offered by a re-structuring to put right some of the wrongs pointed out by Conroy.  I have mentioned some of the wrongs which the Conroy Commission wish the Government to correct.</P>
    <P>When large numbers of Garda are called up for security operations, and the Heath visit exemplified this, there is a total lack of co-ordination between the Department of Justice and the Garda as to the treatment of the gardaí on such duty.  On the occasion of Mr. Heath's visit a number of the gardaí on duty at Baldonnel were left without food and in some instances but for the generosity of the local community in that area they would have been left without food for 24 hours.  This is not good enough.  We feel the Government have taken note of that first example of a breakdown, not in relation to security because the gardaí did their duty on that day, but in relation to the manner in which they were asked to perform their duty.  Proper arrangements must be made for the comfort of gardaí on such duties and proper and regular meals must be provided.</P>
    <P>On the question of crime the Minister in his speech indicated that the Commissioner in his report stated that indictable offences rose in 1972 from 37,781 to 39,327, an increase of 3.8 per cent.  At the same time detection fell from 45.9 per cent to 43.4 per cent, and Dublin was as low as 33.7 per cent.  Special efforts must be made to increase the detection rate and to put a half to the growing violence in Dublin city and county in particular. The Minister stated that he is inducting 500 new recruits and he should consider stationing the bulk of these recruits in the Dublin area.</P>
    <P>There may be reasons why they should not be stationed in Dublin but the general crime pattern in the city is on the increase.  Crimes of violence in the city are also on the increase, a fact which is confirmed by the Commissioner's report.  Consequently, more gardaí should be on the beat on <Col N="751" /> the streets of Dublin.  This should be treated as a matter of urgency.  In this respect the Minister might tell the House how his recruiting campaign is progressing.  We wish his campaign well.  The Minister's colleague, the Minister for Defence, is never slow to tell us how his campaign is progressing. We wish the campaign for recruits to the Garda and the Defence Forces well.</P>
    <P>The Minister also dealt with the question of prisons.  In my view the Minister is to be congratulated for allowing journalists into the prisons so that they could see first-hand what goes on in them.  Much of the response to the Minister's invitation to journalists to visit the prisons was not that great but their criticism was undoubtedly constructive.  I am sure the Minister did not expect to receive 100 per cent praise for the conditions of the prisons, quite the contrary, but his decision to invite these journalists to visit the prisons was a good one. Before the Minister took that decision he had anticipated a question of mine on the possibility of allowing journalists to gain first-hand knowledge of the prison conditions through visitation. They gained first-hand knowledge and it was proper that they should have done so.</P>
    <P>I should now like to refer to an examination of the penal system which was conducted by the Community Development Division of the Department of Psychiatry of University College, Dublin.  Before going into detail on the report I should like to state that the Fianna Fáil Social and Individual Rights group visited prisons.  We saw Mountjoy, St. Patrick's Institution and the women's prison.  As I understand it, the women's prison in the complex we know as Mountjoy is a wing of St. Patrick's Institution.  In addition to that I visited Shanganagh Castle on a number of occasions.  I did not have the opportunity of visiting Portlaoise Prison, through no fault of the Minister. On one occasion I was asked, for good and sufficient reason, to postpone my visit but I should like the Minister to re-activate his invitation to me so <Col N="752" /> that I can visit that prison at some time convenient to him and the prison authority.</P>
    <P>Some concern is being expressed about the possibility of the Kilbarrack project for a women's prison not being carried out.  The political antennae are up in this respect and for this reason the Minister should assure the House that this project will go ahead and that this prison will be sited there. The condition of the women's prison in Mountjoy leaves a lot to be desired. In fairness to the prison officers, male and female, they keep the place spotless, but the buildings are not up to the standard of what is required in a modern prison.  That is why we want an undertaking that the Kilbarrack project will be completed urgently.</P>
    <P>Apparently, the group in UCD had some difficulty in obtaining information from the Minister and his Department.  In their report they state that their main problem was that the Minister and his Department did not co-operate in any way with their efforts.  They state that they wrote, having received an acknowledgment of their first letter, on several occasions but none of their letters was acknowledged.  The report mentions a number of officials communicated with in relation to this matter but I am not going to mention these officials because it is not my practice to do so.  The report goes on to state that because of this lack of co-operation they were unable to interview many of those working in the different services provided in the prisons, including chaplains, governors, welfare officers and prison doctors.  They concluded by pointing out that they were unable to see for themselves the accommodation in any of the prisons.  There was a limitation on the report but it must be read in the context of what this group of people state at page 4 where they say that the very closed system which they encountered between the Department and the Minister imposed severe limitations on their research and that they were forced to piece together a picture of the prison process from accounts of people who experienced that process in a different capacity.  The report says that an endeavour <Col N="753" /> was made thoroughly to cross-check all the information received.  No doubt there are inaccuracies in the report but it was an effort by people who are obviously concerned to set out for the benefit of the community a clear and concise if not, through no fault of their own, entirely accurate report of the whole area of the penal system.</P>
    <P>Having regard to the group's limitations the attempt was a fair one and the document produced is very helpful if for no other reason than that it indicates clearly, by its headings and paragraphs, the various areas of the penal system.  It sets out also the number of prisons in Ireland and brings together, in booklet form, the whole essence of the penal system. For all of that it is worthwhile.</P>
    <P>Reference is made in the report to the psychiatric service in Mountjoy. The psychiatric service in prisons generally is a matter of concern to the social and individual rights group of the Fianna Fáil Parliamentary Party. Apparently, the psychiatrist attached to Mountjoy visits the prison once a week during which session he sees, on average, six or seven prisoners.  These prisoners are referred to him by the prison medical officer.  We have no complaint on that score.  It is interesting to note that in 1964 the then Minister for Justice said that psychiatric treatment was provided for inmates who were in need of special medical care, that a 20-bed psychiatric unit had been opened in the hospital wing of Mountjoy and was operating under the control of the prison medical officer who was a qualified psychiatrist. He went on to say that occupational therapy was provided for those undergoing treatment and that consultant services were available to the prison medical officer where necessary.  I understand that these services became available as a result of the recommendations of an inter-departmental committee who had been set up to deal with matters relative to the prisons.  What the social and individual rights committee of the Fianna Fáil Parliamentary Party would urge is that a full-time psychiatrist be attached to the various prisons.  In January, 1973, <Col N="754" /> the department of forensic medicine of the Eastern Health Board commenced a service on a weekly session basis both to Mountjoy and to St. Patrick's Institution.  These then, are some of the matters that concern not only us but the Minister also and we would support him in any action he might take in these fields.</P>
    <P>Regarding prison officers it is our belief that this group of people have been made the whipping post, that they have been the subject of a considerable amount of unfair criticism by certain individuals and groups. These individuals and groups might examine themselves in the light of their contribution to the community as against the contribution made by the prison officers.  In the main the criticism that has been levelled at the prison officers has been unfair and unsubstantiated.  Much of it cannot be supported.</P>
    <P>Prison officers have an important role to play in the rehabilitation of prisoners and, therefore, efforts should be made to recruit into the prison service qualified personnel so as to enable prison staff to provide teaching and medical and welfare services for prisoners.  On a number of occasions the Prison Officers' Association have stated that they favour the introduction of certain standards in relation to assessment and recruitment of candidates.  Pre-service training and increased recruitment of officers is needed badly to ease over-work.  In this context there is no reason why prison officers should not be regarded as being the same as members of the Garda Síochána and be given a comprehensive pre-induction training programme. The four-week induction course can hardly be considered adequate to prepare people for this service.  The Prison Officers' Association deserve the best possible treatment because of the extremely responsible job of work they do on behalf of the community.</P>
    <P>I have here quotations from various presidents of the Prison Officers' Association.  In his 1970 presidential address the then president of the association gave an indication of the executive thinking within the association <Col N="755" /> when he said that it had long been recognised that the whole concept of the role of the prison officer had been changing from the old idea of a warder to that of someone who was much more than a social worker.  He said that in all the processes of rehabilitative treatment in prisons the most important element is the relationship that exists between the prison officer and those committed to his care and that, therefore, it was vital that training in the skills of a social worker be provided for prison officers who would then find that they were enabled to perform their duties more effectively.</P>
    <P>In 1972 the then president of the association, Mr. Gerry Dunne, said that, with the introduction some years ago of new measures of re-socialisation of offenders, members of the association prepared themselves wholeheartedly to play an effective part in all aspects of therapeutic treatment designed to encourage and influence an offender to lead a good and useful life on his return to society.  It is interesting to note that the 1947 Prison Rules still govern the role of the prison officer.  I do not think it is a matter for me to quote at length from the 1947 prison rules but it is an interesting view on the circumstances and demands of 1974 that the prison officers themselves wish for an updating of the 1947 rules.  I have already mentioned the Garda Síochána and their relationship with the Department of Justice.  The Minister might take a look at the relationship of the Department and the prison officers, to consider the possibility of prison officers taking more decisions on their own account and still preserve the interdependence between the Department of Justice and the Prison Officers' Association.</P>
    <P>With regard to recruitment, it is interesting to note that entry to the prison service and the basic trade of temporary prison officer is open to all who have reached 19 years, have a primary certificate level of education, are 5 foot 7 inches and have a stable personality.  The prison officers consider <Col N="756" /> this is not a high enough standard to qualify themselves to be described as prison officers.  It is a decent and important job of work that cannot and must not be underrated in any respect.  We would recommend that young men consider the possibility of becoming prison officers or members of our Defence Forces or the Garda Síochána.  They are respected members of the community.</P>
    <P>The report on the Irish penal system produced by the psychiatric division of UCD sets out the working conditions and training for prison officers and specialists.  The concerns and needs of the prison officers should be dealt with by the Minister for Justice.  When we visited Mountjoy we received the greatest attention and courtesy from the Governor and the officers of the prison who conducted us on our tour and also from the official of the Department of Justice who was with us.  We spent a considerable number of hours visiting Mountjoy, St. Patrick's Institution and the women's prison.</P>
    <P>When a person leaves Mountjoy or any other prison he does not work his way back into the social welfare system until a fortnight after his release. This seems rather harsh treatment and I would ask the Minister to examine the possibility that when a person leaves a prison he should be inducted immediately into the social welfare code.  After all, the prisoner has discharged his debt to the society against which he has sinned and he should be allowed to re-establish himself immediately as a full member of that society.  The social and individual rights group of the Fianna Fáil Parliamentary Party see no reason why such a person should not be inducted into the social welfare code immediately on his release.</P>
    <P>At the moment when a prisoner is released there is no special provision for his welfare.  He leaves prison with 35p for every week he spent in prison &mdash;apparently this sum is half the amount of pocket money he obtained for working in prison.  He is given a travel ticket either to the court area <Col N="757" /> in which he was sentenced or to his home.  A problem emerges immediately because very few prisoners have a job and many have no home or accommodation.  Voluntary services have been provided by the St. Vincent de Paul Society and the Guild of St. Philip.  This was established in 1948 to organise the after-care and rehabilitation of male delinquents, in particular young and first offenders.  That guild have since developed to include female prisoners.  Their aim is the hope of restoring potential and habitual criminals to the status of industrious and self-respecting citizens.  We must wonder if society has discharged its obligations.  The prisoners have paid their debt to society but have we discharged our obligations to them on their release from prison?  I do not think we have.</P>
    <P>There are a number of firms, a group of business people who endeavour to provide immediate work for prisoners on their release and credit must be given to them.  However, this is not practised to any great degree. There is the idea that because a person was in jail he should be an outcast in society for the rest of his life. That is wrong and unfair thinking. Not only does the prisoner have to pay his debt to society within the prison walls but when he comes out the community continue his sentence.  We object to that attitude.  That is why we ask the Minister as a matter of urgency to set up some type of agency that would give immediate employment to prisoners.</P>
    <P>I know there are recidivists.  There are people who cannot keep their hands out of the till no matter where they are put or what is done for them. It is unfortunate these people cannot be cured of their criminal propensity. There is little one can do for those individuals; they cannot help committing crime.  Something went wrong at the beginning and they turn up continually and become known as old lags in prison parlance.  However, there are people who commit first, second or third offences who can be caught in time through proper rehabilitation, education and training within the prison system and, on their <Col N="758" /> release, taken into the care of some unit provided by the State and given some kind of comfort, home comfort or otherwise, and then given a job.  It is part of the rehabilitation process we were speaking about earlier.</P>
    <P>I would imagine that there is nothing as soul destroying for an individual as to come out of prison and hang around week after week becoming more resentful day by day, feeling very strongly about the attitude of society and saying: &ldquo;I cannot get a job.  What will I do?&rdquo;  Then he commits another crime.  I almost asked: who can blame him?  That is why we say some special full-time unit should be provided by the State to provide jobs for prisoners who want employment and who are educated for employment within the system.</P>
    <P>There is a half-way house known as Priorswood House.  There are three criteria for induction into Priorswood House: homelessness, a will to better himself on the part of the prisoner, and employability.  Apparently a prisoner ceases to be employable after the age of 55 years.  Let us take the first one, homelessness.  A prisoner comes out of prison with a very small sum of money.  What does he do?  I will leave that question in the air because it deserves to be left in the air.  The second is a will to better himself on the part of the prisoner.  What if the prisoner does not have the will?  What if the will is not created within the prisoner by the penal system?  Where is the will?  What happens if the prisoner has not got the will?  These are questions which must concern us. Apparently these are the criteria required for induction into Priorswood House which was the first half-way house to be established in this country.</P>
    <P>A half-way house can be described as an accommodation or a place half-way between the prison and society. We should have more half-way houses.  Apparently between January, 1970, and April, 1973, 105 ex-prisoners passed through the half-way house.  A group describing themselves as Prisoners Aid through Community Concern were set up in January by the Chaplain in Mountjoy Prison, the <Col N="759" /> welfare officer and a number of professional and business men.  PACE were given a grant of £4,000 by the Department of Justice to renovate the house described.  It is fair to bring these matters to the Minister's attention.  He is aware of them and I do not intend to labour that point very much further.  I do not want to take up much more of the time of the House.  This is my third effort to conclude on this Estimate.  Whatever the merits of one's contribution, one does not like to have it interrupted by continually reporting progress.  My point is that I do not wish to detain the House very much longer.</P>
    <P>Recent legislation has greatly improved a difficult situation by increasing the number of judges.  There are some 35 or 37 justices in the country. Undoubtedly there is need for an extra district justice in Dublin for civil work.  The justice dealing with civil work in the district court has been known to sit on until 7 o'clock. That is very unfair to him.  He does it in an uncomplaining way, to be fair to him.  He is very decent about it.  He wants help, and the system wants help.  That is why we are calling for the appointment of a new district justice to deal specifically with civil work in the district court system in Dublin.  That is not an unreasonable request.</P>
    <P>The Minister mentioned that there is some delay in the provision of the new courts complex.  He was rather sketchy as to what the delay was.  In fact, he did not say what it was, for some reason or other.  He might consider giving us some reasons for the delay in the provision of the courts complex.  The Minister knows from his own experience as a solicitor that, from the District Court, to the Circuit Court, to the High Court, to the Supreme Court, facilities are deplorable, particularly for litigants.  The lack of decent toilet facilities and washing facilities is well known.  I mention litigants specifically, people who come in either to defend, or prosecute, or be prosecuted.  These courts are there for their use.</P>
    <P>I will deal with litigants in the first <Col N="760" /> instance.  Outside Courts Nos. 1, 2 and 3 at Morgan Place in the Four Courts one has to conduct one's consultations in a throbbing mass of people.  This is a deplorable situation.  There are no proper seating facilities.  It is a matter of physical accommodation.  This is why the Minister's announcement that there is some delay in completing the courts complex is causing this side of the House some concern.  Outside Courts Nos. 1, 2 and 3 at Morgan Place for people who are being defended or prosecuted, as the case may be, and for solicitors or barristers, holding a consultation is almost impossible.</P>
    <P>For the proper presentation of a case the siting of the courts and the soundproofing of the courts are a cause of great difficulty to the presiding justice and those in the courts waiting for their cases to be heard and for counsel and solicitors.  The accommodation there from the point of view of district justices is not good enough. They have to operate in a district court, in two instances in Morgan Place, where there is a rush of traffic outside the windows.  This is most unfair from the point of view of the proper dispensation of justice.  We call on the Minister as a matter of urgency to have this problem dealt with.</P>
    <P>The Minister mentioned the district courts and also some problems in relation to some court in Waterford or wherever.  Having regard to what the Minister said about the <i>sub judice</i> rule, it is not my intention to raise that matter here.  There is a court which does not come within the <i>sub judice</i> rule, that is, the Rathfarnham Courthouse in County Dublin.  As a representative of one of the worst courthouses in this or I would imagine any other country from the point of view of facilities, I can say that on a rainy day one certainly cannot conduct a consultation there.  If one wants to conduct a consultation on a rainy day one goes to one's car with the client or clients and conducts it there. If one is so minded, of course, there is a public house across the road into which one can go and conduct one's consultation.  We consider that does not make for the practice of good law.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="761" /> I can speak from personal experience in respect of Rathfarnham District Court.  It is representative of the physical structure of some of our courthouses and the Minister might take this into account.  It is not good enough that the district justice, the gardaí&mdash;I am not putting them in any order of priority&mdash;counsel or solicitors or litigants should be subject to such conditions.  If it is raining one must almost physically break a way into court through a mass of strapping gardaí in wet overcoats and the rather haggard and disillusioned public waiting for a case to come up. We do not consider it proper that all these people should be at such a disadvantage and we call on the Minister to deal urgently with the problem.</P>
    <P>We believe that court pleadings should be shortened&mdash;we have said this before&mdash;in the interests of cost, speed and increased efficiency.  The present court procedure particularly in the case of the High Court is too complex, or not so much complex as lengthy and, to a great extent, unnecessary. We believe an examination of the jury system is desirable so as to consider (a) reducing the size of the jury, (b) increasing allowances for jury service and (c) extending eligibility for jury service, using the basis of the electoral register and the possible increase in fines for absenteeism.</P>
    <P>We are in the time of women's lib and women are properly coming to the fore in the community and we believe that women should be asked to serve on juries.  I see no reason why they should not.</P>
    <P>There may be areas of this Estimate on which I have not touched as spokesman on Justice but the Department has a very wide area and one cannot deal with all aspects of it; otherwise, one could be here until tomorrow and I am sure Deputies would wish to be saved from my speaking until tomorrow.  However, it is my intention to bring a number of matters to the Minister's attention before concluding.  Will the Minister say in regard to the Garda pensioners what he proposes to do in regard to the question of full parity.  There are other national problems to be dealt <Col N="762" /> with but we feel the Garda pensioners deserve the best possible treatment we can give them.  When the Fianna Fáil party were in Government they did not do too badly by the Garda pensioners. We have seen no significant sign in this regard from the present Government, even of their awareness of the situation.  I do not want to be contentious on this matter&mdash;on the contrary&mdash;but we would ask the Minister to introduce full parity for Garda pensioners as a matter of urgency.  The number of these men is unhappily diminishing and we would ask the Minister to consider their very reasonable case as soon as possible.</P>
    <P>In the recent past the Minister announced the creation of the post of Director of Public Prosecutions. I am critical of the Government Information Service from time to time but I would like to thank them and the Minister for the facility of allowing me to have copies of the Minister's speeches and of any judgment the Minister may wish to hand down on occasions in his capacity as Minister for Justice.  We certainly appreciate this very much and hope it will continue.  It keeps us up to date with the Minister's thinking and is helpful.  In one of these handouts from the Government Information Service it was stated that the Attorney General had at the request of the Taoiseach carried out an examination of certain aspects of the present system of the prosecution of crime and had reported thereon to the Taoiseach. After considering this report, it states, the Government have decided on the creation by statute of a Director of Public Prosecutions who shall be authorised to perform and discharge the functions and duties relating to the prosecution of crime which can, at the present time, be performed and discharged by the Attorney General.</P>
    <P>The next sentence is the really important one, apart from the preceding paragraph:</P>
    <P>The Government are very conscious of the necessity for the establishment of a system for the prosecution of crime that is not <Col N="763" /> only free from political influence, but is manifestly so, and they believe that the establishment of an office for the direction of prosecutions would help to enhance public confidence in the administration of the law....</P>
    <P>The Government propose to ensure that the making of representations to the Attorney General, State Solicitors, members of the Garda Síochaná and others officially concerned in relation to criminal matters shall cease.</P>
    <P>Hear, hear to that.  It goes on:</P>
    <P>The making of similar representations to the Director of Public Prosecutions will likewise not be acceptable.  The proposed legislation will include provisions for this purpose.</P>
    <P>The third paragraph deals with the assignment of counsel.  I am sure the Minister will assign counsel on a nonpolitical basis and on ability and merit.  That should be the criterion. That is not the position which prevails at present.  The Government have ruthlessly removed from the list of prosecutors the known members of the Fianna Fáil Party in the Law Library. We regard that as unfortunate.  It is difficult for me to articulate that particular point but I believe, as spokesman on Justice for the Opposition, I have an obligation and duty to point out that there is either a merit system or a patronage system and we believe on this side of the House that the patronage system does exist in the law. The Attorney General in the first flush of enthusiasm said he would do away with the system of giving State briefs on the basis of political affiliation.  We believed the Attorney General then but we certainly do not believe him now.  His words have been proved to be very wrong.  If a patronage system exists, say so.  Do not pretend it does not exist.  It does exist.</P>
    <P>We would hope that the appointment of a Director of Public Prosecutions will bring to an end the patronage system in this respect.  The Attorney General has obviously carried out his survey on the need for <Col N="764" /> such an appointment.  The Minister might consider telling the House in his reply who he intends to appoint to the office of Director of Public Prosecutions.  Is it intended to appoint the person through the Civil Service Commission?  Is it intended to advertise the post in the public media?  Is it intended to appoint a lawyer or a public servant?  That is a simple question requiring a simple answer and there can be no prevarication on it. We would like to know the Government's intent, and it is a pious intent at the moment because it does not exist, that in discharging the responsibilities of office political considerations will play no part.  Unfortunately, political considerations do play a part at the moment and there is no gainsaying that.  We would hope that the appointment of a Director of Public Prosecutions will bring to an end political patronage in the dispensation of State work.  The Minister might fill us in on how State counsel will be appointed after the Director of Public Prosecutions has been appointed.</P>
    <P>The director, I am sure, will take on that task but it would be interesting to hear the whole area of the functions of the Director of Public Prosecutions outlined in this House. Perhaps the Minister would do so. The present Government have a habit of coming out and saying something is going to be done and leaving many questions unanswered.  It would help me, as spokesman on Justice, if they articulated more clearly and were more specific in their announcement in this respect.</P>
    <P>The failure of a person who was convicted of murder to return to Mountjoy after a day's parole on 13th January of this year was a matter of considerable concern to this side of the House, concern, first of all, that this individual, who was convicted of murder in 1964, did not return to prison and that he was abroad and, secondly, concern about the conflicting statements from the Department of Justice on the one hand and the Garda Síochána on the other.  The Garda described him as dangerous. The Department came out with a <i>mea culpa</i> statement.  They said:</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="765" /> It is the norm, not the exception, that persons who are convicted of murder and given the statutory sentence of life imprisonment are released after a number of years.</P>
    <P>Of course, they tried to prevent any blame attaching to the present Government for anything to do with the malfunctioning of the parole system in this respect.  They went on to say:</P>
    <P>This has been the policy of every Government since the establishment of the State.</P>
    <P>It is standard practice, here as in other countries, that such a prisoner, or any long-term prisoner, should before release be allowed to re-adjust gradually to normal life by being given parole on a gradually increasing basis, escorted at first and then without escort.</P>
    <P>We accept that that is a proper and humane way for a person to be gradually reintroduced into society. What we cannot understand and what has remained unexplained are the conflicting statements from the Department of Justice and the Garda Síochána.  Perhaps the Minister will explain this.</P>
    <P>On the matter of the tribunal which the Minister intends to set up, I am grateful to the Minister and his Department for sending me the document of the full scheme of compensation for personal injuries criminally inflicted.  It is a helpful document and sets out very clearly and concisely what the intentions are.  Again, it comes back to the Minister's speech and the fact that the Minister is continuing the work done and the plans laid by his predecessor.  The Minister's speech reveals very little new thinking since the last Estimate was introduced by his predecessor on 12th and 13th April, 1972.  That is the last time the Minister for Justice of this country had an opportunity of setting out a programme for the area under his jurisdiction.  We consider the Minister's speech to contain no new thought, to be full of matter left over from his predecessor.  The way the announcement about this tribunal on compensation for personal injuries criminally inflicted was made in the <Col N="766" /> newspapers one would imagine that this was something new, that this was something this Government thought up themselves, that they worked out the scheme and so on.  It was presented as if the Coalition grouping were introducing something new.  The thinking was not new.</P>
    <P>It was there for a considerable length of time before the present Minister announced it.  In fact, it was there in Deputy Des O'Malley's time, the former Minister for Justice.  This was confirmed in a letter I received from the Minister's private secretary.  I hope the private secretary will not think I am being unfair in any way.  I do not mean to be critical; quite the contrary.  In my position as spokesman on Justice I find, in relations between myself and the officials of the Department of Justice, nothing but good.  I think I will be forgiven just for quoting this; it is a direct quote to support my contention that the Minister's Estimate Speech reveals no new thinking. In fact, one might consider that, in a number of areas the Minister is dragging his feet.  On the matter of the Kilbarrack prison we have asked the Minister to assure the House that this prison will be forthcoming.  On the matter of the new courts complex there now seems to be some doubt in that area.  That is why we say that the Minister's speech is not gauged, as it were, to giving us any new heart.  Just to prove and substantiate what I am saying, this scheme of compensation for personal injuries criminally inflicted is presented by the present Government, through the Government Information Services and so on, as if it were their thinking, their scheme; it is anything but.</P>
    <P>I now quote the letter of the 8th February, 1974, sent to me by the Minister's private secretary:</P>
    <P>Dear Deputy Andrews,</P>
    <P>I am directed by the Minister for Justice, Mr. P. Cooney, T.D., to enclose, for your information, copy of the scheme for the payment of compensation to persons who suffer loss as a result of personal injury arising from crimes of violence.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="767" /> The scheme was laid on the table of the House yesterday morning&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <P>which meant, of course, that every Deputy got it&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <P>the Minister's intention being that he would then refer to it in his opening speech on the Estimates which he expected would be made later yesterday.  As the opportunity to refer to it did not arise yesterday, the Minister decided that, to assist Deputies and other interested persons, some explanatory note should, instead, be issued and I enclose a copy of the statement that was issued last night.</P>
    <P>All very good; all very proper.</P>
    <P>As the Minister has already stated in the House, the scheme is in accord with the general principles that had been approved and announced in the House by the previous Government.  It is, however, wider in its coverage in one respect&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <P>and the scheme sets out 31 points&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <P>viz. that whereas (in order to exclude a multiplicity of small claims) the previous Government's decision was that losses below £100 would be excluded, the corresponding provision in the approved scheme excludes only losses below £50.</P>
    <P>That, I think, is indicative of the matter I mentioned; that, in fact, the Minister's speech is really not earth shattering in its original thought.  I am supported in my view on the basis of the letter I received from the Department of Justice.</P>
    <P>On the matter of the Ban-Gharda, the Minister has made regulations which revoke the statutory provision that a ban-gharda should retire on marriage.  A member of the force may in future, if she so wishes, continue to serve in the Garda Síochána after her marriage.  At present there are 28 women members of the force; five ban-sergeants and 23 ban-ghardaí.  It seems to me to be a rather low figure for women in the Garda Síochána.  I would call on young women to consider <Col N="768" /> the possibility of becoming members of this respected force.  I welcome the Minister's decision which revokes the statutory provision that a ban-gharda should retire on marriage.  I think there is general acceptance in all areas of public endeavour and the public service generally that when one gets married one does not cease suddenly to lose one's qualifications. Therefore, if one is a typist on the day of one's wedding one need not necessarily cease being a typist; one should possibly go back and take up the job where one left off.  That is a proper piece of thinking.  For instance, why should a person who has been in the ban-gharda, a single girl, six or seven years working there, be lost to the Garda Síochána?  I think it is a welcome and worthwhile decision that if, after six, seven, eight, nine or ten years a girl in the ban-gharda gets married, her experience should not be lost to the force.</P>
    <P>There is another point I want to make before concluding.  It is the matter of the information for persons in custody.  Again, the Minister&mdash;with the compliments of the Department of Justice and through the Government Information Service&mdash;sent me a note stating that notices advising persons in custody of their rights have been sent to the Garda Síochána throughout the country.  The notices will be displayed in each station. Leaflets containing similar information will also be handed to persons taken into custody.  The information given in the leaflets and notices outlines a person's rights in relation to bail, visits from a solicitor, a family member or friend, refreshments, legal aid, the taking of fingerprints and the holding of identification parades.  In my view, there is too much in the notice.  There is the question of bail, the question of facilities and, as I said, refreshments.  There is too much in it.  But, under the heading of legal aid, this is dealt with on application to the court and may be granted in certain circumstances.</P>
    <P>I do not wish that every Garda station in the country be littered with notices setting out the rights of citizens but there are some rights which <Col N="769" /> I think should be clearly stated.  We are concerned particularly with the right to legal aid for young persons. Young persons come into court.  They are extremely nervous.  If they are not properly represented, through no fault of the presiding judge&mdash;just for the sake of even getting out of the atmosphere of the court&mdash;they may commit themselves to saying something which, in the normal way, they would be protected against saying by proper legal representation.  That is why we consider that the legal aid notices in particular should be uplifted from the information to persons in custody posted in Garda stations and that it should be given particular prominence.  We believe that, given proper representation, a person has a fair chance of presenting a good case for himself or herself.  From proper representation stems the whole life force of the legal system.  A person is entitled to be protected, indeed, from himself, perhaps, from his lack of knowledge, again through no fault of his own.  The notice is a very good idea and very welcome but we feel the legal aid aspect of it should be uplifted and given special prominence.</P>
    <P>Perhaps the Minister would give the figures&mdash;he did not in his Estimates speech&mdash;for the amount of money set aside for legal aid for criminal cases which is not utilised.  In fact, if I were to say it is not half utilised, I might be nearer the mark. This is a very sad commentary, I think, on the legal aid system.  It is non-functioning.  We believe that every penny of legal aid in criminal cases should be taken up.  We add, once more, the plea that legal aid in civil cases, particularly in relation to family matters, should be forthcoming as a matter of urgency.  We believe that and we would support the Minister in anything he might do in that respect.</P>
    <P>The Minister said that the matter of ground rents is to be dealt with in a comprehensive piece of legislation.  If a survey were made of recipients of ground rents, one might find that nearly all of those recipients live in Ireland.  They are building societies, insurance companies and so <Col N="770" /> on.  Section 3 of the Landlord and Tenant (Ground Rents) Act, 1967, provides that those who hold land, as defined therein, are entitled to acquire the fee simple in the land compulsorily. In broader terms, those who are entitled to acquire it are (1) those holding under a building lease (2) those who hold a proprietary lease&mdash; (1) and (2) as defined in the Reversal of Leases Act, 1958&mdash;(3) a lease for a term of not less than 99 years which reserves a yearly rent of an amount less than the PLV (4) a person whose predecessors in title have been continuously in occupation of the land as yearly tenants for the previous 25 years and who hold the land at a rent less than the PLV.</P>
    <P>We contend that this Act sets out clearly the procedure for the acquisition of the fee simple.  In 1967 the going rate for the fee simple was about 15 years' purchase of the rent. Because of inflation this rate has now dropped to ten or 11 years' purchase. Basically that is the history of the acquisition of ground rent as it stands at the moment.  The Minister mentioned that he intends bringing in more comprehensive legislation in this respect.  We look forward to seeing what this legislation contains.  We believe that fundamentally ground rents are a penal tax to the extent that there is no apparent consideration from the landlord to the tenant, the benefit is unilateral and, therefore, has no merit except to the recipient.  The tenant, as I have said, receives no apparent service in return.</P>
    <P>As a responsible Opposition we have a duty to point out that any move by the State to abolish ground rents would involve great expenditure as compensation to the disappropriated. It would be necessary to give these people compensation in view of the clearly defined provisions of the Constitution. We do not like the idea of a ground rent.  Our party are committed to the abolition of rates on houses but I cannot commit our party on ground rents because we have not yet formulated a full document.  We are researching the matter very thoroughly and will have a position paper ready in the not-too-distant future.  We <Col N="771" /> would be glad to discuss this paper with interested groups.  To date we have had meetings with a number of groups concerned with ground rents.</P>
    <P>The Government have been silent on this problem.  We look forward, as do other groups, to hearing their views on a matter of such national importance.  What are the Government's views on the social desirability of ground rents?  We would ask them to conduct a survey on this question. They have the whole State paraphernalia at their back.  There is no reason why they should not conduct a survey as to the amount which would be required to compensate landlords or those holding ground rents who would be dispossessed.  This might not be possible, but if so we should be told. The Minister might consider answering the questions on the social desirability of ground rents and the amount of compensation which would be required to pay those landlords who might be dispossessed of their ground rents.</P>
    <P>On 14th November, 1973, I asked a question which is reported in the Official Report of that date at columns 1858 to 1859: I quote:</P>
    <P>Mr. Andrews asked the Minister for Justice the number of occasions on which the Committee on Court Practice and Procedure has reported; and the title of each such report.</P>
    <P>Mr. Cooney: The answer is in the form of a statement which, with the permission of the Ceann Comhairle, I propose to circulate with the Official Report.</P>
    <P>The Committee on Court Practice and Procedure have submitted 18 interim reports to date as follows:&mdash;</P>
    <P>First Interim Report: The Preliminary Investigation of Indictable Offences.</P>
    <P>This has been dealt with.</P>
    <P>Second Interim Report: Jury Service.</P>
    <P>To be considered.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="772" /> Third Interim Report: Jury Trial in Civil Actions.</P>
    <P>To be considered.</P>
    <P>Fourth Interim Report: Jury Challenges.</P>
    <P>Fifth Interim Report: Increase of Jurisdiction of the District Court and the Circuit Court.</P>
    <P>This has been dealt with.</P>
    <P>Sixth Interim Report: The Criminal Jurisdiction of the High Court.</P>
    <P>This has not been dealt with.</P>
    <P>Seventh Interim Report: Appeals from Conviction on Indictment.</P>
    <P>I believe, and I am subject to correction, that part of that may have been dealt with.</P>
    <P>Eighth Interim Report:</P>
    <P>(1)  Service of Court Documents by post.</P>
    <P>(2)  Fees of Professional Witnesses.</P>
    <P>This has been dealt with.</P>
    <P>Ninth Interim Report: Proof of Previous Convictions.</P>
    <P>Is this the Criminal Justice Bill?</P>
    <P>Tenth Interim Report: Interest Rate on Judgment Debts.</P>
    <P>This has been partly dealt with.</P>
    <P>Eleventh Interim Report: The Jurisdiction and Practice of the Supreme Court.</P>
    <P>This is to be considered.</P>
    <P>Twelfth Interim Report: Courts Organisation.</P>
    <P>I have already mentioned the concern of this party for the physical aspects of courts generally and for the reorganisation of the courts.</P>
    <P>Thirteenth Interim Report: The Solicitor's Right of Audience.</P>
    <P>Fourteenth Interim Report: Liability of Barristers and Solicitors for Professional Negligence.</P>
    <P>This is to be considered.</P>
    <P>Fifteenth Interim Report: On the Spot Fines.</P>
    <P>It was reported in the newspapers that on the spot fines will be introduced in the not-too-distant future.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMarkCooney" hpid="Mr. Cooney Mr. Cooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cooney</NameTxt>
      <P>It was in my speech also.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Col N="773" />
    <Speaker pid="DavidAndrews" hpid="Mr. Andrews Mr. Andrews">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Andrews</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, the Minister did mention it in his speech.  The reply continued:</P>
      <P>Sixteenth Interim Report: The Jurisdiction of the Master of the High Court.</P>
      <P>This is in the Bill.</P>
      <P>Seventeenth Interim Report: Court Fees.</P>
      <P>This is to be considered.</P>
      <P>Eighteenth Interim Report: Execution of money judgments, orders and decrees.</P>
      <P>The Minister may have heard from the respected Mr. Justice Walsh about the matters he referred to by warrant to him in June last in relation to family law generally.  The Minister may have received a report from this specially commissioned committee. We look forward to hearing from the Minister when he receives this report and whether he will commit himself to any part of it.</P>
      <P>Finally, I should like to refer to the matter of giving justice a human face.  It will be our intention on this side of the House during the lifetime of this Dáil to press the Minister for socially orientated legislation.  We believe this comprises family law reform, legal aid, and reforms of that nature.  If the Minister was to be known for nothing else but for the fact that he introduced family law reform in this House, apart from the other priority, the security of the country, he would have achieved a lot.  He should concentrate all his energies on the production of legislation relating to family law reform and he will receive the support of this party in this regard.  This is a matter which should be of primary concern to this House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If the Minister can unravel the anomalies of the family legal system and emerge with proper legal aid in civil cases he will have the thanks of the Opposition.  The Minister can distinguish himself in this field if he pursues a family law reform programme. It often struck me that when one decided to produce a particular piece of law reform a section of a Department should be concentrated on producing <Col N="774" /> that reform for a specific period, even if that was over three years.  That section could produce a comprehensive legislative instrument codifying what is needed.  That may sound naive but the Minister may be able to help me in that respect.</P>
    <P>We will also keep an eye on the Minister in relation to the gardaí and the prisons.  The Minister did say on the occasion of my visit to Mountjoy, in the company of Deputy Seán Moore, that the corrective training centre is almost completed.  We were informed that it would be ready by Easter but now the Minister indicates it will not be ready until the middle of the year.  I hope this corrective training centre, which is an outstanding building and must be one of the most modern in Europe if not in the world, will be completed soon.  This unit, which is a credit to the Minister's predecessor, contains every possible modern facility.  The bedroom units, the beds, cooking and recreational facilities are first class.</P>
    <P>I only visited that centre when it was merely bricks and mortar and one had to walk across planks to avoid standing on wet cement.  What I saw at that stage of development was outstanding and it is heartening to know that this type of development is taking place.  I ask the Minister to continue with that type of development in the prison service.  Such development can do nothing but good for the community as a whole.  I thank the House for being patient with me and I apologise that I had to come in, for the third time, on the Minister's Estimate but this was not my fault.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TomEnright" hpid="Mr. Enright Mr. Enright">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Enright</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to congratulate the Minister on the fine and comprehensive resumé he has given of the work of his Department in the past year.  He has given the House a very thorough outline of the happenings in his Department and a guide as to what his future plans are.  Page 2 of the Minister's speech dealt with the kernel of the whole situation, the security and safety of the State.  In that regard the Minister gave a firm indication of the absolute determination of the Government to ensure <Col N="775" /> that the security of the State is upheld and protected.</P>
      <P>It is important for us all to bear in mind that everybody in this country desires peace and prosperity.  To secure this it is necessary to have an efficient and dedicated Department of Justice.  It is also necessary to have a body such as the Garda Síochána, who are doing an excellent job.  They are dedicated to their work and discharge their duties in a manner which, I believe, is the envy of other countries.  We are fortunate that our police force are one of the finest groups of men in the world.  It is necessary, in my view, for backbenchers to endorse the complimentary remarks made by the Minister about the Garda.</P>
      <P>I should now like to deal with a number of matters which have not been touched on by the Minister, or the Fianna Fáil spokesman.  As Deputies are aware, some time ago there was an increase in the jurisdiction of the District and Circuit Courts.  The increase in the limit for civil cases in the District Courts to £250 meant that a greater number of civil cases came before these courts.  This has resulted in a considerable backlog of civil cases in these courts.  For that reason I believe it will be necessary for the Department of Justice, and the district justices, to have consultations to arrange specific dates for the hearing of civil cases and Attorney General, or criminal cases.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As a person who practises in the courts and, consequently, one who has knowledge of the procedures involved I saw on a number of occasions a rent case, or other civil cases being dealt with first while Attorney General cases for which witnesses were summonsed were left to the end of the list.  On occasions rent cases took up almost the entire day with the result that a lot of Attorney General cases were not heard.  This resulted in some cases having to be referred back.  Therefore, it is an unsatisfactory situation.  It is not fair that people who are summonsed by the Attorney General to appear in court should be at the loss of their <Col N="776" /> day's pay as a result of cases not being called.  An effort should be made to ensure that this sort of situation cannot arise in the future.  Even if one day's hearing in every four were to be devoted to civil cases the situation would be improved.  Because of increased jurisdiction greater numbers of people are bringing cases to the District Court.  This applies also to the Circuit Court but in the latter it is normal practice for the Attorney General's cases to be taken first.  Because of this increased jurisdiction it will be necessary in the future to have special sittings of the District Courts for the purpose of taking civil cases.</P>
    <P>I am glad to note that, both in respect of the District and other courts, the Minister has appointed welfare officers.  On the 5th June last Deputy Briscoe tabled a question about the number of these welfare officers.  The Minister told him that in 1970 the number was 14 and that this had increased by 1973 to 47.  The Minister went on to point out that recruitment plans were in progress for the provision of additional welfare officers so as to bring the number up to 90.  I hope that this target will be given the utmost priority.  I say this because court welfare officers are providing an excellent service. Even when they were small in number they proved to have been well worthwhile.</P>
    <P>As Members are probably aware a court welfare officer visits a convicted person's home, talks to him and ascertains relevant aspects relating to his background.  He endeavours to ascertain the cause for the person having committed the offence.  In the report which he prepares subsequently he refers to such matters as the type of crime committed and whether the offender was employed.  If the offender has had a series of dismissals from employment, the officer endeavours to find out the reason for these dismissals.  An effort is made also to ascertain whether family troubles contributed to the committing of the crime.  As well as presenting an assessment of the situation as he finds it, the welfare officer endeavours to make some prognostication as to whether <Col N="777" /> the offender will continue to commit offences.  All this work is very important.</P>
    <P>There was mention in the Minister's speech also of the juvenile liaison officers. The figures given by the Minister in respect of cases with which these officers were associated are very encouraging. More than 7,600 young boys and girls have come under the supervision of the liaison officers and the figures show that only 13 per cent of these juveniles became involved in further offences.  It is only fair to assume that if this scheme were not in operation the number of lapses would be much greater.  Therefore, this scheme as well as the court welfare officers scheme has contributed positively towards the rehabilitation of many young boys and girls.  After an offence has been committed every effort should be made to ensure that there will be no further offences.  If young boys and girls are unfortunate enough to be sent to prison their chances of rehabilitation become less.  Therefore, the time for efforts to prevent further offences being committed is before these young people are sent to prison.</P>
    <P>There is justification for the rapid expansion of the juvenile liaison officers scheme and also of the court welfare officers scheme.  There are court welfare officers who sit through the hearings in the District Courts and, if requested to do so by the justice, will follow up any of the cases that have been brought forward during the proceedings.</P>
    <P>Recently one of our newspapers reported the remarks of a district justice who said that alcohol was the prime factor in respect of a number of the crimes that are committed.  Many people will agree with that.  It is my contention that alcohol is responsible for, perhaps, 60 to 70 per cent of crime.  A person who is under the influence of alcohol may commit crime without being fully aware of what he is doing but such factors as shortage of money or unhappiness in the home may also lead to crime being committed.</P>
    <P>In the future the Minister for Justice will be regarded as a person <Col N="778" /> with a serious social conscience.  It is vital that some form of intensive study be carried out into the reasons crimes are committed; this study might be carried out by court welfare officers, members of the Garda Síochána and officials of the Department.  I believe it will be proved that alcoholism is one of the prime reasons for crimes. The Garda should try to curtail the amount of under-age drinking.  One of the problems is that the owners of public houses are not in a position to find out the ages of young people. The results of such a study would prove of great benefit and might help to prevent people from getting into trouble with the law.  Prevention is much more important than the cure; I consider it to be the kernel of the matter.</P>
    <P>Our national and provincial newspapers report court cases throughout the country and mainly they deal in a factual way with the cases.  The series of articles in <i>The Irish Times</i> by Nell McCafferty is worthy of praise and is providing a social service.  She tries to consider some of the reasons why young boys and girls get into trouble and she gives some of the background to the stories.  The articles deal not only with what happens in the court but the author continues her research outside the courtroom. She tries to bring humanity and a touch of realism and sympathy into our courts.  This is lacking in many other instances of court reporting. The articles by Miss McCafferty help to keep district justices on their toes; this can be a help no matter what profession a person may have.</P>
    <P>Deputy Andrews referred to the situation in the Dublin District Courts and he dealt with the stresses and strains under which the district justices, the gardaí, barristers and solicitors carry out their work.  Additional district justices are needed so that the long hours of sittings may be curtailed.  Deputy Andrews said one district justice has occasionally sat until 7 p.m. to clear a list.  If a district justice must sit from 10.30 a.m. until such a late hour it is obvious that there will be a considerable strain on him.  His job demands <Col N="779" /> total concentration in order to cope with his duties.  The situation in the District Courts in Dublin is somewhat unsatisfactory.  The articles by Nell McCafferty in <i>The Irish Times</i> highlight the fact that the present situation with regard to District Courts is not as satisfactory as it might be and it should be examined.</P>
    <P>Deputy Andrews also referred to the lack of consulting rooms and the lack of toilet facilities.  I have had business in some of the District Court offices throughout the country and I confirm that in many cases facilities are not adequate.  Perhaps this is a matter for the local authorities in the first instance.  I have visited many District Courts in the last eight years and I know that the conditions under which district justices are forced to work are absolutely unbelievable; they would have to be seen to be believed.</P>
    <P>In many of the courthouses it is not possible to light the fire, the seating accommodation is nil, the lighting is unsatisfactory; in short, they do not present a proper medium through which our courts should be administering justice.  The Four Courts in Dublin has been mentioned but that building is in the lap of luxury compared with conditions in courthouses throughout the country.  Young people will be able to withstand many of the difficulties but it is extremely difficult for elderly men and women, expectant mothers and people in poor health. Frequently they have to stand in a courthouse from 11 a.m. until 4 p.m. When their case is called late in the afternoon it may take only a few minutes.  They leave the court with a doubt whether the law has the dignity and backing that a citizen considers necessary.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Justice, the Department of Defence, the Department of Local Government and the county councils will have to look at this in the very near future because conditions in courthouses are very bad.  Deputy Andrews said the toilet facilities in the courthouses in Dublin were inadequate but at least there are some.  In some of the courthouses in the country there are none.  I know <Col N="780" /> of one courthouse which is in a field and it is almost impossible to get into it or out of it.  This is not good enough.</P>
    <P>Quite an amount has been said on the subject of prison reform.  The Minister dealt with it very adequately in his speech.  I am sure he will see to it that every effort will be made to ensure that whatever buildings are necessary and whatever reforms are necessary will be provided.  He said that our prisons are clean and comfortable. This is important because when people leave prisons they have to resume living in society.  One hopes they will be rehabilitated.</P>
    <P>Group therapy in prisons is very important.  Groups of prisoners meet under a psychiatrist or a doctor and discuss the reasons why they are in prison.  They discuss their family background and try to discover in their own way why they are in prison and where they went wrong.  This form of group therapy helps to rehabilitate them.  Many people are in prison due to the fact that they were unable to obtain employment or because the employment they had was not sufficient to occupy them.  While they are in prison they should be trained for future employment.  The Minister dealt with this earlier in reply to questions, and gave details of training and educational facilities in prisons.</P>
    <P>I am pleased to note that the Minister hopes to provide in the near future, if he has not already done so, a director of education for the prison services.  His duties will be to promote a co-ordinating expansion and development of educational facilities in prisons and other places of detention. This will help to ensure that when people have served their prison sentences they will be able to face out into the world again rehabilitated and with, perhaps, some improved form of education.</P>
    <P>In regard to the training which is necessary in these institutions, on 27th November, 1973, as reported in the Official Report, in reply to a question about the St. Patrick's Institution educational facilities the Minister said:</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="781" /> There is a full education unit of modern design and equipment in St. Patrick's Institution, in which a comprehensive programme of education in manual and academic subjects, including remedial education in literacy and numeracy, is provided.</P>
    <P>Classes are conducted by qualified teachers, some attending on a full and some on a part-time basis. Subjects taught include metalwork, mechanical drawing, woodwork, science, mathematics, geography, English, civics and Art.</P>
    <P>Although attendance at classes is not compulsory, up to 50 per cent of the boys do attend.</P>
    <P>This is equally important in some of our other institutions in the country.  I recognise that there are great difficulties in teaching classes in metalwork for which dangerous tools must be provided which could be used to cause injury to life or limb to some of our prison warders and staff.  Every effort should be made to provide some form of retraining for our prisoners.  Far too many people who go to prisons become recurring criminals.  It is a serious situation that a person who could be of benefit to the State becomes a serious burden and, in many instances, a danger.  That is why help, co-operation, rehabilitation and reform are so very desirable.</P>
    <P>I dealt with some of the dangers of alcohol.  If properly used, alcohol can provide enjoyment and, if used in moderation, it can provide social relaxation. There are some changes I should like to see made in the Intoxicating Liquor Acts.  On Sunday nights an hotelier cannot get an extension between 10 o'clock and 12 o'clock even if a full meal is served at the function.  I am from Laois-Offaly and I believe that many more functions would be held on Sunday nights in the country by political parties, Macra na Feirme, the IFA, hurling clubs, football clubs, soccer clubs and rugby clubs but for that restriction.  Sunday night is the night out in the country rather than Friday and Saturday which are the nights out in the city.  I should like the Minister to look at <Col N="782" /> this regulation to see if it could be changed because I believe it is neither necessary nor desirable.  If there is a function in an hotel and if a full meal is served, the bar should be allowed to remain open between 10 o'clock and 12 o'clock at night.  I attend a number of functions on Sunday nights and this anomaly causes great difficulties for hoteliers.  When the people come out from the meal they find the bar closed and have to wait 1½ hours before they can get some form of refreshment.  If the bar is closed they cannot even get a glass of orange or lemonade.  I strongly advocate that hotels be allowed to remain open between 10 p.m. and midnight on Sunday nights when a function is being held.</P>
    <P>The whole situation in regard to licensing requires to be regulated to some extent.  I think 11 p.m. on all week nights would be a better time for closing publichouses and that seven-day licensed premises should be allowed to remain open until 11 o'clock on Sunday nights.  My reason for this is that, especially in the country, Sunday night is the people's night out and opening until 11 p.m. would facilitate many people.  It is also desirable to have the closing hour fixed at 11 p.m. on week nights.  There is a good deal of criticism from tourists about the 10 o'clock closing on Sunday nights, especially at seaside towns.  They say there is nothing much to do after 10 o'clock.  In the case of seaside or even midland towns if there is some festival or ballad session being held and if tourists are staying in hotels, their evening meal may not finish until 8.30 p.m. or 9 p.m. or even later.  Then, if they dress and go out to a licensed premises it closes at 10 p.m. and they have nothing more to do for the remainder of the night. That is unsatisfactory so that there is merit in having the licensed premises open until 11 p.m. on Sunday nights.</P>
    <P>There is also much criticism from tourists because they are unable to have alcoholic refreshment in restaurants at night.  The Minister and the Minister for Transport and Power should look into the matter of granting licences to good-class restaurants. <Col N="783" /> Many tourists would like restaurants to have far greater liberty to serve drink with meals at night and this should be examined as something that is very desirable.</P>
    <P>Some aspects of the jury system have already been dealt with.  The report of the court practices and procedure committee is quite good and some of the recommendations listed are desirable.  Some people are unfairly exempted from jury service. Civil servants and local government officials, with some reservations, are excluded.  So are women and peace commissioners.  There is no logical reason why women should be exempt. They could and should be allowed to serve on juries.  I mentioned previously on a Courts Bill that it is necessary that jurors should be paid for attendance in court.  People nowadays are not in a position to spend two or three days sitting in court while in many instances they are losing wages or business.  It is desirable, necessary and urgent that persons called for jury service should be paid.</P>
    <P>There has been much criticism of the jury system as being unsatisfactory and unwieldy.  I am very much in favour of the retention of our jury system in both civil and criminal cases.  Previously Deputy O'Malley said fewer people were offering for jury service in the Circuit Court.  To some extent I agree with him in respect of the Circuit Court but the reason is that the scale of awards is much less.  In the High Court if people are involved in accidents and so on the scale is far greater.  The jury system is absolutely essential for the protection of the ordinary citizens, to whom it offers great protection in court, and I would strongly oppose any change in the present system. Some reasons for my view include the fact that when judges are five, seven or nine years appointed they may not be in close touch with affairs. They tend to live a quieter life than other people.  When it comes to assessing damages for a person involved in an accident who has suffered loss or injury I believe that the person <Col N="784" /> who is really in touch with things and knows what is happening is the ordinary man-in-the-street and he is the best judge of the loss suffered.  It is very important to retain this system.</P>
    <P>I would also oppose the idea that a scale of compensation for injuries should be fixed either by a Government body or a semi-judicial body.  The jury system looks after this matter satisfactorily.  Some insurance companies are against the jury system because they say the awards granted are far too high.  Personally, I doubt this; I think it is incorrect; I do not think the awards too high.  The value of money has dropped considerably.  If a person suffers a serious injury and has to attend hospital, hospital bills, surgeons' fees and the cost of medicines and drugs are enormous and frightening. There is also the loss the family suffers while the person is out of work and this is also enormous.  I believe a jury of ordinary citizens is in the best position to judge the amount a person has lost and the amount of damages that should be awarded.  It is essential that our jury system be retained as it is.</P>
    <P>There are a few other matters I should like to deal with briefly.  The first relates to our legal education system.  There is far too much overlapping of lectures in UCD, Trinity and Kings Inns. Solicitors' apprentices find that BCL and LLB lectures, a number of top-class lectures, are too limited and I think it has become necessary to set up some body to look into the matter.  Some such approach might help to lower the cost of legal education.</P>
    <P>A point about which there has been quite a lot of criticism recently is the duration of apprenticeship to solicitors. There are many young boys and girls who would like to go into the solicitors' profession but they are disturbed about the length of the apprenticeship.  The number of solicitors who can take apprentices is limited and, therefore, the number of students who wish to become apprentices is curtailed.  This situation, I believe, is to be reviewed by the Law Society.  It tends to reduce the numbers entering the profession.  I have had students from Offaly, Laois and elsewhere asking me for advice in <Col N="785" /> this respect.  One has to be qualified for seven years before taking on an apprentice and this in itself is a curtailing element.  A solicitor must be a master.  A change is necessary in this respect.</P>
    <P>I agree that an apprenticeship of some form is necessary but I would cut down the time of practical apprenticeship to one year instead of four. It would be a pity to see promising boys and girls being prevented from becoming solicitors.  I admit that I do not know of anybody who wanted to become a solicitor who failed to do so because he or she could not find a master to take them on.  However, there has been a rapid expansion in business, a rapid increase in the numbers of people buying and selling houses and, consequently, there has been a great increase in the amount of work requiring solicitors.  This is very important work and it would be a pity to see it hampered by lack of personnel, by a run-down in the number of practising solicitors.  I appreciate that the Law Society are making every effort to improve matters but I repeat my suggestion that the Minister might set up a body to look into the matter.</P>
    <P>Legislation to provide legal aid, particularly in the civil sphere, is an urgent necessity.  I am glad the Minister has set up a committee to investigate it and I hope he will urge that committee to issue their report as soon as possible.</P>
    <P>Finally, I should like to compliment the staff of the Land Registry for their courtesy and efficiency at all times.  Land Registry work has increased enormously in the past few years but the staff has met the challenge most creditably.  However, great delays occur in the supply of maps, in the processing of sub-division applications, in the opening of new folios and other business of this kind, and it has become necessary for the Minister for Justice to do everything possible to facilitate the Land Registry in this respect.  There are delays of up to eight months sometimes in the provision of maps and this hampers people setting up new industries and others.  I congratulate the Minister on <Col N="786" /> his appointment and wish him a long and happy period in office.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BenBriscoe" hpid="Mr. Briscoe Mr. Briscoe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Briscoe</NameTxt>
      <P>I also congratulate the Minister on his excellent brief and on the manner in which it has been presented.  It is most helpful, even from the point of view of reference. I should like to start off on what appears to me to be the most urgent need of the times in which we live.  I will describe it in two words&mdash; crime prevention.  Perhaps I should describe it as future crime prevention because one of the areas to which the Department of Justice appear to have been giving insufficient attention is the area affecting young offenders.  For too long this section has been the Department's poor relation, not enough attention having been given to it.</P>
      <P>The Minister referred to the open centres we now have for young offenders.  He also mentioned the increase in the numbers of such offenders and spoke about the recreation facilities being provided in these centres.  I submit that if greater attention had been given to recreational facilities outside these centres we would not have so many offenders in them.  The number of young people under detention is a fairly good indication of the number of adults there will be in the years to come.  Unless the juvenile problem is examined the seventies could be the decade of violence. This has been borne out by the increase in vandalism and all types of crimes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Some years ago I was very unhappy about what was then called the probation service.  I am glad to see that this has been improved&mdash;not just by the new Government, because the previous Government also recognised the need for improvement.  A person who used be called a probation officer is now called a juvenile liaison officer or a welfare officer.  There were, I think, 47 of them and the number will now be increased to 80.  The number of probation officers engaged full-time by the Department of Justice in 1968-69 was five with roughly 300 cases each, when the recommended load would be 30 to 40.  Of course, one has to be terribly dedicated to <Col N="787" /> persevere in the job.  People quickly lost courage and confidence because there was no back-up.  This service was regarded for too long as the poor relation of the Department of Justice. I believe there is a greater desire now to do something positive about it.</P>
    <P>I have always been very happy about the interest that gardaí have taken in youth clubs, nearly always on an entirely voluntary basis in their spare time.  I am glad that the Minister is appointing gardaí in the capacity of liaison officers with youth clubs.  This is very important for a number of reasons, not the least being that young people who may be in trouble learn to have respect and liking for the gardaí generally.  We are lucky in this country in that our gardaí are very respected by the public.  I would go so far as to say that they are liked and respected except, perhaps, when they stop one on the way home when one has had too much to drink.  Fortunately, that has never happened to me.  I do not drink too much.</P>
    <P>We have an excellent Garda force. I should like to pay a tribute to them and to echo many of the remarks made by the Minister.  I should like, as a Member of this House, as a member of the public, as an ordinary citizen, to ask them to accept sincere thanks from me and from my family and I would say from 99 per cent of the people for the difficult task they do, very often under dangerous conditions, particularly in these days.  I should also like to pay a tribute to their wives and children who have to suffer the anxiety of wondering whether they will come home in one piece.  They deserve thanks and appreciation. Many people feel this but we do not say it often enough.</P>
    <P>I am delighted that the task of issuing parking tickets has been taken away from Garda.  This was damaging the image of the Garda and it was not something they should have been doing.  I would carry that as far as the gardaí on point duty.  The Minister might look at the possibility of training an auxiliary force of some sort to <Col N="788" /> do things like point duty and to handle traffic matters at busy weekends and so on.  The gardaí should get as much leave as possible when it can be had.  I know that leave has been at a premium many times recently.</P>
    <P>I should like to pay a tribute too, to the Special Branch, the men who are very often the objects of disdain and contempt, most often unfairly. Those men who protect the institutions of State, who protect democracy, are very brave men whose lives are always at risk.  Sometimes when one praises people like this it is said that one is in favour of a police State. Every State must have adequate protection. If it were not for the work of such men in every democratic State the State would not last long.</P>
    <P>I should like to come back to the members of the Garda who are engaged on youth work.  They maintain an active liaison with youth clubs, boxing clubs and various organisations. I should like to see greater liaison between youth clubs and the special schools, which come under the Department of Education.  There is a sort of conflict here.  One of the difficulties today is that youth care comes under so many different Departments, particularly the Department of Education and the Department of Justice.  This will probably be used as the quote of the week but civil servants are human too and there may be a certain amount of friction when somebody infringes on another person's area.  I know that the civil servants are concerned for the wellbeing of the young people but sometimes there can be friction.  I would like to see a situation in which when a young person was being released from one of those schools the local youth club would be notified.  The local garda would understand the conditions of the young person's home and he could perhaps explain to the youth leader in the area: &ldquo;Johnny needs looking after.  His parents go out drinking every night and are not really interested in him.  He will end up in trouble again.  See if you can involve him.&rdquo;  This is a very important function.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="789" /> I see the Minister is appointing two additional officers: appoint a dozen; there is no shortage of work.  In spite of the fact that they are engaged full-time at it they are still working probably 16 to 18 hours a day.  This is a very lively issue.  As you know, because of the lack of facilities for young people, only 30 per cent of our youth are actually catered for by youth clubs.  They cannot take any more; they are full up.  That is why the job of getting the young person off the street and into the youth club is an extremely difficult one if these centres do not exist.  I think there could be a contribution from the Department of Justice Estimate also towards helping to provide some of the funds for these facilities.  As I have said before, it is no use building them in the detention centres or in prisons when it is already too late.  I am not saying that they should not be built; of course, they should be built there, but many of these young people who end up there would not be there had there been a youth club in their area.</P>
    <P>It is a vast subject and much consultation is needed.  I was interested listening to Deputy Enright speaking because he believes in going out into the field as well, visiting and doing his own research.  I do not think you can learn it all from a book; you have got to go out and find out what conditions are like.  As one person who believes in doing this, I can recognise another person who also believes in doing the same thing.  I visited the Children's Court some time ago because I had not seen it in session.  I know there is a new children's court being built. The court which we have is very dismal. We have an excellent District Justice who is generally in charge of it and who is well known for her good work in relation to young people. There is nothing wrong whatsoever with the justice being meted out but the conditions of the court room itself leave a lot to be desired.  Obviously they do because there would not be a new court being built if that was not so.</P>
    <P>One of the things which struck me lately is that there has been quite a lot of talk about the panel system <Col N="790" /> that operates in Scotland.  I should like to find out from the Minister if we made any study of the panel system and if we can adapt it to Irish needs.  I am not in favour of copying for the sake of copying or because others appear to be more humane in their treatment of young offenders and so on.  Young offenders too, can be a euphemism because some of these young offenders can be fairly dangerous, depending on what you term a &ldquo;young offender&rdquo;.  There are some 16 or 17 year-old offenders who have got very grown up minds and whose ability to commit crime is greater than that of many adults, perhaps from having a greater intellect misapplied.  I do not want anyone to think that I am one of those supersoft liberals who believes in soft-soaping everything else.  What I am interested in doing is creating conditions that will reduce the amount of crime.  Deputy Enright referred to the Minister instigating inquiries as to what causes it.  We have a fairly good idea what causes it.  If you speak to any leader of any sizeable youth organisation he will be able to tell you and, likewise, if you talk to the members of the Garda force who are engaged in the work.  They know what causes it.  A lot of it is the lack of interest shown by many parents in their children.  Somebody said recently that there is no substitute for a good home.  I agree with that; there is no substitute for a good home but, unfortunately, not every home is good.  This is something we have to realise is going to require real money, real concentration, if we are to get anywhere because these are the young people of tomorrow.  If these statistics prove anything, they show that acts of violence and malicious damages are increasing; they are not reducing. We have to act, and act quickly.</P>
    <P>It is a tragedy, because of the situation affecting security in our country today, that so much of the effort and the time of our Department of Justice is taken up at looking first and foremost&mdash;most importantly, in my view and the view, I would think of everybody here&mdash;at the security of the State.  But at what a <Col N="791" /> cost to the young people, to the young lives we should be helping.  This is one of the side effects, if you like, of violence.  This is one of the side effects of the so-called patriots; that they condemn a generation of children to violence by not allowing, through their activities, the use of funds that could be put into the kind of work we are talking about, the provision of proper facilities and of more people engaged on youth work.</P>
    <P>One of the very worthwhile organisations we have is the National Youth Council of which I am sure the Minister is aware and to which there are at least 30 youth organisations affiliated, organisations like Macra na Feirme, Macra na Tuaithe, the scouts, girl guides and so on.  I think the Minister might make a note to consult these people in relation to the panel system about which I spoke a few moments ago.  In fact, they sent youth officers to Scotland to study it.  They came back; they have a report on it; they found there were many things which would not suit our needs but they also found there were things which would suit the Irish needs.  They are authoritative on it; they have gone out themselves; they have found out about it.  If there has not already been, I hope there will be consultation with the Minister and his Department as to their experience. Nothing can be lost by it.  In fact, if they have not consulted with the Department, the Minister might send an invitation to the people who went out to discuss, with his officials, their experience because there may be something to be gained by it.  In fact, I know there will be something to be gained by it.  Again, these are people who are dedicated and very enthusiastic about what they are doing.  These are the people who should be heeded, the people who are actively engaged, many of them on a voluntary basis; these are the people who are dealing with the problem.  You may set up all the commissions you like to study this, that and the other but unless you consult the people engaged in that field of activity &mdash;and I am sure these commissions do &mdash;you may only be going around the subject.  The people who are genuinely <Col N="792" /> dedicated should be consulted and will appreciate being consulted.</P>
    <P>One of the needs&mdash;and again this cuts across education, because education looks after the special schools and it is through the Department of Justice that offenders end up in special schools &mdash;is an intensive care unit of sorts for 15 and 16 year old offenders.  Nothing can be done with many of them; they can be kept sentenced for a minimum of a year and then they have to be let out of these places.  What is needed is a special unit to care for some of these really hard cases who have no respect for the law, who laugh at authority.  I am speaking now from knowledge gleaned from a conversation I had with a person who is engaged in this field, who deals with these people and who knows what he is talking about.  If there is a hard core who can corrupt a lot of people it is a waste of time sending them to these places where children who are, if you like, moderately bad, who have a tremendous hope of coming out&mdash;I do not like the word &ldquo;rehabilitated&rdquo;&mdash; having been looked after, having been cared for, given proper food&mdash;and most of those children had been neglected badly, suffering from many deficiencies in their diets and many of them are mentally retarded because of this.</P>
    <P>There is a need for a special place for young girls who get into trouble. They are the most neglected of our young people.  One or two places take these girls but they can refuse if the girls are very bad.  As everybody knows, a bad woman can be worse than a bad man.  A place is needed for hard cases.  When hard cases are put with not so bad cases it puts a great strain on those who are trying to help.  This is a very wide field and there is still much to be done.</P>
    <P>When young offenders are sentenced to a term in these centres they are taken many miles from where they live.  They should be kept in their own environment.  There should be special schools in all our cities.  Such a school was opened in Lusk.</P>
    <P>The Minister referred to community responsibility and I agree fully with him.  The community have a responsibility <Col N="793" /> and must be made aware of it.  The Minister referred to the need for greater public awareness. There is no point in imposing an institution on a community if they do not want it.  We talk about youth clubs in many areas.  People will agree that it is a great thing but they do not want a club situated near them.  They do not realise what work is involved. They have peculiar ideas about it. Their attitudes to the young offenders in their own areas are that they want them kept away.  They do not want to know about them.  Let the law look after them.  They break the law and the law is responsible for bringing them to court and sending them away. There is a tremendous need for greater community awareness.</P>
    <P>Many organisations operate as pressure groups in particular spheres. For example, NATO will put pressure on rates one day, or purchase houses another or ACRA will put pressure on mortgages.  These community orientated organisations are trying to develop community awareness.  They should go further.  They should recognise that there are social needs within each area which must be looked at. There is a great need today to remind the public that they have a responsibility to their community.  I am all in favour of community organisations including those for young offenders who go astray.  This will have to be spelled out more often by more talks.</P>
    <P>When I speak on the Department of Justice Estimate I am very much aware that I am not a lawyer.  I think I am the first non-lawyer to speak on this debate.  I have only a layman's view.  Since the majority of the Irish people are laymen, I hope I am putting their views forward.  When one is too close to the law, one realises the difficulties with which one is confronted. There is a famous quote: &ldquo;Some people ask why and I ask why not.&rdquo;  Sometimes out of ignorance of the law and the way it operates can come intelligent questions.</P>
    <P>In his speech the Minister referred to the crime statistics, the increase in certain crimes and the decrease in others.  He will agree that we took a lot of &ldquo;stick&rdquo; when we were in Government <Col N="794" /> because of the number of armed robberies.  I did not see this figure in the Minister's speech.  I had planned to put down a question but perhaps the Minister in his reply will answer it.  How many armed robberies occurred in 1973 as against 1972?  My belief is that there has been an enormous increase in the number of armed robberies in Dublin.  These are difficult times.  I remember saying, when the violence broke out in 1969, that the longer the violence continued the more adept the men of violence would become at using their weapons.  That is why I fear the continuation of violence.  Is this being shown in the number of armed robberies for which people have not been apprehended? I hope not.  If it is, we should take a hard look at our security.</P>
    <P>The Minister started the traffic corps last April.  He said that the unit was set up to concentrate on the enforcement of traffic laws and the prevention of road accidents.  We all agree that the number of cases of careless driving which we see everyday compared with the number which actually reach the courts is infinitesimal. How many drivers have been prosecuted for exceeding the new speed limit of 50-miles per hour?  I have seen this regulation being flaunted on many occasions.  I approve of this regulation for two reasons.  In the first instance it saves petrol, the motorists' way of keeping down the balance of payments, and it has been shown that in countries where the 50 miles per hour limit operates fewer fatal accidents have occurred.  The general impression here is that there have been fewer road deaths since the introduction of this 50-mile per hour limit.  They are two reasons for keeping the 50-mile per hour limit for as long as possible.  In this connection I have not seen any evidence, or any reports in newspapers, of court proceedings arising out of motorists exceeding the 50-miles per hour limit.</P>
    <P>The Minister informed the House of his intention to establish a new motoring court.  He stated that accommodation had been provided beside the Four Courts, on a temporary basis, <Col N="795" /> for use as an additional District Court for traffic cases.  For some time I have been advocating the need for a night court to deal with motoring offences specifically.  Very often two years can elapse before a motoring case reaches court and during that time the guard in question may have retired.  In my view the effect of this is that the gardaí are reluctant to prosecute. The committee which the Minister has sitting should have a look at this matter to see if it is possible to establish such night courts similar to those operating in certain parts of the United States.  Something has to be done because there is an indifferent, almost callous disregard for human life on the roads.</P>
    <P>It seldom happens that a motorist will stop to permit a pedestrian to cross the road.  Regularly one sees the difficulty elderly people experience when trying to cross our roads because of the heavy volume of traffic and the attitude of the motorists.  I do not know what happens to people when they get behind the wheel of a motor car.  It is possible that they get rid of all their frustrations when they are in control of a car.  However, the number of people maimed as a result of motor accidents may also be due to lack of enforcement of the law because of the absence of backing up for the Garda.  It is not necessary that such night courts should be confined to the city of Dublin.  Such courts could also function in Cork, Limerick or Athlone.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMarkCooney" hpid="Mr. Cooney Mr. Cooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cooney</NameTxt>
      <P>There is no demand in Athlone for such a court.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BenBriscoe" hpid="Mr. Briscoe Mr. Briscoe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Briscoe</NameTxt>
      <P>We all recognise the work FLAC are doing.  I am sure the Minister would be the first to recognise that the £5,000 he is giving to that organisation is only a recognition of what they are doing rather than the kind of money which they need to carry out the work they are doing. In my view this organisation require a minimum of £200,000, but it is possible that there are other ways of financing them.  For instance, where the organisation have offices rented the Department of Justice might consider <Col N="796" /> paying that rent for them.  They are doing an excellent job in that organisation.  I accept also, that there are members of the legal profession, not involved in this organisation, who give their services free to those who cannot afford to pay, to contest cases.</P>
      <P>We all support many of the proposals of AIM, particularly that in relation to deserted wives.  Where a husband absconds leaving his wife and children without a means of support there should be some way in which his wages can be attached.  I would support any proposals necessary in that respect.  That is always providing, of course, that the husband left of his own accord and was not driven out of the house.</P>
      <P>Some years ago, when legislation in relation to extradition was being introduced, I asked that provision be made to bring back men from Britain who deserted their wives in order to make them pay maintenance to their wives and families but I was told on that occasion that, because there was no similar law in Britain, we could not do anything about it.  While there is still no such law in Britain we should, through the EEC, be pressing for this kind of a regulation to make it possible for a person to be extradited for desertion of his wife and family.  That is one of the worst types of criminal offences a human being can commit.</P>
      <P>The Minister has informed us that he intends to introduce legislation dealing with personal injury compensation to be payable by the tribunal.  I emphasise personal injury because at times people cannot be monetarily compensated for injury.  There is no mention of damage to property due to, for instance, bomb explosions.  I am concerned about the number of malicious injury claims before the courts at present which, even if they are halved by the courts, will put a great burden on the ratepayers of this city.  The ratepayers of north Tipperary also have a £2 million claim hanging over them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Where damage is caused by bomb explosions this should be met by the Exchequer.  We introduced the Nelson Pillar Act of 1966 in order to pay for <Col N="797" /> the damage caused by the Nelson Pillar explosion.  It does not take very long to prepare such an Act.  One thing which is worrying me at present is the claim arising out of the fire at Dockrell's.  This is for £2 million and I do not see how that can be cut down by the courts to anything less.  When one recognises that 2½p on the rates brings in in the region of £90,000 an imposition on the rates of £2 million would be unbearable.  This brings me to a point that is tragic.  I refer to the number of people who have not the money with which to pay their rates and, consequently, are taken to court. The tragedy of this is that such people, particularly the older generation, regard it as a personal disgrace to be brought before the courts. Very often it is their policy not to borrow money because of their belief that they should live within their means.  In many of these cases one finds that possessions have been sold and that there is no possibility of qualification for a waiver of rates.  When these people go to court the justice may put a stay on the payment issue if he is satisfied that the money is not available.  That, then, would be the end of the matter.</P>
    <P>However, the point is that generally these people do not wish to go to court under any circumstances.  If arrangements could be made to have such cases heard <i>in camera</i> less distress would be caused, although I am glad to say that I have never yet read in the papers a case of anyone who had been brought to court for non-payment of rates.  I suppose this is because the Press is not interested in muckraking of that kind.  Nevertheless, these people live in fear of others becoming aware of their misfortune.  Perhaps some special arrangements might be made for dealing with such cases. Time and again I have tried to assure people who are being pressed for their rates but who cannot pay that there is no disgrace in poverty but they do not like the use of the word &ldquo;poverty&rdquo;. I say to them that they are better off not having the money than is a person who has the money but who needs it for a purpose other than the payment of rates.  I try to dispel <Col N="798" /> their fears as best I can.  The day of removing property from person's houses has long past.</P>
    <P>Let it not be thought that I would encourage people not to pay their rates but I try to give some sort of assurance to those who are driven almost to a suicidal mentality because of their inability to pay.  Literally, they worry themselves to death and this happens in many more cases than is realised.  It is important, therefore, that legislation be enacted to deal with this problem of rates.  We are not a savage society.  As the Minister is aware, claims totalling £8 million are before the court in respect of malicious damages.  Of this amount £1 million is in respect of bombings while the remaining £7 million relates to vandalism.  There are 17,000 separate cases of vandalism before the courts. People will not be able to pay the increased amount that this would impose on the rates.  I am not concerned so much about those who cannot pay and who do not worry about it, rather, I am concerned for those who worry because they cannot pay.</P>
    <P>When he is introducing a Bill to deal with the question of compensation perhaps the Minister would make provision also for damages caused by acts of violence.  When many of the present laws were enacted any malicious damages that there might have been were of a minor nature but times have changed very much.  Last year, for instance, the amount paid by Dublin Corporation as a result of claims was £300,000. This year the figure is £600,000.  What is to happen in relation to the Dockrell's claim for £2 million?  It is obvious that some steps must be taken to change the present situation.  The Government may say that they will not provide funds to cover compensation but the people will not be able to provide such funds either.</P>
    <P>The next point I wish to deal with is that concerning changes in the adoption law.  I am glad to hear that progress is being made in respect of a Bill in this regard.  I find it very depressing to speculate on the number <Col N="799" /> of children who are in orphanages but who might not be there if our laws were different.  I refer to children who may now be six or seven years old and for whom there is now no possibility of adoption, children who have become institutionalised.</P>
    <P>Let me make it clear that I have nothing but the greatest admiration for those people who devote their lives to looking after children in orphanages.  They take on this work because of a sense of love and dedication but, be that as it way, there can be no substitute for a good home. The individual love that a child receives at home must have an advantage over the group love that he will receive in an institution.  It would be interesting to ascertain the number of people who get into trouble after leaving institutions.  I do not know of any instances of adopted children here having been ill-treated. People who adopt children do so because of a genuine desire to have those children.  The Minister can be assured of the full support of this side of the House for any Bill that will change the present situation.  It is an area in which the Minister expressed an interest on many occasions before ever he became Minister and I know that while in office he looks forward to introducing the various reforms that are necessary.  Changes can never be made without there being offence caused to somebody because it is impossible to please everybody but in the context in which we are speaking the most important point is to think first of the good of the child.  All laws relating to young people should be framed with this priority in mind.</P>
    <P>I would refer briefly to the Children's Act of 1908.  This is an Act to which there have been very few amendments.  I would like to hear from the Minister whether any progress is being made towards producing an entirely new charter in respect of the rights of children.  Much of the present law is very haphazard.  One area infringes on another and different Departments are involved.  Not <Col N="800" /> everyone will agree with me on this but from talking with people engaged in the sphere of the protection of the rights of children it is my belief that we need a department of the family for the purpose of bringing together the various aspects that are involved in this field.  I suppose it is a reflection on us that the 1908 Act has been amended in such few respects.  Today there is a much greater awareness of the need for work in this field.  It is all right to say that changes should have been made long ago but when we became independent we were poverty stricken and we had to pull ourselves up by our boot straps, we had to house our people and do many other essential things.  Survival came first and all other matters had to take their place along the line.</P>
    <P>Now the time has come for change. I will not use the word &ldquo;radical&rdquo; because I do not like it.  I am as careful about change as anyone else.  If there are sudden changes it is usually the case that someone gets hurt.  Matters should be carefully thought out so that when the time comes for decision-making all the facts are available.</P>
    <P>I do not want to be thought narrowminded. A man wrote to me once and called me &ldquo;another &lsquo;cowl&rsquo; in the Dáil&rdquo; because I had made a reference to censorship to which he had objected. I am as broad-minded as the next person. I believe an adult is entitled to read and see what he wants so long as he is not damaging anyone in the process. In my life I have met only one person who told me he was totally against censorship.  I told him that everyone is in favour of some form of censorship.  Even though a person may say he is against censorship, if one asks him if he would allow his child to read a certain book he will probably say that is a different matter.</P>
    <P>If the Minister could spare a few hours I should like him to see a film now showing in Dublin.  I was tempted to put down a facetious question to ask when the position of film censor had been dispensed with but I decided that was not the way to go about the matter.  The film I have mentioned is not one I think young people should <Col N="801" /> see.  I am not narrow-minded, neither am I an excessive liberal.  We have a responsibility in these matters.  The film I referred to has a message for young people but I believe the majority of them will be intelligent enough to reject it.  Perhaps the Minister would ask one of his officials to see this film &mdash;he might get him a good Pullman seat.</P>
    <P>There is a treamendous appetite for sadistic violence in films.  I consider this is more immoral and dangerous than nudity.  Such films tend to desensitise people.  We have been desensitised to violence and horror with regard to occurrences in the North because of the constant spate of films we see.  We accept the sudden dismembering of human beings as something that happens.  We profoundly hope it will not happen to us or to our families but that is the extent of our emotion.  I hope the film censor will keep a careful eye on films containing sadistic violence.  I referred previously to what are called the &ldquo;dollar&rdquo; films &mdash;the &ldquo;Fistful of Dollar&rdquo; type of picture&mdash;some of which were very bloody.  They get tremendous attendances and rake in the money but I wonder at what cost to our society. Later I will tell the Minister the name of the film I have in mind&mdash;perhaps he may not agree with my views.</P>
    <P>Frequently an organisation is started with a very good intention; it may be a community or a group of people who are interested in a particular matter.  Then the smart guys from the various subversive organisations infiltrate it and gradually the original movement disappears.  One such group was very active originally, but not to the same extent nowadays, and the reason may be that it was taken over by people who had not its real interests at heart.  I may be in trouble for the comments I am about to make.  I am referring to the Flatdwellers' Association.</P>
    <P>There are flatdwellers in this city who are getting a raw deal from landlords. Young men and girls who work in the city are spending huge portions of their weekly pay for miserable flats.  Frequently the corporation are unaware of the existence of the <Col N="802" /> flats because the owners are afraid information would be given to the Revenue Commissioners and they may have to pay tax on income that might not be declared.  This is one of the reasons many people who live in flats are not included in the voting register because when the relevant form is delivered to the house the landlord destroys it.  Many people who live in flats have found they were excluded from the register and I wonder if this is the reason.  The majority of landlords are fair but there are many others who do not give a good service.</P>
    <P>I do not know what progress has been made in compiling a register of landlords who own flats.  Perhaps the Minister would have some information on the matter.  I know they were active a few years ago and wanted such a register.  This should be done. Every other business is registered and a person who has flats is in business.  People who live in flats should be considered.  We must not always give attention to those who shout the loudest.  There are many worthwhile causes where there is no organised appeal.  The flatdwellers-need some kind of recognition that something will be done about their plight.</P>
    <P>With reference to the appointment of the new public prosecutor and the announcement that representations could not be made to him in relation to any cases before the courts, I am as aware as anyone in the House that the functions of the judiciary and Parliament are clearly defined in the Constitution and there should be no conflict.  When one is asked to make representations about a case, a public representative should be permitted to make certain all the facts are known, particularly when a district justice may have handed out what seemed to be a harsh sentence.</P>
    <P>I made representations to the Minister for Justice on previous occasions for parents who felt that their son or their daughter had got into trouble because all the facts of the case had not been put before the court.  When additional facts are given, the district justice who decided the case looks <Col N="803" /> over them and decides whether he will alter the decision he made.  Sometimes he does and sometimes he does not.  In my view that is not an interference with justice.  Some people may claim it is, but I do not feel it is.</P>
    <P>As a public representative you must at all times be allowed access to people in all parts of the public service.  I am not saying one should be able to tell a judge, or a public prosecutor, or the Minister for Justice, what to do but one should be able to make representations. There is nothing wrong with that. A very funny narrow line is drawn.  I learned that for one job it is stated that personal canvassing will disqualify. I was asked to canvass for somebody and I asked: &ldquo;Does it say anything about canvassing disqualifying?&rdquo; I was told it did but: &ldquo;You know how it is.&rdquo;  I said that if he could find out the names of the other people who were looking for the job and canvass for them he would be the only person left who did not canvass and he would get the job.  One person said: &ldquo;You are not allowed to canvass but you can send a reference.&rdquo;  I thought to myself: &ldquo;There is a very narrow line there.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I would like the Minister to say whether a public representative can write a letter to the prosecutor pointing out certain facts.  Is he completely prohibited from doing that?  Is that it? Do the doors clang shut?  Is there no way in which hardship at home or some other factor which might be taken into consideration and which the court were not aware of could be brought to their attention?  I know the person has a right to appeal.  I do not believe anyone should exercise political influence to get somebody off for a crime he has committed.  Everybody must recognise the right of a public representative to draw attention to certain features of a particular case and how a person's whole future life may be determined because of a foolish act.  Judges themselves would be the first to agree that not every judge makes a perfect decision every time. If they did we would not have courts of appeal where very often the decision is changed.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="804" /> Deputy Andrews dealt with the patronage system which apparently still operates.  The Attorney General said it would not operate when they came into Government but the fact is that, up to a month ago, not one barrister who had known Fianna Fáil sympathies was engaged on a case by the State.  If you put this type of thing down in the form of a question it is &ldquo;old hat&rdquo; and you are trying to make a fuss.  The facts are there and a debate like this is the best place to air them.  I think this is wrong.</P>

      <P>I understand that there have been imports of beef into Great Britain from Germany in recent months at the rate of about 300-400 tons a week.  This beef is mainly of forequarters and is consigned direct to manufacturers' premises.  Information is not available in regard to beef sold to manufacturers but such quantity as reaches Smithfield is sold at a price of 18p to 19½p per lb.</P>
      <P>These imports undoubtedly have some influence on the forequarter trade generally which is also affected by the recent heavy slaughterings of cows in the United Kingdom.</P>

At recent meetings of the Council of Ministers I pressed strongly for additional measures to strengthen the beef market which included the prohibition of imports of beef from third countries.  This proposal was not acceptable to the council which, however, adopted measures such as export restitutions, extention of the intervention system and aids to private storage to strengthen the market.

      <P>The interest of this country generally is in the export of beef rather than veal and our exports of veal are not therefore significant. In July last, after consultation with the farm organisations I sought and obtained a derogation from certain EEC monetary compensatory arrangements which would have applied unduly favourable import charges elsewhere in the Community to calves and other young animals as compared with adult cattle and beef.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Clinton</NameTxt>
      <P>With your permission, a Cheann Comhairle, I propose to take Questions Nos. 19 to 22 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On 10th July last when replying to questions by Deputies Haughey and Cronin I gave detailed information about the FEOGA scheme of grants for structural projects in agricultural production and marketing, including information about the number of applications received under the 1973 scheme, the number and value of those recommended and forwarded to the EEC Commission, the agricultural sectors to which they related and the <Col N="822" /> position in regard to the allocation of funds between member states for the purposes of the scheme.  I also described the steps taken to publicise the scheme and the arrangements for the processing and handling of applications. Decisions by the Commission on the 1973 applications have not yet been announced.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GerardCollins" hpid="Mr. G. Collins Mr. G. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>Arising out of whatever part of that answer deals with Question No. 22, I would like the Minister to tell us the number of people within his Department who are specifically involved in advising on and processing Irish FEOGA grant applications for 1973?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MarkAClinton" hpid="Mr. Clinton Mr. Clinton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Clinton</NameTxt>
      <P>I have an additional note on this.  A number of Government Departments and State agencies were involved including, of course, the Industrial Development Authority. About 50 applications were dealt with directly by my Department and a large number of officers from various branches of the Department were involved to a greater or lesser extent in examining and processing them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardCollins" hpid="Mr. G. Collins Mr. G. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Collins</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MarkAClinton" hpid="Mr. Clinton Mr. Clinton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Clinton</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think this number can be given at any particular time.  We have at the moment only three applications from the 1974 list. What happens in all these schemes is that, at the 11th hour, applications flood in in case they are going to be late.  Then, naturally, you have to get a large number of people from every section of the Department to process these applications as quickly as possible and get them in.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MarkAClinton" hpid="Mr. Clinton Mr. Clinton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Clinton</NameTxt>

      <P>Will the Minister comment on the view held by many people that his Department were guilty of delays with regard to advertising this particular scheme and that the advertisements appeared late?  This is, <Col N="824" /> possibly, evidenced by the fact that applications were received very late.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MarkAClinton" hpid="Mr. Clinton Mr. Clinton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Clinton</NameTxt>
      <P>No matter what scheme is advertised the same thing will happen.  Very wide publicity has already been given to the 1974 scheme of grants.  Further publicity measures will be undertaken from time to time in addition to Press advertising.  Detailed memoranda on the subject have been issued by my Department to over 200 organisations covering all branches of agriculture.  The IDA are concerned with applications relating to marketing and processing projects.  They have literature for potential applicants.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Clinton</NameTxt>
      <P>With your permission a Cheann Comhairle, I propose to take Questions Nos. 28 to 33 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="831" /> A difficult situation for our pig producers has developed over recent weeks due, on the one hand, to the rise in feed prices and, on the other, to downward fluctuations in pigmeat prices on our main export market, Britain.  The present high prices for feed are world-wide and pig producers in Northern Ireland and Britain have been similarly affected.</P>
    <P>Fluctuations in pig prices are to be expected in the freer trade conditions obtaining in the EEC.  Such fluctuations also occurred last year, but on the whole, that year was a profitable one for pig producers.  In these circumstances it is important that pig producers should stay in the business and refrain from selling off more sows to factories as some appear to have been doing recently.  It should be accepted that periods of reduced profitability must be balanced against those periods when profits are good. Recent sales of sows, however, which include sows imported from Northern Ireland, are partly due to the current good demand and prices for sows for special markets and for processing and do not necessarily indicate any significant movement out of pig production.</P>
    <P>I am keeping the whole situation under review in consultation with the interests concerned.  I may mention that the EEC Commission's price proposals for the coming year include an increase of 8 per cent in the basic price for pigmeat and I am pressing at the Council of Ministers to secure the best arrangements possible in that respect.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GerardCollins" hpid="Mr. G. Collins Mr. G. Collins">

      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>I will be very brief with my supplementary.  It is heartening to see that the Minister is aware of the crisis in the pig industry but is he serious when he says that the advice he is giving those involved in the industry is to stick it, to stay together on it?  This advice, I am sure the Minister would agree&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="GerardCollins" hpid="Mr. G. Collins Mr. G. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to know from the Minister why he believes that people involved in the pig industry who are getting £3.50 less for pigs now than they did before Christmas will be able to stay in the industry and how the small pig producer can ride out this storm?  How can he hope to stay in the business?  Can the Minister say if any subsidy can be made available to tide him over?</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MarkAClinton" hpid="Mr. Clinton Mr. Clinton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Clinton</NameTxt>
      <P>It depends on how small you get.  There is no doubt about it if you are too small in the business and you are not otherwise occupied there will not be much profit in pigs in the future.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GerardCollins" hpid="Mr. G. Collins Mr. G. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Collins</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="MarkAClinton" hpid="Mr. Clinton Mr. Clinton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Clinton</NameTxt>
      <P>It is very difficult to decide what is the dividing line.  The EEC people who discussed this have decided they would base their grants on a 20 sow unit, as the Deputy knows, or a 200 pig fattening unit.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GerardCollins" hpid="Mr. G. Collins Mr. G. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Collins</NameTxt>

There is one particular factory where up to 80 or 90 are going in.  Is the Minister also aware that I know a factory where they offered a sow free to their employees to bring home to farrow but because of the cost of feeding stuffs they would not take the sow to get the bonhams free?</P>

    <Speaker pid="MarkAClinton" hpid="Mr. Clinton Mr. Clinton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Clinton</NameTxt>
      <P>I have done the only thing that was open to me to do.  Mind you, I had a lot of consultations with farming organisations and everybody else on this and I asked them for their suggestions.  The one thing we could do was to ask the EEC in the case where at present we are getting no import subsidy on grain not to ask us to pay compensatory monetary amounts on exports of pig meat because we are practically competing on level terms with third countries in the British market at the moment, Poland mainly.  The Commissioner at the last meeting offered to look at this seriously and see if anything could be done.  If we secure this it will mean approximately 50s. per pig.  I hope this may happen.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Clinton</NameTxt>
      <P>I understand from the Pigs and Bacon Commission that their export outlets are predominantly in Europe where price returns are more attractive.  The Commission keeps <Col N="837" /> other markets under constant review with a view to exploiting any profitable opportunities that may arise.</P>
      <P>The Commission did not export bacon or pork to markets outside Europe during the past six months either because these markets were closed to imports or the Commission's efforts to obtain business failed because of price considerations. Three factories are exporting limited quantities of canned and pre-packed products to the US market.  Information on the quantity and prices of such exports in the past six months is not available.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MarkAClinton" hpid="Mr. Clinton Mr. Clinton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Clinton</NameTxt>
      <P>It has all along been the policy of my Department and of the Pigs and Bacon Commission to foster the diversified processing of pigmeat, particularly for export markets. A substantial trade to Britain in different pork cuts has been developed and bacon sides also are being cut to various specifications for that market. Pork in the form of special cuts is also being supplied to the Italian market. One bacon factory has for some years past established a totally diversified trade in cured pigmeat products and another factory has recently undertaken a special canned ham and bacon export project to the USA.</P>
      <P>The Pigs and Bacon Commission is taking further measures to promote the export of bacon and pork in diversified form to the greatest extent possible in order to reduce our vulnerability to price fluctuations associated with the traditional carcase trade.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Callanan</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries if, in regard to recent EEC directive No. 159 on farm modernisation, he is aware of the uneasiness of the farmers in the <Col N="846" /> transitional group as to their future; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MarkAClinton" hpid="Mr. Clinton Mr. Clinton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Clinton</NameTxt>
      <P>The farm modernisation scheme, which is designed to give effect to the EEC Directive 159/72, provides for generous levels of aid to farmers in the transitional group. These aids, which will continue to operate at least until 1977, will enable many transitional farmers to build up their resources and to attain the status of development farmers.  There is no reason to assume that appropriate measures of assistance for such farmers will not be continued after 1977.  Large numbers of them will, of course, also qualify for special aids under the scheme for mountain and less-favoured areas which will be introduced in due course to give effect to the EEC directive relating to such areas.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnCallanan" hpid="Mr. Callanan Mr. Callanan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Callanan</NameTxt>
      <P>The reason I am seeking a debate on this matter is that experts, writing in a well-known journal in regard to this directive, have stated that the subvention being given to transitional farmers is merely for the purpose of keeping them at their present rate of production.  If that is so, how can any of those farmers hope to become developing farmers?  I am entitled to three supplementaries on my question and I would ask the Chair to be kind enough to allow me avail of the opportunity of asking them.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Callanan</NameTxt>
      <P>I cannot quote here at Question Time but I assure the Minister that the report appeared in a very important journal.  This subvention does not apply to farmers who are more than 55 years years of age <Col N="847" /> but for those who are less than that age the subvention is to apply for a period of five years so as to keep them at their present rate of production. Therefore, about 70 per cent of the farmers of Ireland would be put out of business.</P>

      <P>With the permission of the Ceann Comhairle, I propose to take Questions Nos. 46 and 47 together.</P>
      <P>Firstly, I should point out that instructors are employed by committees of agriculture and that I have written to each Chairman to ask his committee to operate the farm modernisation scheme.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The scheme has been the subject of discussions with the Irish Agricultural Advisers' Organisation and various other bodies concerned with its operation. <Col N="852" /> The IAAO have expressed dissatisfaction with certain aspects of the operational arrangements, particularly the requirement that classification of applicants and the farm development plans drawn up for them, must have the approval of my Department. Since the bulk of the expenditure under the scheme falls on the Exchequer and since responsibility rests with my Department, this arrangement is the only acceptable one.</P>
    <P>It is not possible to say at this stage to what extent the existing corps of instructors will be able to cope with the work arising under the scheme or what numbers of extra staff may ultimately be required.  The matter will be kept under review.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Meaney</NameTxt>

    <P>Under the EEC marketing system the price of grain is subject to market forces as long as the price is above the relevant intervention price.  Last year there was a large and unexpected increase in grain prices after the <Col N="863" /> harvest and holders of grain profited accordingly.

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MarkAClinton" hpid="Mr. Clinton Mr. Clinton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Clinton</NameTxt>
      <P>It is clearly desirable that the processing and manufacturing <Col N="873" /> of Irish agricultural products should, as far as practicable, be undertaken by concerns owned and controlled by Irish people.  There is already a high degree of Irish ownership and participation in these industries and I am confident that this situation will continue.  It has to be recognised of course that, in certain circumstances, advantages in the fields of management, markets and technology, not otherwise readily obtainable, may accrue from foreign investment. Such investment is often necessary or desirable in the interests of the food processing industry as a whole and of the farming community.  However, while it is not possible under the Treaty of Rome to restrict, on grounds of nationality, investment by nationals of other member countries of the EEC, the objective of Government policy will be to encourage maximum participation by Irish interests and to preserve an acceptable balance between home and foreign ownership.</P>

      <P>While I appreciate the Deputy's concern.  I would like to remind him that an intention to increase fish landings on the Kerry coast cannot be isolated from overall plans for the development of Irish sea fisheries as a whole in accordance with the established programme.</P>
      <P>The operation of an overall plan is essential at the present stage of development where at one end of the scale there is a need to conserve certain species to avoid overfishing and at the other the growing complexity of marketing arrangements.  As regards the expansion aids mentioned by the Deputy, the establishment of processing plants in Kerry or elsewhere in the State is a matter in the first instance for private enterprise.  Assistance is afforded by An Bord Iascaigh Mhara and the Industrial Development Authority in the establishment of such plants and grants are available for suitable projects.</P>
      <P>Kerry fishermen, with the assistance of An Bord Iascaigh Mhara, are continuing to expand the local fishing fleet but it must be remembered that the fishermen are free agents and cannot be compelled to land into Kerry ports, particularly when it can be more profitable and convenient to land into other ports.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelPatMurphy" hpid="Mr. M.P. Murphy Mr. M.P. Murphy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M.P. Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>The amount paid by the Department to guesthouse owners who provide full board and accommodation for these trainees at Moville during the season has been increased as follows from 1968 to meet the increased cost of living, following representations from the guesthouse owners concerned.  In 1968 it was £5 per week per boy; in 1970 it was £6 per week per boy; in 1973 it was £7 per week per boy; and as from the fourth of this month it has been increased to £8 per week per boy. As well as that, trainees are given a weekly allowance of £5, and deducting the insurance contribution mentioned by the Deputy, it means he has £3.64 weekly together with the lodging allowance of £8.  The same position applies, of course, during the period of seven months when they are undergoing practical training in the selected fishing vessels.  Therefore, taking it all in all, I think they are being looked after reasonably well.</P>

      <P>No.  The position is that £3.64 is a reasonable contribution towards the cost of his maintenance, together with the £8 paid to the guesthouse owner.  Public funds are subsidising each trainee in so far as pocket money and lodging allowance are concerned to the extent of £13 weekly.  Such trainees are exceptionally fortunate, first of all, in being selected, because there is some competition now to get a place in the training school.  I am sure their parents would not mind making a contribution.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelPatMurphy" hpid="Mr. M.P. Murphy Mr. M.P. Murphy">

      <P>Under the Control of Fishing for Salmon Order, 1973 the maximum number of drift net licences that may be issued by each board of conservators during 1974 is the number of such licences that were validly issued by each board in the previous season.  Accordingly, there can be no question of an increased number of drift net licences being issued by any board during 1974.  As all boards of conservators have not yet completed the allocation of licences for 1974, it is not possible to indicate the fishery districts where the number of drift nets may be reduced for the present season.</P>

      <P>I appreciate very much the Deputy's point of view, which coincides with mine.  There are undoubtedly very worthy applicants who last year were unsuccessful. Unfortunately, because of the extreme nature of the conservation measures and the necessity to limit the number of licences issued, the boards have to refuse very worthy applicants.  However, it is not a completely closed shop.  For instance if a person dies, the boards have discretion to re-issue his licence to a member of his family. The Deputy brought this to my attention some time ago and it is being done.</P>

      <P>As the Deputy has stated, the destruction is great. The cyanide acts through the gills. The fish killed in this way, according to my reports, are edible but they go off very rapidly.  It is the worst form of destruction and the boards are extremely concerned about it. They brought some people to court recently.  Twelve people were apprehended and 57 fish were confiscated. They were convicted, heavy sentences were imposed and appeals have been lodged.  The courts take a serious view of this type of offence.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>Surely the Parliamentary Secretary is aware there must be a specific reason for this overall reduction? In 1971 there were over 5,000 fish between what escaped and what were caught.  In 1972 there were something under 3,000 between what escaped and what were caught and in 1973 the figure was under 2,000 between what escaped and what were caught.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelPatMurphy" hpid="Mr. M.P. Murphy Mr. M.P. Murphy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M.P. Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>The big increase in the net catches of salmon during 1972 and 1973 as compared with 1971 is largely due to the fact that in these years in the interests of conservation fishing was restricted in the tidal waters of the Erne by not allowing <Col N="888" /> additional and net fishing until such time as 2,000 fish had been recorded as passing through the counter on the ESB installation at Ballyshannon.  The figure of 2,000 fish was settled for 1972 and 1973 as the minimum escapement which was needed to maintain the future well-being of the river.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>Regardless of what were the reasons the fact emerges clearly that less than half the number of salmon went up that estuary than went up two years previously and there must be an underlying reason for this that does not emerge as a result of conservation.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M.P. Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>There is another complication.  The Deputy has made the point about half the fish but there was a complication during 1973 by reason of the fact that there was an apparent malfunctioning of the counter operated by the ESB.  We are not positive on account of this malfunctioning.</P>

      <P>Presumably the Deputy is referring to salmon net licences as distinct from rod licences. During 1973 the two boards concerned, that is, the Ballyshannon and the Letterkenny Boards of Fishery Conservators issued 469 net licences. So far this year it is understood that the Ballyshannon board have granted 135 net licences but that the Letterkenny board have not allocated their licences.  It is not the practice of boards of conservators to disclose the names and addresses of licensees.</P>

      <P>While I think the Parliamentary Secretary is failing to disclose the actual position in regard to the Letterkenny board I would like to ask him why he refuses to publish the names of those to whom licences are issued?

      <NameTxt>Mr. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Parliamentary Secretary stated that the damage to fishing boats and fishing gear was not extensive but surely that is not a reason for victimising those who suffered severe damage. Would the Parliamentary Secretary agree that the people who have been deprived absolutely <Col N="892" /> of their means of livelihood by the loss of uninsured boats should get some consideration from the people responsible to enable them to go back into the business again?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M.P. Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>As Deputy Brennan is aware, Bord Iascaigh Mhara have indicated that a full assessment of damage to fishing boats and gear as a result of the recent storm would take some time to complete.  The Deputy is aware also, that all boats financed by the bord are insured and that all boats could have, and most of them have, insurance policies against storm damage.  I assume that the insurance cover that it available in the normal way to owners of fishing boats of any size will cover the cost of repairs in most cases.  The only people who will be excluded are ones who did not go to the trouble of taking out an insurance policy against such damage.  Our information is that the number is small, that the damage to such boats is small and there is no State scheme to help them.  I do not see how the State could propose a scheme to help people who did not help themselves and failed to get insurance on their boats.</P>

      <P>I take it the Parliamentary Secretary is aware that there are certain anchorages, around the coast of Donegal particularly and perhaps elsewhere, where due to the past record of damage in storms insurance companies refuse to cover boats.  The particular place I have in mind is Glengad.  Has the Parliamentary Secretary a record of damage during the recent storm to boats that were not insured through no fault of the owners but because no insurance company would take them?</P>

Deputy Blaney has mentioned difficulties about securing insurance on the part of some boat owners.  If he will give me further information I will have a look at that position.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>I understand that the Parliamentary Secretary recently received a deputation from interests in the harbour area and that it was pointed out to him that there was need for substantial improvements there, that there were certain difficulties between the fishermen and the harbour commissioners which are interfering with the prosperity of the fishing industry at the harbour.  It was indicated that the Parliamentary Secretary was prepared to reconsider whether further developments would take place, other than the lay-by proposals which I understand are being surveyed.  I am sure the Parliamentary Secretary is fully aware of the difficulty at Galway harbour.  Does he feel that the lay-by proposals will be adequate to meet the real needs of the fishing industry there?</P>

      <P>I regret that differences have arisen between the commissioners and the fishermen and I hope that the difficulties will be amicably resolved.  Unfortunately, court proceedings were taken.  I am not commenting on the justification for taking the proceedings.  With the co-operation of the three Deputies from the constituency the Department and myself if at all possible will try to resolve or help to resolve the problems that have arisen between the commissioners and the fishermen.  I would have no hesitation in going to Galway and meeting the three Deputies from the constituency and representatives from the <Col N="895" /> harbour board and fishermen if we could try to resolve the questions that have arisen.  We could also consider the question of a lay-by and other incidental questions that may arise.  It is regrettable that this dispute exists.</P>

As the Deputy knows, I have no compelling powers so far as the disposal of berthage at Galway harbour is concerned; that is a function of the commissioners.  I had hoped to get this dispute resolved, if at all possible, outside the courts in an amicable way.  I said to the representatives of the harbour commissioners and the representatives of the fishermen from Galway, that I would be only too pleased to go to Galway to help the local Deputies.

      <NameTxt>Minister for Posts and Telegraphs (Dr. Cruise-O'Brien)</NameTxt>
      <P>The answer to the first part of the question is &ldquo;no&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As regards the second part of the question there are not, and never were, <Col N="898" /> any such things as &ldquo;plans for an immediate improvement in the service&rdquo;. Serious plans, leading to real improvements, have to be laid well in advance. The over-riding requirement in relation to such plans is the provision of adequate capital.  Most of the problems affecting the telephone service at present result from under-capitalisation in the past.  The Government's intentions in relation to the future can be measured by the most recent Telephone Capital Act, which provides for capital expenditure of £175 million over the next five years.  The work of improvement and extension goes on all the time.  In fairness it should be added that, just as many of the defects in the present service are due to failures in relation to capitalisation on the part of the previous Government, so also&mdash;on the credit side&mdash;many of the improvements now coming into effect were planned under that Government.</P>
    <P>Improvements effected over the past six months include the opening in Dublin of a major new exchange at Rathmines, the conversion to automatic working of the Dungarvan exchange area and the provision of extra exchange and trunk equipment in various other centres.  Over the next few months a 12,000 line instalment of a new 20,000 line exchange will be brought into service at Ballsbridge; the Clonmel area will be converted to automatic working; and a new international exchange will be opened in central Dublin.  Later in the year, major new automatic exchanges will be opened, one in Tallaght and the other in the GPO.  In the provinces the Cavan and Fermoy areas will be converted to automatic working.  Numerous other schemes are on the way.</P>
    <P>I have previously pointed out that the telephone service difficulties which obtain in many parts of the country, due mainly to overloading of exchanges and trunk lines, did not develop overnight and they cannot be remedied quickly.  Major exchange schemes normally take approximately two and a half years from the date on which they are ordered to the date on which the equipment comes into service. The planning and other preliminary work required has to be initiated <Col N="899" /> much earlier particularly where new buildings are required.</P>
    <P>There have recently been exceptional service difficulties caused by the severe storm damage in the past two months.</P>

      <P>Postmen who use private bicycles on delivery are paid allowances which vary with the amount of travelling involved. The maximum weekly allowance, for travelling of more than 24 hours a week, is 45p.  The minimum allowance, for travelling of 12 hours weekly or less, is 24p.</P>

      <P>Postmen who use private motor-bicycles on postal delivery are permitted to do so under certain conditions at their own request. <Col N="900" /> The posts themselves are scheduled as cycle posts and, as such, the allowances appropriate to cycle working are paid.  These allowances vary according to the amount of cycle travelling required, the maximum and minimum allowances being 45p and 24p weekly respectively.  The allowances are settled by agreement with the staff under the conciliation and arbitration scheme and it would not be appropriate for me to comment on them.</P>

      <P>With the permission of the Ceann Comhairle I propose to take Questions Nos. 243 to 248 together.</P>
      <P>All of the nine applicants' premises are in the Letterfrack rural area where terms for supply under the final phase of the rural electrification scheme have recently been quoted to interested parties.</P>
      <P>In addition to fixed and special service charges, capital contributions are required from eight of these applicants because the cost of providing them with electricity is very high. Their houses are a long distance from the board's networks and as a result, a considerable investment in materials, labour, and so on, will be necessary to connect them to the system.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>No capital contribution will be required for supply to An Óige Hostel. However, the special service charge <Col N="902" /> exceeds 300 per cent of the fixed charge and the normal practice in such cases is to require a revenue deposit equal to the annual fixed and special service charges.  This amounts to £65.58 for the hostel.  The deposit will be refundable after one year.</P>
    <P>Despite the high charges required in these cases the persons concerned are being offered supply at charges much below what would be appropriate to the capital costs incurred by the ESB.  In the circumstances, I have no plans for changing the existing arrangements for determining such charges.</P>

      <P>The three State airports&mdash;Shannon, Dublin and Cork&mdash; already provided have adequate capacity for substantial expansion of traffic.  They continue to be operated at a heavy annual loss and it is not my intention to establish any further State airports for the foreseeable future.</P>
      <P>Aerodrome facilities for small aircraft, in particular the Aran Islands service, are provided by the licensees of Oranmore aerodrome.  The manoeuvring area of this aerodrome has a grass surface which restricts operations in prolonged wet weather conditions and during such conditions Shannon Airport has to be used.  The licensees have plans for installing a hard surface runway.  My Department are affording technical advice to the licensees and I understand that the question of a grant towards the capital cost from the Special Regional Development Fund administered by the Minister for Finance is at present under examination.</P>

In so far as the use of a textbook is advisable at all nowadays, it should be treated only as a handy compendium of basic facts.

      <P>With the permission of the Ceann Comhairle I propose to take Questions Nos. 444, 445 and 446 together.</P>
      <P>The Deputy will be aware that these houses were provided under the guaranteed order project&mdash;the &ldquo;low-cost&rdquo; housing project initiated by him when he was Minister.  On the 28th January last when I heard reports of storm damage to this scheme I asked for an urgent report from the National Building Agency, who had the houses built on behalf of Galway Corporation.</P>
      <P>I received a telegram on 29th January, 1974, from the Corrib Park Residents' Association asking that the housing estate be declared an emergency area and requesting a meeting with me.  I had, by then, already received a preliminary report on the storm damage from the agency.  I understand that, on the 27th January, 1974, winds of between 90 and 103 miles per hour were recorded over a period of two to three hours, and that extensive stripping of roof tiles was caused throughout the scheme.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="922" /> The necessary repair work was put in hands by the contractors immediately the weather abated sufficiently, and all repair work to the roofs had been completed by them, without cost to Galway Corporation or to the tenants, by the 2nd February, 1974.</P>
    <P>At my request, representatives of the agency met the chairman of the residents association who was informed that priority had been given by the agency to getting the damaged roofs repaired and that a detailed house to house survey was being put in hands to deal with any consequential damage which might have occurred as a result of the storm.</P>
    <P>About claims for damage to personal property, I understand that some of the falling tiles caused damage to a small number of parked cars.  These claims are being examined by the agency.</P>
    <P>I am informed by the agency that the builder complied with the contract specification in the construction of the houses.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Minister for Local Government (Mr. Tully) James Tully">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Local Government (Mr. Tully)</NameTxt>
      <P>When the most recent official revision of their waiting list for re-housing was carried out in November, 1972, by Dublin Corporation, the total number of families, including families of one person, on the approved waiting list at that date was 5,307.  While no official revision of the list has been carried out since then, I understand from the corporation that in November, 1973, they estimated that there were then about 5,237 families on the approved waiting list.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Deputy will be aware that the number of persons comprising the families on the approved waiting list varies constantly and that, as a consequence, information as to the number <Col N="923" /> of persons, as distinct from families, on the list, from time to time, is not available.</P>

      <P>With the permission of the Ceann Comhairle I propose to take Questions Nos. 456, 457 and 458 together.</P>
      <P>My policy regarding planning control is set out in a circular letter dated 12th November, 1973, to local authorities. The contents of that letter are well known having received wide publicity. They indicate that while I would not apply an absolute restriction to the national primary roads I would still apply the principle of restriction to them, putting the onus on the developer to show clearly that an exception is warranted, for example, on grounds of there being infilling or there being access to a lay-by.  The letter also indicated that in the case of national secondary roads and indeed other important roads, it would be for the local authority to establish an identifiable risk of accident as grounds of refusal of permission on traffic grounds.</P>
      <P>The information sought by the Deputy in Question No. 458 is not readily available.  The compilation of it would involve a detailed examination of the cases, well over 2,000, which have been decided since 1st April, 1973.  I consider that this would require an unjustifiable amount of staff time, in view of the urgent need to devote all the available resources of staff for planning control to the clearance of appeals.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Local Government (Mr. Tully)</NameTxt>
      <P>With the permission of the Ceann Comhairle, I propose to take questions Nos. 461 and 462 together.</P>
      <P>I would refer the Deputy to the statement in the matter which I issued through the Government Information Services yesterday 13th instant.  A copy of the statement is attached.</P>
      <P>Intervention in the matter was based on the right of the Government to take action in a matter of serious public interest, quite apart from my control over the capital expenditure of local authorities.</P>
      <P>Following is the statement:</P>
      <P Just="Center">Dublin Corporation Civic Offices Project.</P>
      <P>The Government decided in November last that the development of the site at Wood Quay/Winetavern Street for civic offices should cease pending consultation and further investigation. The City Manager was advised accordingly and it was conveyed to him that the Minister wished the further consideration to include an examination of possible alternative locations for the civic offices.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Government's decision that the project should be further considered reflected their misgivings regarding the use of the particular site for civic <Col N="930" /> offices because of its significant location in relation to Christchurch Cathedral, its archaeological importance and its value as an open space in the context of the Government's desire to develop the Liberties and surrounding areas for housing.</P>
    <P>The City Manager submitted a report in the matter to the Department in December.</P>
    <P>The Minister has had a re-appraisal made of the project taking account of planning, archaeological and general amenity considerations.  The possibilities and implications of using an alternative site for the civic offices have also been assessed.  The Minister has had discussions in the matter with the City Commissioners.</P>
    <P>The Commissioners at a meeting on 4th instant passed a resolution recommending that the civic offices project be proceeded with on the Wood Quay/Winetavern Street site on the basis of a regrouping of the buildings on the site to a plan submitted to them by their consultants.</P>
    <P>The matter has now been considered further by the Government and the Minister has conveyed to the Corporation that no objection will be raised to the scheme proposed in the Commissioners' Resolution of 4th instant.</P>
    <P>Account has been taken in particular of the fact that the amended scheme, while allowing the archaeological examination of the site to proceed, will leave a sizeable area available for suitable open space/ amenity development with a clear view of the Cathedral over that space. Account was also taken of the urgency of the Corporation's need for modern centralised accommodation and the fact that the amended scheme can go ahead with very little delay.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ThomasJVMeaney" hpid="Mr. Meaney Mr. Meaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Meaney</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Health why a person in County Cork (details supplied) has not been supplied by the Southern Health Board with a dental brace, sanction for which was given some months ago.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrendanCorish" hpid="Minister for Health (Mr. Corish) Brendan Corish">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Health (Mr. Corish)</NameTxt>
      <P>The provision of this service is a matter for the Southern Health Board.  However, I understand, on enquiry from the board, that their chief dental surgeon wrote to the mother of the child concerned, in September last, suggesting an appointment for the child at Mallow, Mill-street or Charleville and asking that he be notified which centre would suit.  He has not since received a reply <Col N="932" /> but is prepared to arrange an appointment immediately he is advised by the parent which centre would be convenient. I suggest that the child's parent get in touch with the chief dental surgeon, Child Health Clinic, City Hall, Cork, about this.</P>
      <P>The Dáil adjourned at 5.15 p.m. until 3 p.m. on Tuesday, 19th February, 1974.</P>
