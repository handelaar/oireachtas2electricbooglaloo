    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Minister for Local Government (Mr. Tully) James Tully">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Local Government (Mr. Tully)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move:</P>
      <P>That a supplementary sum not exceeding £1,000,000 be granted to defray the charge which will come in course of payment during the period commencing on the 1st day of April, 1974, and ending on the 31st day of December, 1974, for the salaries and expenses of the Office of the Minister for Local Government, including grants to Local Authorities, grants and other expenses in connection with housing, and miscellaneous schemes and grants including a grant-in-aid.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The main purpose of this Supplementary Estimate is to enable the Department of Local Government to give effect to the recently-announced Government decision that local authorities should receive recoupment from the Exchequer of the full cost <Col N="604" /> of malicious injuries to property, which in the opinion of the chief superintendent for the area, are caused by the use of explosives and are attributable to the disturbances in Northern Ireland.  It is intended that the recoupment will apply retrospectively to payments made by local authorities on or after 1st January, 1974.</P>
    <P>The Government wish that payments on foot of relevant court decrees by local authorities and the subsequent recoupment from the Exchequer be made with minimum delay.  It is not possible at this stage to forecast accurately the total amount of money which would be recoupable in the present financial year.  I am aware, however, that decrees paid by local authorities since 1st January, 1974, plus amounts decreed and not paid by the authorities up to mid-May, 1974, totalled about £550,000. The total claims not yet processed through the courts are of the order of £13 million.  It is felt that the Supplementary Estimate of £1 million now sought will be sufficient to meet applications from local authorities maturing for recoupment within the current financial year.</P>
    <P>It is intended that claims for compensation for such malicious injuries will continue to be submitted, processed and paid in the same manner as malicious injury claims generally are at present.  I commend this Supplementary Estimate to the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>We have no objection to the Supplementary Estimate but I have grave doubts as to whether £1 million will be adequate to pay for the damage done on even one day recently, the unfortunate day of the explosions in Dublin and Monaghan. Unfortunately only now when we heard the Minister's speech do we know the details of how it is proposed to pay this.  I should like to give some study to it because, as I understand the Minister's speech, it is not proposed to change the method of claiming for and processing of claims.  If that is so, as the Minister will appreciate, the delay in getting payment is often two and sometimes three years&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>If I may interrupt Deputy O'Malley to clear it up, the big delay, of course, is that it is not payable until the next year after the decree is made.  It is proposed in this case that the payment can be made as soon as the decree is made which will cut it down to a matter of months rather than years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>That is certainly a help.  I am glad to hear that from the Minister.  The Minister said:</P>
      <P>It is intended that claims for compensation for such malicious injuries will continue to be submitted, processed and paid in the same manner as malicious injury claims generally are at present.</P>
      <P>Not unnaturally that led me to believe it was going to be the same because that is exactly what it says.  I am glad to hear now that in respect of this type of claim it will be different.</P>
      <P>As the House is aware, if a malicious act takes place this year and a claim is made in respect of it and a decree is given next year in the Circuit Court, the decree or the order of the court has then to be sent to the local authority who have to include it in the rate that is to be struck for the following financial year.  They cannot pay until the rates have been got in for the following financial year.  The result is that in many instances the delay in payment to the claimant may be as long as three to three and a half years.  I am glad to see that there will be at least some shortening of this, but it appears that it will be necessary for the claimant to wait until the decree has been given which, because of the backlog of cases, particularly in Dublin, could be a year or more.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I understand that the number of cases pending for malicious injuries in the Dublin Circuit Court is approaching 10,000.  Happily there is no delay of any magnitude in the other circuits. I am not saying that there are 10,000 cases actually on the court list but I am saying that there are 10,000 which have been submitted to Dublin Corporation and which the Dublin Corporation have not yet got around to dealing with to the extent that they <Col N="606" /> can be put on the court list.  This is a good opportunity to point out that Dublin Corporation and other local authorities who have huge amounts of claims, many of them for very small figures&mdash;they are not in this category &mdash;awaiting processing by their solicitors and by the courts, they should be given the power to settle those cases which are perfectly obvious without having to go to court.  As the law stands even in the most obvious case they must go to court.  One of the clearest examples one can give is this bombing in Dublin.  It is absolutely crystal clear that it is malicious within the meaning of the Acts but they still have to go to court formally to have the court rule on it.</P>
    <P>There was a Bill in the Department of Justice when I left it proposing to make a number of changes in the malicious injuries code and one of them was to give power to local authorities to settle cases without going to court.  This would be a tremendous help particularly to some of the more hard pressed local authorities such as Dublin Corporation. As well as being a help to them and to the people who are claiming against them it would also save the local authority and accordingly the ratepayer a good deal of money because additional money is being spent going to court in circumstances which are not necessary.  An ordinary civil case could be settled long before it ever got near a court.</P>
    <P>The gainers by promoting the giving of power to local authorities to settle out of court would be the ratepayers and when you take into account that taxpayers are now being asked to contribute £1 million towards these expenses the general taxpayer also would gain.  I have grave doubts if £1 million will be sufficient particularly as it is retrospective to payments made since 1st January, 1974.  Already £550,000 has been paid out.  Over half this sum has gone before we start at all.  That will not leave very much for decrees between now and December which is the end of the current financial year.</P>
    <P>The Minister stated that it is intended the recoupment will apply <Col N="607" /> retrospectively to payments made by local authorities on or after 1st January, 1974.  That is a rather arbitrary decision for the reason that what is being regarded here as relevant for the purpose of recoupment to local authorities is not when the outrage or incident happened but the date when the payment was made.  A much fairer way from the point of view of local authorities of deciding who should be recouped would be to pick a date and say that any outrage which came within this category subsequent to that would be recouped by the Exchequer.  We could have a situation where a particular local authority paid many of these decrees in December, 1973, but another local authority who were tardy in their payments and did not pay until 31st January, 1974.  The latter get recouped in full while those who met their obligations more speedily do not get recouped.</P>
    <P>I do not know if there are any instances of this but it would be more satisfactory to select a particular date and state that any malicious injury after that would be recouped to the local authority.  I am rather disturbed at the clause in the Minister's statement which refers to the full cost of malicious injuries to property, which in the opinion of the chief superintendent for the area, are caused by the use of explosives and are attributable to the disturbances in Northern Ireland.  This is going to cause a lot of difficulty.  We have had the opinions of chief superintendents well aired in this House 18 months ago and I am sure many of us do not want to hear any more about their opinions.</P>
    <P>It is one thing for a chief superintendent to have an opinion as to whether or not a particular gentleman is a member of an illegal organisation but it is a different matter altogether to express an opinion as to whether a particular explosion was attributable to disturbances in Northern Ireland.  Where they are going to draw the line I do not know.  It is wrong that a chief superintendent should be asked to decide a matter such as that.  That is <Col N="608" /> a matter which should be decided by nobody other than by a court.  It is particularly so in the southern part of the Republic.  As an example I should like to refer to a case which has already been decided, the explosion at the Silvermines in County Tipperary about two years ago.  As a result of that explosion a decree for £30,000 odd was given recently in the Circuit Court in Nenagh.  That damage was caused by an explosion after the Silvermines was raided by a group from an illegal organisation.  They did a good deal of damage and blew up the transformer.  There is some subsequent argument about whether consequential loss is recoverable from the county council but that does not enter into the matter for the purpose of this argument.</P>
    <P>The chief superintendent for Tipperary, which is a good way from the Border is going to be asked, if such a thing were to happen again by the Tipperary County Council&mdash;he may well be asked in this particular case because the decree was given subsequent to 1st January, 1974&mdash;if this was attributable to the troubles in the North.  There was an explosion and presumably if the troubles in the North were not going on the IRA would not have bothered to bomb it. The chief superintendent may be asked to certify that it was attributable to the disturbances in the North. That chief superintendent may have considerable difficulty in trying to decide on that and I do not think he should have to.</P>
    <P>Any damage caused by the use of explosives, particularly where members of illegal organisations are concerned, should automatically be recoupable from the Exchequer and the chief superintendents should not be put in the invidious position of deciding on such matters.  It will be particularly difficult for them to decide on such matters in southern divisions of the Garda Síochána because they cannot be definite whether a thing like that is attributable to what is happening in the North or not.  Such an explosion might happen anyway even if there was no trouble in the North.  One can understand <Col N="609" /> the anxiety of the Tipperary North Riding County Council for their ratepayers. They will be anxious that their ratepayers are not saddled with a decree of £30,000 odd which is equivalent to about 3s. in the £ for that area.  They will obviously approach and press the chief superintendent to certify that crime in order to bring it within the recoupment which this Supplementary Estimate is going to cover.</P>
    <P>A decision of that kind should be made by a court only because a court is free of influence and county councils can only approach the court openly through their barristers or solicitors.  It is wrong that a deputation from a county council should wait on a chief superintendent and press him in the interests of their ratepayers.</P>
    <P>The Minister's speech was very short but the whole principle of what is involved is new and important.  It merits greater examination than I have been able to give to it in the minute or two I had while the Minister was speaking.  While I agree with the principle of what the Government are doing because they had to do it, the amount of damage in the last month or so has been so great that the local authorities could not survive if the Government did not step in to deal with the question of compensation. I suggest to the Minister that he should not tie himself to the figure of £1 million because it is clear that this amount will be inadequate even in the present financial year.  Also, I suggest to him that he should not pick an arbitrary date of payment such as the 1st January, 1974.  It would be more satisfactory to include any outrage committed after 1st October, 1972. That date would have the benefit of tying in with the personal injuries scheme which was introduced recently by the Minister for Justice.  That would be the fairest way of dealing with the matter.  Then, any outrage of the nature we are discussing which took place on or after the 1st October, 1972, irrespective of when payment was made by the local authority, should qualify.  That would not increase greatly the amount that would be recoupable to local authorities because, <Col N="610" /> perhaps, most of them would not have paid by the 1st January, 1974, although some of them may have paid.  I recall that when I fixed the date originally as 1st October, 1972, for the coming into operation of the scheme for compensation for personal malicious injuries, I did so because in the months of October and November, 1972, there were explosions in Dublin, in Belturbet and in Clones.  The reason I fixed the 1st October, 1972, was because it covered all of those incidents and also because these incidents involved not only loss of life and personal injury but because they led also to considerable damage to property.  Therefore, I would suggest to the Minister that the fairest date to begin this scheme would be the same date as that of the coming into being of the personal injuries scheme.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>Damages will be included in this because they have not been paid yet.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>They will be included only if they have not been paid but I am wondering whether some have been paid in which case the scheme would be very unfair in so far as those local authorities who had paid are concerned.  The change I suggest in the timing would overcome any problem of that kind.</P>
      <P>The third point I wish to make as going too far on this is that I regard the provision that the damage must have been caused by the use of explosives and must be attributable to the disturbances in Northern Ireland. I say this because it will be very difficult to prove that any particular incident is attributable to the disturbances in Northern Ireland.  The Minister would cover that point adequately if he left it merely at the question of the use of explosives.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A further point I wish to make is that I am strongly of the opinion that a chief superintendent should not be asked to certify that explosives were used or that explosions were attributable to the disturbances in Northern Ireland.  It is not fair to a chief superintendent to ask him to decide a matter such as that because it is not <Col N="611" /> within his particular knowledge.  The example I have given of the malicious damage to the Silvermines is as good an example in this context as one can cite.  That damage was caused by explosives and was carried out by the IRA.  Presumably the ratepayers of Tipperary North Riding will be able to recoup from the Exchequer the amount of compensation that has been paid assuming that the chief superintendent is prepared to testify as required by the provision of the scheme.  I do not know who that man happens to be but I would not like to be in his shoes if he is to be pressed into certifying that the damage was caused by explosives and that it was attributable to the disturbances in the North.  I do not think the man would be in a position to certify to that effect.  One of the culprits in that instance &mdash; I can refer to him as a culprit because he was killed in the course of the explosion &mdash; came from Cork.  The Silvermines company had no connection with Northern Ireland that would render them liable to attack on that score.  This was an ordinary criminal outrage by one branch of the IRA but the chief superintendent in Thurles would be put in an impossible position should he be asked to decide on the issue.  I am sure there are many other examples.  The position of a chief superintendent elsewhere would be equally invidious should this clause be insisted on.</P>
    <P>Subject to these four reservations which do not touch the principle of the idea, I am glad that the Minister has taken this action.  In fact he had no option but to do so because some local authorities could be wiped out as a result of recent outrages if they had to foot the bill.  One doubts whether the amount being voted will be adequate but of course a further Supplementary Estimate could be introduced towards the end of the year should this be found necessary.</P>
    <P>In view of what the Minister said in the third paragraph of his speech, it is only right that he should spell out what he meant by his interjection subsequently, in other words that in <Col N="612" /> relation to these types of decrees where there is to be recoupment to the local authority, the local authority will be empowered to pay immediately the decree is given by the court and without waiting to put it on the rate to be struck in the subsequent financial year.  That will be a considerable help to claimants but because that is being done now in respect of that type of claim, the question arises as to the payment of all malicious injury claims.  With money inflating at 10 per cent per annum at present, a man being granted a decree in 1973 for £X and being paid that amount in 1975 or 1976, would find that the money had depreciated in value in the meantime by, perhaps, 30 per cent.  That would hardly be fair to any claimant.  If immediate payment after decree can be made in these instances as the Minister suggests, perhaps he would give a direction to local authorities to pay immediately in respect of malicious injuries that are not attributable to explosives, in other words, injuries that are not covered by this Supplementary Estimate. Subject to the reservations I have expressed, I am glad that the Minister has introduced this Supplementary Estimate.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMKelly" hpid="Parliamentary Secretary to the Taoiseach (Mr. Kelly) John Kelly">
      <NameTxt>Parliamentary Secretary to the Taoiseach (Mr. Kelly)</NameTxt>
      <P>There may be some reason in what Deputy O'Malley says in regard to the arbitrary character of some aspects of the Supplementary Estimate but the Deputy might have gone further, as I intend doing, to point out the arbitrary character of the whole malicious injury code.  There is no way of doing the job which the Minister is doing here other than by doing something which in its nature is inherently arbitrary.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy O'Malley mentioned the difficulty in which a chief superintendent would find himself in being asked to testify in a particular way. The Deputy has a reasonable point but of course chief superintendents are used to being lobbied about all kinds of matters and if they have not enough character to stand up to that <Col N="613" /> lobbying they ought not to be in their jobs.  In the first instance they would not have been promoted to their positions if they had been shown at earlier points in their careers to be men of straw.  That does not devalue the points the Deputy made and which I concede to some extent.</P>
    <P>A decision made by a chief superintendent in the absence of any evidence in regard to whether the trouble originated in connection with Northern Ireland will be subject to judicial review like any other administrative decision.  If the ratepayers are agreed on the one side and the Attorney General is agreed on the other, the law has got to the point that his decision can be questioned judicially.  I sympathise with the point of view that such a decision should have been judicially made from the very beginning.  The House will understand that the courts, already submerged in a backlog of work, would be still further submerged if they were called on to decide whether a particular incident of malicious injury, for example the Silvermines explosion, was connected with the Northern Ireland troubles.</P>
    <P>The Northern Ireland troubles seem to be a very good illustration of what an arbitrary system this is. Deputy O'Malley underlined this, maybe unintentionally, in bringing out the difficulty of making a decision in connection with the Silvermines explosion.  No matter where the line is drawn, an injustice is being done to some people by overburdening them with something for which they have no liability, and excessive favour being given to others by releasing them from that liability.  There is no reason in logic why malicious injury attributed to the North of Ireland troubles, or to the violent activity which has spread from it, should not be put into a special category and the local ratepayers should be relieved of such responsibility, while they are stuck with responsibility for acts of no political dimension but from which they are equally unable to protect themselves and for which they equally carry no responsibility whatever.  That <Col N="614" /> is the inherent illogicality of the malicious injuries code which has been pointed out here very clearly by the Minister and his opposite number in mentioning the North of Ireland.</P>
    <P>We all see that the situation in Northern Ireland, quantitatively speaking, has produced an inordinate amount of suffering and damage. There is no reason in logic why it should be made a special case and why, in regard to the damage to the Silvermines, if it were committed by a child firebug on holidays from County Louth, the people down there ought not to have been exempted from having to carry the burden in that case also.  The entire system is irrational and cannot be defended. That system is a survival of an ancient criminal code which imputed liability to residents of an area for outrages committed in their district. It was part of the criminal law going back to the Middle Ages.  It was maintained in this country in the form in which it exists and nowhere else in Europe.  It still rests on the idea that people in the locality are in a position to prevent damage from being committed maliciously.  It penalises them for something for which liability is imputed to them.</P>
    <P>I can imagine in a case of agrarian unrest or in a row about land division or acquisition, where ricks are burned or barns are destroyed it may be fair to say that all the families knew what was going on and could have stopped it if they had given information to the Garda, but they did not.  There may be many cases like that of which I know nothing. The average instance of malicious injury is one in which it is inconceivable that local residents, let alone the local ratepayers, could have done the slightest thing to stop it.</P>
    <P>Let me give an extreme example of the absurdity of this system.  I remember this from my own short practice at the Bar.  I cannot recall if I was appearing for the county council or for CIE but I do remember what it was all about, vandalism on an excursion train travelling from Dublin to Cork &mdash; may be it was Cork to Dublin &mdash; carrying hurling <Col N="615" /> enthusiasts.  The train was vandalised and the evidence seemed to show that all this happened while the train was whizzing through County Kildare. Believe it or not, a claim was brought by CIE against the Kildare County Council for the recoupment of that loss.  That happened 14 or 15 years ago and as I said I cannot remember on what side I was or whether we won or lost.  It was a sustainable claim at law in the conditions of those times and those legal conditions have not changed.  That train did not stop anywhere in County Kildare.  But since it could be alleged that the train was vandalised while within the boundaries of the county, in theory the claim lay against the ratepayers of that county who, on no possible construction of the situation, could have done anything to prevent it.</P>
    <P>My view is that the malicious injury code in the form in which it survived here is unconstitutional.  It purports to inflict a penalty on people who, not alone have not been convicted of an offence but have not been tried and could not be tried on any offence known to the law.  Nothing could be a clearer infraction of Article 38.  It seems to me to be an infraction of Article 40 also because it contains a very serious inequality.  The Constitution guarantees all citizens equality in the eyes of the law.  This system discriminates not only between citizens inasmuch as some are ratepayers and others are not, but it discriminates between the ratepayers in one county and those in another, none of whom was responsible for the outrage.</P>
    <P>Suppose an outrage is committed somewhere in Carlow near the Kildare border.  In such a condition it would be possible to have been done by some vandal from Kildare crossing into County Carlow.  It is a total inequality in the eyes of the law and, I believe, unconstitutional, that when that claim is processed and paid by the Carlow County Council, that Carlow ratepayers should have to pay for it when it is equally possible that the wrongdoer came from County Kildare.  Even if it were possible to show where he <Col N="616" /> came from, I still do not think it would be right to charge the ratepayers, as distinct from all citizens in County Kildare, with the damage. The system is a creaking, unjust and, in the strictest sense, unconstitutional one.  For what my opinion is worth, I make a free present of this advice to any solicitor who finds himself representing a county council, such as the North Riding of Tipperary, charged with a big claim in connection with the Silvermines explosion.  Let him defend the claim on the basis that the law on which it is being brought is not consistent with the Constitution. It would be wrong to make a case of that type which would inevitably end up in the Supreme Court in connection with a very small claim. In connection with a substantial claim it would be well worth making that case.  It would be, perhaps, contemptuous for me to predict Supreme Court reaction.  Our antiquated statutes go back to the Tithe War.  These statutes could be held in their application to modern conditions to be unconstitutional.</P>
    <P>Leaving aside the question of the constitutionality of the system, in 1960 an inter-departmental committee was set up consisting of officials of the Departments of Lands, Justice, Finance and Local Government to consider the question of malicious injury payments being recouped from local authorities.  That committee reported in 1963 against changing the system.  It is fair to say that the committee's attention was not directed to the strictly legal and constitutional aspects of the system and, therefore, might not have been equipped to consider them.  It reported against changing the system because it felt that the system more or less worked.  In connection with the so-called local levy where a charge is levied not on a county at large but on a particular town land or barony, it said that a local levy brought home to the people of an area where, for instance, a land agitation was in progress, that they had some moral responsibility in the matter.  We all have moral responsibility for a whole range of things.  We have our responsibilities as citizens.  I cannot see that a person who is completely <Col N="617" /> innocent and even ignorant of the fact that a malicious act has been committed should have it brought home to him, by this cruel engine of medieval law, that he has a moral responsibility in the matter.  I freely admit that he has a responsibility to dissuade his neighbours from doing criminal acts if he gets the chance.  I am completely against the idea that the law should bring home to him in this unjust way the moral responsibility for an act for which he not only has no responsibility but of which he was even ignorant.</P>
    <P>I suspect, with the greatest respect to that committee, that considerations of conservatism and convenience more than anything else weighed with them in recommending that no change should be made.  In part of the report they produced an argument which was intended to rebut the argument that to make malicious injury claims as such a charge on the central Exchequer would reduce costs.  The committee tried to dispose of this argument by saying that to transfer the responsibility to the State would necessitate the establishment of more specialised staff, both technical and legal.  This, they felt, would greatly increase the cost of malicious injuries. On the other hand, inquiries made indicated that removing the responsibility from local authorities would not result in any tangible saving to them. That means that if there were a system of centralised malicious injury claims a special section of the Attorney General's Department would have to be set up to process them.</P>
    <P>Officials who are now engaged on other work would have to be seconded to do this job.  Down the country the local county solicitors' offices would be still doing their ordinary legal work.  They would not have any appreciable lightening of their work by the removal from their desks of malicious injury claims.  I suggest that that does not hold any water as an argument.  There is no need to change the litigation machinery whereby malicious injury claims can be enforced at the moment.  They can still be brought against the county or the county borough.  I have no objection <Col N="618" /> at all to that.  If the system works well as a piece of machinery there is no reason why the claims should not be processed by the local authority.  The local authorities should be allowed by law to send the bill to Dublin.</P>
    <P>The Deputy who has spoken already &mdash; and I can see that others wish to speak &mdash; will agree with me in what I say about this.  I do not want to reiterate the arguments but where there is no evidence to show where a wrongdoer came from, or even where there is evidence, it is totally unjust that the ratepaying section of his neighbours should be stuck with the consequences of his malice.  It seems to me that the only sensible way to deal with this at all is to agree that we have a social responsibility as a nation to compensate the victims of malice.  That compensation should be a national charge. I am quite happy if it works well, and if to demolish and replace the machinery would be expensive, that the claims should be brought against county councils but that the bills for the claims once conceded by the court should be sent to Dublin.  That would obviate the delays to which Deputy O'Malley referred.  There would no longer be a question of waiting until the rate is struck.  As soon as the matter is decided by the court the claim should be sent to Dublin and the Central Fund should pay it immediately without waiting until the rate for that particular county or county borough was struck in the following year.</P>
    <P>That would get rid of the difficulty which Deputy O'Malley mentioned under the heading of depreciation of money.  It is true that an award made in one year, if not paid for two or three years, will not any longer make good the real loss to the injured party. Conditions may vary but the money may not possibly be of as much use two or three years later.  If these charges were centralised and if the making of a decree by the court led to quicker payment that difficulty would disappear.</P>
    <P>Finally, I understand that this whole question is being considered in the Department of Justice.  I would <Col N="619" /> like to add my voice to those who are urging the Minister to make the entire system of malicious injury compensation a national rather than a local charge.  I hope the Minister will bring his weight to bear in the same direction.</P>

      <P>Like the previous speaker I welcome this Vote.  It is going some way towards remedying the injustice to the communities which have suffered so much by the irresponsible acts of people unknown. The Parliamentary Secretary mentioned the 1960 committee.  At that time that committee reflected the general thinking regarding the malicious damages code.  Since that time the whole picture has changed so much that nobody today will seriously back the maintenance of this code, which is archaic and has little justice in it.  It has been said that the day the motor car was invented that that was the day to abolish the malicious injuries code.  It then became possible for people well outside any given area to cause untold damage in the area and then move out again.  The Parliamentary Secretary's example of a train going through Kildare from Cork to Dublin and in which vandals caused damage&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMoore" hpid="Mr. Moore Mr. Moore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moore</NameTxt>
      <P>They were not my club anyway.  This whole system is shown to be absurd.  The Government had to introduce this measure because in a few years' time when rates have been abolished on private dwellings we can no longer put malicious <Col N="620" /> damages against the rates.  Rates will have been abolished altogether by that time.  There is a general welcome for the principle of the Government's move in this matter.</P>
      <P>I want to make a special plea for this capital city which, unfortunately, is going to be the main target for any subversives who want to kill people and damage property.  Even if they do not come from the North and are not attached to the North in any way&mdash; they could be members of the American organisation known as the Symbionese Liberation Organisation who might kidnap people and cause all kinds of mayhem if they were to move in here &mdash; damage might be done to our city.  It would be unfair, when they have no connection with the Northern troubles, to suggest that the people of Dublin should pay for this damage.  I wish to mention one very definite example.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In my own constituency there are many embassies.  Some time ago an embassy of a friendly nation was badly damaged by explosives.  At the time it was rumoured that this was the work of a German organisation. As far as I know those people were never apprehended.  They had nothing to do with the Northern troubles but the bill for that damage will fall on the Dublin ratepayers unless the legislation is amended.  Any of these outside organisations will pick the capital city as their target.  It is easier to hide among three-quarters of a million people than it is to hide in any rural area and also there is a prestige value attached to an explosion caused by subversives in a capital city for propaganda purposes.  The Garda, despite the wonderful work they do, cannot build a moat around the city to keep all undesirables out.  Therefore, the people in the city should not have to pay for malicious damage to property to any greater extent than the people of any other area.  The same should apply if malicious damage of this type is caused to property in any rural area, whether it is Monaghan or anywhere else.  The people in those areas should not have to bear the full cost because of the irresponsibility of outside people who come to <Col N="621" /> kill people and to cause damage to property.</P>
    <P>It is totally wrong that a chief superintendent should be put in the position that he must be the arbiter of whether or not an outrage had any connection with the Northern troubles.  If that was tested in the Supreme Court I believe it would be found to be repugnant to the Constitution. The Minister and the Government might consider setting up a special section of a Department to adjudicate on these matters into which they would recruit outside people to advise on legal, humanitarian and social grounds.  There will be cases where the chief superintendent could not decide whether malicious damage to property was connected with the Northern troubles.</P>
    <P>When you take into consideration some of the Middle East people who hijacked planes and killed people they could say they were doing it in connection with a general liberation movement. They could probably say they were trying to liberate some people in the North and the chief superintendent could say that this had some connection with the political troubles in the North and that compensation should be paid out of the Central Fund.  We could have the absurd position that unless some of those people from the Middle East decide to link what they are doing with the Northern troubles the people of this city, Monaghan or wherever the damage is caused, would have to pay up.</P>
    <P>I welcome the Minister's move as outlined in his speech but he might be a little more generous in the matter of retrospection and go back to cover the incident I mentioned, where a foreign embassy was damaged by non-nationals. I know the Minister is used to the plea that no matter what is brought in we always want it back-dated further.  The atrocities we are referring to are not of long standing and I believe a three-year period would see justice done to all.  There was a very valid point made by Deputy O'Malley and Deputy Kelly in relation to inflation.  At present if one is to make a claim against Dublin Corporation, or any other authority, under the <Col N="622" /> malicious injuries code one has to wait a long time before one is paid.  In the meantime, money is losing its value by as much as 10 per cent a year.  The Minister might well include in some legislation a guarantee that where payment has been sanctioned and is not paid within about three months the funds then will bear an anti-inflation clause which will compensate the person for the inflationary rise between the period when the award was made and when he received it.  The Minister would then be giving a broader degree of justice to all these people.</P>
    <P>I agree with the principle of the supplementary Vote with reservations about the retrospective date and the position of the chief superintendent being the arbiter in certain cases. Because Dublin city has such a large population it should be declared an area for special attention.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to welcome the Supplementary Estimate for the purpose stated in the Minister's speech. A good deal of the contribution by the Parliamentary Secretary to the Taoiseach seemed to me to be irrelevant as it took the whole case of malicious injuries to property as its theme and this is specifically related to the damage arising out of the troubles in Northern Ireland.  From the remarks of the Parliamentary Secretary it seemed to me it would be fitting to introduce legislation to cover the points he made but this particular Supplementary Estimate is related specifically to injuries to property arising out of the Northern Ireland situation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Unfortunately, in my own constituency, the town of Belturbet suffered in this way.  A young man and a young woman lost their lives.  I raised this matter by parliamentary question on a number of occasions because people in the town who suffered were desperate. There was a promise from the Fianna Fáil organisation that the personal injuries claim would be looked after.  Now we have the properties provision which should allay the fears of a number of people.  A number of speakers have made the point that people who have small business premises,  <Col N="623" /> who suffer severe damage to their property and have to wait a long time, can be put out of business by the laws delay.  I am not talking about the stage to which Deputy Moore referred, when he said damages were agreed or had been processed through the court, but about the delay in getting it through the courts, through nobody's fault but perhaps due to heavy business in the courts.  Some type of bridging fund should be available. It would probably be very hard to handle this in law but some aid should be available where one is morally certain that a certain amount of money will accrue to the person when the process of the law has been completed.</P>
    <P>I know of business people who were ruined by the Belturbet incident and they could not raise the wind to keep them going until the money became available.  Have payments for malicious injuries to property actually been made before the 1st January? If they have there is a very strong case for flexibility.  If the year 1969, when all the Northern troubles started, were mentioned as the base year there would be no danger of anybody suffering an injustice.  The recent Dublin bombings were a terrible tragedy.  I have not seen any statement from the Garda authorities, the Minister or anybody else that they know who planted the bombs or even that they have strong suspicion. This may cause some trouble when a decision is being arrived at as to whether the money should be paid according to the terms of this Supplementary Estimate.  I am sure there is hardly anybody who is not of the opinion that these bombings were connected with the trouble in Northern Ireland.</P>
    <P>There are other cases as well as those mentioned by Deputy O'Malley and the Parliamentary Secretary to the Taoiseach.  Silvermines in the constituency represented by the Ceann Comhairle suffered an outbreak of arson some years ago.  It seemed to be ideological; it was a deliberate attack on property.  Cases of arson in the Minister's own constituency were also <Col N="624" /> alleged to be ideological.  I am just wondering if these cases will be covered retrospectively.</P>
    <P>I am glad this Supplementary Estimate has been introduced and I appeal to the Minister to do all in his power to expedite payment.  That is what people are looking for.  Nowadays, with the high cost of money, live horse and you will get grass is a poor philosophy to offer to people who have been seriously hurt.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Leonard</NameTxt>
      <P>I, too, welcome this Supplementary Estimate.  I am whole-heartedly in favour of compensation for bomb damage and loss of life. Prompt and effective action is fully justified.  One cannot, however, help comparing this prompt action with the inaction in regard to claims for bomb damage in my constituency in 1972.  This matter has been raised on a number of occasions and the replies have been very unsatisfactory.  Not alone was extensive damage caused to property but there was also a great deal of suffering caused to those involved.  The county manager in Monaghan got assurances from the two parties now in Government that, in the event of their being returned to power&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>They did not have time to put through legislation in those few months.  The extent of the damage in Clones was £388,000, a large amount of money.  Many of the people involved &mdash; I drew attention to this by way of supplementary question here &mdash; had to procure loans at very <Col N="625" /> high interest rates in order to have their property repaired.  In the street where the damage was most severe one young businessman has since died, leaving a wife and small family. Another businessman in an adjoining street, whose premises were partly demolished, has been very seriously affected and is in failing health since. Another young businessman who went back in his car at midnight after an earlier bombing incident was also very seriously affected in his health and had to spend a long time in hospital.</P>
      <P>I would ask the Minister in these cases to expedite payment.  It is almost two years now since these incidents occurred.  Premises had to be completely rebuilt or reconstructed with resultant heavy commitments to banks.</P>
      <P>I have been in touch with the Minister for Justice in connection with the shooting in the village of Emyvale. I take it this would come in under criminal injury to persons.  A carload of men opened fire indiscriminately up the village street and one woman was injured.  Again, there is the cratering of roads.  Part of the cost of putting this right may possibly be paid by another state.  My one appeal to the Minister is to make the payments with all possible speed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TomJFitzpatrick" hpid="Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick (Dublin Central) Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick (Dublin Central)">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Dublin Central):</i> I welcome this supplementary Estimate and I agree with what the Parliamentary Secretary to the Taoiseach said about malicious damage being brought within the scope of the Central Fund.  Deputy Wilson referred to delay.  Something in the region of £13 million in claims has been presented. There is a regulation whereby such claims must be lodged within six or seven days.  Knowing the situation in Dublin and the confusion which existed it is quite easy to understand that it would be impossible to process a claim promptly or, indeed, to carry out an investigation in that short period of time.  We could very well have a position in which an entire family could be hospitalised and would have something else to think about besides lodging a claim for malicious damage.  In such a situation an extension <Col N="626" /> should be given under the malicious damages code.  Business people were, I know, informed by their advisers that it would be necessary to put in claims within six or seven days. This causes a certain amount of confusion. One firm in Earl Street submitted a figure and, when they carried out their investigation afterwards and brought in their architects and engineers, they arrived at a different figure.  This clause in the Malicious Injuries Act should be amended for purposes like this.  When there is no emotion involved you can sit down and calculate the entire cost of malicious damage.</P>
      <P>Many businesses will be out of commission for a considerable length of time.  I have some knowledge of how long it takes to get payment for malicious damage.  Where plate glass windows are broken your own insurance company will normally pay for having them repaired the following day, and they are recouped by the local authority.  The cheque from the local authority is made payable to the insurance company in the person's name and they must bring the cheque to him to be countersigned.  It has taken two years for an insurance company to get their money from the local authority.</P>
      <P>On this occasion the insurance companies are taking no responsibility for providing finance to carry out the necessary repairs.  They are quite substantial and the insurance companies will not get involved.  The owners of the property have to try to negotiate loans or else they are out of business.  It will not be possible for some people to negotiate a loan to carry out substantial repairs and their only alternative is to close down their business until they receive their damages from the local authority or the Central Fund.  That will take a considerable length of time.  I cannot see cases for compensation for the recent damage in Dublin being processed through the courts in this financial year.  I hope they will be.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would ask the Minister to use his power to ensure that they are processed through the courts as soon as possible.  If they are not, obviously <Col N="627" /> people will be in a bad position as regards getting payment.  Many employees will have to lose their jobs if businesses have to close.  It could be 15 months to two years before these damages are paid.  It is very doubtful if business people will be able to negotiate loans with the banks.  We know what inflation and interest rates are like today.  Interest works out in the region of 20 per cent.  I presume that loss of profits will have to be taken into consideration in assessing malicious damages.  I am not sure about that.</P>
    <P>I would like the Minister to look sympathetically at all these points.  It is very hard on a person who built up a business over a number of years to find himself outside the door.  I am glad the Minister has brought in a Supplementary Estimate.  The amount is rather small.  I am sure that the payments outstanding through the local authorities at the moment will absorb it and that it will be necessary for the Minister to bring in another Supplementary Estimate shortly.</P>
    <P>I know the people who were killed and injured are covered in a different Act.  I met an employee of the Department of Posts and Telegraphs at about 12 o'clock the morning after the explosions.  He told me he had gone into work in Marlboro Street at 5 o'clock.  He had bought a car the previous evening and this was the first day he used it.  He parked it outside the Marlboro Street office and at 5.30 it was a sad sight.  Apart from damage to property there are cases of hardship like that.  I hope the Minister will try to get these cases before the courts as soon as possible.  The personnel of the local authorities will have to assess the damage and I am sure they will carry out their research expeditiously.  They will get every co-operation from everybody who has a malicious injuries claim.  I am delighted the Minister introduced this Supplementary Estimate.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiBrugha" hpid="Ruairí Brugha Ruairí Brugha">
      <NameTxt>Ruairí Brugha</NameTxt>
      <P>All Deputies welcome this Supplementary Estimate and the purpose behind it, although it is restricted in the Minister's <Col N="628" /> speech to a fairly narrow area.  This is the type of thinking we need from the Government.  Touching on the Minister's own interjection regarding the Monaghan explosion, this Administration and the previous Administration should be at one in facing up to a reappraisal of the whole situation in regard to malicious damage claims of this nature which are by any means arising out of local situations or from a national situation as we have today.  They may arise from international activities.</P>
      <P>I agree with the Parliamentary Secretary to the Taoiseach in his criticism of the very old code which is operating here.  I do not know what operates in other countries but my feeling about the malicious injuries code is that it is some sort of old ascendancy enactment which was intended to punish the natives if any damage was done in their locality. It was a way of keeping people quiet. There is a wider scale in this type of deliberate malicious damage now. One Deputy referred to the kind of activities being carried on in England by international groups such as the element calling themselves &ldquo;The Angry Brigade&rdquo;.  We have also seen incidents of high jacking all over the world which have nothing to do with the local affairs of any community or nation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On the other hand local vandalism, such as the breaking of shop windows, should remain a local charge.  I agree with Deputies on both sides who have reservations in regard to the date selected by the Minister, 1st January of this year.  Some damage was caused last year and during the time of the previous Administration.  The question of the delay in payment is another matter about which I am concerned. If we accept the principle that damage done by bombing by any element ought to be payable by the Exchequer one of the key matters should be the loss of earnings or loss of employment arising out of the delay in making payments. A problem of this kind could be got over if it was clearly understood in relation to damages of this kind that the malicious injury claim would be sustained and that this <Col N="629" /> would be acceptable by the bank with whom the firm was dealing.</P>
    <P>The Minister when considering legislation of this kind in future should bear in mind the question of interest and make provision for it to run from the time the claim is entered.  I agree with the Parliamentary Secretary to the Taoiseach when he says that he did not see why the question of Northern Ireland or damage originating from there should be a necessary part of the claim.  We all know that it is the function of the State and of the local authority to defend the people against claims and if it is not possible to provide evidence to show where the cause originated then such a claim could easily fall.  A fresh approach is needed irrespective of what Administration is in office.  Up-to-date laws and regulations are required and I do not think any political point should be scored in this regard.</P>
    <P>The whole situation over the past 100 years in regard to malicious damage has changed.  Claims such as we have in the case of Dublin for £13 million were never heard of when the Act was introduced but we have to keep in mind that such claims could occur again.  The Minister in preparing any new legislation to deal with malicious injuries should bear in mind the points I have made.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JosephDowling" hpid="Mr. Dowling Mr. Dowling">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dowling</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to add my voice to that of the other Members who have spoken on this matter and to welcome, with some reservations, this move by the Minister.  The callous and ruthless action by the group of men who prompted this type of legislation is to be condemned. They have not yet been brought to justice but it is my wish that they will be in the not-too-distant future. The Minister's statement to the effect that it was being left to a chief superintendent to certify that the incidents occurred as a result of the situation in Northern Ireland is very vague and is causing concern to Members on this side of the House.  An interpretation of this in a strict sense means that claims will be dealt with on a <Col N="630" /> very narrow basis and subject to the opinion of one man.</P>
      <P>As the people who were responsible for the callous and ruthless activities in Dublin and Monaghan have not been brought to justice I wonder how a chief superintendent can decide whether these bombings were attributable to the situation in Northern Ireland.  What guidelines will the chief superintendent have?  Is the fact that the car used in a bombing carried a Northern Ireland registration to be sufficient proof that the bombing was attributable to the situation in Northern Ireland?  This matter will have to be clarified.  In my view this particular aspect of the Minister's statement will not meet with general approval.</P>
      <P>The opinion of one man is not sufficient because the people who are responsible for policing activities may have information at their disposal which is not known to the general public.  We could also have a situation whereby the developments could be coloured to create an impression in the minds of these people.  For example, if there were disturbances in this city or elsewhere as a result of people being on hunger strike in England will the damage caused during such disturbances be considered for compensation?  There are many factors which come to mind of incidents that may not be directly attributable to the Northern Ireland situation.  There may be domestic matters which would spring from developments abroad resulting in destruction but will this be considered in the same light as the recent bombings?  How will these people be treated?  This is not an aspect of the situation that should be left to the discretion of one person.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>While I have absolute confidence in our police force and while realising the difficulties involved in apprehending those responsible for these crimes, a decision of a chief superintendent could be coloured by the fact that no one had been brought to justice for a particular crime.  While a car bearing a Northern Ireland or a British registration number may be planted in the area of a crime, that is not evidence <Col N="631" /> as to the origin of the perpetrators of the crime.  Perhaps the Minister would tell us whether he is prepared to widen the scope of this clause.  Perhaps, too, he would expand on the terms of reference under which a chief superintendent would operate and on what he is to base his conclusions. This provision is weak in terms of retrospection.  I know of the difficulties involved in the area of retrospection &mdash; the question of claims and counterclaims and references being made to previous Administrations &mdash; but this aspect should not be a factor at the moment.</P>
    <P>Every Member of this House is prepared to support any effort made by the Government to relieve the problems that have resulted from the present serious situation.  It is an abnormal situation requiring abnormal consideration.</P>
    <P>The provision of retrospection to the 1st January is something with which not everyone would agree. However, what we are doing here is a start.  It may be that we have not seen the end of the wholesale destruction of recent times.  Apart from the Garda authorities the matter is one that must be given constant attention by the Department concerned in an effort to find the best methods possible of relieving the distress associated with the situation.</P>
    <P>Regarding the clause which stipulates that explosions must be attributable to the disturbances in Northern Ireland in order that compensation be paid, what would be the position if explosions should take place following the deaths of, say, hunger strikers?  Would no compensation be payable in such cases?</P>
    <P>Several speakers have pointed out the problems that arise because of delays in the payment of compensation. Perhaps it would be possible to set up some special court or commission for the purpose of processing the various claims.  I trust that some means will be devised to allow for the speedy processing of claims especially those claims which, in the opinion of a chief superintendent, are attributable to the disturbances in the North. We must give every consideration to <Col N="632" /> businesses that suffer damage as a result of explosions and we must ensure that in so far as possible they are enabled to resume work quickly and without any undue loss of employment. Much difficulty can be caused to business people by their having to obtain loans at very high rates while they await compensation.  Therefore, I ask the Minister to ensure that payments will be made at the earliest moment possible.  Where possible arrangements should be made whereby the Government would at least carry the interest on loans obtained by business people for the purpose of reconstructing their premises.</P>
    <P>The Minister tells us that this Supplementary Estimate is considered to be sufficient to meet the applications from local authorities during the current financial year.  That is an indication that a prolonged period will elapse before payment will be made of the amounts that are being sought.  Perhaps the Minister will give us something more definite as to any immediate relief that can be given.</P>
    <P>I trust that those responsible for the callous and ruthless crimes of recent times will be brought to justice.  I take this opportunity of expressing my appreciation to all those who helped during the recent tragedies.  In particular, a special word of thanks is due to ambulance crews and all those involved in treating the injured.  To all these people the nation owes its greatest thanks.</P>
    <P>I should like the Minister to clarify the position relating to an incident which, in the opinion of a chief superintendent, could not be attributable to the disturbances in Northern Ireland but which resulted from some action on the part of political groups on the Continent or in Great Britain.  Would the Government be prepared to bring in a separate Vote to deal with such cases?  I trust that the weaknesses we see in this provision will be remedied.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BenBriscoe" hpid="Mr. Briscoe Mr. Briscoe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Briscoe</NameTxt>
      <P>I realise that this sum is a very small contribution towards the cost of some of the malicious damage claims pending before the courts at the moment.  I am a little <Col N="633" /> concerned about the Minister's statement that it is intended that the recoupment will apply retrospectively to payments made by local authorities on or after 1st January, 1974.  Does this take into account the damage which arose as a result of the December, 1972, bombings in Dublin and the explosions prior to that? Have these claims been settled by the courts?  Has compensation been awarded to the claimants?  If this is not so, it is wrong that the ratepayers of this city should have to foot the bill.</P>
      <P>As the Minister is aware, I was most concerned when I learned some months ago that the total number of claims facing the ratepayers of Dublin, pending before the courts and not awarded, was in the region of £8 million. This was not just for damage through bomb explosions but also for 17,000 separate cases of vandalism.  Of these 17,000 separate claims I do not know how many resulted from the burning of the British Embassy when a mob went on a rampage and smashed windows in many of the shops and stores through the streets of Dublin.  Will claims arising from political unrest where damage is caused, not necessarily through explosions, be paid under this heading? It is very important where a lot of damage is caused by people on the rampage that these claims must also be taken as part of the political unrest which exists.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My view is that all these malicious damage claims should be paid for from the Central Exchequer.  Originally, when the local authorities were levied with the paying of malicious damage claims, transport, as we know it today, did not exist.  Very often most of the damage which occurred in a local authority area was caused by somebody living in that area.  Today because of our different modes of transport, people from one area can converge on another area very quickly.  Unless there is proof that people from another area caused the damage, claims must be paid by the local authority in which it occurred. This code seems to be outdated.  I know the Minister agrees.  He has been <Col N="634" /> trying very hard to get his colleagues in the Cabinet to accept that malicious damages should become a charge on the Exchequer.  There is always the shortage of money and this makes it very difficult for the right decision to be made.</P>
    <P>I am hopeful that all the malicious damages will be taken off the rates. The policy of this party is to remove rates from private dwellings.  It seems unjust that while the rates on health charges and housing subsidies have been taken off the rates in Dublin, they have also been taken off business houses.  The latter can claim their rates bills as overheads as opposed to the private dweller who cannot.  The Minister should have another look to see if he can separate them.  There is a bill of £8 million before the courts, of which on the law of averages £4 million will be awarded, and the ratepayers of Dublin will not be able to pay it.  One cannot pay what one has not got.  I have no doubt that if the Dublin ratepayers are faced with a huge increase in the rates as a result of this, they will not be able, and cannot be expected, to pay it.</P>
    <P>The Minister should examine carefully the setting up of a qualified panel to examine claims.  When a car is involved in an accident, once the garage knows there is an insurance claim and the insurance company will pay for it, the price is raised and nobody tries to bring the price down.  The same thing applies to people who put in claims for malicious damages caused by explosions.  There is no hard negotiating with the companies who give the estimates for repairing the damage.  The bill is put in and met.  Therefore, the Minister should set up a panel to examine claims to ensure that claims are equitable.  This is very important, particularly where State or local authority money is concerned.  People do not seem to mind how much it costs because they think the money comes from somewhere else and not from their pockets.</P>
    <P>Our people are taxed to the limit. The Government should be seen to give a lead by giving close scrutiny to all these claims.  The panel could consist of the chief superintendent, people <Col N="635" /> from an insurance company, the business sector and the public at large. They should be in a position to understand the matters involved and find out whether the claims are fair.</P>
    <P>The response of the citizens of Dublin to parking restrictions has been excellent.  There is a general awareness among them that because of the recent bomb explosions it is important that they play their parts in ensuring that the Garda do their jobs efficiently. What I am about to say may not be very popular with many people but we have a responsibility to our citizens.  If security is to mean anything it must be enforced.  People who ignore parking restrictions as laid down should be fined double while the present crisis continues.  Anyone who parks in a place prohibited by Garda notices and who has his car towed away should have to pay twice the current fine in order to get that car back.  The Garda are always looking for suspicious-looking cars and if cars which are not dangerous are parked in the wrong places the Garda may miss cars with bombs parked further down the streets and which they have not had time to investigate.</P>
    <P>This particular Supplementary Estimate is vital.  You may feel, a Cheann Comhairle, that I am digressing a little but I am not.  This is very important. The majority of the people of Dublin are security-minded.  Those who disobey the rules at this particular time should be made pay.  There are few offenders.  It might be interesting to ask the Minister for Justice how many parking tickets have been issued over the past couple of weeks.  I am sure their numbers are well down.  People are conscious of the present security measures.  Money spent on malicious damage claims could be used to extend the social welfare services or to keep down taxes.  This money which has to be paid to people could be used to assist social causes.  It has to be spent on security.  In a way it is waste of State money.  It is terrible.</P>
    <P>The Minister should bear in mind that much of the malicious damage in this city has not necessarily been caused by explosives but by people <Col N="636" /> who go on the rampage after a political rally or something like that. The whole question of malicious damages will have to be examined to decide whether payment for them should be made from the Central Exchequer.  The position has become too serious.  The people are unable to pay.  When one is in a position in which one cannot pay, one is, in a way, in a happy position.  This puts a heavier burden on those who are barely able to pay.  The sooner the Government realise that malicious damages claims on rates are a thing of the past the better.  This is an inequitable system.  Rates on private dwellings should be removed.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnCallanan" hpid="Mr. Callanan Mr. Callanan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Callanan</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome this measure.  It would be ridiculous that claims for damages because of the disturbances in the North should be borne by the people in a particular county or city.  The damage is outside the control of the people.  I have a few reservations which I want to bring to the Minister's notice.  I have reservations about the chief superintendent in a county being the sole adjudicator.  This is unfair.  Where there is no doubt one should not have to go to court at all.  It is unfair on a person waiting for compensation to have to wait for a court.  I agree with Deputy Briscoe about some type of arbitration board being set up.  In cases of malicious damages or even with car insurance the amount of money claimed is often ridiculous. Sometimes this money is paid without any negotiations.  A board should be set up.  It is unfair to leave all decisions to a chief superintendent.  People may say that no one would attempt to go to the superintendent.  People will go to anyone.  They would lobby anyone's house.  Anyone who says otherwise is fooling himself.  The Minister is long enough in public life to know this.  When a public representative writes to a local authority about something he may be told that he cannot make representations and that no canvassing is allowed.  This is not quite true.  No matter how high up one is, one can talk to you. The chief superintendent could be lobbied.  That will continue while <Col N="637" /> human nature exists.  This has happened over the years.  It is not fair to put one man in such a position.</P>
      <P>There were many borderline cases in my own county.  It is a bit much to ask that they should all be made a charge on the Exchequer.  An arbitration board should be set up to decide whether the damage has been caused by the disturbances in the North.</P>
      <P>Dublin city has been mentioned often here.  We in the country have had experience of people coming from the city of Dublin on tours and causing considerable damage.  We have had to pay for the damage on a number of occasions.  I know of an occasion where young lads came for a hurling match but I have never seen anything happening at hurling or football matches.  There are gangs in the city which go down the country.  They are not very nice people.  We had to pay for the damage they caused.  The wealth of Ireland is around Dublin city.  I know their rates are high.  It is unfair on the decent people down the country to have to take responsibility for all the damage caused by vandals. We should not all have to pay for damage caused in Dublin.  I have reservations about it.  It should not be made a national charge.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister mentioned retrospection to 1st January, 1974.  He should go back further.  Deputy O'Malley mentioned that some counties pay more quickly than others.  That happens in many public offices.  It is unfair when a scheme is introduced that people who have been too quick to pay should come out as losers.  If some local authorities have paid compensation damages for 1973 and this only goes back to January, 1974, they will not come within the scope of this new arrangement.  The Minister should look at this point.  I would emphasise again the point about leaving the whole matter to the chief superintendent. Deputy O'Malley spoke about reservations in connection with this matter.  I had reservations about that and I have reservations now about putting it on the shoulders of one man to decide.  There should be some impartial arbitration set up that would deal with this matter and if the thing <Col N="638" /> is a little doubtful the courts should decide.  This is the most important part of it because it can be open to abuse.  I know I may not be relevant on this but I spent about ten minutes telling the Minister how open to abuse the postal vote was.  I think he knows about it now.</P>

I hope the Minister will consider the remarks I have made.</P>

      <P>I seldom speak in this House.  As an old lady said to me the other day when I was doing some county council canvassing: &ldquo;If you gabble as much inside the House as you do outside you should be a great TD&rdquo;.  However, my first remarks are quite in order when I say I want to congratulate the Minister on his drive since he became Minister for Local Government.  He, like me, was brought up in a hard school serving county councils over the years.  He has proved himself very well fitted for the high office he now holds.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I want to congratulate the Minister on the bit of liberalism he has brought into planning.  Up to this we had a lot of little tin gods set up who said: &ldquo;You do not build here, you do not build there.  In fact, you do not build anywhere.  You do not build on a main road.  You do not build on a by-road.  In fact, you must go to a bog or a mountain if you want to build&rdquo;. They would not let you build on a mountain because they said there was something scenic about it.  I am glad to see the Minister has seen the light and he is doing something about this. I encourage him to do more.  My remarks at all times in this House are brief.  I know the Minister is pushing <Col N="639" /> his housing programme as far as possible but it is not enough.</P>

This is probably outside the scope of the debate but it is a very vital point.  There are young people in my constituency who are on the verge of starvation because they cannot get insurance to drive cars.  I appeal to the Minister to do something about this.  It is a shame that people outside our jurisdiction can come in and put the hangman's noose around the neck of a young man who wants to earn a few pounds working on a Bord na Móna bog, with the county council, or somewhere else but he cannot get insurance on a car.  They might as well take his car away altogether.  In fact, he would be better off in Long Kesh or Mountjoy.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Minister for Local Government (Mr. Tully) James Tully">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Local Government (Mr. Tully)</NameTxt>
      <P>First of all, I would like to thank Deputies for the way in which they received the Supplementary Estimate, which was as I expected because it is something we all want to see.  The only thing I was a little bit surprised about was that some of the Deputies did not take the trouble to check up on some facts before they came in here. Most of the facts which I have were available to Members before the debate started.  There is very little in the statement I made at the start and very little was required because it is something to which I felt there would be no opposition.  The reason we have to go through the procedure of having the cases tried in the normal way, as if they were malicious injuries before the court, is, as everybody who is in public life knows, because malicious injuries claims are usually very inflated.  Sometimes one is amazed at the claims put in for thousands, and in some cases hundreds of thousands of pounds, <Col N="640" /> which are settled up for hundreds of pounds.  It is another day's work as to whether or not there should be some way of taking action against the people who put in such claims.  I notice most of the Deputies &mdash; I do not blame them because I would probably have done the same myself if I was in Opposition, and even the Parliamentary Secretary to the Taoiseach did the same thing &mdash; dealt with the malicious injuries code but this Estimate does not deal with that.</P>
      <P>I would like to say for the record, that it is a matter for the Minister for Justice, who has reached an advanced stage in his study on the malicious injuries code.  While I agree with a lot of the things said here today by Deputies I do not want to prejudge what the Minister for Justice will be putting before the House, I hope in the very near future, with regard to malicious injuries.</P>
      <P>I agree with the point made by Deputy Callanan about insurance companies.  Some people pay high insurance to cover their property and then find the insurance companies expect the local authorities and the ratepayers to pay for any damage that is done.  This has got to be stopped.  One of the things which will have to be looked at when the malicious injuries code is being investigated is this word &ldquo;malicious&rdquo;.  I had experience of two little boys who were mental defectives who burned down a school.  They were brought before the court which decided they were unable to plead and, therefore, could not be charged.  At a subsequent court another judge gave a decree for £11,000 for the malicious burning of the school by those two children who a previous court decided could not commit a malicious act.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Some Government years ago did not do anything about this.  I believe this is a matter which should have been dealt with long ago.  I do not want to make a political point on this but I think it has been overlooked for a long time and everybody will welcome the changes when they come in.  The points made on this Supplementary Estimate could very usefully be made when the new legislation <Col N="641" /> comes before the House, which must be pretty soon.</P>
    <P>Deputy O'Malley referred to the question of settling claims out of court.  This is a matter for the Minister for Justice.  I feel, as a layman, there should be a way of dealing with it but because of the fantastic claims which some people put in it was possibly felt up to now that it was proper to have them processed through the court.  If they were dealt with in any other way there might be a danger that people would get a lot more than they were entitled to.  Deputy Briscoe also spoke about processing the claims and investigating them much more than they should be.  All of us have heard of malicious injuries claims which have been paid and the amount subsequently spent on repairing a vehicle or a building was very much less than the sum of money granted by the courts.  This must mean there is a lot of fraud involved. It is another day's work and another Minister's work.  I do not propose to pursue it any further.</P>
    <P>Some Deputies asked why we had 1st January as the date of operation of retrospection for this Supplementary Estimate.  As far as I understand, most, if not all, of substantial payments on foot of decrees of court are after 1st January so there would not be any point in going back further because even some of the 1972 claims have not been paid.  Therefore, the 1st of January is quite safe and the House can be assured that it is reasonable and no one will be left out.</P>
    <P>With regard to the explosion at Silvermines, we all have our own views about this.  The certificate of the chief superintendent is required and I should not like to prejudge the matter.  Some Deputies have argued that it was wrong to ask the chief superintendent to decide.  As I understand it, the main reason for selecting one person was to ensure there would be no delay in making a decision. Subsequent to the court deciding on a claim, if we had another committee sitting to decide whether or not this occurred as a result of an explosion because of the Northern troubles, we <Col N="642" /> would reach a stage at which the delays that can possibly occur under malicious injury claims might be accentuated.</P>
    <P>Deputy O'Malley asked me to spell out something I had already spelled out during the course of his own speech.  The idea is that, once a decision has been given by the court, the matter will then be referred to the chief superintendent.  If he gives a certificate it goes to the Department of Justice and then it comes to the Department of Local Government, after which payment should be made within not more than three months. This would be a very big improvement. I quite appreciate the difficulties that have occurred up to now.</P>
    <P>All insurance companies are not as decent as the one with which Deputy Fitzpatrick is dealing because they do not all put up the required money and subsequently claim recoupment. Because of the long delay in the past I have known cases where people had to go out of business since they could not raise the necessary money.  I should like to see in the new code something covering this but at the moment I am dealing with just one specific item.  The idea is that we will prevent these long delays and, as soon as the certificate is given by the chief superintendent, payment can be made in a very short time.  I have already communicated with the local authorities advising them as to what is proposed and asking them that payment should be made without any delay.  A great many people should be paid in the very near future. Whether or not the chief superintendent is the proper person is another question.  All I can say to the House is that we should see how it works and, if it does not work, we can have another look at it.  The job of the Government and the Opposition is to ensure that these particular people are paid as quickly as possible and the suggestion we have made is, we think, reasonable.</P>
    <P>The Parliamentary Secretary to the Taoiseach referred to the interdepartmental committee of 1963 which dealt with malicious injuries.  Their attitude was rather odd because as long ago <Col N="643" /> as 1963 it was quite obvious to everyone we were reaching a stage where malicious injuries were becoming an intolerable burden on the rates.  My ambition is to see the rates replaced by some other system of local taxation, but the position is that because of the type of malicious injuries occurring something has got to be done, and the Minister for Justice is doing it.</P>
    <P>The extraordinary thing about malicious damage is that in most cases nobody sees it done.  The ratepayer complains, and rightly so; everybody, including Members of this House, complain because they have to pay more money by way of rates, but these are the people who stand by and see young hooligans smashing public and private property and make no effort to bring the matter to the notice of the authorities. This is quite wrong and the sooner we get a little more public spirit about this sort of thing the better it will be for all concerned.  The number involved in this type of hooliganism is relatively small.  They constitute a small group in this city and in other cities and towns throughout the country. These are the people who are consistently damaging property.  Yet, nobody sees them do it.  We hear about the telephone kiosks smashed up and when we talk about it everyone clamps down as soon as the question of names comes up.  Now we cannot have it both ways and, if we want to put an end to the type of damage for which ratepayers are paying so heavily, we will have to stand up to it and ensure that these small groups of vandals every-where are named and dealt with as they should be dealt with.</P>
    <P>Deputy Leonard referred to the bomb damage in Monaghan.  He can be assured that the cases he referred to are covered by this legislation.  I was afraid for a moment he was going to go a little bit too far.  I rather felt he was a person with very large stones in his pocket and a very small glass-house around him.</P>
    <P>Deputy Brugha also referred to the delay in making payments.  Let me repeat that the delay will now be con-considerably reduced.  The ambition is <Col N="644" /> to see it reduced as much as possible so that those who get a court order will be paid as quickly as possible.</P>
    <P>Deputy Dowling wanted to know what type of malicious injury is going to be certified.  If I were to make any forecast on that, I would be prejudging what the chief superintendent will decide and I should not like to tie his hand since anything I might say here might prevent him making the decision he intended to make.  I hasten to add that I have a great respect for the Garda.  A number of Deputies referred to lobbying.  We are lobbied and they are lobbied.  A person who has a job to do and has not got the moral courage to do it as it should be done, irrespective of whether or not he is lobbied, is not fit for the position he is in.  I believe a chief superintendent, no matter what lobbying is done, will always make his decision fairly.  I would trust all chief superintendents to do that. Should it turn out subsequently that I am wrong, then we can have another look at this.  By passing this on to the chief superintendent we are putting people in the position in which those who are entitled to be paid will be paid without further delay.</P>
    <P>Deputy O'Malley and others commented on the provision of £1 million. It was suggested that this looked as if claims would not be processed this year.  The way things go I will be very surprised if claims are processed this year.  We have only another six months left.  We could have put in a token Estimate for £10.  What we did was to put in an Estimate for £1 million because half the year has gone and we thought £1 million should be sufficient for the moment.  If it is not we will bring in another Supplementary Estimate.  There is no mystery about this.  We are dealing with it in a very reasonable way.</P>
    <P>Once more, I thank the House for dealing with this matter so expeditiously.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>One of the reasons why it is the chief superintendent is that, in the course of his investigation of the case, he must know all the facts.  I think Deputy Dowling asked who caused the trouble in Dublin.  I do not know and I do not believe anybody knows with certainty.  The people who will be able to give us the best idea as to who did it are the Garda.  The chief superintendent will be acting on that at present.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>I did.  The reason why we have not suggested independent assessors is that we want a quick decision. If they were involved it could mean a delay of a month or two months or six months while an assessment was carried out.  We are suggesting the person who will be responsible for the investigation of the actual crime in the area and who, therefore, should have first-hand knowledge as to who was responsible for it.  If that does not work out, we are prepared to have another look at it.  We suggest this is the best way because it will mean that those who have got decrees and who have not been paid &mdash; that is most of the people concerned &mdash; will now be able to get their money immediately following the report from the superintendent.  With an assessor or a number of assessors it could take months on end.</P>

The staff in the Department of Posts and Telegraphs at all levels deserve a very high tribute from all of us.  I am sure many of us can be difficult and hard to please.

    <P>He addressed an aside to the unions which I thought was unbecoming to him, particularly coming from the party he represents.  He said that the national wage agreement having been implemented other requests were being made which also put up staff costs.  He said:</P>
    <P>With the emergence of national wage agreements securing general increases for all staff, unions are in a position to concentrate&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <P>I think this is a subtle criticism of the unions</P>
    <P>&mdash;&mdash;on claims for special increases for more pay or improved conditions supplemental to the increases provided for in the national agreements.</P>
    <P>Reading between the lines here the Minister is saying in a very subtle way that the unions representing the members of the staff are not entitled to make such claims.</P>

      <P>The Minister said that the unions are in a position to concentrate on claims for special increases.  Here we have the Minister of a Department, the boss, the man in charge of the Department, speaking on this subject.  The Minister devoted two and a half pages to this culminating on the beautiful point that no major economies can be achieved in the short term without curtailment of services and a discharge of staff.</P>

      <P>The atmosphere there must have been very good but I would interpret this as possibly a threat from the Minister to these people to go a little easy on their demands on him or he is saying to the general public that he either gives the increases or lays off staff or the people of Ireland will have to pay more for the postal services.  The Minister is telling us that this present Government, under whom we have seen prices escalating since February of last year, because of increasing costs will have to come in with another mini-budget to meet the rising costs in his Department.</P>

      <P>We have the Minister plugging and trying to pad the way for increased charges for Post Office services to the general public. <Col N="650" /> He has spent two and a half pages bemoaning and begroaning the fact that wage increases are soaring.  When I read this, it reminded me of what one would have expected from one of the big Dublin bosses, or big Dublin employers, in the pre-1913 period.  This is something the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs would not like me to think of him but it is the impression he creates in my mind.  He created the impression that here was the big boss, the man in authority, a member of the Labour Party, telling the staff of the post offices throughout the country that it was wrong for them to be seeking increases over and above the national wage agreement.  I hope I am wrong in my interpretation of it because I would be amazed that a Minister would have that idea.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. G. Fitzgerald Mr. G. Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I have read it fully but the overall impression must come across that here is the big boss waving the stick and stating that his costs are soaring because his boys are looking for more money.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister concerned states on page 18 that he recognises their right to do this.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. G. Fitzgerald Mr. G. Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>Agreed, but he goes on to bemoan and begroan just like one of the 1913 big bosses would have done in Dublin city.  He throws in that but he goes on from there to complain about these increasing costs.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In my view the staff of the Department of Posts and Telegraphs have given, and are giving, an excellent service to the general public.  I should like to mention in particular the ladies and gentlemen who man telephone exchanges and the postmen in rural areas who work under very trying conditions.  They are deserving of our appreciations.  On the question of postal deliveries the Minister has mentioned that we now have 650 motorised units representing 45 per cent of the total mileage covered by the postal service.  In my opinion this is <Col N="651" /> inadequate progress and progress too slow.  If we take it that 55 per cent of the mileage covered by the Department of Posts and Telegraphs in postal deliveries is still being operated by people on foot or on bicycles, then the progress is not adequate.  I accept that the progress was slowed down during the recent fuel crisis and that it has now gathered momentum.  I should like to encourage the Minister to press forward in this regard in an effort to see that all the outlying services are adequately covered by motorised transport.</P>
    <P>I should like to refer to the cut in postal services in the Cork area.  From the Minister's statement I understand that it also occurred in Dublin and Dun Laoghaire.  While I accept that the Department had a function to do in trying to save and conserve fuel during those critical months, the Department must also ensure that its efficiency is not impaired or that anything it does will not create problems for local people.  I can recall putting letters into pillar boxes during those months &mdash; I am talking about areas where the Minister had deliveries reduced from four to two per day &mdash; and having to put in my hand to push down the letters already in that box. It would have been no problem for me, or anybody else, to take out many of those letters and throw them away.</P>
    <P>In my opinion this was impairing the efficiency of the Department to too great an extent to comply with the situation that arose.  The 50 per cent cut in the number of collections was aggravated by the timing of those collections.  In some areas there was no collection from 4.45 p.m. until 1.30 p.m. the following day.</P>
    <P>I was glad to see the Minister paying tribute to the previous Administration and I am glad that the Minister for Local Government is here to listen to that tribute.  The Minister for Posts and Telegraphs stated that 101 extra postmen were created because of housing and other developments in urban areas.  It certainly is a tribute to the previous Administration that there was such housing development that it necessitated the creation of 101 extra posts.  I have no <Col N="652" /> doubt that the Minister for Local Government has noted that compliment and that he will not now say that no houses were built by the previous Administration.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, I provided the figures.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. G. Fitzgerald Mr. G. Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs for that tribute to the previous Administration. I am glad to note also the Minister's reference to our postal history.  An effort should be made to preserve this great history.</P>
      <P>Perhaps some speeches made by the Minister in other places are not intended to be taken as seriously as they are.  Because the Minister is a man who likes surrounding himself by controversy he may not always mean what he says.  However, I shall deal later with the question of our history and culture.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister refers, to the waiting list for telephone installations.  We seem to be losing ground in so far as this work is concerned although 30,000 new lines were connected last year which was 3,000 more than the previous year, there were still some 41,000 applications awaiting attention, an increase of 9,000 during the year so there was a net loss there of 6,000 on the previous year.  I take issue with the Minister is <Col N="653" /> his reference to the highest priority being given to raising the general standard even at the cost, where necessary, of restricting the intake of new subscribers. In his reply I trust that the Minister will tell us specifically where the major improvements have been carried out, in which areas of the country they have been carried out and whether, for example, improvements in the capital city have not been made at the expense of applicants in, say, Cork. The priority aspects of the situation need to be reviewed.</P>
    <P>On a number of occasions the Minister has reminded us of the various categories that are given priority but I am aware that occasionally the queue is jumped in so far as the priority list is concerned.  I would suggest that the highest priority be given to any young man starting a business. Provided a man employs six persons he will be facilitated with a telephone but in many cases the person who has the courage and initiative to go into business will be on his own or at least have fewer than six employees initially.  A telephone would be of vital importance to that man and would help him in the expansion of his business; otherwise, he may have to struggle in his efforts to an extent that would not be necessary in the event of his having a telephone at his disposal.</P>
    <P>There are other categories of persons, too, who deserve priority such as those living in remote areas and, perhaps, where there are no local transport facilities but I would put the emphasis on the man going into business because it may be very frustrating for him to be told that he has no chance of having a telephone installed for at least a year or two.  Many of our big businesses have grown from small beginnings and that is another reason why we should give every encouragement in the initial stages of a business.</P>
    <P>On page 15 of his speech the Minister refers to price increases and he attributes these to inflation.  It is amazing that up to 1973 the responsibility for increases in the costs of commodities or services was placed on the Fianna Fáil Government but that since then inflation is blamed entirely <Col N="654" /> for cost increases.  We all know that the Minister for Finance has helped to worsen the inflationary situation. Therefore, the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs must level some of the blame for the increases in costs associated with his Department at the Minister for Finance.  In a nice way the Minister is telling the public that because of inflation, because of national wage agreements and because of other increases in costs it is necessary for his Department to increase their charges.</P>
    <P>There is a warning from the Minister of a possible increase in television licence fees and the reason for this, we are told, is that there is a diminishing volume of advertising on television. Perhaps the Minister will tell us the reasons for this situation. Would one of the reasons be a lack of finance on the part of the private sector because of various circumstances.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMKelly" hpid="Mr. Kelly Mr. Kelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>Some advertisers are being encouraged to reduce their advertising, for example, the building societies.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. G. Fitzgerald Mr. G. Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Parliamentary Secretary saying that that is the reason for diminishing advertising?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMKelly" hpid="Mr. Kelly Mr. Kelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>No.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. G. Fitzgerald Mr. G. Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister has not given us the reason.  I accept the point made by the Parliamentary Secretary but I trust that in his reply the Minister will elaborate on this aspect.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One welcomes readily the provision in the network to allow for a choice of programmes.  Those of us who live in the south are at a disadvantage in that there is not available to us a choice of channels, a facility which, by accident or otherwise, is available to people in the eastern part of the country.  Another matter I have brought to the attention of the Minister on other occasions by way of supplementary questions is the matter of black spots.  We are told that £1 million is being provided for the elimination of black spots.  I am sure there is no need for me to elaborate on what I mean by black spots.  They are the areas which because of geographic or other features, are not receiving worthwhile reception of our <Col N="655" /> national television service.  He hopes that considerable progress will be made in that respect this year.  I pointed out to him at Question Time some time ago that in the valley from Ballygarvan to Ballinhassig, a few miles from Cork city, television reception is almost nonexistent. This is a social problem which needs to be looked at by the Department providing the television service.</P>
    <P>I was impressed when I heard that the Minister had a little aside with the unions, and he was saying to the staff that he was the big boss and they were overdoing their demands for increases.  I also thought he was unfair to the Broadcasting Review Committee.  He over did his criticism of that body.  He could have said that most of the report did not appeal to him.  That body was appointed to do a specific job.  The fact that their report was not entirely satisfactory to him, did not justify him condemning and criticising it to such an extent.  Of course, he inserted a paragraph thanking them for their efforts.  If I had been a member of that committee I would have felt that I had been rapped on the knuckles by the Minister and it would have been the last time I, as a citizen, would undertake to sit on a review body appointed by a Minister.  I would not like to believe that the fact that this committee was appointed by his predecessor biased the Minister's thinking on this report.</P>
    <P>A correspondent in one of the Sunday newspapers stated that for the next few days we in this House would be giving our views on specific television shows.  He gave me the impression that he felt we had not the ability to judge shows or, if we had, we were only flying our kites by referring to them.  I do not intend to go into detail about television programmes.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMKelly" hpid="Mr. Kelly Mr. Kelly">

    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. G. Fitzgerald Mr. G. Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree whole-heartedly. If we as Deputies wish to express our views on television programmes he should not inhibit us any more than we inhibit him from making his comments, which are not always complimentary, in his weekly contributions to the newspaper.</P>
    </Speaker>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Kelly</NameTxt>

      <P>If he had gone on to say that the Deputies may not be in a position to comment on television programmes because they do not see them as often as they might like, I could accept that point as valid. RTE is a powerful media going into many homes throughout the country.  We are all biased when we look at current affairs programmes because we look at them from our own point of view.  I do not think we got a fair break in the earlier months of this Government.  Despite that, it is important that the programmes be topical, examine subjects in depth, be well-balanced and informative on educational and other bases.  RTE provide a service which, if carried in the wrong direction, could have very serious consequences for our youth. Everyone with a young family realises how young people absorb the programmes set to suit them, just as teenagers will listen to and be guided by comments expressed on the media.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I heard the Parliamentary Secretary's contribution.  He agreed that we have a culture, history and language which was dear to those who have gone before us.  We have a right to preserve and respect our heritage. It deserves coverage on our television media.  Its extent is not overdone, in fact, I would be inclined to say the opposite.  I would hate to think that <Col N="657" /> any Minister for Posts and Telegraphs would seriously suggest that this type of programme should be eliminated from our radio and television. Our culture, history and language are distinctive qualities of our life.  We are in the EEC now.  We, as a nation, have a right to retain and respect our heritage.  If there is to be a difference between us and the European races we must preserve these particular and specific characteristics of our heritage.</P>
    <P>There is a certain inconsistency in what the Minister says in places other than this House.  During the EEC campaign he shared the same platform with those who advocated the loss of our heritage, culture and language if we entered the EEC.  We said that we would like to see them preserved. Now the Minister is saying that these things no longer matter in our society.</P>

      <P>I wish to refer specifically to a bias which has been apparent, perhaps not to such a great extent in present weeks as it was <Col N="658" /> some months ago.  At the opening of the Irish Ballet Company season in Cork when RTE covered the opening night and showed the film subsequently the Lord Mayor of Cork, The Ministers for Education and Transport and Power and the Shadow Minister for Finance were present. The three people I have mentioned first were shown entering Cork Opera House that night.  Deputy Colley, who was a former Minister for Finance and is now Shadow Minister, was barely shown at all.  He was the man responsible for the State aid being given to that ballet company. He was as entitled as any of the three others to be photographed as he entered Cork Opera House.  I made inquiries about the matter only to discover that the cameras were cut after the three members of the Government side had passed in.  It is a small point.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnMKelly" hpid="Mr. Kelly Mr. Kelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>It is quite a big and fair point.  When we were in Opposition we were blotted off the screen every night by Deputy Molloy jumping into swimming pools.  The Ministers then in office virtually took over the screen.  On another occasion recently Deputy Tunney was shown.

      <P>I am sorry the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs is not here to listen to my comments.  I maintain that he is controlling the media through the Government Information Services.  Last week, on the night of the unfortunate collapse of the Northern Assembly, the Leader of the Opposition got very little mention in spite of what he had said in this House but others were interviewed and their views and comments sought. Deputy Lynch got very sparse coverage on the television.  I am satisfied that the Minister has appointed men in key positions who are determined to convey an image of the Government that is not correct.  The Government are probably on their last legs.  They are cracking up.  With the help of the Minister and of RTE we are not being given the impression that we have a Government that is tottering at every level and in every Department.  The biggest, strongest and most responsible political party in the country are not being fairly dealt with.  On 18th June we will have an opportunity of seeing that the people are aware of where the strength lies.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I love sport and speaking for all sport lovers I must say that the sports programmes on Sunday nights during the winter were not acceptable.  People take their sport seriously.  On Sunday nights we like to hear the results and to hear what happened at the various games.  I am not speaking merely on my own behalf.  This view has been <Col N="660" /> expressed by organisations covering various types of sport.  I like to see Raquel Welch on television but I think there is a time and a place to show her. It is not suitable to show her during the sports programmes on Sunday nights.  This view should be conveyed to RTE.</P>
    <P>I want to compliment the people responsible for the present sports programme, which is an excellent one.  The programmes during the winter months made a joke of sport.  RTE should not repeat programmes like that.  Such programmes should not be imposed on us next winter.</P>
    <P>I will await the Minister's reply.  I hope he will cover some of the points I have mentioned and not give us a low-key speech bemoaning the fact that his staff are looking for increases, that inflation is affecting his costs and that advertising on TV is going down. The Minister's statement from beginning to end smacks too much of the old boss in the pre-1913 period.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BenBriscoe" hpid="Mr. Briscoe Mr. Briscoe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Briscoe</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to emphasise the serious deterioration in the telephone services throughout the country and particularly in the city.  I do not think these services have ever been so bad.  Every time the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs speaks he does not seem to be talking about his Department. He talks about anything except his Department.  It seems as if we have no Minister for Posts and Telegraphs at all.</P>
      <P>The difficulties of getting telephone numbers in this city are frustrating.  A short while ago I asked the Minister a Parliamentary Question about the number of complaints which he had received in the course of this year. Frankly, I was astounded that the number was so high.  The figure in Dublin was something around 10,000 complaints about the telephone services. The figure in the country was about 20,000.  Only about one in ten people probably bother to ring up at all complaining about the service.  This is indicative of the gross deterioration in the telephone service.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister said that the number of local calls grew by an estimated 10 per cent.  In view of the increase in the number of telephones installed, this <Col N="661" /> seems to me to indicate that people are getting so frustrated with the telephone they are not bothering to use it.  If I have three or four phone calls to make I might only get three short calls in one hour.  In the end I get so frustrated that I give up.  The telephone service is rapidly deteriorating.  I hope there will be some improvement in it in the near future.  I do not know why things have deteriorated so much recently.</P>
    <P>The previous speaker referred to the political bias which appears to many people to be operating in RTE in relation to speakers from the Opposition party.  I believe the people throughout the country are very well aware of this and do not need us to come into the House and say this.  When Fianna Fáil were in Government we very rarely had an incident where a Fianna Fáil Minister went on the &ldquo;This Week&rdquo; programme on radio who was not flanked by two members of the Opposition, a Labour member and a Fine Gael member.  As the previous speaker said, up to fairly recently we had Government Ministers, together with other members of their parties going on radio but not being flanked by a member of the Opposition party.</P>
    <P>When you get such imbalances people switch off.  They are not interested in hearing one side of the argument.  They want to hear both sides.  This happens a lot more than RTE realises.  There is too much emphasis on public affairs, particularly on radio, at the present time.  I asked a gentleman from RTE recently why they did not have the Northern Ireland news separate from the ordinary news.  I told him that as far as many people were concerned there seemed to be only two places in Ireland, Dublin and the North of Ireland and why should we not have a little more news.  His answer was that we would not get away from it that easily, that we would have to listen to it whether we liked it or not. I told him that people do not have to listen to it whether we liked it or not. to the BBC, who have a very good news programme where you get world news and can hear a little bit more about what is going on in the world. We seem to be a little bit too insular. We should not forget the problems in <Col N="662" /> the North of Ireland but we should have more world news than we have at the moment.  I favour very much programmes like &ldquo;Today in the Dáil&rdquo; and &ldquo;Today in the Northern Assembly&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>A doctor told me recently that 25 per cent of his patients suffer from nervous tension.  He told me that when he asked them if they listened to the radio a lot the answer was usually &ldquo;Yes&rdquo;.  When he asked them if they read the papers a lot the answer usually was &ldquo;Yes&rdquo;.  His advice to them was to switch off the radio as too much of it builds up tension, of which we have a lot in our society at the moment.  Public affairs programmes are fine but you can have a little too much of them.  When the &ldquo;Here and Now&rdquo; programme started off it was excellent with first class presenters. They had lively interviews with people visiting our city.  The people enjoyed this very much.  Then the programme became terribly serious and day after day we have very serious discussions, nearly all about what is happening in the north.  If I appear to overstress the misery in our country at the moment it does not mean that I care less about what is happening but I think you can over-kill in the sense of people switching off altogether. RTE should look at this.</P>
    <P>Many people switch over to the BBC and Radio 2 for entertainment, music and guest appearances of various well-known people because they want to be entertained.  The housewife in her home is busy and has not time to sit down and listen to the radio.  When I travel from place to place in my car I can switch the radio on and listen to various interviews but this does not suit the public in general.</P>
    <P>There is a little overemphasis in RTE on public affairs.  They should go back to a little more entertainment. Their prime function is to entertain and through that to educate, to make education a pleasurable experience.  We can do that by not taking ourselves as seriously as we do.  There is no balance in the Sunday &ldquo;News at One&rdquo; programme. I remember being pretty disgusted when there was an item on building societies.  Deputy Molloy <Col N="663" /> was interviewed on the phone from his home in Galway.  The Minister for Local Government, Deputy Tully, sat comfortably in the studio and was questioned about various things which Deputy Molloy said, who was not present to be able to say the Minister did not interpret correctly what he said. The people have a tremendous sense of fair play.  I want again to press the Minister to do something about the telephone service which is terrible at the moment.  It has never been worse and people are nearly driven out of their minds trying to get local calls.  It is indeed very bad.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesCTunney" hpid="Mr. Tunney Mr. Tunney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tunney</NameTxt>
      <P>I shall start on the note on which Deputy Briscoe has concluded. I know appeals have been made before and I know this is a matter that cannot be dealt with over-night, but nevertheless I appeal to the Minister in respect of what must be regarded as an utterly inadequate telephone service in Dublin and, I am sure, elsewhere.  If we wanted to be flippant we could all admit that there were occasions on which we got a better radio programme by listening on our telephones than we actually got from Radio Éireann.  I do not say that to denigrate the programmes we get from Radio Éireann.  Of the two media I am much more a radio man than a television man.  I say this merely to bring home to the Minister the utter and complete lack of privacy on our telephone service.  In this House, I have had the experience of attempting to make a call and finding myself being answered by Deputy Gerry L'Estrange. I think one need say no more as an indication of how undesirable the position is.  When one lifts a receiver one should be guaranteed one's destination and the speaker whom one is calling.  One should also feel absolutely happy that, while speaking on the telephone, no third party will be involved.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This is not a problem that has appeared with this Government.  It was there before the Minister took office.  I mention it because I have not seen any evidence of the system having been improved in the last year or so and, from that point of view <Col N="664" /> the present holder of the office must accept responsibility.</P>
    <P>Other speakers have mentioned the frustration that arises because of inability to get through to anybody when one is so determined.  Of the two I should be happier putting up with the latter rather than the former. Post Office engineers told me on one occasion that it was impossible for me, having moved only to the second digit, to get any voice at all.  I am sure they now realise that what I said was perfectly true.  The technicians may claim that technically it is not possible; in actual fact we know that at any stage from the time one lifts the receiver until one is finished, one is liable, putting it mildly, to hear anything and be heard by anybody.</P>
    <P>It was, I think, Deputy Briscoe who said that he would accuse the Minister of neglect in what can be regarded as the more mundane and less glamourous duties devolving upon him.  I would not agree with Deputy Briscoe in that regard, but I have one reservation to make.  During the year I brought to the notice of the Minister the very unsatisfactory situation obtaining in part of my constituency in east Finglas.  Local residents had been denied normal post office facilities for a period of 12 months. Actually I am not too sure that the problem has yet been resolved.  I brought that to the notice of the Minister and the Minister, in his latest reply to me, indicated that the matter was now finally being attended to.  If the Minister were genuinely interested in the residents of that area he should have probed a little deeper into the matter and not accepted the answers prepared for him by his officials.</P>
    <P>Three weeks or a month ago, I had a question to the Minister about a newly developed area in south Finglas in what is called the Tolka Valley. I asked the Minister would he expedite the provision of telephone kiosks and of a post office in that area.  This is a new town and those moving into it are people from all over the city.  They are people who suffered many botherations in one way or another and, because of that, were offered new houses in this area.  I would hope the Minister would share <Col N="665" /> with me a concern for lightening the burden on these people in every way possible.  Here I come to the reservation in not agreeing entirely with Deputy Briscoe, who would say that the Minister is not interested in these matters.  I would say that he has an interest but I would like to see evidence of his probing instead of his accepting the answers provided for him.</P>
    <P>When I asked the Minister for particulars as to the nearest post office in the Tolka Valley area his answer was that there were three sub-post offices within a radius of three-quarters of a mile or half a mile.  Had the Minister given thought to that, he should have sent a reply to his official saying: &ldquo;Look, I am not happy; this is a reply which perhaps other Ministers might accept but I realise that when one places a compass on the map and can show that there may be another sub-post office within half a mile, that does not give a clear picture of all the botheration and hardship caused to a lady who has to make the journey from her place of residence to the post office.  In all probability the journey she travels may be a mile or a mile-and-a-half, as in some of the cases I instanced. If one considers the real position obtaining one must be more sympathetically disposed to the ladies, and indeed the gentlemen, who will have need of the facilities and services available to them in those post offices.</P>
    <P>I mentioned this matter here hoping that, having brought it to the Minister's attention, he might assure me that he has given it additional consideration and, having regard to the fact that probably similar problems arise in his own developing constituency, he will probe beyond the superficial, sugared answer which all civil servants and Ministers like to give to the House but which, in my opinion, is an abuse of this House and not at all in accordance with the entitlement of the people whom we claim to represent.</P>
    <P>On the matter of post offices and sub-post offices, there is one final point I should like to make.  That is <Col N="666" /> to repeat my request, in regard to the areas around Dublin city, where children's allowances are so vital to many of the mothers, that the Minister's Department and the Department of Social Welfare might agree to some system of payment which will have much more regard to the dignity of the lady whose right it is to collect children's allowances on a particular day or, indeed, on any day of the month.  I do not enjoy mentioning these matters because I am fully aware that the Minister, and indeed every other Deputy, is, and should be, as sympathetic as am I to the people who suffer, and suffer they do.</P>
    <P>In the matter of which might be regarded as priorities, I realise that one could relegate this matter to a minor position.  While I accept that that attitude is prevalent and might be justified in some cases, on the other hand I freely admit that the importance of the person must claim priority over everything else.  Where it can be shown that any citizen, in the pursuit of some service which is his or her entitlement finds the facilities are not in keeping with what should be accepted as our regard for our people, one cannot mention or criticise too often the shortcomings existing.</P>
    <P>We must remember that while for the rest of us there is no such day as children's allowance day, because we are not waiting for the money, to these people there is the children's allowance day, which is the first day on which the money becomes payable. I wonder what thoughts run through the minds of the children who accompany their mothers to the post offices or sub-post offices and who find themselves standing outside&mdash;and here we must think of mid-winter conditions&mdash; in the cold and rain in queues of perhaps 50, 60, 70 or 100 yards long waiting for the payment of money which this House has decided to grant them.  Again, and not to quote the words of the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Social Welfare with whom I entirely agree this is payment of money which is in no way a charity but which is their due entitlement.  Apart from what thoughts the children might have on affairs of <Col N="667" /> State, I wonder what are the thoughts of the mothers who are subjected to such hardship in the collection of their children's allowances.  I am quite sure it is not outside the ingenuity or capabilities of the officials of the Departments of Posts and Telegraphs and Social Welfare to introduce a form of payment which will eliminate this scandal which exists in certain areas in our city.  One is forced to the impression, too, that if the hardship existed in what might be regarded as the more residential parts of our city the matter would not need such repetition as it has received in this House.</P>
    <P>In whatever period of office remains to the Minister of Posts and Telegraphs my indebtedness to him will arise more on the score of whatever action he may take and I would be more convinced that the true spirit of socialism was manifesting itself in his regard for people if I had evidence that action had been taken in regard to these matters, especially the payment of children's allowances.  If action is taken in that respect then to me, apart from all else, his period in office as Minister for Posts and Telegraphs will have been justified.</P>
    <P>There is a Chinese proverb about the man who was continually watching the stars and not seeing what was happening at his feet.  So far as my remarks up to this referred exclusively to what may be regarded as being at my feet I am now moving to matters which, correctly or otherwise, are regarded as being on a higher level.  Much has been said about the influence of television and radio and about the power and the merit of communication.  I must admit to having some doubts recently about whether the influence is altogether as powerful as we think it is. I am talking now on planes which are perhaps philosophical, not about the power of television or radio to sell records or create pop kings and queens, but about its power to influence people in a worthy and lasting way.  I can see both agencies exercising a certain influence, which might be regarded as ephemeral, but whether we should accept that radio or <Col N="668" /> television do much more than entertain or agitate the mind&mdash;but only to a point of convincing one that the ideas, thoughts and impressions which one has and the wisdom which one thinks one has captured are still the best&mdash;I do not know.</P>
    <P>Presumably if television and radio do nothing more than confirm the viewer or listener in the wisdom of his prevailing thoughts, it is giving a service but I do not think we should accept that unless we gear television and radio in a certain way it can lead to our ultimate destruction or to dispelling all worthwhile thought or, on the other hand, that it is an agency that can be geared to the creation of a climate or educational atmosphere superior to all else.  Recently somebody said he thought television was driving people to pubs.  I do not accept that but his point was that because of the intrusion of television on domestic and household conversations and pastimes, people were less inclined to welcome certain programmes.  People had now become accustomed to thought being compartmentalised for them.  They were obliged to sit and listen to or look at people who regarded themselves or might be regarded by others as the sole custodians of all that was correct.  They found themselves listening to or watching programmes which ostensibly were designed to educate and seemed <i>ab initio</i> to set out to prove conclusively that this or that was the true position and excluded all else but instead of its reaching over a wide area&mdash;which it would claim to do&mdash; the manner in which questions were put limited the discussion.  If the person being interviewed wanted to move outside the limits set by the presenter of the programme such comment was not welcome.  People are beginning to move away from that kind of programme. They do not feel any sense of participation in it.  While I do not agree with the person who said such programmes were driving people to the pubs, I accept that the point he was making was valid to the extent that there are not sufficient programmes in which the viewer or the listener can become really involved.</P>
    <P>Deputy Briscoe referred to morning <Col N="669" /> programmes.  In the last year I have been listening to these programmes and, although they appear to think they can cure certain tensions that exist in society at the moment, it is impossible to listen to them and not feel under severe tension. Instead of helping towards the elimination of stress, it could be argued that some of the programmes and the topics discussed leave the listener with a far greater degree of tension after the programmes have concluded.</P>
    <P>Here we are faced with the problems that arise when one considers the programmes that will satisfy the listener or the viewer.  Unfortunately, human beings have an immediate attraction towards morbidity, the gruesome or news items that are distasteful in themselves.  Here the Minister might intervene and indicate that it is not necessary all the time to pander to what gives ephemeral or immediate satisfaction; rather the obligation lies in providing a more lasting, wholesome and beneficial satisfaction.</P>
    <P>Reference has been made to what was described as the Minister's Waterford speech.  I am happy that since that speech, or more correctly that alleged speech, the Minister has indicated to this House and elsewhere that, to say the least, there has been some misunderstanding as to what was said.</P>

      <P>Later I would appreciate a copy but it will not deter me now from continuing in this vein. Here is evidence of what I referred to earlier and of the attraction that lies for television, radio and the Press to report what might be newsworthy rather than something that is abolutely factual.  If that is what happened well and good, but I think the Minister would accept that from general reporting of the speech it was assumed and accepted that he was unusually critical of the Irish content of radio and television programmes.  Apart <Col N="670" /> from that, the Minister was reported as having accused the people in television and radio who deal with programmes in Irish of a domineering attitude&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Tunney</NameTxt>
      <P>I thought it strange in that speech that if the Minister had evidence he did not refer to the reaction of the listeners and viewers to these programmes.  I have not heard any criticism from people regarding the amount of Irish in programmes. On the contrary, I have heard many comments and many expressions of disappointment that we have not many more programmes.  People whose knowledge of Irish is not that wonderful have said that the programme &ldquo;Féach&rdquo; is one of the best television programmes.  Subsequent to the Minister's speech, I had hoped to get information on the TAM ratings of a programme such as &ldquo;Féach&rdquo; but, unfortunately, the Ceann Comhairle's office advised me it was not a matter for the Minister to give these details.  I hope that it is now in order for me to refer to the matter so that the Minister in his reply might give us some information regarding the reaction of the people.  I am not talking about the Gaelic leaders, the Gaelgeoirí, Conradh na Gaeilge or Comhdháil Náisiúnta na Gaeilge or what might be regarded as a lobbying group.  I am not concerned about them at this point, or their alleged desire to impose Irish on the people.  I am anxious to get from the Minister the people's reaction to these programmes.</P>

I should point out, however, that the number of inseminations in the first quarter <Col N="674" /> of the year normally represents less than 10 per cent of the total inseminations in any year.

      <P>I have already given some reason why inseminations in the first quarter would be less than they would be later on in the year.  It may also be because everybody was advising people in the liquid milk trade that the differential between the liquid price and the price for processing was not great enough to induce them to work seven days a week.  In very little over a year I increased that differential by 10.25 per gallon.  That is a very substantial increase and it should now be very attractive for people to continue in winter milk production.</P>

      <P>Under the provisions of the treaties establishing the European Communities, to which the Irish <Col N="689" /> Government adhere in accordance with the decision of the Irish people, the council may, acting unanimously on a proposal from the commission, decide upon the measures appropriate to the conjunctural situation in the Community. Where these measures have been adopted unanimously by the council, the commission have the further function of proposing directives for action to give effect to these measures, these proposals being subject to adoption by the council by a qualified majority.  Finally, in addition to these provisions of Article 103 of the EEC Rome Treaty, Article 155 requires the commission, in order to ensure the proper functioning and development of the Common Market, to formulate recommendations or deliver opinions on matters dealt with in the Rome Treaty, to the extent that the treaty expressly so provides or if the commission considers it necessary to do so. The commission, of course, have other functions under other articles of treaties.</P>
      <P>The representations which the Deputy proposes that I should make would accordingly be inappropriate as they would involve seeking to dissuade the commission from carrying out the functions conferred on it by the treaties to which we have adhered in response to the wishes of the Irish people.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Foreign Affairs if there are serious implications for this country in the deadlock which has now been reached in negotiations between the EEC and 44 African, Caribbean and Pacific island states concerning the key issues of access for agricultural products and arrangements for trade in raw materials; and if he will <Col N="691" /> make a statement on the matter.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>Negotiations under Protocol 22 of the Accession Treaty concerning relations between the European Economic Community and its member States on the one hand and the Associated African and Malagasy States and the independent Commonwealth countries in Africa, the Indian and Pacific Oceans and the Caribbean on the other, were formally inaugurated by the conference in Brussels on 25th and 26th July, 1973.  Substantive negotiations commenced in Brussels in the autumn and are continuing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is not true to say that deadlock has been reached.  The position is that while considerable progress has been made in a number of areas, the community had difficulty in adopting final negotiating positions on some issues which are of a vital concern to the negotiating partners, and this led to expressions of dissatisfaction by them which have been reported in the Press.  The outstanding issues have included those of access for some agricultural products and the stabilisation of export earnings or some other means to safeguard the interests of those negotiating partners whose economies depend to a considerable extent on the export of primary products. The community's offer for the outstanding agricultural product was, however, finalised at the Council of Ministers meeting in Luxembourg the day before yesterday, 4th June, and the way is now open to discuss this offer with the negotiating partners. The effect of the community's proposals would be to accord the partner States a special regime, on a product by product basis, more favourable than the general regime applied to third countries with the necessary safeguards to protect community interests.  With regard to the stabilisation issue, this is, of course, a very complex and technical problem but it is one of great importance to some of the negotiating States and particularly to the poorer among them.  The commission is shortly to complete its proposals as to community <Col N="692" /> action in this field and I would hope that the council will subsequently be in a position to take an early decision on the proposals to be made in the negotiations which may resume at ministerial level before the end of next month.</P>

      <P>The Government are fully committed to the policy of affording all possible support to United Nations peace-keeping efforts and we would, therefore, be anxious to respond positively to any requests for troops that the United Nations might make to us in the future.</P>
      <P>At present, Irish officers and men are participating in the work of the United Nations Truce Supervision Organisation in the Middle East and of the United Nations Force in Cyprus. In addition, I am very glad to be able to inform the House that an Irish officer has now been appointed to the post of interim Chief-of-Staff of the newly-created United Nations Disengagement Observation Force, which will supervise the disengagement agreement between Israel and Syria signed in Geneva on Friday last, 31st May.</P>
      <P>With regard to the United Nations Emergency Force in the Middle East, the Government decided, following the bombings in Dublin and Monaghan last month, to ask for the temporary release of the Irish contingent there. The Secretary-General fully appreciates the circumstances under which these troops are required for service at home. We informed him that when the present need has passed, we would be happy to send an Irish contingent again to the Middle East.  Our commitment to the United Nations Emergency Force we regard as continuing, even though we are not for the present in a position to supply troops to that force.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should like to avail myself of this opportunity to tell the House that the Secretary-General publicly paid tribute <Col N="693" /> to the officers and men of the Irish contingent in the emergency force for the manner in which they discharged their difficult task in the Middle East. I need hardly add that this tribute is fully endorsed by the Government, as indeed, it is, I am sure, by every member of the House.</P>

      <P>Fossa is a village without a post office.  It is in a thickly populated area about three miles from Killarney.  It is roughly as described by the Deputy.  Within a one-mile radius of it there are 87 houses, 31 of which have rented telephones. Ten of these telephones are coin-box phones.  Seven of them are in guesthouses.  There is one in a youth hostel also.  Heavy use is made <Col N="695" /> of the coin-box telephone in the licensed premises.  As Deputies know, in rural areas kiosks are provided on the basis of replacing call office telephones in post offices which are used to a large extent.  That is the priority system.  I do not propose to alter it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs if he will give consideration to the social needs of rural areas when determining the priority list for the erection of public telephone kiosks in rural districts.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ConorCruiseOBrien" hpid="Dr. Cruise-O'Brien Dr. Cruise-O'Brien">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Cruise-O'Brien</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy's question implies that the social needs of rural areas are not taken into account at present.  This, of course, is not so but quite the reverse, in fact. In urban areas kiosks are provided only where they are likely to pay their way; in rural areas on the other hand they are being provided on an increasingly subsidised scale according as the facilities are being extended to areas which show lower and lower use of existing public telephones.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have already indicated&mdash;I would refer Deputies to the Official Report, Volume 269 No. 7, column 877&mdash;that the present system of determining priorities will continue to operate until a better system can be devised.  I invited suggestions for a more satisfactory system based on criteria which could be applied consistently and would not open the floodgates to demands <Col N="696" /> for kiosks in areas where they would be little used.  I would be glad to consider any suggestion on these lines from the Deputy or from any other Deputy.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister consider a remote rural district which is about 14 miles away from the nearest priest, doctor or veterinary surgeon and which is a remote valley into which there is no communication in bad weather an area of social need for the provision of a telephone service?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ConorCruiseOBrien" hpid="Dr. Cruise-O'Brien Dr. Cruise-O'Brien">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Cruise-O'Brien</NameTxt>
      <P>This is quite difficult.  The problem is that the need felt by individuals for this facility is highest in the areas where it would be least economic to provide it.  The social need is recognised by the extent of the growing subsidy which my Department are putting into this. Deputies will realise that there is an upper limit.  Each locality sees its own need without reference to the priorities which my Department under any Minister would have to have regard to and which my Department always have had regard to.</P>

To go back now to Deputy Haughey's question, I have now the relevant information. Call offices in which the receipts are £42 or over qualify for inclusion in the 1974 kiosk programme.  Kiosk takings depend on local circumstances. Since the annual cost of providing and maintaining a kiosk in provincial areas is calculated at £170, it is clear that the element of subsidy in that programme is quite heavy.</P>

      <P>I do not consider it necessary to take any action in this matter as I am satisfied that the quality of the postage stamps on sale is satisfactory.  I am advised that every sheet of postage stamps is examined for adhesive backing.  Although the adhesive used in recent years is superior to gum arabic previously used, the fact that it is transparent and without taste or smell may lead people at times to overmoisten the stamp and so remove the gum.  Used normally, the stamps readily adhere to parcels and envelopes.</P>

      <P>I have done that but the Deputy must appreciate that what we are dealing with now are the areas that are closed for subsidisation all over the country since rural electrification started over 30 years ago. These are small pockets and small areas, individual houses in many cases, which did not accept electricity when it was offered to them on two or three occasions.

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PeterBarry" hpid="Mr. P. Barry Mr. P. Barry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>It is a matter for the ESB under the statute by which they were established to make scales fixing the methods of charge and the rates of charge for electricity supplied by the Board.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The reasons for the difference in charges between urban and rural consumers <Col N="701" /> are the substantial extra costs of extending supply to rural consumers and the higher costs for maintenance, depreciation, interest, provision of renewals of assets and meter reading.  The Board have no proposals for the equation of the charges which could only be done by increased subsidisation of rural charges either by the urban consumer or the taxpayer.</P>

      <P>I do.  I quite appreciate the point the Deputy has been making.  It has been made on a number of occasions in this House during the last 12 months.  The Deputy is now talking about charges, which is different from the subsidisation of rural electrification.  My information from the ESB is that at the moment rural consumers are being subsidised by the urban consumers to the tune of £4 million a year.</P>

On 23rd May the Minister, in reply to a question, said there would be no further export of nitrogenous fertilisers by NET in this fertiliser year apart from a possible shipment of 150 to 200 tons to Northern Ireland.

      <P>The incidence of crime in Clonmel has not been disproportionately high, having regard to the population of the town, but I am aware that, in recent months, there has been an increase in the incidence of larcenies there.</P>
      <P>I understand that the local Garda superintendent had a meeting with representatives of Clonmel Chamber of Commerce on Tuesday last to discuss police arrangements in the town and that they are to be in contact on the matter again.  On the question of strength I should, I think, mention that there are of course, many demands on Garda resources at present and that, while the Garda authorities will certainly have the fullest regard to any special factors appertaining to Clonmel, the needs of other areas must also be borne in mind.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Davern</NameTxt>
      <P>In view of the very grave situation in south Tipperary since last Tuesday, is the Minister satisfied that the availability of manpower has been properly and sufficiently used, particularly in the Clonmel town area, a town with a population of 13,000 covering an average of eight or nine miles radius and where there are only two men on duty at night?  Is the Minister further aware of individual complaints where a shopkeeper's window was reported broken at 8 o'clock in the morning and he did not get the Garda Síochána to attend him, because they were on other duties until 4.30 in the afternoon? Is the Minister satisfied with these conditions?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cooney</NameTxt>
      <P>It is not correct to say there are only two gardaí available for night duty in Clonmel.  There are two gardaí on beat control in Clonmel while, in addition, there is a patrol car available with a crew of two also available during the night.  With regard to the specific matter mentioned by the Deputy, it has not come to my notice.  I regret that the shopkeeper in question had to wait so long for Garda attention but, of course, at that stage, the crime had been committed and the immediate presence of a garda was not going to make any substantial difference.  As I indicated in my reply, there are many demands on Garda time at the moment.  The Garda authorities have the fullest regard to the difficulties in Clonmel and so far as possible, within existing resources, will endeavour to meet them.  Clonmel, like any other part of the country, has suffered from the fact that men have had to be detached on temporary duty to the Border and this has meant a diminution in the number of men available.  I am not aware that the situation in Clonmel is any more serious or more difficult than in any other part of the country.</P>

How can they possibly be of use or at least be contacted by the central base at the station?  Furthermore, does the Minister agree that it is a very casual attitude to take to say that the presence of the Garda Síochána does not mean a lot to a shopkeeper who has just had his window broken in which there was £400 or £500 worth of stock?  I think this was reflected in the fact that there were not enough Garda Síochána on duty and that the people who kidnapped the Earl and <Col N="720" /> Countess of Donoughmore got through the cordon?</P>

      <P>&mdash;&mdash;the situation in Clonmel.  I think he is also being unfair when he says I am not serious about this matter.  I am, indeed, serious about it and I am concerned about the level of policing in any town in Ireland but there are only so many men available for any particular town.  The numbers of men have had to be reduced, unfortunately, because of the demand for extra presence of the Border.  Clonmel has had to suffer in the same way as any other town.  The deployment of the existing force is a matter for the professional judgment and expertise of the officers in each division and I would not attempt to tell them how best to do that.  Neither should the Deputy because all he can offer is essentially a layman's view in what is a professional area.  It is untrue and unfair to suggest that there was any lack of police concern in regard to the abduction&mdash;&mdash;</P>

While we all deplore and share the universal horror at the abduction of the Earl and Countess of Donoughmore and wish them to be speedily returned to their family unharmed it is not correct, and it is probably unhelpful, to suggest that the abduction was due to any failure on the part of the police in South Tipperary.</P>

I cannot say when an independent commission is likely to bring in a report on a particular matter but this commission has not been slow in the past in bringing in reports.  The delay has been in implementing the reports in the form of legislation.</P>

      <P>Prior to the car bombings in Dublin and Monaghan on 17th May, 1974, plans had been prepared in my Department for the provision of a skeleton service by way of Army lorries during the present transport strike in Dublin.  Because however of security commitments following the bombings the plans could not be implemented.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Tunney </NameTxt>
      <P>These lorries are garaged in certain barracks in the city and you would need these lorries in case of an emergency.  Surely the fact that they were on the streets would not interfere to any appreciable extent <Col N="725" /> with what might be in mind as regards a greater need?</P>

      <P>Would it be possible to allocate some of the Civil Defence vans for this job?  They have a number of very fine vans.  I see them being used for exercise purposes only.  Also, a number of big firms have staff members in the FCA and could there not be some liaison between these men and the Army so that the men could drive the lorries for the bigger firms, taking people off the road with them? I think if the Minister examined this he could work out some scheme with Civil Defence, the FCA and the Army.</P>

      <P>No.  What I am saying is that I must take the best advice I can get and the disposition of troops and lorries requires advice to be given to me.  The disposition of troops and lorries requires that advice be given to me. I demand from the Chiefs-of-Staff of the Army that in times of high security there must be the best possible security.  Consequent on that, it is not possible to afford the help asked for at this time.  As a responsible Minister I must take the advice I get and, on that basis, make my decision.</P>

The temporary staff on clerical assistant duties were women and those on clerical officer duties were men.  This determined the field of eligibility for the competitions.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Kenny Mr. Kenny">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kenny </NameTxt>
      <P>I am aware that there is concern in some quarters as to the changes in current handling methods at Dublin Port which may result from the use of transit depots removed from the points of importation for the customs clearance of certain container traffic.  Proposals to make changes in handling methods have emanated from commercial and industrial interests and not from the Revenue Commissioners.  The position of the Revenue Commissioners is that, having regard to the enabling provisions contained in section 16 of the Finance Act, 1967, they could not reasonably withhold approval of any such depots if they satisfy their requirements for effective and economic customs control.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The position might best be clarified by full discussion of the issues involved by the various interested parties.

The unions pointed out they had not been made aware of developments in this matter until 17th April, 1974, and that it was imperative that adequate time be made available to discuss the issue involved.  The Minister for Labour discussed the matter with the Ministers for Finance and Transport and Power and, following these discussions, a letter was sent to the unions on 31st May, 1974, by the Minister for Labour in which he stated it would not be possible to issue licences for a period of some months and that this would give the interested parties time to resolve any outstanding problems.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Tunney </NameTxt>
      <P>I was suggesting earlier to the Minister that it is necessary for him to indicate more clearly the essence of what has now come to be regarded as &ldquo;the Waterford speech&rdquo;.  I was hoping he would be patient with me while I repeated <Col N="733" /> something which I have already said in this House.  If there is one thing more than any other which must be catered for on radio and television, it is our sense of Irishness.  I was very happy to listen to the Parliamentary Secretary to the Taoiseach expressing his thoughts on this.  In the main they coincide with mine.  I would not be anxious to divorce myself from anything which I considered wise and profound coming from the other side of the House.</P>
      <P>I said earlier that I did not accept that television or radio has an absolutely powerful influence.  I did not deny that it has an influence.  It has an aggregate influence which must be regarded as an important factor in the ultimate.  In the matter of catering for and fostering things which are regarded as being Irish, its function must never be forgotten.  If the history not only of this country but of the world shows anything, it shows the folly of disregarding the past. There are certain aspects of the past attaching to every country which one would like to forget and which one should forget.  The normal and natural feeling of emotion which every Irishman and Irish woman has, idealistic towards that which is best for the people of Ireland, cannot and should never be disregarded.  More positively it should be catered for.  In catering for that which might be regarded as idealistic, you are also performing a very useful social, economic and cultural exercise.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If it appears to people that this provision is not being made, you create in the minds of some a feeling of despair or indifference, and you create in the minds of others a feeling of resistance and anger and a certain militancy which could be more than dangerous.  In so far as the Minister may have given wrong impressions, or wrong impressions may have been created about him, I should like him to assure me that he is in full sympathy with RTE's obligations to cater for this feeling which we all have. I am not suggesting that we should cater for the fanatic or the impossible character.  I am not suggesting that we should cater for the person who, in <Col N="734" /> harbouring certain thoughts, would constitute a bother and a danger to his neighbour.</P>
    <P>We are obliged to cater for the moderate Irish person who has this feeling within him, whether it manifests itself on the day when Ireland is involved in an international soccer match, or on the day when Ronnie Delaney is representing Ireland at the Olympic Games, or in the pride we feel when somebody who can claim Irish descent is elevated to the highest position in America.  There is in the heart and in the mind of every Irish person a desire and a craving that Ireland should be free, with its own identity, and with an attitude towards life as good as and, if possible, superior to the attitude to life in any other country.  Arising from that there would be a family feeling and we would have regard for each other as members of a family.</P>
    <P>It is sad that anybody should have to stand up here and state that position.  From my knowledge there is no example to be found in history of a nation who were prepared&mdash; unless they had to yield to greater force&mdash;to part with that which they regarded, and which must properly be regarded, as peculiar to themselves. Because of this I suggest to the Minister that it is an area which cannot be approached in any cold, clinical fashion.  I freely admit that it is an emotional area and emotional areas and feelings generally do not lend themselves to any cold, clinical analysis. I am stating the position as I see it.  I am not claiming that what I see is always, or in this case the absolutely correct view.  It would be very presumptuous of me to do that but I suggest that what I am stating is as near to being correct as anything else I have stated from those who hold opposing views to mine.</P>
    <P>I have stated on radio programmes, and in this House, before Deputy Cruise-O'Brien became a Minister, that in the matter of things Irish he was one of the few Deputies who spoke the Irish language.  I heard his views expressed before he became a Minister and I never had any reason to doubt that his feelings would <Col N="735" /> largely coincide with mine.  Therefore, it is with reluctance that I express my anxiety and ask the Minister to make clear his position.</P>
    <P>In treating this matter solely from the practicalities of it, it should be mentioned that in respect of section 31 people are not too happy with the situation where we get a man who is regarded by most people as being a good sound and intelligent Irishman, Seán Ó Riordáin, not being allowed take part in a television programme.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ConorCruiseOBrien" hpid="Dr. Cruise-O'Brien Dr. Cruise-O'Brien">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Cruise-O'Brien</NameTxt>
      <P>That was not the point.  The point was that he made a statement in support of the Provisional IRA which statement was deleted from the interview as broadcast and not that there was any objection to him as a person but to this particular sentiment.</P>

      <P>The Minister is making what I regard as a subtle distinction. When I say that he was denied full expression on an RTE programme&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ConorCruiseOBrien" hpid="Dr. Cruise-O'Brien Dr. Cruise-O'Brien">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Cruise-O'Brien</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesCTunney" hpid="Mr. Tunney Mr. Tunney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tunney</NameTxt>
      <P>He was denied full expression on an RTE programme because, it is alleged, he was commenting in a favourable fashion on an organisation which could be accused of intimidation and violence. On the other hand, it is well known to everybody, and this is the problem as I see it, that representatives of the intimidating violent loyalists can be brought down here at expense and given every opportunity to present themselves in a full and free fashion to the viewers.  Where is the balance? Where is the impartiality there?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the matter of intimidation and violence I would not differentiate between the provisionals and the loyalists.  I hope the Minister will indicate why he accepts that on one hand RTE should arrange for and thank representatives of one intimidating violent group for having taken part in a programme while on the other hand they excluded a gentleman, a scholar and an Irishman of the calibre of Seán Ó Riordáin.  In so far as this <Col N="736" /> specific case may create the circumstances of building up in the minds and in the hearts of a certain section of people an eagerness for violence, annoyance and frustration as expressed in a manner which is not correct and does not appeal to us, I am trying to present to the Minister the need there is for at least maintaining an appearance of impartiality.</P>
    <P>The Minister is a fair man and he has sat through the debate on his Estimate in a patient fashion but I hope he will allow himself to accept some of the ideas from this side of the House.  I venture to suggest that he will accept that by appearing to act in an unjust fashion &mdash; here I refer specifically to the area of Ireland largely catered for by RTE &mdash; and that if a case can be made that this is taking place one automatically builds up in the minds of the people what they would regard as cause and reason for them to give expression to their frustration in an undesirable fashion.</P>
    <P>In a more everyday comment I want to record my own personal annoyance and displeasure when I hear competent television and radio commentators talking about Ireland, about people in Ireland, or about counties assuming what I would regard as an old west Britonish attempt at an Irish brogue.  As far as I am concerned that attitude has gone and there is an obligation on them as Irish commentators and as Irishmen to act in the same fashion towards Ireland as the manner in which their counterparts in England act towards England, but they must be careful that in so doing they do not regard Ireland as a part of England and that they do not imitate their English counterparts in the attitude they might have towards Irish bogmen.</P>
    <P>Ar nóta a bhaineas le díomá, caithfidh mé a rá go bhfuil brón orm nach raibh an tAire in ann níos mó airgead a chur ar fáil do Radio na Gaeltachta.  Tá a fhios agam go bhfuil suim aige atá ioncurtha leis an suim atá agamsa i Radio na Gaeltachta. Tuigfidh sé mar sin an díomá atá ormsa nach bhfuil ar a laghad an t-árdu céanna sin i gcúrsaí airgid a <Col N="737" /> líonfadh an bhearna atá ann maidir le h-úsáidh airgid le bliain anuas, comh fada is a bhaineann sé le muintir na Gaeltachta.  Bhí mé féin thiar.  Bhí mé ó dheas.  Bhí mé ó thuaidh agus ag caint le daoine thuig mé, sé sin i rith na bliana, gur cheapadar go bhféadfaidís i bhfad níos mó oibre a dhéanamh ach níos mó airgead a bheith acu.  Gan trácht air sin ar chor ar bith, tá ceist na síceolaíochta ann.  Seans go gceapfaidh siad anois, de bhrí nach bhfuil aon ardú airgid ann, nach bhfuil an oiread sin suime againn iontu agus ba cheart.  Más féidir le Radio na Gaeltachta a thaispeáint go bhfuil pleananna acu nó go bhfuil ar intinn acu cláracha speisialta a chur ar fáil nach féidir leo a dhéanamh anois cheal airgid an mbeadh an tAire sásta a rá leo go gcuirfeadh sé féin an t-airgead sin ar fáil?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Gallagher </NameTxt>
      <P>Ar dtús, ba mhaith liom traoslú leis an Aire maidir leis an gcaoi ar chuir sé na Meastacháin os comhair na Dála.  Tá sé soiléir dúinn uilig an chaoi ina bhfuil an caiteachas sin déanta agus tá sé i bhfad níos fusa a thuiscint cén chaoi go bhfuil obair na Roinne atá faoi na chúram ar siúl.  Ach, faraoir, caithfidh mé stopadh ansin nuair a théann sé go dtí moladh mar nuair a léigh mé óráid an Aire feicim go bhfuil mé ag rá na rudaí adúirt mé anuraidh mórán, go bhfuil na deacrachtaí céanna ann, go bhfuil na rudaí céanna a luadh anseo anuraidh, go bhfuil siad mar a bhí siad cheana agus gur beag dul chun cinn atá déanta sa Roinn seo.  Dúradh go mbeadh pleananna ag an Aire le cuid mhaith rudaí a dhéanamh ach is oth liom a rá nach mar sin atá an scéal.  Is beag buntáiste a fheicim ón chaiteachas seo sa Roinn Poist agus Telegrafa.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Luaigh an Teachta Tunney Radio na Gaeltachta.  Tá díomá orm faoin gcaoi go bhfuil faillí déanta arís maidir le caiteachas i dtaobh Radio na Gaeltachta.  Caitfidh mé, mar a rinne mé anuraidh, tagairt ar leith a dhéanamh do Chontae Mhaigheo.  Níl aon tseirbhís le fáil ansin againn ó Radio na Gaeltachta.  Cé gur muid an tríú Gaeltacht is mó sa tír is féidir liom a rá nach bhfuil mórán teangmháil <Col N="738" /> againn ná mórán cuidiú dá thabhairt dúinn ó Radio na Gaeltachta.</P>
    <P>Tá a fhios agam go bhfuil deacrachtaí ag an bhfoireann atá ag obair ansin ceal airgid.  Níl an gléas ceart oibre acu agus déarfainn dá mbeadh an tseirbhís chéanna ar siúl acu agus atá anseo i mBaile Átha Cliath agus deis acu mar atá acu anseo i mBaile Átha Cliath go bhféadfadh siad i bhfad níos mó a dhéanamh.  I láthair na h-uaire níl aon phost faoi leith ag cuid de na daoine atá ag obair ansin.  Caithfidh siad dul amach agus eolas a bhailiú, ábhar chlár a bhailiú agus ansin caithfidh siad teacht isteach go dtí an stáisiún féin agus an clár sin a chur os comhair an phobail.  Níl aon deis acu mar atá anseo i mBaile Átha Cliath.  Níl aon chaoi ceart acu le na gcuid cláracha a réiteach agus lena gcur os comhair an phobail.  Dá bhrí sin, go leor den ábhar a cuirtear amach ag Radio na Gaeltachta baineann sé leis an rud céanna i gcónaí.  Níl aon leagan amach ar smaointe ná ar obair ná ar an ábhar atá á chur os comhair an phobail agus ní aon locht é sin ar na daoine atá ag plé leis an Radio ansin.  Faoi mar adúirt mé níl an t-airgead acu agus níl an deis oibre acu.  Is mór an trua nach bhfuil níos mó deis ag na daoine éisteacht leis na cláracha breátha a chuireann Radio na Gaeltachta ar fáil.</P>
    <P>Sílim ó thaobh na mbunscoileanna go mba bhreá an rud é dá mbeadh clár ann a mbeadh deis ag na páistí scoile éisteacht leis i rith am scoile.  Ar an gcaoi chéanna ins na meánscoileanna, agus ins na gairmscoileanna ba bhreá an rud é dá bhféadfaí ceol, amhráin, an saibhreas cainte agus Gaeilge atá ag muintir na Gaeltachta a chloisint i rith am scoile.  Sílim go mba cheart don Aire féachaint chuige go mbeadh níos mó airgead le fáil aige ón Aire Airgeadais más féidir, fiú amháin go gcuirfí airgead ar fáil tré mheastacháin Aire na Gaeltachta leis na seirbhísí seo a leathnú agus a chur ar fáil do chuile dhuine.</P>
    <P>Anois gheall an tAire go bhféachfadh sé chuige go ndéanfaí rud éigin i gContae Mhaigheo.  Ón tuarascáil <Col N="739" /> seo is cosúil nach bhfuil sé ar intinn tada a gheallúint i mbliana ach ní bheidh mé sásta agus coinneodh mé leis an Aire nó go bhfaighe mé freagra a bhéas sásúil maidir leis na Gaeltachtaí i gContae Mhaigheo.  Cé go bhfuil muid ó thaobh daonradh dó ar an tríú Gaeltacht is mó sa tír tá an deacracht seo ann go bhfuil muid scaipthe.  Tá Tuar Mhic Éadaigh i bpóca leis féin, tá Acaill&mdash;an méid atá fágtha dó mar Ghaeltacht, tá Ceathrú Thaidhg agus áiteacha eile ar chósta thuaidh Mhuigheo, agus an chuid den Ghaeltacht atá ar an taobh thiar de leithinis Bhéal a' Mhuirthid tá siad scaipthe óna chéile agus ar an gcaoi sin deineann sé an scéal níos measa mar go bhfuil siad istigh i lár áiteacha a bhfuil an Béarla ag fáil an bhua orthu.  Níl siad cosúil le Gaeltachtaí Chonamara ná Gaeltachtaí Thír Chonaill atá dlúth agus atá lonnaithe in aon áit amháin.</P>
    <P>Dá bhrí sin, sílim nuair a bhí an rud seo faoi Radio na Gaeltachta faoi scrudú an chéad uair nár tugadh aitheantas go leor do na deacrachtaí i gContae Mhaigheo.  Tá mé ag iarraidh ar an Aire arís go ndéanfaidh sé scrúdú faoi leith ar an scéal agus go mbeidh freagra níos fearr le fáil agam ná fuair mé go dtí seo.</P>
    <P>Ó thárla ag caint mé faoi Ghaeilge agus Gaeltachtaí, sílim go bhfuil rud amháin fúinn.  Ní thugann muid go leor aitheantas do cheist seo na Gaeilge.  Tá tuiscint i bhfad níos fearr ar Ghaeilge sa tír ná mar is eol do dhaoine.  Sílim gur beag rud gur féidir le duine a rá ar an Radio ná i n-áit ar bith eile nach mbeidh tuiscint air agus ar an ábhar sin sílim go gcuideodh sé go mór le ceist na Gaeilge dá mbeadh daoine in ann níos mó den Ghaeilge a labhrann muintir na Gaeltachta a chloisteáil ar an Radio.  Tá gá dá bhrí sin leis an gcuidiú seo.  Tá gá leis an scéal a athbhreithniú agus lena leathnú amach le hais mar atá sé.</P>
    <P>Níor mhaith liom go dtuigfeadh daoine ná go sílfeadh daoine go raibh mé ag caitheamh drochmheas ar na daoine atá ag obair ar son Radio na Gaeltachta.  Go deimhin, a mhalairt atá ann.  Sé an rud atá ar siúl agam go bhfuil mé ag iarraidh a thaispeáint na deacrachtaí atá acu agus an obair <Col N="740" /> dheacair atá acu san obair atá ar siúl acu.  Tá rud eile ann.  Tá go leor taistil le déanamh acu agus cuireann sé seo isteach go mór ar gach gné den chaoi atá acu le cláracha a réiteach agus a chur os comhair an phobail.</P>
    <P>Maidir le radio i gcoitinne sílim go bhfuil an-obair á déanamh ag an radio féin.  Tá na cláracha atá acu ar an radio suimiúil.  Tá go leor leor gné de shaol na ndaoine á chur os comhair an phobail.  Tá gach cineál obair agus gnoithe atáar siúl sa tír, tá sé ag fáil aitheantas ar an radio.  Is mór an moladh atá ag dul na daoine atá i mbun cláracha ar an radio.  Go deimhin, tá a fhios agam féin go bhfuil daoine ag cailliúint go leor leor cláracha breátha radio i ngeall ar an dteilifís mar tá faisean ag daoine nuair a osclaíonn an teilifís tráthnóna é a chasadh ar siúl agus bíonn sé ar siúl i gcaitheamh na hoíche.  I ngeall ar sin cailleann siad cuid mhaith cláracha breátha a bhíonn ar siúl ar an radio.</P>
    <P>People who do not listen to radio programmes are missing a great deal. I find radio programmes have great value from an entertainment point of view, the standard is very high.  There is more versatility on radio than on television.  Too often we are inclined to switch on television when the programmes commence in the afternoon or evening and that is a shame.  In this way many good radio programmes are missed.</P>
    <P>The people responsible for this service are doing an excellent job in providing entertainment and programmes of a high educational value.  I cannot say the same for television.  Our television service at the moment could be regarded as another branch of the BBC.  We do not appear to have very much originality.  Our home-produced programmes are often of a very high quality.  In the main our television service is not providing the service we expect.</P>
    <P>Sports programmes as a rule are entertaining.  The programme produced on Sunday night was, at one time, a sports programme where one got a fairly good balance as regards the various games being played.  The GAA and other sports got a fair share <Col N="741" /> of the time.  For some reason some bright genius decided to introduce a programme which to me appears to be an attempted comedy act rather than a sports programme.  I used to enjoy this particular sports programme, but since the introduction of this new programme, it has deteriorated considerably and can now hardly be classed as a sports programme.  As a national service we are entitled to see programmes which relate to the Irish way of life.</P>
    <P>One very seldom sees a good play in English or Irish.  The amount of Irish music and songs which we get is fairly limited.  We could hardly be satisfied with the amount of time devoted to the Irish language.  It is necessary for the authority to consider these things seriously and not to make us just another branch of the BBC.</P>
    <P>With regard to telephone services and the post office, I find myself making the same references and complaints today that I made here last year when this Estimate was presented to the House.  A sum of £7.5 million has been provided for the telephone services.  Quite honestly I cannot see any marked improvement in the area which I represent.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ConorCruiseOBrien" hpid="Dr. Cruise-O'Brien Dr. Cruise-O'Brien">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Cruise-O'Brien</NameTxt>
      <P>It takes between two to three years for such investment to have an effect which is felt by the consumers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DenisGallagher" hpid="Mr. Gallagher Mr. Gallagher">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gallagher</NameTxt>
      <P>I accept that.  The importance of proper communications for industry and tourism and life in general in remote areas must be taken into account.  Letters from the Department which I receive in reply to questions contain stock answers with regard to the provision of public telephones and the extension of services for people in rural areas.  Last year the Minister when replying on his Estimate asked for some criteria from Deputies with regard to the provision of public telephones.  At that time suggestions were made.  I myself decided that where there is a national school serving an area of 70 or 80 houses this could be taken as a unit where a public telephone or kiosk could be erected.  Going on that basis I have <Col N="742" /> written to the Department and on various occasions put down parliamentary questions asking to have telephones provided in such areas. Again I find that the stock reply is that the Department's policy is to provide a telephone kiosk only where there is a post office.  There is not much benefit to the public in having a telephone kiosk erected just outside a post office.  In many instances the post offices in rural areas have been there for hundreds of years.  No extra service is being provided by having the telephone service outside except that some assistance is being given to the sub-post mistress.  She is being given an opportunity of finishing at 5.30 p.m. instead of continuing until 10.30 p.m. to facilitate the people coming to make telephone calls. There should be some new thinking on this.</P>
      <P>Rural areas are very much hampered because of the lack of these services.  They are necessary and should be provided without delay.  If I, as a public representative, have to go before the public and give them the Department's excuse with regard to the matter I am afraid they will think very little of it.  The telephone is a necessary part of life in a rural community.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Today I had two parliamentary questions to the Minister relating to this matter.  The Minister explained why it is not possible to provide telephones in the two areas I mentioned. It is because a special cable would have to be put down.  I accept this. The two areas I mentioned are Gaeltacht areas.  Gaeltarra Éireann are doing a tremendous job trying to have industry brought to the Gaeltacht. They are working hard on this.  They have a programme to have all the people of the Gaeltacht working in the early eighties.  The telephone is one of the things that industrialists ask about.  An industrialist will ask about communications and facilities. If a man is a farmer who wants to rear his family in a particular area where he sets up he needs such services. Apart altogether from the fact that it is important for industry it is also important from the social side. <Col N="743" /> One of the things that counts a good deal with people making inquiries about setting up any particular industry is the availability of telephones. It is also very important for tourism.  We find that the Americans are constantly complaining about our telephone service.</P>

      <P>I am informed by the ESB that terms for supply under the final phase of the rural electrification <Col N="732" /> scheme have recently been quoted to applicants in Meathill rural area.  The terms quoted to each applicant are based on the cost of extending supply to the applicants' premises and include a special service as well as the normal fixed charge.</P>
      <P>The capital payments referred to by the Deputy apply in cases where the applicants were given the option of buying out their special service charges but they are under no obligation to avail of this offer.</P>
      <P>In one case the applicant was quoted a capital contribution of £459.02.  This payment is required to buy out part of the special service charge as the cost of extending supply to his premises is very high, in the region of £1,200.</P>
