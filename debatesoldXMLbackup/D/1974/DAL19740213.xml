      <NameTxt>Minister for the Public Service (Mr. R. Ryan)</NameTxt>
      <P>An actuarial survey of the contributory widows' and children's pensions scheme for the Civil Service was completed last November.  This survey showed that the capital cost to the scheme of doubling the existing rates of pension for pre-1968 widows and the potential widows of pre-1968 pensioners was £7,353,000 which, in terms of an annual contribution, would involve an additional 1¼ per cent per annum of salaries.  The survey showed that the existing contribution rates were barely sufficient to support the scheme's liabilities and could not, therefore, meet this additional cost.  The staff associations were asked for their comments on the question of existing members of the contributory scheme making higher contributions towards the cost of increasing ex-gratia pensions. The replies received did not indicate agreement to pay increased contributions and I am considering the matter further in the light of these replies.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>No, because the replies from the staff associations concerned have only recently been received.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister now communicate that information to the widows in question and obtain their views as well as those of the Civil Service associations?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I will, of course.  In case there is any doubt about it I should like to explain that the widows concerned have been informed of the result of the actuarial survey.  They were also informed that the matter was <Col N="569" /> being taken up with the associations. They have not been informed of the attitude of the associations but they will now be so informed.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to ask the Minister&mdash;I do not expect him to commit himself one way or another at this stage&mdash;to indicate to the House whether he would view the claims being made sympathetically in the light of the information now at his disposal?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for the Public Service if, as indicated in a recent ministerial statement, there are difficulties in filling vacancies in the Civil Service for qualified accountants; if so, why; and if similar difficulties are being experienced with regard to other professional grades.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>When addressing a professional body recently I referred to difficulties of recruiting accountants in sufficient numbers for the Civil Service.  These difficulties are also being experienced in filling some other professional grades and arise mainly because expansion in both public and private sectors has caused demand for suitably qualified people to exceed the supply.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoelTLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>All sectors of our economy both public and private are having difficulties in recruiting professional people having regard to the increased demands which exist for their services and, no doubt, the points mentioned by the Deputy, and others, are relevant to this.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoelTLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>Is it a fact that people recruited by the State services who prove to be very good are bought away by private enterprise offering them a bigger salary scale?</P>

      <P>That is one of the matters about which I am very concerned as Minister for the Public Service.  I am anxious to see mobility generated not merely from the public to the private sector but from the private to the public.  I hope it will be possible to generate this move.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MarkAClinton" hpid="Mr. Clinton Mr. Clinton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Clinton</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Clinton</NameTxt>
      <P>With your permission a Cheann Chomhairle, I propose to take Questions Nos. 6 and 7 together.</P>
      <P>The Government fully recognise the importance of agricultural research, particularly in the current period of development and intensification in the industry, and intend to give it all necessary encouragement and support.  As Deputies are, no doubt, aware, State expenditure in relation to agricultural research has increased rapidly in the past decade and accounts for a high proportion of total State expenditure in the research area.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardCollins" hpid="Mr. G. Collins Mr. G. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Collins</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MarkAClinton" hpid="Mr. Clinton Mr. Clinton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Clinton</NameTxt>
      <P>The level of agricultural research being carried out in this country is the envy of most European countries.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Collins</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="MarkAClinton" hpid="Mr. Clinton Mr. Clinton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Clinton</NameTxt>
      <P>Of course, I would like to see even more research being carried out but the people who are deriving the benefit of this work should now begin to contribute towards it.  I have asked the various sections to make contributions for this purpose and they have indicated that they are prepared to do so.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardCollins" hpid="Mr. G. Collins Mr. G. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>I understand that the Minister has requested that a principal of a £ for a £ be put up by commercial interests.  If this is so, perhaps the Minister would tell us how he hopes this will work.  Does he envisage, say, a levy on livestock or will the exporters of livestock&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>All available evidence indicates that the level of pesticidal or agro-chemical residues found in agricultural produce in this country is far below the tolerances accepted internationally for medical and commercial purposes.  This position is likely to be maintained having regard to the rate of usage of such materials in this country.</P>
      <P>In regard to the substitution of less dangerous alternatives for potentially dangerous chemicals, I understand that this is already the practice in the trade. In view of these considerations I do not propose to introduce specific controls on such chemicals.</P>
      <P>My Department are, however, actively participating in the work of various committees of FAO and EEC which are at present considering the questions of standards and controls for agricultural chemicals.</P>

      <P>It is difficult to forecast the movement of cereal prices especially in the present conditions of tight world supplies where political events can strongly influence prices. Increased sowings of cereals are, however, expected this year and if yields are up to average prices should ease in the second half of the year.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Clinton</NameTxt>
      <P>I was not aware that the variations were as much as that although I was aware there were some variations.

      <P>Does the Minister realise that because of the poor price for store cattle farmers may be inclined to go in for grain growing which has been discontinued for a number of years?

      <NameTxt>Mr. Clinton</NameTxt>
      <P>The local instructors and the farmers are the best judges of what they can grow economically. There are areas where farmers must decide against growing grain because the soil and the terrain would not enable them economically to produce the grain.

      <P>The Deputy made this kind of remark previously about our failure to get people to grow more grain in 1973.  He knows the grain was in the ground before we took office. There is nothing I can do to force farmers to grow a particular crop.  I will certainly do everything possible to encourage and advise them to grow more grain but I cannot compel them to do so.</P>

      <P>The Deputy is aware that this has been thrown around since 1972 or before that.  Nobody is satisfied with the present position.  I have great sympathy with the people who lost sheep, and particularly with the people who lost sheep in large numbers.  The ISPCA issued a report on this and they made certain suggestions, but the feeling of the Department of Justice is that this would be more appropriately taken care of by the local authorities.  Perhaps the Deputy as a member of a local authority could pursue this a bit further there.</P>

      <P>With the permission of <Col N="584" /> the Ceann Comhairle, I propose to take Questions Nos. 18, 19 and 20 together.</P>
      <P>The commission's proposals on agricultural prices for 1974-75 and certain associated proposals on some of the common agricultural policy arrangements were presented to the Council of Ministers at its meeting on 21st and 22nd January and were the subject of a preliminary exchange of views by Ministers. The council agreed to discuss the proposals more fully on 11th and 12th February and again at a special meeting commencing on 18th February, when it is hoped that a final decision will be made.  A copy of the commission's proposals is in the Dáil Library.</P>
      <P>I do not consider that it would be in the country's best interest to disclose my negotiating position on the various matters covered by the proposals in advance of full discussion of them in the council.  As regards the proposal to apply levies on milk and butter production, I have already made it quite clear at meetings of the council that I am completely opposed to such levies not only in principle but because, in my opinion, their introduction is not warranted by the present or prospective state of the market for dairy products.</P>

      <P>Can the Minister tell us what percentage increase he would hope to get for cattle prices? Could we have indication from him as to whether we might have a 10 per cent increase, or maybe better, because at this stage, as the Minister probably realises, those involved in the cattle trade would need something to boost their morale if not their pockets?</P>

    <Speaker pid="MarkAClinton" hpid="Mr. Clinton Mr. Clinton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Clinton</NameTxt>
      <P>The people involved in the cattle trade are very shrewd and they are able to keep their eye on indicators themselves.  It would be <Col N="585" /> wrong for me to indicate a figure at this stage.  It would be no help to the country.  I do not think the time has arrived for me, as the person negotiating on behalf of Ireland, to say exactly what I would be prepared to take.  It depends on what is in the package generally.</P>

      <P>As the revaluation of the mark in October, 1969, had the effect of reducing in terms of marks the value to German farmers of the EEC common prices, Germany was authorised by the community to give certain temporary compensatory aids to its farmers.  The scope of these aids has now been reduced to a concession on VAT, and the commission is to report to the council on this before the end of 1974.</P>

      <P>This is a proposal of the European Commission that levies be imposed on milk producers and on milk processing undertakings when the quantities of butter sold to community intervention agencies during a particular reference period would exceed 300,000 metric tons.</P>
      <P>The proposal is included in the commission's general price proposals for the coming year which are still under consideration by the Council of Ministers but I have expressed strong opposition to it and so have a number of my council colleagues.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Clinton</NameTxt>
      <P>At a Council of Minister's meeting last December, continuance of the EEC Social Butter Scheme in 1974 was approved by Ireland and all the other member countries.  The rate of FEOGA subsidy fixed by the EEC Commission is slightly lower than in 1973.</P>

      <P>Would the Minister ease the minds of people to whom, when we were &ldquo;selling&rdquo; the EEC, we said there would be a tariff wall around us but who now see cattle being imported from non-EEC countries?  I know the Minister is fighting this very hard but I know also that people down the country&mdash;and the Minister is aware of this&mdash;are very worried when they find we are now in the EEC and at the same time cattle can come in from outside and we are getting very poor prices here.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MarkAClinton" hpid="Mr. Clinton Mr. Clinton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Clinton</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes.  That was always so and there were certain restrictive measures which have not proved to be fully effective.  There is a safeguard clause provided it was used but we could not get agreement on the use of it because most EEC countries were opposed to using this clause which represents a total embargo on imports from third countries for a period.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries whether any special arrangements have been made for imports into the EEC of beef from Brazil, Uruguay and Argentina; and, if so, if he will specify such arrangements.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MarkAClinton" hpid="Mr. Clinton Mr. Clinton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Clinton</NameTxt>
      <P>Special arrangements for imports of beef into the Community from Argentina and Uruguay are contained in trade agreements which the Community has concluded with these countries.</P>
      <P>The main provision of these agreements in regard to beef is an undertaking by the Community to endeavour, in the application of the common market organisation, to suspend or reduce levies on imports of certain categories of frozen beef, including frozen beef for processing.  If such action were to disturb or risk disturbing the Community beef market, the Community may invoke a safeguard clause until the market situation has settled itself.  The agreements also contain technical provisions relating to such matters as the advance fixing of levy to take account of the long sea journey involved and the fixing of the community's annual tariff quota under the GATT for imports of frozen beef.</P>
      <P>Similar provisions are contained in an agreement between the Community and Brazil which is expected to come into operation in the near future.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MarkAClinton" hpid="Mr. Clinton Mr. Clinton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Clinton</NameTxt>
      <P>Practically no effect on our beef exports because they apply only to calves or very young cattle and it is mainly a traditional trade to Italy for feed lot production of beef.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Crinion</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister not aware that there was always the danger when Argentina was exporting to Britain that a shipload would depress the price?  I would imagine the same thing holds for EEC countries and that it would have the same effect on the Irish cattle trade.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MarkAClinton" hpid="Mr. Clinton Mr. Clinton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Clinton</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>I understand from the Minister that it is calves that are involved but surely he will not deny that these calves will be reared and fattened and will supply a market for which we will be competing with our beef and as a result would really be competing with our exports?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MarkAClinton" hpid="Mr. Clinton Mr. Clinton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Clinton</NameTxt>
      <P>That is true, but I think the Deputy will agree that long before we joined the EEC the Italians had special concessions in this regard because there are very poor areas in Italy and this is one of the ways in which they were specially assisted.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardCollins" hpid="Mr. G. Collins Mr. G. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>I can readily understand about the poor areas in Italy and those who live there have my sympathy.  I am sure the Minister will understand the concern which exists for the relatively poor areas in our part of the country and that the legality of the trade agreement of July, 1973, the trade agreement with Yugoslavia has been raised.  It is the subject matter of another question, No, 51 which is on the Order Paper and which we might reach today.</P>

      <P>I propose, a Cheann Comhairle, with your permission to take Questions Nos. 29 and 30 together.  There has been no undue delay in the payment of grants under this scheme.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Clinton</NameTxt>
      <P>Of course this is not correct at all.  In County Sligo there were 2,300 herd owners participating and before 31st December, £277,301 was paid or 1,947 of the applicants. Last spring, because of representation made by several Deputies in this House, I extended the time for applying. I gave an additional six weeks to apply and an enormous extra number came in in that time.  We cannot have it at both ends because you must have two inspections.

      <P>With your permission, a Cheann Comhairle, I propose to take Questions Nos. 31 to 36 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am not, of course, happy about the present weakened position in the cattle <Col N="602" /> and beef market.  Slow consumer demand for beef on our export markets, coinciding with substantially increased seasonal supplies brought about weak conditions in the Community beef market during recent months.</P>
    <P>I joined with the French and Italian Ministers in having a special meeting of the EEC Council of Ministers called on 14th January to discuss the situation. Among the measures adopted as a result of that meeting were the extension of export restitutions to certain categories of fresh, chilled or frozen beef, including those which Ireland exports to third countries.  A special refund on Irish exports of beef to the United States was granted to cancel out the monetary compensatory export charge on these exports.  Other measures adopted as a result of the special ministerial discussions on beef were a widening of the scope of permanent intervention buying and the introduction of arrangements for Community aid to the private commercial beef storage.</P>
    <P>It is hoped that these measures will have the effect of strengthening beef prices in the Community generally. This upward trend is now becoming noticeable.  I have every confidence in the future outlook for the cattle and beef trade but I recognise that producers have short-term problems, especially as regards feed, in continuing to hold cattle for which exceptionally high prices were paid in the early part of 1973.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Minister for Local Government (Mr. Tully) James Tully">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Local Government (Mr. Tully)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>The purpose of the Bill is to increase from £5 million to £15 million the limit on advances and borrowing guarantees which the National Building Agency may have obtained at any time for industrial housing purposes.</P>
      <P>The National Building Agency was set up in 1960 as a company under the Companies Acts with the primary object of facilitating industrial expansion by the provision of houses and ancillary services where this need could not be met appropriately by local authorities or was not being catered for by private enterprise.  It was placed on a statutory basis by the National Building Agency Limited Act, 1963.  The scope of the agency's activities was extended two years later to cover any housing or related operations which the Minister for Local Government might assign to it from time to time.</P>
      <P>The work of the agency now falls into three broad categories &mdash; the provision of housing and ancillary services related to industrial expansion, the provision of houses for State employees whose duties involve them in occasional transfers of residence and housing operations undertaken on behalf of local authorities.  This Bill is concerned with the first of these categories only.</P>
      <P>The agency's operations in the provision of housing and ancillary services related to industrial expansion are financed by repayable advances made by the Minister for Finance under section 6 of the 1963 Act.  Provision is also made in section 7 of the 1963 Act for the Minister for Local Government to guarantee moneys borrowed for this purpose by the agency.  Under section 9 of the 1963 Act, as amended by the National Building Agency Limited (Amendment) Act, 1969, the aggregate at any time of advances and guaranteed borrowings obtained by the agency and still unrepaid may not exceed £5 million.  No guarantee has yet been given under section 7 of the 1963 Act but over £4.5 million has been advanced to the agency under section 6.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The accounts of the agency are laid before each House of the Oireachtas. The agency's industrial housing service is comprehensive and extends to the acquisition of land, the design and planning of the scheme and the financing and construction of the houses. Within broad policy outlines determined by the Minister for Local Government, industrial housing is provided by the agency in consultation with the various Departments concerned, the Industrial Development Authority and the local authority. Normally the dwellings are provided at the request of individual industries and are financed by way of mortgage loans granted by the agency either to the firms or to nominated individual employees and by the usual State and <Col N="615" /> local grants.  A small proportion of houses are provided for letting.</P>
    <P>The agency, to the order of the Industrial Development Authority, also provide industrial housing on a more general basis related to the anticipated growth of industry as a whole in an area rather than for specific industries. Houses built by them, in association with the local authorities for letting to key workers in new or expanding industry qualify for a subsidy of two-thirds of loan charges.</P>
    <P>The agency built a total of 1,398 houses for industrial workers up to 31st December, 1973, and at that date, work was in progress on a further 456 houses, with schemes comprising 1,015 industrial houses at the planning stage. Information available to the agency from the Industrial Development Authority indicates that the rate of industrial expansion will require a substantial increase in the numbers of industrial houses required in the next five years.</P>
    <P>Experience has shown that an adequate and planned programme of housing for key industrial workers is vital to the success of any programme of industrial expansion.  In this connection, my Department, the Industrial Development Authority and the agency have maintained close liaison in the matter of assessing industrial housing needs.  More than 30 towns throughout the country have been identified in which industrial housing needs, aggregating over 1,350 houses may arise in the next five years.  Major industrial developments are anticipated in a few other centres which could require over 500 houses between them.  The estimated cost of providing a programme of this order would be approximately £10 million.  As I have said, the agency's present statutory limit of indebtedness has been reached and it is now necessary to increase it by £10 million to enable the agency's industrial housing programme to proceed. I commend the Bill to the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Mr. Molloy Mr. Molloy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>At the outset I should like to assure the Minister that Fianna Fáil welcome this Bill and will give it their full support.  The Bill is, in <Col N="616" /> one way, a verification of the necessity for a State agency to assist in the industrial drive and, generally, in the housing drive.  This agency has proved, especially in recent years, a very valuable one in assisting local authorities in the construction of dwellings.</P>
      <P>As the Minister has stated, the purpose of the Bill is to increase from £5 million to £15 million the limit on advances and borrowing guarantees which the agency may have obtained at any time for industrial housing purposes.  This we welcome and we will not place any obstacles in the Minister's way.</P>
      <P>The National Building Agency's activities have been greatly extended since it was originally established with that single purpose in mind.  It has made a major contribution by way of house completions to the national housing programme.  This is an opportune time for one to ask the Minister a number of questions relating to the operation of the agency in its various aspects.  Housing is always a very contentious and important issue. During the debate in this House some time ago on the Estimate for the Department of Local Government this was gone into in detail.</P>
      <P>During the last general election campaign the Minister, and the parties now making up the Coalition Government, chose to select this area of the economy as one in which they would make specific promises to the community should they be elected.  Positive targets were put before the people and it is only fair now that the Opposition should ask the Minister whether it is his belief that his targets are achievable and whether he would indicate to the House the level of construction which he expects will be achieved in the coming year also.  The period up to the end of December, 1973, covers the first nine months of the Minister's term in office.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Mr. Molloy Mr. Molloy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, and the moneys so granted will assist the NBA in carrying out their functions.  I may be wrong but from my own experience I know that the agency staff is not divided into sectors of those dealing exclusively with housing for industry and those dealing exclusively with housing for local authorities.  The NBA staff are active on all these fronts at the same time.  Therefore, it is unreasonable to expect that when money is being voted for this body one should confine one's comments to one aspect of their activity, namely, industrial housing, when the agency are engaged in work with the local authorities and are very much involved in the construction of local authority houses.  It is not possible to <Col N="618" /> differentiate between the functions of the staff of the NBA.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DenisJones" hpid="An Leas-Cheann Comhairle Denis Francis Jones">
      <NameTxt>An Leas-Cheann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy must accept the ruling of the Chair on this matter which concerns the provision of extra money for the NBA.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Mr. Molloy Mr. Molloy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>In that case I would merely refer briefly to the Minister's comment that next year, le cúnamh Dé, he hopes to be able to achieve certain targets.  In the first nine months of this year the total number of houses begun or authorised is already down by 3,000 and it seems that the Minister will be obliged in this last quarter to allocate 13,600 grants in order to achieve even the level of last year.</P>
      <P>It is astonishing that this is the situation and that no concern in regard to it has been expressed by the Minister other than the vague wish that God will come to his aid next year.  If a start has not been made the Government cannot possibly achieve reasonable housing outputs next year. The total number of houses begun or authorised in 1972-73 was approximately 33,000 and in the period up to the end of December last the number comes nowhere near that figure : it is only 16,900.  Can the Minister give the House an assurance that about 16,000 houses will be begun or authorised in the final three months of this financial year?  Such news would be treated with some satisfaction but the situation in the housing sphere appears to be dangerous.  The national housing statistics to which I am referring are contributed to by the houses that are built by the NBA for industrial purposes.</P>

      <P>In any case, I have sounded the warning bell for the Minister in regard to the serious situation in the housing sphere.  The future is gloomy in this regard.  We should be hearing from the Minister of special <Col N="619" /> measures to be taken to ensure that next year we will achieve at least a rate of house building similar to that of the present year.  It is regrettable that the Chair considers it necessary to confine the debate on this important occasion.</P>

This is a matter of the utmost importance and this party are prepared to do all in their power to assist in the expansion of housing.  I assure the Minister of our co-operation in that regard but we would add one criteria and that would be that the Minister would be more forthcoming with us on basic information in relation to housing matters in general.</P>

    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>I, too, welcome the necessity for the advance accommodation that is anticipated to be required by the NBA particularly in relation to industrial housing and ancillary services provisions.  However, I express my disappointment with and disapproval of the fact that while this measure is being referred to as an extension for the purpose of industrial housing and ancillary services, the question of ancillary services is something that is disregarded almost <Col N="620" /> entirely.  This is something for which I lay the blame not at the door of the Minister for Local Government but at the door of the Government as a whole because in the days before the NBA came into being the underlying need for ancillary services was outlined specifically to the then Government and this has been done subsequently on other occasions.  While we may make every effort through the local authorities and through the NBA to anticipate housing needs and to meet these needs and while we are quite helpful in regard to the provision of subsidy in relation to houses built by the agency to fulfil industrial needs, we do not do much about providing ancillary services.  Water and sewerage facilities and roads are required but are not being provided by the agency or by the IDA who, under their articles of association have the authority.  This authority is spelled out but it has not been operated.</P>
      <P>The Minister would be well advised to take up with the Government the utilisation of some of the additional financial accommodation that will be provided by this House for the building agency.  This will enable the agency to establish industry throughout the country, particularly in the more remote parts.  These areas suffer not only from the lack of housing for any industrial enterprise that may emerge; they are often by-passed because the ancillary services, merely mentioned in the Minister's speech, are not available.  They are not likely to be quickly provided by the local authority because of other commitments or by the IDA.  Facilities, by way of financial help, are not offered by the IDA even though they may be entitled to do so.  Apparently the National Building Agency are not alerted to the fact that this is a job they could do, and I am sure would be glad to do if they were given the green light to go ahead.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One of the prime motives in setting up the National Building Agency was to have a body who could get in and do work on the construction side, particularly housing, for any Department, local authority or industry.  It was hoped they would do it on equal <Col N="621" /> terms with any private agency or contractor without the inhibitions of a local authority.  It was envisaged that the agency would be given a freedom to do things quickly and to take short cuts when this could be done to the advantage of the State or local authority.  This seemed to work well in the earlier years of their activities but from what I can gather from their activities in recent times it appears that they have grown inward. As a result, they are suffering from the ill they were set up to avoid, namely, they do not act with the same freedom of movement as originally. Now they are inclined to be a part of a Department, although this is not a reflection on any Department. The agency have become rather like the public authorities who suffer from certain disabilities.  They are restricted to various procedures about advertising, tendering, bargaining for pricing, and so on.</P>
    <P>I realise these restrictions are necessary but the agency have allowed themselves to be driven to the position where they have become almost like another public authority with the attendant obligations and restrictions of a public authority, although I am not suggesting they should be relieved of these obligations.  On the establishment of the agency, the thinking of those in the Department of Local Government and other Departments was that an agency with more freedom than a Department or a public authority could be a great advantage not only from the financial point of view but in the expeditious carrying out of certain works.  This was a new concept and even though there was a lack of experience, there was a problem of getting staff together and other difficulties in the early days in the sixties, those years have shown that the establishment of the agency was worthwhile.</P>
    <P>I would ask the Minister to look back on the performance of the agency.  I think he will find I am correct in saying the agency have become ingrown.  This is reducing their effectiveness and is eliminating the advantages they had when set up.  If the Minister does this, perhaps he will <Col N="622" /> find it possible to loosen things a little.  Perhaps he will allow the agency greater latitude and freedom than they have exercised in more recent years.  In the expenditure of the additional money being sought now, a greater effort could be made by the agency if they were less restricted and not tied too much by the Department or by regulations that may apply to public or local authorities.  Once this happens and is brought to its conclusion the usefulness of the agency will have disappeared.  If they are similar to a public authority there will be no need for them because they will be only a duplication of that authority.  It is the freedom that was envisaged for the agency that has justified their existence; without that freedom there is no advantage in having the agency.  They will be just a costly, additional authority doing a job that could equally well be done by a public authority.</P>
    <P>I am a great believer in the value of the agency but that value is measured by the freedom given to them.  I appeal to the Minister to look at the record of the agency from the beginning, to follow their development, to look at the mistakes made as well as the accomplishments.  He will find from that the reasons for all the achievements. In the knowledge that any mistakes made will have been a useful experience that will help to avoid&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sure the Chair appreciates that, in the utilisation of the additional money we are proposing to provide &mdash; and I do not think anybody in the House would suggest in any way that it should not be provided in full measure &mdash; the freedom the agency had is not now enjoyed by them to the same degree and, therefore, we will not get as good value for the additional money as we would <Col N="623" /> get if that freedom were restored.  If I have digressed to some degree, I will try to avoid doing so in any further comments I have to make which are few and will be restricted, I hope, to the matter before us.</P>
      <P>The utilisation of this money cannot be confined solely to the provision of industrial housing.  I want the Minister to let us know what is being done, or what it is proposed to do, or what it is anticipated will be done, in the provision of ancillary services which I understand go along with industrial housing to make up the demand that is foreseen to amount to an additional £5 million over the five years immediately ahead.  Why should we couple ancillary services with housing if we are doing nothing about the provision of ancillary services?  If we propose to do nothing about it, it should be deleted from the statement to this House making the case for the additional £5 million.</P>
      <P>I believe it should not be deleted.  I believe it is properly where it is at the moment as part of the reason for the additional £5 million requirement.  It is only fair to suggest that a considerable proportion of this £5 million should go to the provision of ancillary services such as roads, water, sewerage, <i>et cetera,</i> without which industry cannot be provided in any circumstances, and is not capable of being provided without extreme trouble, cost and inconvenience to the local authority in whose area the industry is proposed to be sited.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The IDA have welshed on this over the years.  The agency should take up the slack because they are the type of body who can do this sort of job. Others have fallen down on it and the agency can and should act in this respect.  This additional accommodation of £5 million being provided through this House should give them the opportunity to help not only in housing industrial workers and providing for anticipated growth in the need for housing as a result of the establishment of industry, but also with the infrastructure necessary for the establishment of almost any industry. That should be capable of being provided by the agency to <Col N="624" /> encourage the establishment of the industry the growth of which would create a need for housing which we hear so much about.  We hear very little about the infrastructure needed to encourage the industry which, in turn, creates a demand for houses.</P>
    <P>That is the main point I should like to emphasise to the Minister; that and the restoring of freedom or the giving of greater freedom to the agency to act in the best interests of industry, the local authority, the Department, the Government, and the people generally.  They should be given the freedom which private institutions enjoy and which public authorities do not enjoy, very often to the disadvantage of the projects which the public authorities embark upon.  Let the agency be what it was envisaged to be, that is, a free agency which can compete on similar terms with any other body, and whether it be a private or corporate body does not really matter.</P>
    <P>This is essential.  Taking that freedom away from the agency and turning them into a branch of the Department of Local Government, or any other Department, or turning them into just another public body or public authority, is a total negation, in my estimation, of the whole concept that underlay the establishment of the agency.  Without that concept I can truthfully say that such an agency would never have been established. They have proved their worth over the years.  They can do a great deal more.  I am absolutely convinced that their freedom of movement, their free approach, and their unorthodox approach to getting the job done, and bargaining in whatever was necessary to get the best job done at the cheapest price, are essential to their wellbeing and, indeed, to their very existence.  Without them the provision of money or the lack of money will not make any great difference.</P>
    <P>I say we should give them the money they need and restore and widen the freedoms they had.  They have proved their worthiness of these freedoms in the past.  By doing that we will not only be enabling them to spread their wings further in very useful fields of operation, particularly in industrial housing and the provision <Col N="625" /> of ancillary services, but also we will be ensuring that the additional money we are proposing to provide here this evening will be well spent and that we will get better value than average from it as a result of the activities of an agency free and unfettered as they were proposed to be from the start.</P>
    <P>If the Minister does this he will be doing a very good job.  The agency are well worthy of this consideration, not for their own sake but for the sake of the country and the community they serve and have served well.  Do not tie them up.  This has happened very gradually.  Give them the latitude and the freedom they deserve and we will be very happy to come back in quite a short time, possibly, to enlarge even further the amount of money which may be provided to them.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JosephDowling" hpid="Mr. Dowling Mr. Dowling">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dowling</NameTxt>
      <P>Like other speakers, I welcome this measure.  I want to deal with the provision of housing and ancillary services related to industrial expansion.  In doing so I should like to draw the attention of the House to the fact that the inflow of industrial workers into Dublin city and county over the years has been very substantial. Many hundreds of thousands of key workers have come into Dublin city and on no occasion have the NBA or the IDA taken into consideration the vast industrial expansion in the various industrial estates throughout the city.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Key workers in Dublin are being discriminated against by the NBA and the IDA in that they have had no consultations with the local authorities about Dublin workers.  In the vastly expanded industrial estates in Ballyfermot and Tallaght and in the outer perimeter areas, the local authority are the agency to which people are directed.  Many key workers come home to employment and find that they are unable to get accommodation in Dublin city because they have not got the four years' residential qualification. No real effort has been made to establish homes for them in the way they are established in other sectors. In the year under review, 122 houses were provided by the agency <Col N="626" /> for the industrial housing programme. At the moment a further 244 dwellings are under construction.</P>
    <P>The Dublin situation requires immediate consideration and I would ask the Minister to use his influence with the IDA to ensure that they and the local authorities get together to see that the social and industrial needs of the workers are catered for in Dublin city.  The volume of workers coming to Dublin is much greater than that going to any other part of the country.  The inflow of workers is to Dublin from the country.  We have an agency and, if they have not got the necessary finances, they should have them and I am quite certain that if they required more the House would vote more to ensure that key industrial workers were housed adjacent to their employment.</P>
    <P>We have a situation at present in which workers are housed on the basis of the building programme of the local authority who attach certain conditions to the allocation of dwellings.  Sometimes key workers are completely disregarded &mdash; employment is not one of the factors taken into consideration. In the case of industrial workers in this city the factors considered are whether they qualify and where the house is available.  We have workers located in Ballymun who work in Ballyfermot industrial estate and who have to cross the city day after day.  On the other hand, people working in Tallaght are living in Ballymun.  Dublin workers are entitled to consideration and are entitled to a housing programme of the NBA and other agencies to ensure there will be no discrimination against them, particularly against workers who come home or come to the city for employment and who possess skills and crafts which are possibly not available here and find no housing accommodation and are then directed to the local housing authority which is not concerned with housing on an industrial basis.</P>
    <P>Very large industrial estates are now being developed in the Tallaght area and I hope the NBA and the local authority or the IDA or whichever body should cater for workers in that area, would come together at an early <Col N="627" /> stage so that this discrimination, so obvious in the past, will not exist in future and that industrial workers will be located near their jobs and so obviate unreasonable travelling.  This is particularly desirable in the case of shift workers.  We have large industries on the perimeter of Dublin city employing workers on a shift basis, such as those in the Semperit factory in Ballyfermot and who have to come from Ballymun.  This is very difficult for them.  All workers should have housing close to their employment.  If they had, it would relieve much of the stress, strain and tension now existing because of the transport position.  Many workers must leave home very early to meet the shift requirements of the bus service.  Many have to provide their own transport.</P>
    <P>The idea of housing workers near their employment is a very good one. This is something that has been lacking for Dublin workers.  I hope in future consideration will be given to this point in the development of industrial estates anywhere.  I am mainly concerned with Dublin because I feel there has been discrimination against workers in this regard.  If the money is not sufficient, the Minister could come back and I am positive that the House would be only too happy to provide additional finance.  I hope the Minister will use his influence with the various agencies concerned with a view to providing with housing key workers coming to this city from abroad or from other parts of the country with skills and crafts.  These are people who would have to leave if they could not find accommodation and this happens on many occasions.  A skilled worker who is referred to the local authority is told he must have a residential qualification of four years.  This matter should be examined immediately to ensure that justice is done across the board.  Like Deputy Molloy and Deputy Blaney.  I welcome the Bill and I hope the points made by speakers will get consideration by the Minister.</P>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>It seems to me that the Deputies who have welcomed and <Col N="628" /> supported the Bill are quite right in doing so because the provision of housing in relation to industrial development is very important and, hopefully, will become more important. Therefore, we all wish the agency every success in its endeavours.</P>
      <P>I would urge that possibly greater use be made of the agency and that it be encouraged in every way to pursue its statutory objectives.  Recently an industrialist in charge of a well-established industry in the Minister's constituency told me that more significantly than anything else the lack of housing for workers was inhibiting expansion of that industry. That experience, possibly, is repeated in many different areas.  I hope the agency will be encouraged by the Minister to go out and look for business in this regard and not merely confine its activities to situations where new industries are envisaged but to keep in mind situations of the type I have mentioned where expansion of existing industries is inhibited by lack of suitable housing for workers.</P>
      <P>I also urge the Minister to ensure that the agency should include in its planning and layout of schemes the highest possible level of amenity and facility development.  The words &ldquo;industrial housing&rdquo; have a certain connotation and I hope the agency to an increasing extent will devote attention to the amenity aspect of its housing estates.  With very little effort and attention, any estate can be very considerably improved.  The Minister is also interested in this.  We should get as far away as possible from the concept of a housing estate which is simply an extension of the industrial premises and should look on housing even though it is provided for workers in a specific industry, as a place where people have to live and children have to grow up and where all sorts of educational facilities and amenities are desirable.  In that regard I agree with Deputy Blaney, although from a different point of view, that the agency should give attention to ancillary services where they relate not so much to the industry itself but the housing estate attached to the industry.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="629" /> The Minister indicated that the agency so far has not had any recourse to borrowing outside the Exchequer.  I wonder why that is so. If I understand the Minister's statement it is to the effect that so far any money which the agency have used has been in the form of repayable advances from the Exchequer.  If I am correct in that, that situation should be looked at.  The resources available to the Minister for Local Government for housing will always be limited and if he can have houses built by the agency with money provided from sources outside the Exchequer that should be done.  It would also contribute to the development of an Irish money market if the agency were to issue some form of securities of their own and raise money by the issue of some form of Government guaranteed bonds or something of that nature.  There may be some good reason for the present situation and for not changing it but the Minister might give us some indication as to whether he intends to look at the situation and, if it were thought useful, encourage the agency to go outside Exchequer sources for their resources.</P>
    <P>The Minister also indicated that the money involved would be required for the provision of housing and ancillary services related to industry.  I should like to ask the Minister if he could give us any indication of what is the situation in regard to the provision of housing for State servants generally. When I was Minister for Justice the provision of houses for the Garda Síochána was a very urgent task.  Perhaps the Minister would indicate whether that problem has been solved or whether there is still a need to provide houses in different parts of the country for members of the Garda and, if so, whether the agency will engage in the provision of such houses.  We know that the force is to be increased considerably in numbers and it is possible that that increase in numbers may give rise to a demand for housing.  Would the Minister also indicate whether the agency is engaged or intends to engage in the provision of houses for other State servants such as customs officers, <Col N="630" /> Army personnel and teachers.  It seems to me that the agency could, if they were encouraged and sufficiently progressive-minded, perform a very useful role in the whole area of the provision of housing for State service personnel.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnCallanan" hpid="Mr. Callanan Mr. Callanan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Callanan</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome this Bill. This agency have been doing a very good job.  However, I should like to ask the Minister whether it is because of an effort to save money that all the houses in housing estates are the same.  No matter how nice houses are, if they are all the same it is shocking for the people living there.  I would like to see more variety in housing estates.  If the reason for this is the cost of planning different types of houses we should forget it because we are ruining the country.  I believe it is not good to bring up a family in such an environment.  In my county the planning authority when turning down applications for planning permission used the phrase &ldquo;out of character&rdquo;. As I go through the country I love to see things out of character. I believe it adds to the beauty of the countryside when everything is not in character.  The trouble with housing estates is that they are all alike and they are ruining the country both as a tourist attraction and for the people who live in it.</P>
      <P>Near the regional hospital in Galway there is a little thatched cottage, completely out of character.  It is an attraction and people come to see it and photograph it.  Even if the cost is a little more I would like to see more variety.  A person building his own house will design the house to his own liking but a person going into an estate must take what he gets. I am not saying those houses are not well built and good structures but they are too much in character.  I think we are doing a good job by voting money to this agency but I feel very strongly that we should not have a whole lot of houses of the same design.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Crowley</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not in very good voice so I shall limit my statement to a few words.  I welcome the Bill.  Indeed, I welcome any move <Col N="631" /> which will ensure that more of our people have their own houses.  For far too long we have been either burying our heads in the sand or turning a blind eye to the plight of a great number of our industrial workers. Any proposal which can bring about the easing of the housing situation is very welcome.</P>
      <P>The NBA have built a considerable number of houses in Cork and while there has been some criticism, and in some cases pretty severe criticism, of the houses, overall it can be said that they answered a very specific need at the time.  We should try to ensure that proper standards are applied to all NBA schemes, that they do not just have a cul-de-sac at practically every turn, that there is a proper amount of green space and, generally, that the layout is what we would desire for ourselves if we were living in it.  Of course, I know it is probably very difficult to meet or overcome all those restrictions when one gets involved in a scheme such as the NBA undertook this year on a fairly substantial scale. Nevertheless, we should not lose sight of the fact that we are putting people into houses and that they deserve the best we can give them.  I do not mean just, as I said, in mere housing.</P>
      <P>The time has come when we should be seeking moneys elsewhere to try to raise as much capital as possible, at the cheapest possible rates, to involve ourselves in further house building.  I do not know whether it is true but I have heard on the grapevine that the Government are negotiating a fairly substantial loan from some foreign country.  I do not want to be too specific lest I interfere in any way with the loan&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <Col N="633" /> The increase from £5 million to £15 million is a fair one but I wonder have we gone far enough.  I should like to know what the Minister envisages in the future for the building agency and the type of role he foresees them playing in future development because, again, there is a certain amount of running down of their activities.  I do not exactly mean criticism; there has been criticism, but there is a certain running down of the activities of the agency and I should like the Minister to assure us that this will not happen.  Otherwise I am very much in favour of the Bill and, indeed, I welcome it.</P>

      <P>No; I made my point.  The other point I did want to mention &mdash; and it might be something for the National Building Agency in relation to the provision of housing of the first category &mdash; is that we are in an interim stage; the old order seems to be passing and a new order coming up.  There is the whole question of housing materials; the use of scarce materials; whether the National Building Agency should go into this fairly thoroughly seeing that it is a matter of concern; what is going to be the future pattern and price; how far can we use native products to a greater degree percentage-wise in the <Col N="635" /> provision of housing?  We must eliminate from house buildings some of the materials which hitherto were freely available at reasonable prices. This will not be the score in the future.  New materials and methods should be researched by the National Building Agency.  An Foras Forbartha are engaged in this type of work.  They have carried out investigations and experiments with different kinds of materials in other spheres.  Would it be desirable for the NBA to undertake this job themselves?</P>
      <P>Our housing grants system may have to be changed to allow for the use of materials which would not at the moment reckon for grant purposes. I suggest that an investigation be carried out to find out what materials are used in house building. In the years ahead, traditional materials will be scarce, sometimes impossible to find and very expensive.</P>

    <Speaker pid="EugeneTimmons" hpid="Mr. Timmons Mr. Timmons">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Timmons</NameTxt>
      <P>I support the Bill. I congratulate the National Building Agency which was a creation of the Fianna Fáil Government.  They have fulfilled the needs of certain sections of our community, who, in other circumstances, would not have been provided with houses.</P>
      <P>I was disturbed to read in newspaper reports that the standard of construction in certain parts of the country is being brought into question. The NBA is an organisation which engages contractors to develop certain schemes.  It was reported that the quality of work done, in some cases unfinished work, was a matter of grave concern to the people who will live in these houses.  Perhaps the Minister would deal with this point.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should like to refer to those who control the affairs of the NBA.  I was very impressed by the contributions made by Deputy Haughey and Deputy Callanan.  Deputy Callanan referred to the question of the design of houses. This is a monotonous feature of our housing estates, of local authority and building agency houses, that is, houses which are built by the public authorities whether they be corporations or <Col N="636" /> urban councils, or the NBA.  In a report issued&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="DenisJones" hpid="An Leas-Cheann Comhairle Denis Francis Jones">
      <NameTxt>An Leas-Cheann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>I hope the Deputy is only making a passing reference to this point because we are dealing with the provision of increased money for the agency.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EugeneTimmons" hpid="Mr. Timmons Mr. Timmons">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Timmons</NameTxt>
      <P>I support that.  I was about to comment on the question of those who are charged with the responsibility of guiding the affairs of the agency.  I was impressed by Deputy Callanan's reference to the design of houses.  Looking at the list of those responsible for directing the affairs of the NBA, I find that there is no scope for appointing, at professional level or otherwise, a housewife to have a say in the design of houses.  It is very important that the NBA, or any building agency, should have the advice and guidance of a woman as it is she who will spend the greater part of her life in the house.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMoore" hpid="Mr. Moore Mr. Moore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moore</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome this Bill. Anything which promises an expansion of the housing drive will, of course, be welcomed.</P>
      <P>Have the agency ever carried out a big urban development?  The Minister is aware of the drive to redevelop central Dublin.  I suggest that the NBA be entrusted with the planning and designing of houses and flats to be built in the new development areas.  Here is a chance of working in something really new in urban renewal, that is, the development of the three-storey town house which gives each family complete privacy.  This has been developed on the continent.  The suggestion of Deputy Timmons that women should have a say in the design of these flats could be taken into account.  With the Minister's backing, this new drive in the city is bound to succeed and provide a new concept of urban housing.  The scheme on the 80 acres, from the Liberties to Irishtown &mdash; which Dublin Corporation intend to acquire &mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="DenisJones" hpid="An Leas-Cheann Comhairle Denis Francis Jones">

      <NameTxt>Mr. Moore</NameTxt>
      <P>This scheme offers an opportunity for new-look housing in these areas and the agency can carry out this scheme.  As regards industrial building is there enough co-operation and cohesion between the various statutory bodies?  Whose duty is it to provide houses for workers of any category?  No opportunity should be lost to provide the agency with the orders for houses and to ensure that they will not be in competition with private developers.  They should be given the projects which are not attractive to the private builders.  Sites exist in this city on which it would only be possible to erect two or three houses and the NBA should be given such sites.  Building firms may consider such a small area of land uneconomic but the agency, as a social investment, could be given such land. I welcome the Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Minister for Local Government (Mr. Tully) James Tully">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Local Government (Mr. Tully)</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to thank the House for the reception given to the Bill.  It is what I expected.  We are all in favour of advances in the provision of houses and, for this reason, I did not expect the debate on the Bill would last as long as it did.  Some interesting comments were made in relation to the agency but I was surprised that Deputy Molloy resented the fact that I was calling on the help of God to ensure that what this Government planned would be carried out.  I am sure Deputy Molloy felt he carried on without God and from the results it would appear as if that is so.</P>
      <P>With the permission of the Leas-Cheann Comhairle I should like to cover matters which, although not relevant to this Bill, were referred to by more than one Deputy.  If I am permitted to give some of the facts which were sought by Deputies I believe it will help.  The general housing programme does not arise now.  This Bill relates to the financing of industrial housing which is only 1 per cent of the housing programme this year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>However, I should like to put some figures on the record; 18,441 new houses were built in the first nine months of 1973-74.  We will complete 6,500 more between the 1/1/1974 and <Col N="638" /> the 31/3/1974.  Adding that one finds that it is very close to 25,000.  With regard to local authority houses, houses in progress on tender at 31/12/1973 totalled 14,033, 1,000 up on the figure for the previous year; 15,773 more are being planned and thousands of these will commence in the next few months.  On the private housing side there has been a falling off a new house grant allocations in 1973-74 as compared with 1972-73&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Mr. Molloy Mr. Molloy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>A drop of 3,000.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;but housing is not susceptible to short term changes, however.  It is relevant to note that during the period from the 1st April, 1968 to date a total of 83,437 new house grants were allocated but a total of only 61,301 grants were paid. For the information of Deputy Molloy more than £1 million, in fact, £1,020,000, was paid in grants for the first time ever in July gone by in order to catch up on the backlog left by the Deputy when he was in office. There is a balance of 22,136 houses for which grants have been approved but, obviously, the houses have not been completed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Mr. Molloy Mr. Molloy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>How could there have been a backlog when 3,000 fewer grants were paid?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy should wait and he will get the information. Another indication of the trend in private housing is the number of persons who applied to the lending agencies for house purchase loans. The total here was 15,341 at the 1/4/1972 and that rose steadily to 19,847 at the 31/12/1973.  These figures show a positive promise of the continuance of private housing at local level.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Mr. Molloy Mr. Molloy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>How many people succeeded in securing loans?  That is what really matters.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>They got loans.  Deputy Molloy, when he was finishing, thumped his breast and said that Fianna Fáil were behind the housing drive.  Fianna Fáil did everything they could since they left office to prevent the housing drive getting off <Col N="639" /> the ground but, in spite of them, 25,000 houses will be built in this financial year.  This figure will continue to go up in the years to come and the Deputy cannot get away from that.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy's party did not oppose it but members of his party tried by various ways, and I must admit there were exceptions, to give the impression that there was not a hope in the world of getting the housing programme operated.  It is being operated and that is that.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>Next year there will be a further substantial increase and I hope Deputy Molloy is here to hear me when I read the figures at the end of the year.  The Government are committed to an output target of 25,000 houses per year and they will go up on that.  All the talk of Deputy Molloy trying to deny that will not change the facts.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Mr. Molloy Mr. Molloy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>It is a serious drop.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>The Government are also determined that an increasing proportion of these will be provided in the public sector to cater for a long neglected need.  This change in emphasis will take up any slack which may develop on the private side.</P>
      <P>Deputy Haughey asked some questions to which he is entitled to a reply because they are relevant to the Bill before the House.  The NBA has never refused an application submitted with the benediction of the IDA to provide houses needed to facilitate industrial development.  The IDA must approve, and, if they do, the NBA never refuse to carry out their wishes.  In the case of industrial housing 112 were built by the agency in 1972-73.  We will complete 260 this year.  Work is now in progress on a further 456 houses with another 1,015 being planned.  These are all industrial houses.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The question was asked about the gardaí and civil servants.  The gardaí <Col N="640" /> decided not to have their houses built by the NBA.  Apparently, the Board of Works decided to do something about this themselves, but if they come back and ask to have houses built that will be all right.  With regard to the Civil Service, no Department, with the exception of the Department of Defence have made a request.  For the Department of Defence the NBA recently completed 50 houses for Army personnel at the Curragh and they are building another 20 for the Army at Athlone.</P>
    <P>The fact that we are looking for such a major increase in borrowing capacity is the best proof we have that we propose to make very good use of the facilities of the NBA.  It is true that all the borrowing has been done from the State but the reason for this is pretty obvious.  We all hear of the fellows who go to the offices of Ministers of State and tell of the £20 million they can make available at low interest rates.  We have such people all over the place but the plain fact is that, as far as borrowing money is concerned, there is only a certain amount of money available and putting more agencies into the field to borrow that money will not increase the amount available for borrowing. It is felt so far that the State should borrow the money and lend it to the NBA.  If it is found that there is a better way of doing this, the present method can be changed.</P>
    <P>Deputy Dowling asked how it was that houses were being built for industrial workers in other parts of the country and not in Dublin. Deputy Molloy could give him the answer to that because the previous Government decided, rightly or wrongly, that they would not build houses for industrial workers in Dublin.  At present that is being reviewed and we are looking at it to see if the NBA should take part in the building of houses for industrial workers in Dublin.  There are two schools of thought about this but we are hoping to have a definite decision on it in the near future.</P>
    <P>From the IDA, the output of houses for industrial workers is expected to be of the order of 600 units <Col N="641" /> a year for the five years from 1974-75 to 1978-79 compared with an average of 260 annually in the four years ending 1973-74.  No matter what way it is taken extra houses have been built.  In addition to this, there is a programme of 10,000 houses being built for local authorities over a five-year period by the NBA.  These are in addition to the industrial houses but are not included in this because the money for them is not required since they are provided by the local authorities for whom the houses are built.</P>
    <P>While I may not agree entirely with everything that Deputy Callanan said I admit that there should be variety in housebuilding.  Obviously it is cheaper to build every house in a scheme to the same design but I can assure the House that for as long as I am Minister for Local Government there will not be built any more of those houses which, because they were to house working-class people, were built cheaply and were of the worst possible materials and designs. I have taken a definite decision that the houses that will be built from now on will be of the best quality and design.</P>

      <P>Deputy Timmons must have embarrassed my predecessor when he spoke of the bad housing standards that he had read of in the papers.  Not only have I read of them but I have looked at some of these houses and &ldquo;bad&rdquo; is a mild term to apply to them.  Their design was atrocious.  An effort was made on a previous occasion to have houses built cheaply and that resulted in the utilisation of bad materials and in bad workmanship.  It is something that should never have happened and we took steps several months ago to ensure that it will not happen again.</P>

      <P>Deputy Timmons spoke of the housewife having a say in house design.  When talking of building houses we tend to forget that the person who uses the house more than any other member of the family is the housewife.  Until recently her ideas in regard to house design did not seem to matter and, so, houses were built in the way that the men thought fit.  There is no housewife on the NBA Board but I changed the composition of that board recently and have added some worthwhile people to it.  In addition, I have asked the NBA and other authorities who come within the ambit of the Department to endeavour to ascertain as many views as possible on house design from the housewife's point of view.  I am hopeful that this will result in better designing.</P>

The question was raised, <Col N="643" /> although entirely out of order, as to the renewal of the Dublin city centre. This is a development that we all wish to see take place and I am delighted to be able to say that Deputy Moore and his commissioner colleagues have always been in favour of such development. I expect that in order to carry out the developments we have in mind it will be necessary to seek the assistance of the NBA.  I assure the Deputy that the work will be carried out in accordance with the best possible planning and I am confident that the result will be a credit to all concerned.  I am not interested in who takes credit for the work.  My only hope is that once again the centre of Dublin will be lived in.</P>

      <P>I have at my disposal some figures in respect of industrial housing which I wish to give to the House.  In respect of Galway, the NBA have a firm order for 100 houses for workers and 30 for executives per annum for the next five years.  In Donegal 174 houses are at planning stage.  These include 100 houses at Letterkenny for employees of the new Courtauld's factory and the IDA envisage that a further 100 houses will be required in that area to meet final demand.  In Limerick the IDA have notified the NBA of a requirement of at least 200 houses in the Foynes and Askeaton areas to meet the demands that are expected to arise there.  In Mayo it is estimated that 1,000 houses will be required in future years to meet the demands of the workers to be employed in the three major industries proposed for that area.  The immediate requirement there is for 200 houses. In Cork, industrial expansion in the Ringaskiddy and Bantry areas is expected to create a demand for at least 500 houses within the next five years. All of this is good news.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Blaney referred to the question of ancillary services.  The Deputy and I do not seem to be on the same wavelength in this regard because, as I understand the term, ancillary services are services required for houses being built.  The Deputy <Col N="644" /> seems to think that the NBA should set out to service areas particularly for industrial sites where water and sewerage facilities are not available already.  There has been no proposal in this regard and I doubt whether under the scheme of building industrial houses such services could be included.  However, it is a matter that can be looked at.  Deputy Blaney, too, referred to the agency's freedom of action being interfered with.  I can assure him that the NBA have never had the amount of freedom that they have now.  They are using this freedom to the utmost and are doing a very fine job.</P>
    <P>Deputy Cunningham referred to Greencastle fisheries school in Donegal.  Lest anyone might get the impression that I have a set on Deputy Cunningham I should say at the outset that if the Deputy makes a stupid comment he cannot blame me for reminding him of that stupidity. He had not read the Bill before coming in and thought it contained provisions which it does not contain at all.  The Deputy must be aware that the school in question will be completed shortly but that it cannot be taken over for teaching because of the shortage of some equipment and materials, some of which are for roofing purposes.  The Departments of Agriculture and Fisheries and of Education are looking after the question of equipment while the IDA and the NBA, for their part, have done everything possible.</P>

      <P>On Second Stage I referred to the question of the manner in which the NBA would procure their resources.  I pointed out that so far they have resorted only to the Exchequer and suggested that the agency should consider going outside the Exchequer. I repeat that suggestion now.  In his reply the Minister indicated that the Exchequer is the best vehicle for borrowing and that it was best that the Exchequer should borrow the money and give it to the agency.  That is a rather simplistic approach.  I know it prevails to some extent through the financial establishment of the public service but the Minister could have another look at it.  I do not for a moment suggest that any credence should be given to, or any time spent on, these people who come along with fabulous offers &mdash; usually it is sheik or oil money.  On the other hand, there has been an attempt for some years to build up an Irish money market.  It is possible there is money around, either in private or semi-public institutions, which might not go into the Exchequer through the normal sources of national loans but which might be available.  It might suit the different institutions to provide it for the agency if certain types of bonds were provided by the agency.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Agricultural Credit Corporation have been very successful in getting in funds from the general field <Col N="646" /> outside the Exchequer.  I put these suggestions forward as something that might be examined.  If there is pressure on the Exchequer for money for housing, perhaps the agency could devise a certain type of bond that would ensure that money could be channelled into it for a longer or shorter term and, to that extent, relieve the Exchequer of the burden.</P>

      <P>I take the Deputy's point.  I would point out to him &mdash; he might consider it unfair &mdash; that from 1963 until last year the previous Government apparently were satisfied with the situation.  I go along with what Deputy Haughey said.  It may be possible to raise money outside but I do not think the ACC are a fair comparison because they would generally appeal to people involved in agriculture. If these people had money to invest they would put it into agriculture but I do not think all the builders would rush to put their spare money into the NBA.  They would find other ways of investing it from which they might get a better return.  However, the matter is at present under consideration and if it is thought there may be another way in which the money can be raised we will take advantage of it.  In any event, we have the authority.  I thank Deputy Haughey for his suggestion.</P>

      <P>I am concerned as to the significance of declaring a road to be a national road.  Section 2 provides that the Minister can declare an existing public road, or proposed public road, to be a national road or a motorway.  We all understand what can happen when he declares a public road to be a motorway.  From perusal of the Bill it seems to me that the national roads only come into operation for the purposes of section 11, for the purpose of the Minister giving instructions as to the management and co-ordination of national roads and motorways.  I am wondering if national roads have any other significance.  Will the Minister declare a public road to be a national road for any other purpose?  Is anything else involved other than the fact that it will become operative for purposes of section 11?</P>

      <P>Amendments 1 and 2 may be discussed together.</P>

    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 1:</P>
      <P>In subsection 3 (a), page 3, line 22, before &ldquo;, or&rdquo; to insert &ldquo;unless the construction, repair or maintenance is necessitated by damage caused by works carried out by a road authority under subsection (2)&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>The purpose of the amendments is self-evident.  They relate to subsection (3) of section 3.  I should like to draw the attention of the House to the precise wording of subsection (3) as it stands.  It seems to me to be fairly draconian.  My first problem with regard to it is the use of the word &ldquo;responsibility&rdquo;.  In both sections (a) and (b) this word is used. The subsection lays down that the Act will not impose on a road authority any liability, duty or obligation to construct, repair or maintain fences or retaining walls which are the responsibility of any other person I am not quite clear what is intended by the use of the word &ldquo;responability&rdquo;. How does the responsibility arise?  Who will decide who is responsible for the maintenance, repair or construction of fences or retaining walls?  Is responsibility there equivalent to ownership?  At what point does responsibility move from a private citizen to the road authority?  That is my first difficulty.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Apart from that aspect, it seems to me also that we should be careful here.  This is a very important piece of legislation.  As some of us said on Second Stage, it will affect the lives and property of many individuals in the future.  We have to look ahead and try to envisage situations which will arise in regard to the lives and property of individuals and see that we frame this legislation in such a way that no injustices will be done.  Once the Bill becomes an Act, the public <Col N="649" /> authorities, the local authorities, take over and the individual private citizen will depend entirely for his rights on what we lay down in this piece of legislation. The local authorities, the road authorities, will have a very direct responsibility to provide motorways, and national roads, and so on.  From time to time they may be faced with situations where they would like to do something to ease the position for a private citizen in regard to his property, but they will be prevented from doing so by the provisions of this Act as it will then be.  This is the first point where this type of question arises.</P>
    <P>The Bill, as framed, seems to me to go very far in absolving local authorities, or road authorities which we are dealing with in this case, from any sort of responsibility for constructing, repairing or maintaining fences.  We have to think ahead.  In many cases the need for these fences or retaining walls will only be brought about by the construction of a motorway.  It seems to me that there will be a very big obligation on the road authority to see to it that the walls and fences along the motorways are maintained, and adequately maintained.  That will be important both from the point of view of the rights and amenities of the landowners adjoining the motorway and also from the point of view of the motorway itself.</P>
    <P>It would be very important from the safety point of view that the fences, and walls, and so on, along the verges of the motorways of the future should be adequately maintained. I am trying to improve the situation here somewhat by these amendments.  I am trying to provide, by means of these amendments, that the road authority will not be relieved of the liability, duty or obligation to construct, repair or maintain these fences if the necessity arises from something they have done.  In other words, it is necessitated by damage caused by works carried out by a road authority under subsection (2).  I hope the Minister will see what I am seeking to do here and have sympathy with my objective and accept both of these amendments.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>I understand what Deputy Haughey is saying and I appreciate what he is trying to do. Two points arise.  One is that this does not apply only to motorways.  It applies to all roads.  I am sure he will understand that his amendments, therefore, are entirely unnecessary. The Bill, as drafted, does not change the <i>status quo</i> in regard to responsibility for construction, repair or maintenance of fences or retaining walls adjoining a public road which are the responsibility of any other person or body, or for the construction repair or maintenance of bridges, railway tunnels or railway crossings which are the responsibility of CIE.  It does not change the position as it is at present at all.</P>
      <P>Furthermore, the amendment would render the road authority liable for subsequent repair or maintenance of such fences, walls, bridges, <i>et cetera</i>, in any case where modifications or alterations carried out under subsection (2) would be held to have damaged such fences, walls, <i>et cetera.</i> It does not alter the <i>status quo</i>.  The fact that it deals with motorways in addition does, perhaps, appear to confuse the issue.  I assure Deputy Haughey that it makes no difference. The present arrangement has worked pretty well so far.  As a matter of fact, some of us think it works too well and that too much money has been spent from time to time on walls and fences adjoining the roads.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>The motorways are a special case.  The Minister has not dealt with my point about responsibility. Motorways will be a very special case.  One of the big points about motorways is that access to them will be controlled.  From that of vehicles that will be allowed on them will be controlled.  From that point of view, it seems to me that very definitely the road authority should be almost totally responsible for constructing, repairing and maintaining fences.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I want to try to establish from the Minister under what circumstances would the road authority not be responsible for the maintenance of these fences, retaining walls, and so on.  Are <Col N="651" /> there any circumstances, where a new fence or a new roadway is provided along the side of one of these new motorways, in which the road authority will not be responsible for maintaining those fences but the private landowner will?  Will that arise?  If that is so my amendments are very definitely necessary.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMoore" hpid="Mr. Moore Mr. Moore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moore</NameTxt>
      <P>Let me say in support of Deputy Haughey's amendment that last week the Minister approved in principle a new bridge across the Liffey.  Immediately after that we were told in the newspapers that people spoke in terrified terms about what would happen to their communities.  If it were written into a Bill that the road authority must consult with all these people, there would be some safeguard, and the road could not be started before they had been consulted on the matter and made their views known.  The Minister may say that any responsible road authority would do that anyway which they probably would.  Could we have written into the Bill, as suggested by Deputy Haughey, this extra safeguard that they must be consulted?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>There is a later amendment which deals with this point.  The people who make statements which make them appear to be terrified would not be so terrified if other people did not give them the impression that they know what will happen and give them an entirely erroneous impression of what will happen.  I met those people and I talked to groups of them.  When they understood they would get full consultation before anything was done they were satisfied.</P>
      <P>The section provides:</P>
      <P>A road authority may do all things necessary or incidental to the construction, maintenance or improvement of public roads...</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Would Deputy Haughey read that in conjunction with his amendment?  He is talking specifically about motorways. He asked me under what circumstances would the authority not be responsible for a fence along a motorway.  They would not be responsible for the fence after it was made safe.  That would be <Col N="652" /> the responsibility of the person living there, like a wall or a fence along a house.  If the local authority were responsible for all the fences along every road, which would be the effect of this amendment, the local authorities would be in an impossible position.</P>

      <P>At present what the Minister says is quite true that the responsibility falls on the person who owns the land after the fence is put up.  Would the Minister think it slightly unfair that if the fence is knocked through an accident on the road and &mdash; as could be proved in Galway recently &mdash; that the road authority is in no way responsible&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Callanan</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to have some assurance that if a motor way happened to run through my land and I had a fence which ran for a quarter of a mile perhaps along that motorway where there could be ten accidents in a week and the good fence such as the Minister is talking about &mdash; and they are good fences; they are provided by local authorities &mdash; was all demolished I would not be held responsible for repairing it.  I do not think it is fair to the man whose land is inside it that he should be responsible for repairing the fence when he was in no way responsible for the knocking of it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Callanan asks who should be responsible.  The man who owns that land is not responsible; the man who knocks down the fence is responsible.  If on a motorway it is knocked down by a car that is the position.  Deputy Callanan and other county councillors would be the first to scream if there was a law that every fence that fell must be repaired by the local authority no matter who is responsible for knocking it.  That is what the amendment says.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>No.  There are several aspects of this matter.  The <Col N="653" /> question of responsibility is important but what both my amendments say is that where some action of the road authority damages a fence or retaining wall then they shall not be relieved of the obligation, liability or duty of maintaining or repairing it.  As it is, the section is blanket.  It says that nothing in this Act shall impose on a road authority any liability, duty or obligation to construct or maintain a fence....  That is a blanket relief for the road authority.  My amendment seeks that where something happens to the fence or retaining wall because of the action of the road authority, then &mdash; I do not even go as far as to say that they must repair it &mdash; all I say is that they shall not be relieved of any liability, duty or obligation to repair it.  I think that is fair.  If they do the damage they should repair it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>It is entirely unnecessary. It would make it appear that it was necessary to put in this to have it done.  If at the present time a local authority is doing any work along a road and they damage a fence or anything else they usually spend a lot of money repairing it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>We are not concerned with what they usually do. We are creating the legal position for the future and I want to protect the legal position of the individual private citizen along the motorway of the future.  First, in view of the importance of these motorways both from the point of view of the motorway itself and that of the individual along whose land or property the motorway will run, I think from both points of view the road authority should be solely responsible for these fences or retaining walls.  It is very important that they should be but particularly &mdash; and this is what my amendment is confined to &mdash; I think we should spell it out here quite clearly in the Bill and not leave it to custom or practice, <Col N="654" /> as a legal responsibility that if the road authority does something which damages any of these fences, that authority will not be relieved of the liability, obligation or duty to repair them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnCallanan" hpid="Mr. Callanan Mr. Callanan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Callanan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister probably misunderstood me.  It is true that if these people who hit a fence are caught they will have to pay but if an accident occurs and the fence is down the Minister will say the local authority did not knock it but if the local authority did not put the motorway through my land it would not be there.  They are responsible in that way.  This is why I think it essential that where no proof can be got against the person who destroyed the fence the owner of the land should not be responsible for the repair.  We had a case of this in Galway county recently &mdash; not very recently; I do not think it was in the Minister's time.  As the law stands at present, if you cannot get the culprit the person whose land is inside is responsible for repairing the fence.  I think that is unfair.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy is suggesting that we should have another type of malicious injury, that no matter who the culprit is if the road fence is knocked down by a drunk charging along at 80 miles an hour in a car, the local authority, the ratepayers should pay for it and he should not be asked to do anything about it.  Perhaps I am unfair to the Deputy who himself is usually very fair.  I am sure Deputy Haughey will admit that what he suggests here does not refer to motorways alone but to all public roads.  To put in the amendment as he suggests would be to write in that they would be responsible for all public roads.  At present if a local authority is doing repairs or any work on any public roads and they cause damage, they repair it.  That is and has been the case for years.  If Deputy Haughey's neighbour does something which knocks the Deputy's fence it does not require to be written into any law that such a man must pay, I think it is unnecessary.  I agree that it is right to bring the matter to the notice of the House but I would ask Deputy Haughey to accept that, as the <Col N="655" /> law stands at present, the matter is completely covered.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Mr. Molloy Mr. Molloy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister states what is, in his view, the law at present. I should like him to elaborate the reasons for including this section in the Bill if the law is so clearly understood at present.  What was the necessity to write in this section stating all over again what the Minister says is already law?  That is one point. There is obviously a real need and a necessity for this section and I am sure the Minister will be able to elaborate further on that.</P>
      <P>On Deputy Haughey's point, I think the Minister will accept that it is valid in that we are discussing under this Bill authorising the future construction of a new form of road known as a motorway.  All of us have some experience of what is meant by a motorway.  The power to control access to it will be exercised very rigidly and even the type of vehicles allowed to use the motorway will be limited.  The general purpose of motorways is to provide a roadway which will be capable of carrying large traffic loads with greater safety and improving travelling time and road capacity.  Generally speaking, they will be straight and they will remove many of the faults which one can see in our existing road system which developed over centuries and was never designed to cope with modern traffic.</P>
      <P>When you are constructing these highways, acquiring land from landowners, completing the construction and leaving the site with fences along both sides of the road, I think in fairness to the landowners concerned and in particular, in fairness to those who will travel on that road it is absolutely essential to obtain maximum safety margins and ensure that all fences adjoining these roads be at all times properly maintained because if they are damaged they could cause a serious accident.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We know that accidents on motorways do not happen very often but, unfortunately, when they happen they seem to cause much greater destruction than accidents on the roads we know at present because of the high volume <Col N="656" /> of traffic.  They generally seem to involve a large number of vehicles.  It is essential that access be controlled and most essential that fences along these roads be properly maintained at all times to avoid cattle straying across or other unauthorised movement along the motorways.  It is not unreasonable to expect that the authority that constructs the motorways should be responsible for their maintenance.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LiamCunningham" hpid="Mr. Cunningham Mr. Cunningham">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cunningham</NameTxt>
      <P>The argument put up by the Minister is based on a false premise.  The financing of the motorways, I presume, will be for the central Exchequer.  I should like to take that a step further and suggest that the maintenance of those inter-county roads will be the responsibility of the Exchequer also.  Repairs to fences, property and so on should be as well. For instance, there will be fly-overs which will be well above the level of the land.  Surely if a heavy truck gets off the fly-over, damages the fence and damages property, it should not be the responsibility of the owner of that property. What is he to do?  Is he to get a ladder, climb up and repair the fence of the fly-over?  In the same way, there will be pedestrian crossings above the motorway.  If damage is done to the pedestrian cross-over surely the person on whose land part of that cross-over is&mdash;&mdash;</P>

I am making a case that if you are to be responsible for some repairs on land which is owned by a private individual why not be responsible for all the fencing?  The motorway <Col N="657" /> is a new concept in this country and people will be very much inconvenienced. If there is damage, how long can that damage remain and not be a hazard to people?  Can we afford a situation in which there will be a legal wrangle as to who is responsible for the repair of the fencing?  If the person responsible for the damage is not apprehendable or is not known, surely there will be a lot of litigation involved and eventually the local authority will be responsible because it will be regarded as malicious damage. There is a case to be made for the amendment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>We appear to be getting completely off the line.  Deputy Cunningham says that the State would be responsible for the building of a motorway, which is a new concept. That is correct and nobody said it is not but this does not refer only to motorways.  This refers to all public roads.  The State is not responsible for all public roads at present and, therefore, the local authority will come in for the vast majority of roads.  If Deputy Haughey's proposal were accepted it would mean that in certain circumstances all public roads would be affected by this.  I am quite sure he did not intend this and I can see the point of the amendment.</P>
      <P>Deputy Cunningham talked about fly-overs and pedestrian crossings. They would not be part of the fencing of a farm or a holding.  They would be artificial creations which would be owned by the people who built the road.  They would be part of the motor way.  They must be.  One might as well suggest that where there are overhead crossings in this city they belong to the people on either side of the street.  Nobody would be so ridiculous as to suggest that.  They belong to the corporation.  If anybody were foolish enough to drive through the wall of such a fly-over, naturally the State would be responsible for the repair of it and I am quite sure they would try to collect from the person who did the damage, if they could, payment for it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The simple facts are that as of now in countries where there are motorways, <Col N="658" /> and while it is the first of its kind here it is not the first of its kind in the world, what we are suggesting here is what is operated.  That is that where there is an existing fence responsibility for the maintenance of which rests on a private individual that will not be altered.  Where the State or the local authority damage, by any work they are doing, this sort of fence the position has always been &mdash; and I shall go a little bit ahead because on another of Deputy Haughey's amendments I will be referring to this &mdash; the powers are regarded as being implied in the duty placed on them under section 24 of the Local Government Act, 1925 &ldquo;to construct and maintain public roads&rdquo; and the definition of &ldquo;maintenance&rdquo; contained in section 1 of that Act.</P>
    <P>This is the situation and I would ask Deputy Haughey to accept that the matter is fully covered as it is. His amendment would not be acceptable. Possibly if he had another look at it and decided that it needed a further change he might get one of his colleagues in the Seanad to try to have it introduced.  I would not be in a position to accept the amendment as it is.</P>

    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>Is ceist eile í sin.  My amendments are not as accurately drawn as they might be because we have not had much time to consider this Bill.  We only had the Second Stage last week and it was only on Second Stage that we got from the Minister his ideas on all the things that were involved in the construction of these motorways.  Therefore, my amendments, I am afraid, do lack the precision which I would like them to have.  However, I do think that, framed as they are, they outline the dilemma with which this House, I suggest, is faced in this regard.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I said, on the Second Stage, that in this Bill, we in this House are called upon to discharge one of our best, and <Col N="659" /> most fundamental, functions &mdash; that is, to try to lay down the rules of the game for the future.  What local authorities, county engineers and so on, will do in the construction of these motorways or national roads in the future will undoubtedly have a very important bearing and effect on many private citizens.  We owe it to those citizens to try to ensure that the construction of those roadways will be done in such a way that they will be able to look to this legislation for the protection of their rights.  That aspect will come up under a number of different sections.  We would be failing in our duty if we did not &mdash; as far as we could do so and as far as we could foresee into the future the problems and difficulties that will arise &mdash; safeguard against them as far as we can in the legislative provisions now before us.</P>
    <P>I was going to raise with the Minister &mdash; on the section, as such, when we came to deal with it &mdash; what he is after in section 3.  Perhaps if we could get that at this stage it might help us to deal more effectively with my amendments.  It would seem to me that section 3 is seeking to do something we all thought was already there.  Section 3, in effect, says that a road authority may do all things necessary or incidental to the construction, maintenance or improvement of public roads; not just motorways, as the Minister points out.  Any of us in this House would have thought that road authorities already had that power but it seems there must be some need to make a clear statement of that power in this Bill. If that is so, perhaps the Minister would indicate it, that there is some doubt about the authority of road authorities to do these things.  In particular, I can see that it may not have been absolutely clear up to now that a road authority had the power to do landscaping, planting and similiar activities of that sort in the interests of amenity and environment. It may be necessary to spell out that power specifically.  But the section also spells out that the road authorities, in the future, may do all these things which are necessary or incidental to <Col N="660" /> the construction, maintenance or improvement of public roads.</P>
    <P>Perhaps, if the Minister would outline for us why it is necessary to spell out that power at this stage, then we would have a better idea of whether or not my amendments could be dispensed with.  If the situation is that the law is quite clear and definite; that where a road authority, by their own action, interfere with a fence they are liable to repair that fence; if that is so, that is one situation.  If that is so, I do not see any harm in spelling it out here in black and white in this Bill.  We are simply re-declaring the law, because that seems to be what section 3 is doing anyway; it is re-declaring the law in so far as the powers of local authorities are concerned. And, if it is re-declaring the law in so far as their general powers are concerned, then there is no harm whatsoever, in fact it is desirable, that we should also re-declare the law in so far as their duty to construct, repair or maintain fences, where they damage them, is concerned.</P>
    <P>If the Minister says to me: &ldquo;Look, this has always been the situation; the local authority, if they have damaged a fence belonging to a farmer along the side of the road, always repaired that fence,&rdquo; that is all very well.  The local authority may have always done so out of the goodness of their hearts but we are now spelling out clear legislative powers in this Bill.  If we are doing that, I think we should also avoid the situation.  It seems to me that section 3 would leave us in a situation where the local authority would be relieved completely of any responsibility for repairing a fence where they had damaged that fence by their own action. I think this is particularly important in the case of motorways.  There should be a very heavy responsibility on road authorities to keep fences along motorways repaired.  But, even in the case of ordinary public roads &mdash; and the Minister rightly points out to me, all public roads are concerned in this section &mdash; I cannot see how the Minister can object to our spelling out here, in the section, the fact that if the road authority damage a fence or a retaining wall they shall not be relieved <Col N="661" /> of the responsibility of repairing that damage by this section.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>First of all, might I say they have not got powers with regard to landscaping and planting now. Therefore, we are putting them in. I think Deputy Haughey's objection is mainly to subsections 3 (a) and (b) where he suggests that it is relieving the local authority of some responsibility they have at present.  That is not quite so.  The purpose of sub-section 3 (a) is to ensure that no additional obligation for the road authority in this regard will be read into the Act.</P>
      <P>As I mentioned earlier, it is implied in the duty imposed under section 24 of the Local Government Act of 1925 &mdash; the question of maintaining and repairing would mean repairing fences damaged.  This has been the law up to now and will continue to be the law.  But what we do not want to happen is&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>The provisions of section 24 of the 1925 Act which, unfortunately, I have not got.  And it has operated &mdash; as Deputy Haughey knows as well &mdash; that when damage is done to fences by a local authority, or even if it is suggested that they may have damaged fences, they have, in every case, repaired them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>But as subsections 3 (a) and (b) are now framed &mdash; if that obligation is placed on them by the 1925 Act, subsections (a) and (b) will relieve them of it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>No, it will not.  As Deputy Callanan mentioned, if somebody crashed into a fence and knocked it down, that is not now the responsibility of the local authority or the State to repair it and it will not be, under this Act, but might be if Deputy Haughey's amendment was carried.  What we are saying is &mdash; and listen to the wording carefully:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>(3) Nothing in this Act shall be <Col N="662" /> construed as imposing on a road authority any liability, duty or obligation to&mdash;</P>
    <P>(a)  construct, repair or maintain fences or retaining walls adjoining a public road which are the responsibility of any other persons, or</P>
    <P>(b)  construct, repair or maintain any bridges, tunnels, railway crossing or any other structure which by virtue of any enactment are the responsibility of a railway company or other person.</P>
    <P>What Deputy Haughey is afraid of &mdash; and I can see his point &mdash; is that the original arrangement, under the 1925 Local Government Act, would be ignored now and, under this new legislation, we would attempt to enact this to mean that even though the local authority knocked down some of these things, because they belonged to somebody else, there would be no responsibility on the local authority or the State to repair them.</P>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">

      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, I have put it fairly clearly.  I intended to do that.  I put the case fairly clearly so that the Deputy would understand exactly what was in his amendment.  His amendment suggests that on every public road, if anything happens, the local authority or the State should be responsible for repairing fences.  That just could not be and I think Deputy Haughey would be the first to accept that it would not be something which would be acceptable to anybody. There would be uproar in local authorities if it were found that we were imposing on them the liability to repair every farmer's fence.</P>
      <P>May I suggest again to Deputy Haughey &mdash; he may consider that this requires amendment; he may, as he says himself, tighten up his amendment&mdash;&mdash;</P>

Work on a number of very important roads is being held up because this Bill must be law before the work can be started.  This delay is unjustified.  If Deputy Haughey insists on further time to consider the Bill, I will not oppose it.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Mr. Molloy Mr. Molloy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>I am surprised that the Minister should lay such emphasis on the fact that now great urgency attaches to this Bill and that there were certain matters appertaining to roads which were being held up because this Bill was delayed in the House.  The Minister knows that the Bill, as it appears before us, was <Col N="664" /> substantially available to him as far back as March, 1973.  There were several opportunities for him to come before the House since that date of which he did not avail.  It is asking a lot when the Minister stresses that now he has decided to bring in this Bill, he must slap it into top gear and slam it through the House.  The 1925 Act is the basic Act as far as road law is concerned.  In the intervening period there has not been any detailed debate on roads legislation.  Any Acts passed since then have not had the same significance as the 1925 Act. A number of years have elapsed since a Roads Bill came before this House. We are making a significant change in this Bill.  It is improper for the Minister to suggest that it should be rushed through the House.  Last week he complained that he was not getting all Stages.  Deputy Haughey has thought fit to try to improve the Bill by putting down amendments and the Minister has put down an amendment since we discussed the Second Stage. Therefore, it was a good thing that we did not let the Bill slip through last week.</P>
      <P>We are discussing the first amendments to the Bill at this stage.  We should see how the debate proceeds and make our decision at the end of each Stage.  We should not be asked to commit ourselves in advance.  I feel that the Minister has not given a full and satisfactory explanation as to the reasons why the amendments which Deputy Haughey suggested could not be accepted.  If his reasoning in opposing the amendments has been given and he has nothing further to add, obviously it would be necessary for us to study in greater detail some of the references he made in order to see what the law is and whether we should not amend our amendments or introduce new ones at a later date.  I would ask the Minister not to press us to make decisions about coming to a conclusion and to let the debate proceed in the normal way.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>How ridiculous can Deputy Molloy get.  He says that this Bill was available to me last March. He has spent time arguing why it should be changed and he wants further <Col N="665" /> time to consider what amendments he may find necessary.  Deputy Haughey put in amendments and had reasonable arguments why they should be carried. Deputy Molloy's arguments have no relation to what is before the House. My amendment concerned a printer's error.  It was not my fault that the printers put in &ldquo;employment&rdquo; instead of &ldquo;enjoyment&rdquo;.  There was nothing I could do about that and I am trying to correct it now.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>Once in a while it might not be a bad idea to break with international practice.  I am sure the Minister would be capable of doing that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In conjunction with the considerations advanced by Deputy Haughey and others in their amendments, which perhaps do not fit into the <Col N="666" /> pattern of things as the Bill now stands, I recommend that the Minister have a look at this point and disregard, if necessary, international practice and maybe even learn from international mistakes.  The motorway as we envisage it for the future is a very different kettle of fish to minor roads, accommodation roads, main roads, public roads, county roads and arterial roads.  The damage and dangers consequent on a fence broken by some unknown in the middle of the night are enormous.  As a result, cattle may stray through the breach of such a fence, a fence which according to the law as proposed, would be the responsibility of the landowner.  However, the landowner was in no way responsible nor was he even aware of the breach, nor of his cattle wandering on to the road creating a pile-up and great damage and even loss of life.  This is a case where the local authority or the Government should take over.  This matter should not be treated in the same way as a winding country road under the 1925 Act. This is not the same thing and, therefore, should not be treated in the same way.  Other speakers referred to the legal wrangles which may emerge as a result of trying to apprehend the person who damaged the fence &mdash; I am talking about a fence rather than any other structure &mdash; identifying who did it, getting redress from that person to the degree that would enable the landowners to repair it or to pay for its repair.</P>
    <P>What happens in the interim?  Is the gap still to remain there?  Is the particular land that is enclosed by this fence to be out of commission in so far as the farmer is concerned?  Is he to be prevented from using it for his cattle, horses or sheep in the meantime? If he does use it will it be at his own risk completely though the damage done, and the breach in the fence through which his animals could stray and cause damage on the roadway, was no fault of his?  Is the public to be put to this additional risk as a result of this?</P>
    <P>Would it not be better that the <Col N="667" /> local authority or whatever agency may be responsible, should, in all cases, be responsible for all repairs and that they should be in a position to sue the culprits who cause the damage?  In order that the safety of the motorway should be maintained at all times surely it is more compact, explicit and clear, if one authority is responsible at all times to maintain this roadway, including the fences, in such a manner as to provide the greatest possible safety for the users of that roadway.</P>
    <P>The Minister should look at this matter between now and the next stage, and, perhaps, in conjunction with, or in consultation with, those who are suggesting amendments of various kinds, bring in an amendment that would suitably cover this aspect in a wider manner than was suggested by Deputy Haughey.  If this was done the necessity for other type of amendments, which only tend to confuse, as the Minister seems to think, would disappear.</P>
    <P>This is a horse of an entirely different colour and should be dealt with in a different way.  International practice and experience is a good thing to have as a guide but I believe it should be treated entirely different from what we have been doing since 1925.  Safety on the road, and the usefulness of the new motorways, would be greatly enhanced if a single authority was responsible at all times for the most immediate repairs to fences or boundaries.  That agency should have the right to sue those who cause the damage and recover damages where appropriate through the normal channels, in the courts if necessary.</P>

      <P>It appears that a new concept in law is being suggested by Deputy Blaney, and others, that the State, or the local authority, should be responsible for fencing private property. It is possible we could go at it in that fashion but I do not think everybody would accept that.  However, the situation is that it appears that everybody is not satisfied with the wording of this particular section. <Col N="668" /> For that reason I agree to have a look at it before Report Stage to see if I can get an amendment which might be acceptable, if I think this is entirely necessary.</P>

From much of what he has been saying up to now he has been indicating to the House that the law, as it stands, covers the position which it seems is deemed to be covered again under <Col N="669" /> section 3 except, he says, for that part of subsection (1) of section 3 which relates to the undertaking of landscaping, planting or any similar activity in the interests of amenity and environment.  The Minister says that local authorities did not have that power up to now and that he is writing this into this Bill in order to provide that power to them in the future.  I find that difficult to understand because all of us are aware that from time to time local authorities have spent moneys on this type of work where they have carried out road works.  We have all seen tastefully executed landscaping.  We are entering into the realm of confusion here in relation to what powers local authorities did have up to now and what is new in what we are giving them under this section.</P>
      <P>In considering this question of fencing on the motorways the Minister should also bear in mind a valid point, that the total mileage of motorways which will be constructed in this country over the next 20 or 30 years will be very small in relation to the total mileage of primary roads, national primary, national secondary and main roads.  The actual cost which could arise out of the road authority taking the responsibility for maintaining these fences would never be great.  One of the arguments in favour of motorways is the fact that access to them is controlled.  Because it is controlled there is a much higher degree of safety for those persons travelling in vehicles along that motorway.  The whole point of motorways is this question of control, and the Minister is seeking, in the Bill, strong powers to control these points of access.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am sure the Minister, when he is re-considering this section, will bear in mind that if a breach in the fence takes place, by whatever cause or for whatever reason&mdash;some person, through an accident, may have driven his car off the road and breached the fence&mdash;there is then a new access point on to the motorway created by the misadventure of that person travelling on the motorway.  If the whole validity of <Col N="670" /> the argument in favour of motorways lies in the strength of the law in relation to the control of access, then surely the arguments we have been making are valid and worthy of serious consideration. We feel that provision should be made so as to ensure that when such a new access is made on to a motorway by way of an accident which allows for animals to wander through that access to the motorway thereby reducing the safety factor, the roads authority should be responsible for maintaining the fences along those motorways.</P>

      <P>I do not wish to prolong the argument but every time Deputy Molloy gets up to make arguments like this I wonder if things have changed so much since he, according to himself, prepared this Bill.  The things he sees so clearly now he did not see then, or was it because Deputy Haughey is a little more attentive now?  With regard to the point of access, without going through a fence at all animals can and will go on to motorways.  This is not a good argument.  What we have to decide is a very clear principle and we are not talking about the ten or 15 miles of motorway that will be created-in the next few years.  What we are talking about is motorways that will be based in this country long after all of us have gone from this House.  Is the State being responsible for maintaining all fences along motorways?  If that is what we are saying let us know exactly what we are facing and what is to be the likely cost in the years ahead.  It is on that basis that I will be examining the matter.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>Local authorities had certain duties in respect of areas where road widening was taking place.  For example, it was their duty to ensure that landscaping would be taken into account in certain areas but there was no authority for carrying out this work. Wisely, the Department of Local Government ignored the fact that such authority did not exist and allowed the work to be done.  We are now writing <Col N="671" /> the authority into an Act so that in future the work can be executed without anybody challenging the issue.</P>

      <P>Those provisions are contained in subsection (1) but in so far as subsections (2) and (3) are concerned it seemed from what the Minister said that similar powers existed under the 1925 Act and that he was seeking such powers again in this Act.  I thought he might give some explanation for that.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Molloy is confusing himself but I hope he will not confuse me.  The situation up to now has been that local authorities have had this duty imposed on them by section 1 of the 1925 Act.  They have carried out this responsibility in regard to the repair of fences.  There is nothing to be gained from arguing the fine print of it here.</P>

      <P>Regarding what the Minister said concerning the onerous financial liability that he envisages if the section were to be changed so as to render the State or the local authority responsible for all fencing repairs, and so on, may I put it to the Minister, without recommending it to him, that the local authorities would be held responsible for the earliest possible repair of any breach of any fence?  I stop there for the moment without saying to whom or by whom payment should be made.</P>

    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister indicated that in his reconsideration of the section he would have regard only to one aspect.  Perhaps the Minister would give an undertaking to go a little further.  There are two matters involved here and Deputy Blaney has referred now to a third but the two main items I see involved are, first, the separate question of the fences along motorways, the importance of having these fences maintained adequately and, whether, having regard to the fact that the local authority will have responsibility for managing <Col N="672" /> motorways&mdash;putting up signs and having all sorts of running expenses&mdash;the taking on of the maintenance of the fences would be comparatively negative. That is an aspect that the Minister might consider.  Motorways demand day-to-day positive management by the road authority and in future, perhaps, that would include the fences.  I am putting this forward merely as one aspect of the section which the Minister should reconsider.</P>
      <P>The other aspect concerns roadways in general: whether in his reexamination the Minister is re-declaring the law relating to the powers of road authorities in this regard and whether he should not also re-declare the law on the very specific aspect of the liability of the road authority to repair a fence where they damaged it. The Minister may say that that provision is in the law already but if he is re-declaring the law will he not consider re-declaring also that specific aspect of it?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>Common law will cover that aspect in that the person inflicting the damage is the one responsible for repair or, else, for compensation.</P>

      <P>This sounds like gilding the lily.  Again, regarding the question of fencing, I am sure everybody is aware of the tremendous cost of erecting fences.  Other Members of the House as well as I have commented on the tremendous amount of money which local authorities have spent from time to time on the building of fences for people from whom a negligible amount of land was taken away because of road works.  In some cases very expensive fences have had to be erected before permission to carry out the works concerned could be obtained.  If we go further than that and say that the maintenance forever of all fences, whether good or bad, along a portion of roadway&mdash;all fences will not be new ones since some will already be in existence&mdash; will be the responsibility of local <Col N="673" /> authorities and if we are to put a new fence along every portion of motorway there will be considerable addition to the cost.</P>
      <P>Question put and agreed to.</P>
      <P Just="Center">SECTION 4.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 3:</P>
      <P>Before subsection (2) to insert a new subsection as follows:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;( ) Before making a scheme under subsection (1) a road authority shall have particular regard to the preservation of scenic and natural amenities and to the safeguarding of sports and recreational facilities and agricultural activities and for that purpose shall consult with An Foras Forbartha, Taisce and such other responsible authorities as the road authority considers necessary.</P>
      <P>Whatever about the last two amendments I have no doubt but that this one will commend itself to the favourable attention of the Minister.  My purpose in tabling the amendment is to endeavour to look ahead a little. Section 4 deals with the essence of the new motorway situation.  It provides that the road authority may and, if the Minister directs them to do so, shall make a scheme for the provision of a roadway.  On Second Stage I expressed some fears that I would have in this regard.  Local authorities have their priorities.  Engineers have their professional code of conduct and have their priorities.  There is a great temptation for an engineer to put a roadway straight across the countryside, merely to draw a line between points A and B and say that is the corridor for a new motorway.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As administrators and as people who, perhaps, must take a broader view of the public good, we should lay down some principles along the lines whereby these schemes would be prepared.  I would like to see a solemn duty being placed on the road authority or, if it happens to be the Minister, on the Minister, to have regard to environmental factors.  I would think that in the case of most of these motorways several alternative <Col N="674" /> routes could be considered.  I want to enshrine in this legislation the principle that where possible the minimum interference will arise in regard to scenic beauty and the natural amenities of the countryside. I am quite prepared to accept that my amendment might possibly be improved in the wording.  In fact, I have suggested that An Foras Forbartha and An Taisce be consulted. Other organisations might occur to other Deputies as bodies that might be consulted in this regard.</P>
    <P>I am primarily concerned with the principle that this legislation should be binding for all time on road authorities and Ministers in the future in regard to this matter.  More and more we are conscious of the need to preserve and protect what has come to be known as &ldquo;the quality of life&rdquo;. Here we come up against the whole question of the kind of environment in which we are going to live.  Whether we like it or not, motorways are going to come and we have a solemn obligation to see that in their construction we interfere as little as possible with the amenities and conveniences of all the people, but in particular of those who live in the area that will be traversed by the motorway.</P>
    <P>My amendment would make it mandatory that in preparing a scheme the road authority would endeavour to preserve the scenic and natural amenities, if possible safeguard any sporting or recreational facilities, and have due regard to agricultural aspects.  In other words, that they would interfere to the minimum extent possible with agricultural activities in the area of the motorway. I hope this mandatory principle will be accepted by the House because I think it is necessary.  There would be a great temptation for local authorities and county engineers to take the most direct way, to construct a motorway in a straight line between points A and B.  None of us would have difficulty thinking of the amenities, features and old monuments which, with a little thought, could be protected and preserved even though a motorway has to go through a certain area.  I am sure that in every <Col N="675" /> case there are alternatives, that with a little thought, imagination and foresight amenities could be preserved.</P>
    <P>I thought this might be included in the terms of my amendment.  Perhaps the Minister would consider if my amendment goes far enough to cover the question of re-siting.  In some cases the construction of roadways has been quite barbaric.  They have gone straight through and demolished important monuments and historic buildings.  In other cases some county engineers have done brilliant work where they had to re-site monuments and buildings.  If the terms of my amendment are not broad enough to include some principle in that regard, perhaps the Minister would consider that aspect.  It is important that we place this solemn obligation on the authorities responsible to have regard to the general appearance of the countryside after the motorway has been constructed and, where possible, to preserve the original beauty and the amenities when they are preparing their schemes.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>I would not be prepared to accept this amendment.  While I can see the point behind Deputy Haughey's proposal, at the same time there is a section in the Bill that allows this to be done by whoever is carrying out the work.  For the first time this matter can be dealt with.  An Foras Forbartha and any other body who may be interested would be entitled to give their advice on the matter.  The preservation of scenic and natural amenities are of such high priority that I do not think any attempt would be made to run a motorway through any district without taking account of those matters.</P>
      <P>The road authorities have been given specific powers in this matter in the interests of the community and the environment.  While I can understand Deputy Haughey's point of view&mdash;he made his point on Second Reading&mdash; in the drafting of the Bill care was taken with regard to this matter.  I would ask the Deputy not to press his amendment because I cannot accept it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>What Deputy Haughey has proposed in his amendment is a <Col N="676" /> very necessary part of any new legislation. Whatever may be the view of the Minister, that road authorities are not likely in the future to do these things having regard to public opinion in connection with the preservation of amenities, the best way of ensuring that no damage is caused to the environment is to provide that they must take steps not to breach these matters.  There should be an obligation on them to consult An Foras Forbartha, An Taisce or any other bodies who might be interested.  The obligation to consult these bodies ensures that those who are concerned with the construction of motorways are aware they are not just free agents so far as drawing lines across a map are concerned.</P>
      <P>This poses the question as to whether a multiplicity of road authorities participating in the construction and maintenance of roadways is the proper approach and whether the problems which are likely to arise as a result of this proposed legislation would not melt away if we had a national road authority totally responsible for motorways in the future.  I mention that in passing.  I know it is probably moving away from the section but maintaining the natural scenic value of our countryside, through which new motorways may be driven in the future, is not helped by the fact that we will have participating in the construction of any worthwhile length of motorway several cooks preparing the broth, as it were.</P>
      <P>Probably a great many of our difficulties would be solved to the satisfaction of everybody in the House, and ultimately of everybody outside the House which is more important, if we had one authority doing the job, and responsible for it, and taking the rap for anything about it that was not right.  I am sure the Minister must have considered this.  If we had a national authority operating on behalf of all the road authorities we would have a cleaner job and an operation which would be easier to handle.  I have no doubt from past consideration of this matter, even in a broad sense, that it would be a far more economic proposition.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cunningham</NameTxt>
      <P>This amendment brings to my mind a discussion I had with an engineer on my first and only visit to Bunratty Castle.  He was employed at the time by the local authority.  Bunratty Castle was then a derelict building, practically in ruins.  It was overgrown with trees, bushes and shrubs.  The question of widening and reconstructing the road arose.  The question was whether they should knock down Bunratty or bypass it.  Three or four officials were discussing the matter.  There was nothing in existing legislation to prevent Bunratty Castle being knocked down.  However, after consultation and discussion, they decided to widen the road away from the castle.</P>
      <P>This is an example of where a valuable monument could have been destroyed.  It is not spelled out in any of our road legislation that buildings such as this should be preserved.  This amendment seeks to put it beyond any doubt that buildings like Bunratty Castle, and other more important buildings, should be preserved. If this amendment is accepted no matter what authority or authorities will be dealing with the location of a motorway, they will be bound by legislation passed through this House which will prevent them from doing things that have been done in the past and can be done under present legislation. When we are legislating for this we should spell it out clearly.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>I will explain something later to Deputy Haughey.  The elected members of local authorities are the guardians of these things.  If they do not guard them the responsibility is on them, not on the Planning Act. Many elected representatives may not know what they are entitled to do but, if any elected representative of a local authority allows a road to be erected in his county without having the matter brought to his notice, and discussed if he so wishes, it is his fault. He need not blame the county engineer or the county manager for pulling a fast one on him.  I know of one road which would have divided a very large farm so somebody decided to change it from there and run it through six 15-acre farms.  The little fellows did not count.  The members of the local authority were alive to their responsibilities and they prevented that from happening.</P>
      <P>I disagree with Deputy Blaney on the question of having a national organisation, a national motorway board, or whatever you like to call it. The Department of Local Government have overall control.  The people who can really guard the areas they know well are the elected representatives. I said I would tell Deputy Haughey something.  Where I live there is an old mound which nobody thought very much about.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>We think a lot of Tara. It was an old moate.  Somebody started to dig clay out of the side of it and somebody was down from the National Monuments Commission within hours and a protection notice was put up. I asked why that was not done more generally and I was told it was done only when they were in danger.  If somebody started to knock down Bunratty Castle he would very soon find he could not just walk in and knock it down whether or not it was in the way of widening the road.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>For the first time we are giving certain authority to local authorities to protect this type of thing.  This should be accepted by Deputy Haughey.  I ask him to withdraw his <Col N="679" /> amendment.  I believe he is anxious to put in something which he feels is necessary.  Do not forget that the local authorities and the planning authorities are responsible for planning in their areas.  The onus is on them to guard the things the Deputy is anxious to guard in the Bill.  I think we could safely leave it to them and I would suggest that Deputy Haughey should do so.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Mr. Molloy Mr. Molloy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>I support the motivation behind the amendment which is a serious attempt by Deputy Haughey to humanise parts of this piece of legislation.  The Minister says that the local authorities are the community's safeguard against any over-interference by the road authorities in scenic or other amenities as listed by Deputy Haughey in the amendment.  I should like to ask the Minister if it is not true that under this Bill he is taking the power to supersede the local authority and can make a scheme under this Bill if he is not satisfied with the local authority or if they have failed to comply with a direction from him in regard to the construction of a motorway.  That being so, and these wide powers being taken by the Minister, I fail to see how, in all situations, members of the local authority are the final guarantors for the community that no interference will take place with important amenities.  It is not a bad thing to put a provision such as this into a Bill which obliges officials working on the design and construction of motorways to heed the feelings of people.</P>
      <P>Many people, I am sure, on both sides of the House have expressed the view that we should introduce a more human element into much of our legislation, pay more heed to the views of the community.  I think that was one of the promises made by the Minister's party at the last election, that they would be open and would seek consultation in all matters seriously affecting the community. Such a provision in the Bill would go some way towards fulfilling that part of the promises of the Minister's party.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One can see several instances where <Col N="680" /> a provision like this would be very helpful.  In designing a motorway, as Deputies have said, the engineer will immediately start on the premise that the best way is the shortest way between the two points he has to connect. He will then examine the terrain and see the natural obstacles in his way which he will have to meet in his design.  He will have to tailor the roadway to overcome some of these physical problems.  There will be physical problems which he will not be able to overcome and he will have to design the road to go around them. There could be the temptation to bash on drawing these lines straight through what a local community might consider a very important amenity but which, to the person working in the office in the Custom House or local authority may not seem so important.  When one considers every aspect of the matter one might fairly decide that the engineer was right and that the overall common good would only best be served by putting the road through such a recreational area but at least with this kind of provision the people interested in retaining their playing field or local amenity would have the right to be consulted and their amenity would have had to be considered by the engineer in making a decision.  He would know, if it was so provided here, that he would be faced with having to explain why he wanted to go through it and could not find a way around it.  It is not a world-shaking amendment but it adds that little cushion for the community against the impact of bureaucracy. I suggest the Minister should think again about whether he would allow it to go into the Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Molloy continues to surprise me.  Here, again, having shouted from the house tops about this being his Bill, on the fourth section in succession he finds everything wrong.  In each case he would have the section drafted in another way.  He is trying to have it both ways. I still believe the local planning authority are the people who would know best and would be most interested in protecting amenities. Having given the authority that is <Col N="681" /> given to the previous section, I believe this will be done.  The Minister would only override the local authority in the event of a disagreement between two local authorities or something like that but in the normal way he would sanction a local authority's recommendation.</P>
      <P>I think it was Deputy Blaney who said there could be disagreement. There would not be much disagreement between local authorities because, as was rightly said earlier, the pace at which these motorways would be built will be slow.  They will not be running from one local authority area to another very quickly.  I do not think this problem arises at all. Deputy Haughey has made his point but I think the Bill itself contains sufficient safeguards and I would ask him to leave it as it is.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>I shall make one very special plea to the Minister on this.  This is by far the most important amendment that I have put down and if the Minister would accept it in principle I would, perhaps, be quite happy to withdraw my other amendments. I support fully what Deputy Molloy has said.  I think the Minister is not doing either himself or Deputy Molloy justice in this regard.  I have put a fair amount of legislation through the House in my time and even though I conceived the legislation and directed the drafting of a particular measure, on countless occasions I had need to change it as a result of what I heard in the House. Often, between the time when a Bill went through this House and the Seanad discussions I would change my mind about a particular provision and have regard to what was said about the measure in this House.  Whether Deputy Molloy or anybody else was responsible for the original conception of this Bill does not mean that neither he nor I nor anybody else cannot put forward proposals which we would hope would improve the Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am making a special plea to the Minister to consider this amendment and I want to reinforce it by what Deputy Molloy said.  We in Fianna Fáil, when in Government, had reasonable regard to our community responsibilities <Col N="682" /> and sought, as far as we could, to consider the cultural needs of the people but whatever we could do, this Government certainly held itself out to the people during the election campaign and afterwards as being the Government of enlightenment which would have a whole new approach, particularly to social matters.  Here is an opportunity for them to measure up to that claim.  We are making a very reasonable suggestion that they so frame this piece of legislation for which they will be responsible, as to ensure to the greatest possible extent that the beauty, charm and amenities of the country will be preserved. I do not want the Minister to confine his thinking solely to ancient monuments; some of us on this side may have been responsible for that, but there is much more than monuments and historic buildings involved&mdash; woods, rivers, trees and even, as Deputy Molloy pointed out, agricultural activities.  All we ask is that there should be written into the Bill this directive principle.  We are not placing any financial obligations on local authorities but merely asking them to have regard to the desirability of preserving so far as possible the natural beauty and amenities.</P>
    <P>The Minister should keep in mind that in section 3 he is giving very specific powers to road authorities. In section 3&mdash;and we are all agreed on this&mdash;he is for the first time giving them clear, definite authority to do all things necessary for, or incidental to the construction, maintenance or improvement of public roads.  To my mind that would include knocking down Bunratty Castle or any other castle if the county engineer decided in the interests of road safety that is the way the motorway should go. Having regard to the very strong powers which he is delegating to road authorities in section 3, he should certainly favourably consider including this directive principle in section 4.</P>
    <P>In section 6 the Minister is taking to himself in his official capacity the right, the duty, the obligation to hold public inquiries into matters relating to the scheme.  I submit that it would <Col N="683" /> be a very logical buttress to the concept of the local inquiry to have this subsection in section 4.  It is something which could give very real focus to a local inquiry if the local inquiry concerned itself with whether or not the road authority, in preparing the scheme, had regard to the consideration set out in my amendment.</P>
    <P>The Minister said by way of reply that he did not think my amendment was necessary.  He did not say that it would do any harm to include this principle in the Bill.  He has not pointed to any difficulty which it would cause.  If that is the case, then he must include it.  If he has not argued that it would cause any difficulty or inhibit the local authority in any way and if his only argument is that it is not necessary then he must, as a reasonable man, include it.  I do not ask him to include it in its present form.  Deputy Molloy, Deputy Cunningham and myself, and our colleagues on this side of the House, would be quite satisfied if the Minister would say: &ldquo;I am accepting the principle of the amendment.  I accept that good Government, the sort of good Government to which this wonderful new Coalition is wedded, demands that some sort of directive principle of this sort be enshrined in this particular piece of legislation.&rdquo;  If it is not going to do any harm, if it is not going to cause any serious difficulty in the making of these schemes, then he should accept it.</P>
    <P>We can gain a great deal here from English experience.  The Minister himself has referred to international practice.  I have, over the last three or four years, time and again noticed in the English newspapers instances of where barbaric damage has been done to the beauty of the countryside in England by the way in which roadways have been routed.  I am quite certain that nobody did that deliberately. These things happened because there was no mandatory principle in the legislation which obliged the people concerned to have regard to the sort of considerations which are enshrined in my amendment.</P>
    <P>I make this very special plea to the <Col N="684" /> Minister.  Every Minister coming in here has a certain parental pride in his piece of legislation and is reluctant to admit that it is not as perfect as he thinks it is.  I know, there was nobody more guilty of this particular sin than myself in my day and, therefore, perhaps I am all the more competent to speak from this side of the House.  I would appeal to the Minister to recognise that this will be his piece of legislation.  In the future people will forget how this piece of legislation came into its final shape.  All they will see is a piece of legislation.  I think Deputy Tully, Minister for Local Government, will be able to look back with much greater pride on this Bill if he includes this directive principle in it.</P>

      <P>Deputy Haughey has made a very strong plea.  First of all, he need have no fear.  I will not let Bunratty Castle be knocked down even to widen the road.  The parenthood of this Bill seems to be in doubt. Deputy Molloy had been claiming that it was his until he came here this evening and I realise that he did see most of the heads of the Bill.  Perhaps I have been unfair to him in that he did not see any more than that and that a considerable amount of work was done which he did not see.  We will say no more about that aspect.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>The point I am trying to make is that Deputy Haughey said that every Minister had a pride in his own Bill.  Deputy Molloy has been trying to take responsibility for this Bill since it was introduced and we have had a number of swords crossed over that.  I am now saying that I am aware that Deputy Molloy saw most of the heads of the Bill before it was prepared, full stop, so, therefore, perhaps I am wrong in blaming him for objecting to certain sections as it went along.</P>

      <P>I cannot accept the amendment as it is but if Deputy Haughey will agree to withdraw it, I will have a look to see if I can find some form of words which will fit in to do that, that is, if it will not do harm.  I do not want to write into the Bill something which will create a situation such as we have in regard to certain lanes down the country where six farmers want to repair a lane and the seventh fellow to be awkward will not agree to sign the document.  I do not want to write something in which will mean that discussions and disputes can go on for years when the job should be done.  If there is a danger that this amendment would create such a situation, I cannot include it but if I can write something in which will do what is suggested in a way which will not be objectionable I am prepared to do that.</P>

      <P>I certainly shall not press it to the point of division but I shall make a very brief argument in its favour.  Section 5, as it stands&mdash; in subsection (1) (a) compels or lays down that a scheme by a road authority shall be published in one or more newspapers circulating in the area to which the scheme relates.  In other words, the road authority must put a notice in a newspaper giving notice that the scheme has been initiated under this Act.  It must indicate the times at which, the days on which, and the place where a copy of the scheme and the map referred to therein may be inspected.  That is a very reasonable provision.  The only quarrel I have with it is that it does not go far enough.  This is a very important matter.  This sort of scheme is going to be much more important than anything in the nature of a planning appeal, planning notice or anything of that sort; it is going to be equivalent to a compulsory purchase order. The initiation, the acceptance and the adoption of the scheme will be equivalent to the making of a compulsory purchase order.  From that point of view, the scheme has a very important legal effect and legal implications. It is equivalent to the establishment of a compulsory purchase order in regard to the properties concerned.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>Well, the property owner is specifically notified by letter but the general public would be notified by one advertisement in the paper.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>The general public would be notified by advertisement and also the property owners.  As I understand it &mdash; traditionally in legislation of this sort &mdash; everybody is put on notice.  First of all, general notice by means of public advertisement and, secondly, where one's property is specifically involved, by means of direct personal notice.  From the point of view of the general public I think it is not enough to publish it in a local newspaper in the area concerned. As subsection (1) (a) is at present framed, the road authority would discharge the obligation placed on it simply by putting one notice in one local newspaper.  I suggest to the Minister that that is not enough; <Col N="688" /> it should certainly be published in some national newspaper which is circulated in the area concerned. Many people do not take a local newspaper; whatever about the number of insertions, my amendment predicates putting it on at least three occasions in a newspaper.  But, whatever about the three occasions &mdash; I do not think one is enough; I would strongly urge three occasions&mdash;I certainly do not think it is enough to put it in a local newspaper.  Preferably I think it should be put three times in a national newspaper and the local newspaper.  But, if one must be dropped, then I would certainly drop the local newspaper.  I think it essential that it should be in both.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Haughey should not press this one.  I think he went a little bit off beam.  I do not agree for one moment that in a country district, if something appears in a local newspaper affecting themselves or their neighbours which is unknown to them &mdash; it is, of course, true that national newspapers may not find their way into many houses in country districts; we are dealing mainly with motorways in country districts&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>You could have a person living in Dublin or in a city who has a vital interest in a particular area and the local newspapers&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>Well, the interest would not be terribly vital if they were not aware of the fact that something was happening there.  What has been the practice, in both the Housing Act and the Planning Act, is introduced in this Act.  I think it unreasonable that Deputy Haughey should suggest that there should be a difference in this case and establish a whole new precedent. I am sorry; I cannot accept it; I do not think it is reasonable.  With regard to the question of the owner of the property, he is notified by post. We are talking about the neighbours who might be interested one way or the other.  Perhaps if a motorway runs fairly close to their land, they may have a complaint.  But, in this particular subsection, this amendment is dealing with those who would not be <Col N="689" /> directly affected but who might be interested parties because they lived in the district.  The notice in the local newspaper is the precedent which has been handed down here.  I do not propose to change that precedent.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Mr. Molloy Mr. Molloy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister has suggested that because this contravenes the common practice it should not be pressed.  The Minister will be aware that the law relating to the publishing of notices &mdash; where persons are applying for planning permission &mdash; has met with some criticism.  I suppose it is always difficult to find the perfect system. People seem to be very adept at finding ways in which they can circumvent things to their own advantage, such as publishing a notice in Irish at the bottom of a page in <i>The Irish Times</i> for a site in Connemara where very few people read <i>The Irish Times</i>, although, I must say, the readership is growing down there.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It does give us an opportunity to talk about the difficulties in this type of thing.  A lot of people will be concerned to know about the proposal in addition to those who are owners and who will, of course, be consulted directly or served with a notice direct, as is stated in subsection (1) <i>(b)</i> of section 5.  There could be some merit in improving the practice as laid down in the Planning Act, and other Acts in relation to the publication of public notices.  If they are obliged to publish once only, would the Minister consider changing the law there and asking them to publish twice?  I think it would be difficult for the Minister to accept <i>in toto</i> the amendment as put down by Deputy Haughey; it would certainly be a bonanza for the national newspapers who guaranteed two repeats of special advertisements. Their rates, of course, are high and it might involve quite an amount of money, over a period of a year, which might not be spent to the very best advantage.  But once in the local newspaper might not in itself be adequate.  There are hundreds of people who could be interested in this development other than those whose houses are involved.  We have already elaborated on the Second Stage about <Col N="690" /> the disturbance to house owners caused by the proximity of motorways, the continuous traffic and noise thus created; the discomfort from excessive exhaust fumes emitting into the air and the many other disadvantages of roads being in close proximity to residential areas.  Obviously, many residents would be anxious to know if a motorway was going their way; persons with land and houses whose amenity would be seriously interfered with should be given adequate notice of the road authorities intention in relation to the line which they hoped to take with these new motorways.</P>
    <P>Although Deputy Haughey's amendment might be going too far, would the Minister not consider that two publications might be a compromise and an improvement in the situation to the benefit of all concerned?  We are anxious to ensure that full and proper notice be given to anybody who might be affected.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LiamCunningham" hpid="Mr. Cunningham Mr. Cunningham">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cunningham</NameTxt>
      <P>An improvement should be made in the proposed legislation which gives the local authority the option of publishing a notice once only.  I agree with Deputy Molloy when he says that three times in national and local papers might be too much.  The Minister would be wise to improve the Bill along the lines of &ldquo;more than once&rdquo;.  It would then be left to the discretion of the local authorities whether they would publish the notice three times or, indeed, more often.  Each individual case, depending on its location, is different from the other.  I suggest that the Minister accept &ldquo;more than once&rdquo; and then leave any further number to the local authority.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">

It also says &ldquo;publish in one or more newspapers circulating in the area to which the scheme relates....&rdquo;  We are all talking about local papers.  It was felt by some local authorities that the national paper is a better medium to deal with these plans.  Section 6 also provides for public inquiries.  How could anybody suggest that all these <Col N="691" /> things could happen and somebody could be left out and not know?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>We never introduced legislation dealing with motorways. Has the Minister any idea of the mental anguish and upset caused in cities in other parts of the world where local authorities were proceeding with the acquisition of land for motorways?  I resided in a country where this happened.  The debate that ensued was fierce and the feelings of the people in whose area the motorway was planned ran high.  As we know from our history nothing excites the emotions of our people as much as land.  In these cities nothing excited the emotions of the people as much as interference with the amenities they enjoyed through the acquisition of vast tracts of residential and commercial areas going through city centres.  Anything connected with interference in the ordinary enjoyment of life and environment is a very serious matter.  In future years when such legislation is being implemented and people are fighting it, as indeed they will, we on all sides of the House will expect that the decision in the end will be the one best suited to the common interest of all.  There will be those who feel that they are being seriously affected. Anything suggested to ensure that adequate notice is given to the community and everybody is fully aware that it is proposed to do these things and are allowed time to prepare their case for the hearing is praiseworthy. The Minister feels that because an existing practice has been passed down through various Acts there is no need to change and he is not prepared to create a precedent.  That is his entitlement. If the Minister is satisfied that the existing practice is perfect, is the most suitable and will meet the needs which will arise in this type of case, then he need not accept the amendment. <Col N="693" /> I suggest that it is a good amendment and would be an improvement.

      <P>The trouble is that if we do what the Deputy is suggesting a roadway could be held up forever. There must be some way in which a decision can be taken so that a local authority can legally go forward.  In the compulsory purchase order regulations this is the situation and the position regarding dispensation with notice must be retained in accordance with the usual practice which maintain <Col N="695" /> in relation to compulsory purchase. It must be retained because it is necessary in the same way as it is in compulsory purchase orders.</P>
      <P>If this is taken out and somebody turns up 20 years afterwards the local authority would be liable.  If it is acceptable in compulsory purchase orders is there any reason why it should not be acceptable now in view of the fact that this is the same type of legislation?</P>

In one regard the Minister dispenses with the requirement to serve notice at all and the other situation is that even though the notice was issued the person did not get it.  Surely it would be sufficient, from the Minister's point of view, if he stipulated that provided the notice was duly issued in accordance with the provisions of the section then non-receipt of the notice would not invalidate the proceedings.</P>

The Minister must be satisfied that (1) reasonable grounds exist for the dispensing of the service of the notice and (2) that the dispensing of the service of the notice will not cause injury or damage to any person.

      <P>I move amendment No. 9:</P>
      <P>In subsection (4), page 4, line 42, to delete &ldquo;the only&rdquo; and substitute &ldquo;a&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>Subsection (4) envisages a situation in which the owner of land has only one means of access to any public roadway from his land but is deprived of that one means of access.  The section provides that the road authority cannot deprive him of that only means of access unless and until they provide an alternative means of access.  That is not going far enough.  If the owner of land is deprived of any means of access to a public roadway he should be provided with an alternative means of access.  As the section is framed, it is only in a case where he had merely one means of access that the road authority would have to provide him with an alternative.  That could give rise to severe injustices.  There could be a situation where, because of the location of a particular farm, there would be means of access to two different public roads both of which would represent very considerable convenience to the farmer in that one means of access would be to a public road in one direction and the other to a public road in another direction although in the second case the means of access might not be nearly as important as the first.  Therefore, it is my view that a farmer should be compensated in any case where he is deprived of any means of access to a public road.  There should be an obligation on the road authority to provide him with an alternative.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Haughey has made his point but I would refer him back to the comments made on an earlier amendment.  We are talking here about motorways.  What the Deputy is saying is that for every door that is closed another should be opened.  That is not reasonable if we are talking about a motorway.  It may be possible that the farmer would not want the additional access provided. Indeed there may be compensation granted for the closing of other means of access.  There is no point in <Col N="698" /> talking of a motorway if there is to be an exit from every field of every farm.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>

If the farmer concerned were to avail of one of these exits in order to get to the city of Dublin he would be involved in an extra 30 miles travel.  As the section is framed, the road authority could close the most important of his means of access and there would be no obligation on them to provide an alternative because the farmer would still have a means of access to a public road.</P>

      <P>There could be a very small and relatively unimportant access at one end of the farm and merely because that was the means of access that was not interfered with the farmer would not be entitled to be provided with an alternative means of access to the access that would be closed and, consequently, much hardship might be caused him.  The purpose of my amendment is to endeavour to ensure that for every means of access to a public road that is closed an alternative would be provided but not on to a motorway.</P>

      <P>This, again is the result of the drafting which uses the words &ldquo;public roads&rdquo;.  However, the Bill is designed to deal with the question of motorways but a certain amount of confusion is being caused by the phraseology.  It is as a result of an inquiry that the Minister may decide whether there should be more than <Col N="699" /> one public access.  If Deputy Haughey succeeds in having his amendments accepted, the result would be that there would be means of access from many fields on to motorways.</P>

    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister misunderstands my point.  Subsection (4) is specific.  It deals undoubtedly with the construction of motorways but refers to access to public roads.  It deals with a situation where, in the construction of a motorway, the access by a farmer to a public road is interfered with.  If that were the only means of access to a public road, the road authority must provide an alternative. I am concerned in relation to a situation that could arise whereby a relatively unimportant and inconvenient means of access from a farm to a public road would be interfered with.  As the section stands, the farmer would be provided with no alternative but would be relegated to using the remote and inconvenient means of access to the public road. Where any means of access to a public road is blocked or stopped, the road authority should, in all fairness and justice, provide an alternative to that means of access.  In other words, if a farmer has two means of access, he should continue to have two means of access.  I am sure that any farmer here would agree with me.</P>

I have no wish to have legislation enacted that would interfere with existing means of access to roads other than motorways but we cannot make provision whereby a farmer who loses one means of access is entitled to be provided with another, whatever may <Col N="700" /> have been the nature of the original one.  Subsection (4) reads:</P>
      <P>In any case where the closing, stopping up, removing, altering or diverting of any means of access pursuant to subsection (3) of this section results in the owner of any land being deprived of the only means of access from that land to any public road....</P>

That applies to all public roads, including motorways.

In one instance the county council raised the road outside a house and the main entrance was taken away.  As a consequence the man had to take a sharp turn at the entrance because the road was elevated at that point.  There was a disagreement between himself and the council officials.  The argument is still proceeding but I consider that if a system of arbitration were available the matter could be dealt with.

On the other hand, he is entitled to have the alternative means of access provided because a means of access was taken away from him.  The two matters should stand separately and should not be confused in the assessing of compensation. The assessing of compensation should be directed specifically towards whatever damage, loss or inconvenience the farmer or landowner has suffered without regard to the provision of a new means of access.</P>

      <P>Not necessarily. That might have been taken away.  It seems to me that there are two separate considerations involved.  One is the obligation to provide an alternative means of access and the other is to compensate him for being, as the section says, &ldquo;disturbed in his enjoyment&rdquo;. There is compensation for disturbance and compensation for inconvenience and compensation for loss on the one hand and, on the other hand, there is the obligation to provide an alternative means of access.  It seems to me that there are two completely separate aspects, that they should be regarded separately and that the provision <Col N="705" /> in the first two lines on page five confuses the issue and could lead to a person being very badly treated.</P>

      <P>We have a situation where somebody has a means of access and for some reason&mdash;perhaps because something is to be put there&mdash;it is decided that it cannot be left there. Therefore another means of access will be provided.  Will Deputy Haughey explain to me in what way there would be a substantial loss to the farmer because we had to move ten, 20, 30 or even 50 yards up the road?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cunningham</NameTxt>
      <P>It all depends on what the Minister means by &ldquo;means of access&rdquo;.  Does it mean an entrance?  Suppose a farmer has to forego an entrance plus an avenue which is tarmacadamed.  This entrance plus the roadway or laneway or avenue is closed up to provide for a motorway.  Something equally as good must be provided.  Will the local authority provide a gateway and a tarmacadamed avenue to the house? Will they do all that and, taking it a step further, will they compensate the person for having to abandon an area of land which was tarmacadamed and which it is impossible to reclaim as agricultural land?</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>The Opposition completely misunderstand the section.  It says:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Provided that in assessing compensation regard shall be had <Col N="706" /> to any new means of access provided by the road authority.</P>
    <P>It does not say that if a new means of access is provided no compensation will be paid.  What it reasonably says is that if a new means of access is provided regard must be had to that in finding out what compensation, if any, is due for the closing up of the old way.  That is fair.  There is nothing at all wrong with that.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>

      <P>I can visualise Deputy Tully as a county councillor in Meath fighting very hard and very fiercely on behalf of a constituent who was disturbed by one of these motorways going through his farm.  I can see him arguing very strongly that the fact that his means of access to his farm had been changed resulted in serious disturbance for which he was entitled to be fully compensated&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>&mdash;&mdash;and at the same time that the man was entitled to be provided with an alternative means of access.  Would the Minister see <Col N="707" /> the matter outside this aura of office in which he is now immersed and consider that we are arguing in the main for the ordinary small farmer? There are two situations.  In one case the alternative means of access is provided by the road authority in accordance with the provisions of this Bill.  Fair and just.  Once that has happened a new situation prevails and the assessor is asked to decide to what extent this man is entitled to compensation because of this change which has taken place.  It seems to me that there are two entirely separate circumstances and separate considerations.  It is wrong to mix them up together the way these two lines in the section propose to do.  I think the Parliamentary Secretary agrees with me.</P>

      <P>Deputy Haughey knows quite well that when he was on this side of the House he was very good at making arguments as to why amendments could not be conceded under any circumstances.  I have not adopted that attitude.  I have been reasonable with him on his amendments to the Bill.  He is arguing something which is absolutely ludicrous. He is saying that if somebody gets a new means of access which is paid for by the road authority, this should be completely ignored when compensation is being assessed, if compensation is claimed.  I do not think he would do that himself.  If he were on this side of the House he would not agree to it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnGrattanEsmonde" hpid="Mr. Esmonde Mr. Esmonde">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Esmonde</NameTxt>
      <P>In actual fact by being put into this section this proviso safeguards the landowner.  As section 6 is drafted if we had not got the <Col N="708" /> proviso it might mean that where an entrance was put in which was not as good as the one which was there before&mdash;like the case mentioned about the avenue&mdash;a person might be precluded from obtaining compensation to make up the difference.  Prior to this the position was that where compensation was being assessed under the Acquisition of Land Act, which is dealt with in the next subsection, if an arbitrator directed remedial work to be done the award could be set aside.  There is a case actually on record in the High Court where an ex-President, Mr. Justice Davitt, set aside an award of Colonel Winters, who was then the official arbitrator, on this very point.  I suggest that, in fact, this is in ease of the person whose lands are being acquired because it uses only the words &ldquo;shall have regard&rdquo;.  That means it may be in ease of the amount of compensation. You take the whole global picture, as any arbitrator must do on the acquisition of lands and this provides that the fact that an entrance is built does not preclude the claimant from getting compensation even for that entrance if it is not up to standard. If that proviso was not there it could be interpreted that any claim under that heading was precluded.</P>
      <P>I am talking about case law and my experience of dealing with these matters and arguing these cases before the official arbitrator.  That is why I was very glad to see that and it is why I was a bit perturbed to see that Opposition Deputies think it should be removed.  I should much prefer to see it there if I were acting for a farmer.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not agree with Deputy Esmonde on that.  The Minister is not being reasonable with me. I am not seeking benefit for myself as a parliamentarian.  I am trying to see that we in this House protect the rights and interests of many small farmers who will in future be affected by this legislation.  We must try to lay down fair and just principles by which they would be compensated for the disturbance which these motorways will cause to them.  The fact that a motorway comes along causes serious <Col N="709" /> dislocation to a man's farming activity.  In many cases it will seriously interfere with farms that have been in the same family for generations. The farmer involved is entitled to be compensated for that disturbance and distress arising from the fact that the farm which he now farms, as did his father before him, has been seriously interfered with as a farm.  He is also entitled, if one means of access is taken away from him, to be provided with an alternative.</P>
      <P>My simple appeal to the Minister is not to confuse these two things and to admit that a farmer is entitled to an alternative access to the public road if one means of access is denied him and, on the other hand, is entitled to be compensated in a fair and just way for the disturbance this change causes him.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>There are a couple of arguments to be made against what the Deputy said.  First, when amendment No. 3 was being discussed Deputy Haughey said that was the important one which he really wanted and as far as the others were concerned he could withdraw them straight away.  Now, this is so important that we have been arguing about it for 25 minutes.  I am not prepared to accept the amendment.  Deputy Esmonde says that, if anything, it strengthens the claim of the farmer. It says that (a) he is entitled to claim compensation and (b) that when such compensation is being claimed he must have a complete account of what money was spent under the new circumstances.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">

It is no use having a <Col N="710" /> provision under which a small farmer would have to take the State or a local authority to court.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 13:</P>
      <P>In subsection (6), page 5, to delete all words from and including &ldquo;but&rdquo; in line 7 down to the end of the subsection.</P>
      <P>This amendment is put down because the existing wording of subsection (6) causes me very serious disquiet.  I should like to hear from the Minister what is the reasoning behind the insertion of these words &ldquo;but subject to the proviso that the arbitrator shall have jurisdiction to make a nil award&rdquo; I find it difficult to see the reasoning behind the insertion of those words.  It seems to be tantamount to an encouragement to an arbitrator to make a nil award.  I should have thought that the power to award nothing or one-farthing or substantial damages is entirely within the competence of an arbitrator in the normal way and that there is no need to encourage him in this way to make a nil award.</P>

I am repeating what is in the housing code and Deputy Molloy must be aware of this.  This is in the existing housing code and, therefore, if a farmer gets a new access the arbitrator will be asked to judge if there is a claim for compensation; he can give a cash award or he can say that the new access is sufficient and give a nil award.  If it was not necessary it would not have been provided for.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cunningham</NameTxt>
      <P>What the Minister said deals with planning.  It deals <Col N="716" /> with the abolition of planning permission granted for the purpose of allowing a motorway or motorways to be constructed.  I asked some questions and the Minister accused me of running away and not waiting for the answers.  I did not know when the Minister was going to reply.  He accused me of a number of things.  He has admitted in reply to my question on section 7 that this motorway is planned, delineated and the extensions from it known, mapped by Dublin County Council.  I was in the position that a certain planning appeal came before me.  I studied it.  I went into it fairly thoroughly because there was an industry involved in whatever decision I might take.  Dublin County Council refused planning permission for the construction of this project for a number of reasons.  It would create a traffic hazard being in close proximity to the proposed new road, the one to which section 7 relates.  It was also in close proximity to the existing road and it was on the site of a connecting road.  The advice I got, which corresponded with the advice of the local authority, was that it was going to be expensive to reroute the road. The Minister accused me of sitting on it and doing nothing about it.  This is not true.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">

    <Speaker pid="LiamCunningham" hpid="Mr. Cunningham Mr. Cunningham">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cunningham</NameTxt>
      <P>It was always possible, and I am not quite sure whether it was conveyed to the person involved, that a temporary permission might be granted.  But while there was no decision, while the order which was there, put before me for signature, was for an absolute, outright refusal, I was amazed and surprised to find that the Minister granted full planning permission.  He says, in reply, that Dublin County Council and the road section of the Department agreed that the location, the route of the road could be changed at no extra cost to the ratepayers, even at a saving to the ratepayers.</P>

      <P>Section 8.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Mr. Molloy Mr. Molloy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>Section 8, subsection (3) reads:</P>
      <P>Where a scheme is made by a road authority under section 4 of this Act, the planning authority for the area to which the scheme relates shall serve notice on all persons who have been granted planning permission for development (which has not been commenced or has not been completed) on any land affected by the scheme.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I wonder if the Minister would care to elaborate to the House how it is to <Col N="720" /> be determined whether or not a development has commenced.  I can visualise able barristers arguing as to whether or not a matter had commenced at a certain time or date. Does he intend at any stage introducing some new method which would determine exactly when a development had commenced and, under this measure then, that they would be free from the provisions of this section which, of course, allow the Minister to suspend or abolish planning permissions which have already been granted?  One can see that there could be a lot of argument about this commencement date.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>A little over 12 months ago Deputy Molloy introduced a very good provision&mdash;the question of the value of houses for sale.  He introduced a very good provision in February last which was that, on four houses or more, there had to be a certificate of valuation received&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Mr. Molloy Mr. Molloy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;and I specified exactly what the commencement was.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes.  The commencement date was in February.  The result was that the spec builders went out all over the place and put in foundations, literally hundreds, some say thousands, of them.  The reflection of it is in the number of houses which were supposed to have been started at a certain period last year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Mr. Molloy Mr. Molloy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>I would not like to see the same thing happening again.  I hope to be able, by order, to make an arrangement which will say when work commences.  It will be a question of fact; either work has commenced or not.  I am sure Deputy Molloy will appreciate that if a builder goes into a field putting in foundations that does not mean that work has commenced if he is prepared to leave it there and abandon it.  I assume that, unless there is substantial work done, it will be accepted that work has not commenced.  This is something which <Col N="721" /> has got to be tightened up.  It is not really a part of the Bill.  I quite agree that it is an important thing to be sure that we know exactly what we are doing when the Bill is to be put into operation.  I can assure the Deputy that this will be looked after to ensure that the proper regulation will be made.  It will be a question of fact and the whole thing will be to decide when does work commence.  This is something we have got to ensure.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Mr. Molloy Mr. Molloy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>In other words, the Minister is informing the House that he intends introducing an order, when the Bill becomes an Act, which will specify, in sufficiently elaborate terms, and allow a reasonable person to decide whether or not a development has commenced.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cunningham</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister, by order, may prevent development by revoking a planning permission at the appropriate time.  There are many exempted developments which do not require planning permission.  There could be a situation in which the Minister would, because of his powers under this section, revoke planning permission.  At the same time, there could be a neighbouring farmer who would be in the process of erecting farm buildings which are exempt from planning permission.  He could proceed with his building.  In the other case, proceeding with the development would be negatived by an exemption order.  Did the Minister provide for cases where exemptions from the Planning Acts existed?</P>

      <P>Deputy Cunningham suggested that the Act will give authority to have planning permission revoked for the purpose of creating a motorway and that there should be some special power in respect of people who have not got planning permission and as the Deputy said, do not require planning permission whereby it will not be possible to put motorways through their land because they do not need planning permission.  I want to make this clear before a motorway is built there will be a public inquiry. It will be a lengthy job I am sure.  It will be some considerable time before <Col N="723" /> work can start.  A person knowing there is an inquiry and the prospect of a motorway running through part of his land who deliberately builds and ignores the fact that the motorway is likely to affect it will not be entitled to compensation.  He will be author of his own misfortune.  Clearer than that I cannot go.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>Until motorways are built motor vehicles must travel on the national primary roads when travelling between the major centres of population.  If this principle is deemed to be good when a motorway is in existence, in other words, if it is wrong to allow numerous accesses to a motorway because, as the Minister says, it would reduce its efficiency and safety factors, then surely that same principle must apply to the roads which are performing the functions of motorways at the present time, namely, national primary roads.  Why is it that the Minister, on the one hand, stated that it was all right for the local authorities, for him and for his Parliamentary Secretary, when deciding planning appeals, to allow new accesses to be created to the national primary roads?  There is no harm being done there.  Yet the Minister subscribes correctly to the theory that they are harmful to the creation of motorways.  He knows that they are also harmful to national primary roads.  He has relaxed the planning law and, therefore, reduced the safety factor on our roads.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>I am delighted the Deputy raised this point because it gives me an opportunity of making an interesting comment.  Motorways are different from national primary roads. Motorways have different speeds, only certain types of vehicles are allowed use them and there are many other rules which do not apply to national primary roads.  The Parliamentary Secretary and I will give, in certain circumstances, authority to build houses on national primary roads where there <Col N="725" /> are lay-bys, or where turns have been taken out.</P>
      <P>Deputy Molloy should remember that I am now in the Custom House and the files are available to me.  I do not mind who sees the files when I go.  I will stand over every decision I give.  I will stand over every decision which my Parliamentary Secretary will give.  There is no question of hiding anything.  If Deputy Molloy wishes to raise matters like this on the Bill, then he must take the reply. The 13th of March was his last day in office.  It was on the 13th of March that he gave permission for the erection of a house and a hatchery on a national primary road near Limerick and they were not justified.</P>

      <P>The Minister has not answered my point.  I hope he will clarify a statement which issued from the Government Information Service and which was projected in the newspapers as meaning that from that point forward the Minister and his Parliamentary Secretary were prepared to grant planning permission creating new accesses to national primary roads.  That was a major change in policy.</P>
      <P>I do not remember the details of the two cases on the 13th March. The Minister says he has the files so I would have to ask him to show them to me before I would be satisfied. The Minister should accept this.  As far as I, and my Parliamentary Secretary, were concerned we were very conscious of the necessity to maintain that principle, and it was largely maintained.  If there was one, two, three or four over a period of three or four years the Minister will find that that principle was applied fairly, and fairly strictly as well.  I was surprised that he should deem that this was an area in which he should change policy.  Many people were concerned that the Minister made that statement encouraging persons to apply, encouraging local authorities to grant permission and, in consequence, increase the number of accesses on national primaries thereby reducing the safety factor and efficiency of such roads.</P>

It is clear that the intention is that there should not be any animals on the motorways but I am wondering if the wording is effective enough. First, it does not make any reference to the ownership of the animals.  It simply says that persons in charge of, or having control over, animals shall not permit them to be on the motorway. I am putting the point forward for consideration by the Minister.</P>

If it stated &ldquo;owners of animals&rdquo; then the owners would be entitled to allow somebody else to go out on the motorways with the animals.  The persons in charge of the animals can be pinned down.  &ldquo;Having control over&rdquo;, we assume, means either the person driving the animals, <Col N="729" /> the person leading them, or the owner.

      <P>I move amendment No. 14:</P>
      <P>Before section 10 to insert a new section as follows:</P>
      <P>Where by reason of the construction of a motorway or by any other action taken in relation thereto either by a road authority or the Minister a farmer is deprived of ready access from one portion of his farm to another the road authority or the Minister (as the case may be) shall provide an underpass or other suitable form of access for the farmer concerned.</P>
      <P>I am concerned here with the situation which can be multiplied throughout the country where we will have cases of motorways going through the middle of farms.  Most farms consist of a unit with, in the centre, a farmhouse and farm buildings.  We will have many situations where the motorway will cut off portions, in some cases substantial portions, of a farm from the centre of that farm.  In such cases it will be necessary for the farmer almost daily to take animals from one part of his farm to another. In the new situation which will develop in many cases he will have to take his animals across the road or motorway.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I can see this causing serious hardship and disruption in the case of many farmers and I want to know from the Minister if he has adverted to this type of situation and if he can foresee difficulties arising in any cases. Would the Minister not be prepared to consider the suggestion I am putting forward in this amendment?  I am suggesting that where a motorway or, indeed, any other action taken by a road authority in regard to a motorway, deprives a farmer of ready access to portion of his farm, there should be an obligation on the road authority <Col N="730" /> to provide some means of access from one section of the farm to the other.</P>

      <P>When we adjourned last evening I was half way through my exposition, as it were, on family law reform.  I had pointed out to the Minister the urgency of reforms in a number of areas in that sphere. We, on this side of the House, would ask the Minister to codify the legislation relating to family law but we understand that this cannot be done overnight.  Basically, my call to the Minister last evening was to deal with those areas which, obviously, are out of date.  In his speech the Minister dealt with areas which are of concern to him.  These areas are of concern to us also.  The Minister's contribution in introducing his Estimate was entitled <i>Law Reform Programme</i>.  He has indicated clearly that there is an informal committee for the purpose of considering law reform and that this committee consists of himself, as Minister, of the Attorney General, Mr. Justice Brian Walsh, of the Supreme Court and an Assistant Secretary of the Department. The purpose of this committee, the Minister told us, is to examine areas in which reform of the law, both criminal and civil, is needed urgently and we are told that it is the intention to establish working groups to examine particular aspects of the law and that these will concentrate at the outset on matters that are of a social as well as of a legal nature.</P>
      <P>The Minister is aware of the very many reports that have been prepared by groups who, on a voluntary basis, have interested themselves in the area of family law reform.  One wonders at the absolute necessity of the committee to examine areas in which family reform is needed since there have been a considerable number of reports already setting out these areas and indicating the hardships that are being caused by the existing law.  In these reports there are conclusions on which the Government of the day are urged to take action.  However, I have no wish to criticise the informal committee. No doubt they have other contributions to make.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have before me a report that was <Col N="732" /> prepared by the CARE group which is entitled &ldquo;The CARE Memorandum On Deprived Children and Children's Services in Ireland&rdquo;. That is a conclusive report and indicates clearly the areas in which law reform is needed urgently.  I expect it will be before the informal committee of which the Minister has told us.</P>
    <P>At the AIM seminar held in the Burlington Hotel a few weeks ago, the Minister, in his address to the group, set out the anomalies that exist in the area of family law and he pointed out matters which are of prime concern to him.  It is our hope that an informal committee, or any other committee, is not being set up in an effort to put off the day of reform.  We would like to see an earnest of the Minister's intention and trust that reforms will be before the House very soon.</P>
    <P>We pointed out the areas in relation to family law reform which can be dealt with in the national sense. In relation to wives we pointed out that the matter of maintenance could be dealt with, if not immediately, in the near future.  If a court makes an order whereby a wife is entitled to receive, say, £15 and £5 for each child, there may be difficulty in obtaining the money from the husband although he may be in gainful employment.  Our suggestion of attaching the salary of the husband has been taken up by the Minister. What we mean by &ldquo;attaching&rdquo; the husband's salary is that the court, through the due process of the law, sends to the employer a document indicating that a certain amount of money should be deducted from the employee's salary on foot of the court order.  This is a reasonable and proper approach to the enforcement of court orders and we suggest, respectfully, that that would not be too difficult.  The Minister has available to him the advantage of a Department in relation to these matters.  I respect whatever information he may have and I appreciate the difficulties there are in relation to the areas in which I am now calling <Col N="733" /> for reform.  With regard to the attaching of husband's salaries, there may be difficulties of which I have no special knowledge but I am sure that the Minister will tease out any such difficulties that may exist.  With regard to matrimonial courts, Fianna Fáil favour the setting up of a family tribunal composed of one judge, aided by two suitably qualified lay assessors who would deal with all family problems, with the exception of juvenile matters which would be dealt with by the new juvenile courts. The court would have a reconciliatory function and the opportunity of referring the parties to a family welfare council.  Again, the procedures before the court would be simple; the aim would be to provide speedy and inexpensive relief for the parties resorting to it.</P>
    <P>As spokesman on Justice, I referred to the question of free legal aid for needy litigants.  This should be available. I pointed out at some length the anomalies in the law with regard to women which should be abolished, among which is the criminal conversation action.  I would ask the Minister to clarify these matters.  When one's speech is interrupted by the adjournment it is difficult to preserve continuity and if I am repeating myself I apologise to the House and to the Minister.  We ask the Minister to clarify the position in relation to divorces obtained in England and we ask him to abolish the wife's domicile of dependence.</P>
    <P>We have pointed out also, the urgent priority that exists with regard to law reform for children.  We are concerned about the present juvenile court and we suggested it should be abolished and replaced by a new court where a district justice would sit with two lay assessors.  The main function of the court would be to advise on the treatment of young offenders. The court would have a continuing interest in and responsibility for those whom they send for treatment or sentence and regular conferences to review cases would take place.  We suggested a social report on a child's background and, as in the matrimonial <Col N="734" /> court, we suggested that procedure should be kept as simple as possible without undue emphasis on rules of evidence.  I do not have to spell that out in great detail.  We do not suggest the rules of evidence should be abandoned or should be made elastic.  We have to operate within the rules of evidence and this is quite right, but it is fair to point out that one can deal fairly with individuals without being absolutely emphatic about the application of those rules.</P>
    <P>I have a motion down to the Minister in Private Members' time&mdash;whenever that may arise&mdash;and I shall deal in detail then with the Children's Act, 1908.  We say it is urgently in need of updating and I think the Minister agrees with this, principally to allow the compulsory orders to be made to meet the needs of children under 17 years for security, guidance, care and protection.  We can take pride in the Scoil Ard Mhuire which was recently opened and which represents a great advance in the care of deprived children. More such schools and additional assessment centres are urgently needed.</P>
    <P>With regard to the age of criminal responsibility, we consider this should be raised from seven years to 12 or even 14 years.  We are supported in our proposition by the report of the committee established by the Bar Council on the inadequacy of legal representation in children's courts. The report is contained in <i>The Irish Law Times</i> dated 9th February, 1974 where it is stated:</P>
    <P>As stated in the Kennedy Report (paragraph 10.4) the age of criminal responsibility has been increased to 12 years in England&mdash;</P>
    <P>I do not think it should be increased to 12 years here just because it has been increased in England and I hope I am not being chauvinistic about it&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <P>&mdash;and is still higher in other European countries and the Report recommended the adoption of the age of twelve years in this country and that all children under this age who have committed offences should <Col N="735" /> be brought before the court as in need of care, discipline or control.</P>
    <P>The committee state they support this recommendation and they point out that under the present law a child between the age of seven to 15 years has the benefit of the presumption of <i>doli incapax</i> and that the prosecution is required in such cases to establish knowledge of the wrongfulness of the act.  It is fair to say that in practice very little attention is paid to this requirement.  The committee recommend that until the law is amended in the way they suggested the Minister should direct the Garda authorities as to their obligations in the case of children under the age of 15 years.  I know the Garda authorities are well aware of their obligations to all citizens regardless of age, but sometimes a gentle reminder is no harm.</P>
    <P>In the report of the committee, at paragraph 10 dealing with reform of the legal system there is an interesting observation by Dr. Paul McQuaid in the summer 1971 issue of <i>Studies</i> where he stated:</P>
    <P>The law, the law courts, &ldquo;due process&rdquo;, the whole atmosphere of retribution and atonement and, on the other hand, problems and needs of the individual anti-social or deprived child, are so obviously conflicting and, in their effect on the child, so destructively useless, that it is clear to those who work within or in conjunction with the juridical system&mdash;even if not to all of them &mdash;that a major change in the law, as it obtains in respect of children, is urgently required.  The majority of juvenile crimes are admitted to and there is rarely any problem in assigning guilt, though proof may not be available.  Preoccupation with assignment of guilt tends to obscure the fact that a delinquent act, i.e., one that brings the child to court, is often the last in a long series of anti-social deviations, or is a signal to society of a disturbed child, from a family already known to social work agencies, that help is urgently required.</P>
    <P>Models for real change and improvement in the &ldquo;system&rdquo; concerned <Col N="736" /> with the detection and control of anti-socially disorganised children and their families, and with the application of remedies, are available from abroad and, particularly, in the recent Social Work Act of Scotland (1968). This legislates for children's panels containing judges and professionally qualified people who consider the problem child and his family in the light of carefully and professionally prepared reports.</P>
    <P>That seems to be a reasonable exposition of the problems which now confront the Minister in relation to family law reform relating to children.</P>
    <P>I am sure the Minister will receive an invitation from the CARE group to a weekend seminar in March, I think, to consider the way the Scots deal with children in the context of family law reform.  Subject to correction I think the Social Work Act of Scotland, 1968, will be considered. This is a private-type seminar and the Minister may receive an invitation to it.  I will be going along and I look forward to the Minister's presence there on the basis that what we will be discussing is possibly outside the realms of party politics and should be seen as such.  The whole House is and should be concerned with family law reform in general.</P>
    <P>Under the heading &ldquo;The Kennedy Report,&rdquo; paragraph 11 of the report states:</P>
    <P>We are aware that the recommendations of the Kennedy Report are at present being considered by the Minister.  We wish to record our appreciation of the work of the Kennedy Committee and support the recommendations contained in its report.  In particular, we refer to the &ldquo;Summary of Major Recommendations&rdquo; in Chapter 22 and would urge the early implementation of the recommendation therein set out.</P>
    <P>I think it is fair to say that quite a number of the recommendations in the Kennedy Report were carried out by the former Minister and will be carried on, I am sure, by the present Minister.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="737" /> On 12th December, 1973, I asked the Minister for Education the recommendations of the Kennedy Report that have been implemented and the recommendations that remain to be implemented.  I also asked the Minister if it is his intention to implement the recommendations of the Kennedy Report relating to (a) the introduction of a new children's charter, (b) the abolition of the institutional system, (c) the keeping of families together and (d) the proper training of staff; and if he will make a statement on the matter.  The Minister's Parliamentary Secretary replied at length and set out very clearly and concisely the number of initiatives that had been taken arising from the Kennedy Report. It was very heartening to read the 11 points made by the Parliamentary Secretary in answer to my questions. It is not my intention to read them out; they can be found at Questions Nos. 53 and 54 of the Official Report of 12th December, 1973.  It is not my intention either to make a point about who did what.  That can work to the detriment of the particular object one seeks to achieve.</P>
    <P>I did not go into the question of legal aid to any great extent last evening.  The entire structure of the present criminal legal aid requires examination.  We on this side of the House believe that too many people are not aware of their entitlement to criminal legal aid.  I am sure the Minister is aware from his previous practice as a solicitor and in his capacity as Minister for Justice that quite a considerable portion of the money set aside for criminal legal aid is not taken up.  The Minister paid tribute to the FLAC group, the Free Legal Aid Advice Centre group.  Since the setting up of that group people have become aware of their entitlements under the free legal aid programme, and properly so.</P>
    <P>The Minister issued a direction to Garda stations, and so on, that a notice stating that people were entitled to legal aid should be publicly displayed. The Minister has said that he is now examining the matter of free legal aid in civil cases relating to family law in particular and I hope <Col N="738" /> he will issue large notices about this matter.  I do not want all the Garda station walls to be full of notices but there should be a specific notice in large print on its own quite clearly spelling out to individuals their entitlements to legal aid in criminal cases and, in the not too distant future, in civil cases also, with specific safeguards.  This is a matter which the Minister might consider.</P>
    <P>The next matter I wish to deal with might sound like special pleading but I am sure the Minister and the House will forgive me if I just mention it. It is a matter of fact and it is worth bringing out.  The question of the adequacy of legal aid remuneration might also be examined.  In my own short experience since my return to the Bar I was nominated by a solicitor to take a legal aid case in which two individuals are alleged to have committed a particular crime.  I do not think I am entitled to mention the crime here, alleged as I say.  It is a very serious crime, probably the most serious crime there is.  I was asked to take the particular case and, of course, I took it because I believe in the free legal aid programme.  In cases of murder there are special fees for counsel but in less heinous crimes the disparity between the fees the prosecution receive and defence counsel receive is absolutely astonishing and should be examined.  Need I say that the disparity is very much in favour of the prosecuting counsel who are employed by the State.  It seems very unfair that that should be the position. The Minister might examine the matter because the present legal aid fees for lawyers are little more than one-third of the prosecution fees for the same work.  At one stage this resulted in the Bar withdrawing their services from the scheme in protest. This problem should be remedied as a matter of some considerable urgency.</P>
    <P>I think I have set out fairly clearly the general areas of family law reform which concern this party and the matters I have mentioned are, indeed, of concern to all parties and all Members of the House.  The Minister spoke about the Garda Síochána as the main law enforcement agency of the <Col N="739" /> country and paid tribute to them.  We are living in difficult times and the gardaí, with the Army, are bearing the brunt of this to a great extent. We, on this side of the House, concur in the Minister's expression of gratitude to the gardaí for discharging their duties in their usual thorough and courageous manner.  They have never been found wanting since the foundation of this State and anything we may say on this side of the House in regard to them should be seen as an effort to assist them in their role as the main law enforcement agency.</P>
    <P>The Minister mentioned a number of matters in relation to Garda stations and their condition.  If I may be a little parochial, I am very pleased that among the Garda stations he mentioned was Cabinteely.  I think this station is representative of some of the worst features of some stations from which gardaí operate.  It is situated on a very dangerous thoroughfare, at a crossroads, and one wonders how the gardaí survive getting in and out of the station.  When one actually enters the station one can only have sympathy for the gardaí because of the leaking roof, unavailability of proper drinking water and lack of a proper place for the 25 or 30 gardaí to sit down and have a decent meal. This is representative of the problem existing in some of the Garda stations throughout the country and the Minister pinpointed it, as is quite proper.</P>
    <P>The Minister also said that he is preparing to build or is about to build a Garda station in Limerick in the very near future.  This is absolutely necessary.  I have seen the condition of that station and it is very difficult to expect people to work properly under the conditions there.  To get the best from people one must give them the best in terms of working and living accommodation.  I welcome the Minister's concern in this regard and I urge him to take the necessary steps to bring about a situation in which we as citizens can be proud of our Garda stations.</P>
    <P>The Minister spoke also of the advancement of radio communications and said that work was well in hand <Col N="740" /> on the installation of the most modern equipment in the new radio control centre at Dublin Castle and that he expects the scheme to be fully operational within three months.  We look forward to this.  The Minister might also examine the situation in regard to Garda cars and the question of the mileage a Garda car must record before it is actually sold or scrapped. We understand the mileage is quite considerable in many instances and we think the Minister should set a mileage limit at which cars would be taken out of service and replaced by new cars.  We suggest 50,000 miles. Perhaps this would be considered too low but it is very important from every point of view that the gardaí should have safe, road-worthy cars capable of fairly high speed.  We suggest that the Minister consider having this upper mileage limit so that when it is reached the cars will be replaced by new cars.  The Minister understands what I mean.  I could envisage a situation in which a serious crime is committed and the gardaí come along in one of these over-used cars.  I understand a number of the cars are on 24 hours a day service &mdash;no criticism of the Minister, the gardaí or anybody else.  They must do their duty.  But one can imagine when they arrive on the scene of a crime in a rather old car they may see the thief or thieves leave in a rather new, modern car and the gardaí are in the position in which their own old crock cannot operate effectively.  Consequently, the thieves get away.  I am sure that is of concern to the Minister and he might consider my suggestion of having an upper mileage limit for Garda cars after which they would be abandoned and replaced.</P>

Under the Coast Protection Act, 1963, four coast protection schemes have been completed in the last three years, viz. (1) The Murrough, County Wicklow, in 1970-71 at a cost of £32,000 approximately, (2)  Youghal, County Cork in 1970-73 at a cost of £155,000 approximately, (3)  Moville, County Donegal in 1971-72 at a cost of £34,000 approximately, and (4) Strandhill, County Sligo in 1972-73 at a cost of £23,000 approximately.  A coast protection scheme at Rossnowlagh, County Donegal, which was commenced in March, 1973, is in progress.</P>
      <P>Forty proposals are awaiting investigation under the Act.  It is not possible to give the total cost of implementing the proposals received.
