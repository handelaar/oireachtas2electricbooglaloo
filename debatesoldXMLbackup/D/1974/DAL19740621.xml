      <P>The net Estimate for Social Welfare for the current short financial year is £112,475,000.  This is equivalent to a 12-month estimate of £148,865,000 representing an increase of £12,852,000 over the figure for the previous year <Col N="1326" /> which has been adjusted to allow for the Supplementary Estimate taken in December last.</P>
      <P>This Estimate was, of course, prepared prior to the budget and does not make provision for the increases in rates of payment, improvements in coverage and new schemes which were announced in the budget.  The Social Welfare (No. 2) Bill, which passed all Stages in this House last week, made provision for additional expenditure of approximately £15 million in the current financial year, or £30 million in a full 12-month period.  It will be necessary to introduce a Supplementary Estimate later this year to meet this additional cost.  The published figures, therefore, do not give a complete picture of the current annual cost of the social welfare services or an adequate comparison of the growth in this cost from year to year.  I hope in the course of these introductory remarks, to provide Deputies with as complete a picture as possible.</P>
      <P>This is the first full Estimate debate on social welfare since the change of Government and I propose to avail of this opportunity to range widely over the major developments and policy considerations in this area of Government activity.  I hope that Deputies will respond by engaging in a positive and constructive debate on social welfare policy.  Provision for the social needs of the community&mdash; and in particular for the needs of those persons who are not able to make provision for themselves or who are afflicted by misfortune of one kind or another&mdash;is of such importance as to require serious discussion, in depth, in this House.</P>
      <P>It has been my purpose over the past 15 months to initiate study and debate of major issues of social policy at all levels and I intend to raise a number of matters today which I see as having real priority.  I want to make it clear, at the outset, that I shall be thinking aloud on certain questions and I realise, in doing so, that I am taking a political risk.  The subject-matter is of such importance that it must be debated openly and, where necessary, controversially.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1327" /> Social reform has been, and remains, a major thrust of Government policy.  It was made clear, within days of this Administration taking office, that the overall policy to be pursued would involve a campaign against poverty and unemployment in which economic and social measures would be intertwined to form a comprehensive and realistic programme.  Economic development is of the utmost importance for a country like Ireland, but it is to be valued solely in so far as it contributes to the welfare of every member of society, and especially of the weakest and most vulnerable groups. So-called progress can by-pass many groups and individuals.  In the time that it takes one man to make a million pounds a poor family may move one or two places up the long housing points list.</P>
    <P>Economic and social policy must be linked in reality and not merely in rhetoric.  All aspects of policy must be directed towards social objectives so that the betterment of the living and working conditions of the people will become the yardsticks of political action and of Government decision.</P>
    <P>This requires that social policy&mdash; in its broad dimensions and in terms of detailed implementation&mdash;should be debated fully and in an informal manner.  In this country there has been no tradition of study and debate in this area.  Recent years have seen some important initiatives &mdash; by political parties, by voluntary and Church organisations and by academics&mdash;and these have given a welcome impetus to thought and concern in the community.  However, I do not think it can be denied that we have relied too much on what has been described as me-tooism, a tendency to follow developments and thinking in Britain rather than to work out our own approaches in the light of our own economic and demographic patterns and of our traditions.</P>
    <P>Social policy cannot be regarded as merely a matter of what we usually describe as social welfare&mdash;which is, in fact, income maintenance.  The <Col N="1328" /> income maintenance system, developed from the old British legislation and administrative structures, has concentrated almost totally on catering for the needs of those afflicted by various social problems. Our task now is to seek and implement overall programmes which can solve problems by identifying and dealing with their root causes.</P>
    <P>This Government have, in their two budgets, given concrete expressions to their stated concern for the needy.  They have, indeed, brought immediate assistance to those in need and have sought to deal, as they promised, with the plight of the aged, deprived children, the widowed, orphaned and deserted, and the physically and mentally handicapped. I have, within the past month brought into this House two Social Welfare Bills which indicate this concern which the Government have for social reform.  These measures are but a beginning.</P>
    <P>Raising total Exchequer spending on social welfare from £92 million, in 1972-1973, to the current full-year level of approximately £180 million represents a major commitment in budget terms.  I intend to return later to some of the broader implications of this element of policy.  However, it is most important to stress that increasing expenditure under the traditional subheads is only part of the story.  We must develop our capacity to deal with the new social problems which emerge in a complex, modern society.  These problems include the various marginal types of poverty; the specific difficulties of urban populations; problems arising from the restructuring of agriculture; the inter-related needs of special groups such as deserted wives, unmarried mothers and so on; regional difficulties and the whole spectrum of social services needs.</P>
    <P>Before attempting to spell out in concrete terms these general policy considerations, I want to deal with the facts and figures which illustrate the work of the Department of Social Welfare and the steps which are being taken to build up the efficiency and effectiveness of the Departments' services.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1329" /> As I stated at the outset, the net Estimate for this year is £112.5 million. I shall be seeking a Supplementary Estimate of approximately £15 million to implement the provisions of the budget, as embodied in the Social Welfare (No. 2) Bill.  The net Estimate is, as Deputies will appreciate, only the amount which the Exchequer must provide for the social welfare services.  A considerable sum is provided also by employers and employees through their weekly social insurance contributions &mdash;both flat-rate and pay-related.</P>
    <P>The most useful indication that can be given of the cost of our services is the estimate of the total expenditure on these services in a full 12 months based on the most up-to-date rates of payment.  On this basis it is estimated that, taking into account the provisions of this year's budget, total expenditure is now running at an annual rate of about £295 million.  This annual rate of expenditure compares with a figure of £246 million based on the 1973 budget provisions and represents an increase of 20 per cent.  Even more striking is the comparison of the current rate of expenditure with that in the year ending 31st March, 1973 which was £151 million.  The increase is almost 100 per cent.</P>
    <P>Because of the changed financial year, I do not think it would serve any useful purpose if I were to compare the figures for the different subheads of the Vote with the corresponding figures for last year.  If any Deputy requires information on a specific provision I shall, of course, be glad to supply it.</P>
    <P>Total expenditure on the services administered by the Department of Social Welfare had risen, as a percentage of gross national product, from 5.1 per cent in 1959-60 to 6.76 per cent in 1972-73, the last year of the period in office of the previous administration.  The corresponding proportion in 1973-74 was 7.97 per cent and the estimated figure for the current year is in excess of 8.5 per cent.</P>
    <P>In the course of my Second Reading speech on the Social Welfare (No. 2) Bill, I made reference to the breakdown of the sources of social welfare expenditure as between employers, employees <Col N="1330" /> and the Exchequer.  The proportion of this expenditure borne directly by the Exchequer in Ireland is exceptionally high&mdash;only in Denmark among the member states of the EEC is the State share higher.  The cost of the social assistance schemes falls wholly on the Exchequer and is met from general taxation.  The cost of the social insurance system falls on the social insurance fund which is financed by contributions from the three sources I have just referred to. In the past three years the proportion paid by employers has risen from 32.18 per cent to 37.34 per cent, that paid by employees has fallen from 31.46 per cent to 30.42 per cent while the Exchequer share has declined also from 34.32 per cent to 31.10 per cent which still remains high by international standards of comparison.  I shall be returning to some of the implications of these facts before I conclude.</P>
    <P>Deputies are aware that changes in the social welfare payment rates and the introduction of new schemes involve a great volume of work in the Department.  The estimated weekly average number of persons who will benefit from the improvements in social assistance and social insurance provided for in the Social Welfare (No. 2) Bill will be 767,000, including 219,000 child dependants.  In addition, some 375,000 families will receive increased children's allowances.  This year, the lowering of the pensionable age to 68 years will result in some 13,000 new pensions being awarded in the contributory and non-contributory categories, while the raising of the means limits will bring in some 1,250 new old age or widow's pensions.  The cumulative effect of the reductions in pensionable age in the last two budgets has been to increase the number of old age pensioners by about 25,000, while some 12,000 persons have become eligible for pension as a result of the means test easements.</P>
    <P>The processing of all of this work is proceeding satisfactorily and I am confident that it will be completed expeditiously.  The time available to the personnel in the Department for the implementation of budget changes <Col N="1331" /> has been greatly reduced by the Government's decision to pay increases three months earlier than in previous years.  I must pay a sincere tribute to the officials of the Department at all levels, and in all locations, for the manner in which they have tackled the very heavy burden of work placed upon them by the Government's determination to improve the social welfare system.  They have responded willingly and with great dedication and I am sure that all Deputies will join with me in thanking them for all they do to provide a good and efficient service.  I want also to pay tribute to the other Departments which have cooperated so readily with my Department in this work, and in particular to the staff of the Revenue Commissioners and of the Department of Posts and Telegraphs.</P>
    <P>The staff of the Department in the current year is estimated at 2,729, an increase of 431 on last year's figure. Despite this 20 per cent increase in the numbers working in the Department, the staffing situation in the Department still gives rise to very real pressures and calls for much patience on the part of the personnel.</P>
    <P>Accommodation also gives rise to concern.  Aras Mhic Dhiarmada has again become overcrowded, despite the housing of some sections in Phibsborough Tower, O'Connell Bridge House and D'Olier House.  Additional accommodation&mdash;including facilities for a new and greatly enlarged central public office and information centre&mdash; has now been obtained in Ossian House, Pearse Street, which should be fully fitted out and ready for occupation in the near future.  Problems of space interfere with the efficient discharge of work and cause serious and regrettable inconvenience to the staff.</P>
    <P>In the course of the debate on the Social Welfare (No. 2) Bill, certain criticisms of the Department's efficiency were made.  It is my earnest desire to ensure, as far as is necessary and possible, that the improved social welfare services we are providing will be matched by a corresponding improvement in our administrative practices.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1332" /> There are delays in dealing with applications and with queries&mdash;and, in this area of Government activity, any delay is to be deeply regretted.  A delay in relation to a pension claim, or a disability benefit application, can cause real hardship to a man and to his wife and children.  It is a matter of urgent concern that such delays are reduced to an absolute minimum. Achieving a desirable situation in this respect involves action on a number of fronts: staffing, staff training, accommodation and methods of administration and operation.</P>
    <P>I am giving serious consideration to all of these issues and if helpful, I will have no hesitation in seeking professional and specialised advice on the requirements of efficiency.  Some months ago, I arranged to have a full and thorough review undertaken of all the Department's methods and procedures, its general structure and organisation, and its accommodation, staffing and equipment, with a view to gearing it to fulfil adequately its increasingly important role in the life of the community and to discharge effectively its responsibilities to the public with which it has so many, so varied and so close contacts.</P>
    <P>Because of the extremely heavy work-load with which all sections of my Department have had to contend over the past year this review has made slower progress than I had hoped but, nevertheless, significant and valuable improvements have been made and other developments for the better, including the installation of the most modern office equipment are in progress or planned.  I am confident that, with the ready co-operation of the staff of the Department, we will be able to streamline our services much to the benefit of the public and the Exchequer alike. In particular, I am taking steps to investigate the causes of delays. Among the reasons which have come to light are problems of data handling and errors in the making of claims.</P>
    <P>The installation of the Department's computer configuration which was formally opened last February <Col N="1333" /> has provided us with a resource of the greatest importance.  The computer&mdash;which was in the first instance utilised for the processing of disability benefit claims and the issue of flat-rate disability benefit cheques&mdash;is necessary to permit the operation of the new pay-related sickness and unemployment benefit schemes which came into effect last April.</P>
    <P>To date, the computer has performed reasonably satisfactorily in dealing with these new schemes in what is a particularly novel approach to the use of the computer in the public service.  This is an application of the computer to a completely new social welfare scheme, the various inevitable difficulties, snags and anomalies of which were not known when the original computer programmes were devised.  The experience which is being gained in this exercise will prove to be invaluable as the use of the computer in the Department's work is extended in the period ahead.</P>
    <P>Problems do arise in connection with the making of claims.  I am very disturbed by the fact that many delays in processing claims arise from errors in completing forms&mdash;in particular failure to provide correct insurance numbers.  In the initial stages of implementation of the pay-related benefits scheme some claimants have not provided adequate information on tax reference numbers, with resultant delays in payment of entitlement.  It is most important that, as far as possible, application forms should be simple and easily understood.  I am taking steps to have all Departmental forms simplified.  In this connection, the requirement that application forms should be certified by approving categories of persons is being removed. Existing forms will no longer require certification and new forms will be printed without the present certification section.  This change should speed up applications in many cases.</P>
    <P>This problem of delays cannot be separated from the issue of the provision of information to the citizen. The view of the Government, as expressed <Col N="1334" /> on many previous occasions, is clear.  Access to information about the activities of the Government, and of the various public authorities, is essential.  Information about entitlement to the services provided is a critical requirement in modern society.</P>
    <P>The services provided by Government and public agencies are increasing in complexity as well as in quantity. Every year sees a marked growth in the scope and range of such services. People can very easily become perplexed by the number of laws, regulations and schemes which exist for their good but which are complicated and difficult to interpret.  As services grow they are often characterised by a degree of technical detail which is necessary in terms of professionalism which can, unless understood, create problems for the man and woman in the street.</P>
    <P>I want to make one point absolutely clear.  Every scheme which my Department operates &mdash; and, indeed, every Government service &mdash; is designed for the people and to meet their needs. Very often those eligible for such services, and availing of them, are in great need, or under particular stress. Often they are disadvantaged in terms of education, knowledge and self-confidence. But in every case they are exercising a social and civic right and must be treated as such.  They cannot, however, exercise their rights if they do not know them or how to go about availing of them.</P>
    <P>Few, if any, of the Departments of State have as much direct contact with the people as the Department of Social Welfare.  Following the abolition of the £1,600 income limit for insurability more than 860,000 adults are insured under the various schemes operated by the Department.  As I have pointed out, the average number of persons who are in receipt of assistance or insurance payments is 767,000, including adult and child dependants.  Some 123 public offices are maintained throughout the country and many thousands of claims and inquiries are dealt with through the post and by telephone every day.</P>
    <P>I have been conscious of the need <Col N="1335" /> to improve the information service provided to insured persons and their employers and to those who may be eligible for various forms of assistance. A number of positive steps have been taken in this matter.</P>
    <P>The Information Section of the Department has produced a greatly improved and more readable version of the annual Summary of Social Insurance and Assistance Services.  The new format of this booklet has been welcomed widely but it can, no doubt, be further improved.  The suggestions of Deputies on such improvements will be welcome. It is my intention that this year's version of the summary booklet will be available by the end of the current month.</P>
    <P>Press, radio and television advertising has been increasingly used by the Department to inform citizens of new and extended schemes and special telephones have been installed at headquarters to deal with inquiries from the public.  In particular the introduction of the pay-related benefits and the changes provided for in this year's budget were dealt with in special advertising campaigns.  I believe that this use of the media is absolutely justified by the results obtained &mdash; more than 15,000 persons sent in the application coupon for the pay-related benefits pamplets.  Criticism has been varied of some of these advertisements, with the implication that they were in some way slanted in a party political fashion.  I totally reject this and can assure the House that there is only one objective in this information campaign &mdash;to increase the degree of public awareness of the social welfare services. In coming months this form of communication will be made more systematic and will cover general issues connected with the Department's services as well as the specific, topical matters which will arise.</P>
    <P>The Department now has information offices situated in employment exchanges in up to 18 towns and cities.  These offices are staffed by specially trained personnel and are designed to give enquirers full information about benefits and assistance <Col N="1336" /> available under the social welfare legislation and allied schemes, to assist members of the public with the completion of forms and to pursue complaints about delays or hold-ups in payments or awards of service.  In the most recent three-months' period these offices have handled no less than 15,000 personal and telephone inquiries.  I intend to expand the network of information offices throughout the country and plans are advanced for five new offices, including two in the Dublin area.</P>
    <P>The EEC regulations regarding social security of migrant workers have been in operation here for more than a year now.  The basic purpose of the regulations is to ensure that nationals of other member states will carry their acquired rights to social security with them on moving to another member state.  The regulations cover insurance for sickness, maternity, invalidity, old age, survivors, employment injuries and diseases and family allowances.</P>
    <P>The implications of these Community provisions have been publicised by advertisements in the newspapers which have indicated the action to be taken by persons affected. My Department have available a comprehensive explanatory leaflet which will be supplied to anybody seeking further information.</P>
    <P>Work in relation to EEC membership is increasing and the Department has a special section dealing exclusively with the various aspects of existing and developing Community policies.  Through the work of a social attaché in the permanent representation in Brussels the Department are kept fully informed of developments and are represented on the appropriate committees at various levels.</P>
    <P>Finally in this general review I should like to comment on the cost of administration of the Department's services.  Administrative costs as a percentage of expenditure have been reduced from 4.86 per cent in 1972-73 to 4.47 per cent last year and to an estimated 3.77 per cent in the current financial year.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1337" /> May I turn now to a brief consideration of some of the principal current activities of the Department and in particular of the main schemes of social protection?</P>
    <P>The total cost of social insurance schemes in the current financial year, excluding the cost of the increases provided for in the Social Welfare (No. 2) Bill, will be £92.0 million, equivalent to £125.0 million in a full year.  The net Exchequer contribution to the social insurance fund related to this expenditure will be £25.9 million in the current year, or £33.2 million in a full year.</P>
    <P>The increases in insurance benefit payments which are provided for in the Social Welfare Bill will be in general at the rate of 18 per cent. Thus the personal rate of unemployment benefit will be raised from £6.55 a week to £7.75 a week and the rate for a married couple from £10.80 a week to £12.80.  In the case of the contributory old age pension the rate for a married couple both aged 68 years or over will be increased from £12.35 to £15.00 a week.</P>
    <P>It is not my purpose to dwell at any length today on the rates of increases &mdash; the debate last week on the Bill was extensive and covered that adequately &mdash; but I wish to indicate that social welfare benefits are being raised substantially. While the average weekly increase in the rates of benefit over the period 1963 to 1972 was approximately 40p, the increase in 1973 was £1.00 and in the present year £1.20£1.30.</P>
    <P>The reduction of pensionable age to 68 years in the 1974 budget is the latest step towards the stated goal of a pensionable age of 65 years at the earliest date possible.</P>
    <P>The system of pay-related benefits in the case of unemployment and disability, as well as maternity allowance and occupational injury benefit was introduced in April of this year.  It is early to make a comprehensive statement on the workings of the scheme but there is no doubt that it has proved to be of great significance for very many families afflicted by the hardship occasioned by the illness or unemployment of the breadwinner. <Col N="1338" /> As Deputies are aware the Social Welfare (No. 2) Bill has made provision for certain amendments in the legislation covering this scheme.  I shall ensure that the working of this complex system is kept under continuing review and that any necessary adjustments will be made without delay.</P>
    <P>The total cost of social assistance schemes provided for in this Estimate, but not taking into account the provisions of the Social Welfare Bill, is £51.6 million in the current financial year or £68.8 million in a full year. The cost of children's allowances in the current year will be £29.5 million, or £39.3 million in a full year.  I may mention here that following the implementation of the recent budget increases in children's allowances, expenditure on this service will be running at the rate of £43.50 million in a full year.</P>
    <P>As in the case of social insurance payments, the average level of increase in assistance payments will be 18 per cent.  Thus the personal rate of old age non-contributory pension will be raised from £6.15 a week to £7.30 a week on 1st July.  The rate of urban unemployment assistance will be raised from £5.35 to £6.35 a week for a single person and from £9.25 to £10.95 a week for a married couple.  The four important new schemes provided for in the Social Welfare Bill will come into effect next month, including the introduction of an adult dependant allowance for the wife of a non-contributory old age pension recipient. This will raise the weekly payment in a case where the new allowance applies from £6.15 a week at present to £10.95 a week next month.</P>
    <P>In the case of deserted wives, the period of six months which they had to wait before they could qualify for payment has been reduced to three months.</P>
    <P>Some 375,250 families with 1,045,000 children under age 16 will benefit from any new rates of children's allowances.  In addition, allowances are now payable in respect of some 70,000 young persons who are between the ages of 16 and 18 and <Col N="1339" /> undergoing full-time education or are apprentices or incapacitated.  Our scheme of family allowances has been improved to such an extent that it now compares not unfavourably with the schemes in the other member states of the EEC.  Furthermore under legislation which was recently enacted the mother has become the person entitled in her own right to payment of the children's allowance.</P>
    <P>The Estimate provides for an expenditure of £3.69 million in the current financial year, or £5.15 million in a full year, for the various miscellaneous services administered by my Department.  These include the schemes for the supply of cheap fuel and cheap footwear to necessitous families, of free travel facilities for those over pensionable age, for the provision of free television licences and for school meals.</P>
    <P>These are important and valuable schemes which bring badly needed assistance to very many persons and households.  I am having each of these elements of our overall programme assessed with a view to ensuring that they contribute to the welfare of recipients to the utmost extent.  In particular the cheap fuel scheme is characterised by a number of quite serious anomalies.  The scheme is being critically reviewed at present.</P>
    <P>The position of the social insurance fund calls for some comment.  The total expenditure, which is also the total income, of the fund has grown from £9.9 million in 1957 to £104.4 million in 1973-74 and to £92 million in the current short financial year.  Contributions from employers and employees have increased from £5.6 million in 1957 to £70.7 million last year and £65.5 million this year.  Thus the State grant has altered from £3.8 million, 38.2 per cent, in 1957 to £32.5 million, 31.1 per cent, last year and £25.9 million, 28.1 per cent, in this short financial year.  The major point arising from these rather tedious statistics is the decline in the State grant as a proportion of the total income of the fund.  The rationale of this trend is based upon the known pattern of social welfare financing in other European countries.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1340" /> The 867,000 persons at present covered by social insurance in this country represents some 77.5 per cent of the total national workforce.  The very substantial increase in insurance coverage brought about by the abolition of the £1,600 income limit is reflected in the comparison of the percentage figures for 1973, 71 per cent, and the current figure which I have just given.</P>
    <P>Consideration of the most up-to-date figures for coverage indicates a number of issues requiring very serious policy consideration.  Of the total covered, almost 100,000 are not insured for all benefits because of the nature of their employment&mdash;civil servants, teachers, local authority officials and so forth&mdash;and their situation has been the subject-matter of some discussion and controversy.  This is a matter which I intend to review in the near future.</P>
    <P>The other major issue is that of the approximately 300,000 self-employed persons in the national workforce who are, with only some exceptions, not covered at all by the social insurance system.  The proportion of the workforce in self-employment in this country is very much out of line with other countries of the EEC and with developed economies in general.  In fact the proportion varies from 7.5 per cent in Britain and slightly more in the other highly industrialised countries to more than 30 per cent in Italy and Ireland.</P>
    <P>Consideration of the role of the Department within the overall social programme of government shows a very significant development.  Total spending on social welfare and health has risen from £75 million in 1968-69 to £278.2 million in the Estimate for the current financial year&mdash;from 23 per cent of total Government expenditure to 32 per cent.  Expenditure of this magnitude is very clear evidence of the importance of social policy, not least in its implications for economic development.</P>
    <P>I have attempted to indicate the scope and current developments in the work of my Department.  I want now to turn to a consideration of a number of policy issues which are at <Col N="1341" /> present the subject of study and preparatory work within the Department. They serve to underline the major preoccupations in key areas at this stage of the Government's social programme.</P>
    <P>The Government have very clearly committed themselves to combat poverty and deprivation in the community. This is a real commitment and one which must be given concrete expression.  The establishment of the advisory committee on pilot schemes to combat poverty in May was a most important contribution to this area of policy.  I am confident that this initiative will be successful in bringing relief of an immediate nature to some of those who are living in need and, more importantly, in providing the Government with the practical foundation for really effective long-term policies to eliminate poverty from our country.</P>
    <P>The membership of the committee represent a very wide range of disciplines, skills and experience which will be relevant to the demanding work which must be done.  The mixture of statutory and voluntary involvement; of academic and field-work background; of national and local levels of activity, of the members of the committee is a necessary element in tackling this very special task.</P>
    <P>I want to place on record in this House my belief that we must act rather than talk in relation to this issue of anti-poverty policy.  Our actions will give focus and meaning to our debate on the nature and incidence of material and moral deprivation. Properly planned, these pilot actions will create a momentum and an attitude which can give us hope of long-term success in combating poverty.</P>
    <P>I have made clear to Sister Stanislaus, who is bringing such skill and dedication to the task of chairing the advisory committee, and to the other members that the pilot scheme project is to be seen as</P>
    <P>first, an exercise in practical commitment to provide effective help for groups and individuals in poverty and for disadvantaged areas</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1342" /> second, a piece of planned action research aimed at the improvement of existing services and, more significantly, at the development of long-term policies to eliminate poverty</P>
    <P>third, a positive response to, and vital element of, the social action programme of the EEC, and</P>
    <P>fourth, a conscious effort to create awareness of and sensibility to the needs of the poor in Ireland so as to ensure the public political will for change.</P>
    <P>I have also explicitly stated that pilot schemes as envisaged in the programme of the advisory committee are not intended to be</P>
    <P>symbolic actions, designed to signify our distaste at the existence of need. They are to be real, concrete interventions in areas of deprivation, or among groups in need,</P>
    <P>academic research projects.  They must become community-based projects, meaningful to local people and involving them fully</P>
    <P>not the final answer to social problems. Of their nature the pilot schemes will be limited in scope and resources.  They will be a form of action research, giving some practical results in the field but more significantly giving data and insights to policy makers.</P>
    <P>In dealing with the work of my Department in the area of provision of information to the citizen I made clear my deep concern at the existence of a wide problem of lack of awareness of State services and provisions. It is, however, necessary to recognise that the need for information and advice to the citizen goes far beyond the area of social welfare entitlements.  Citizens require to be informed and helped on a wide range of matters since the right to know extends to all areas of public and community life.</P>
    <P>The Government have responded to the growing demand throughout the country in recent years for the establishment, with State support, of a network of citizens' advice bureaux, In February the decision, in principle, to support the setting-up and operation <Col N="1343" /> of bureaux was announced.  I hope that the consultations which have followed that announcement, involving both my Department and the Department of Health, will soon result in a detailed scheme for the implementation of the Government decision.  I see this as a most important step which will be based on a welcome collaboration between voluntary organisations and the various statutory agencies.</P>
    <P>I have already indicated my thinking about the extension of the various information services related to the work of my Department.  It is of the utmost importance that every new development in social welfare is communicated to the maximum number of citizens.  What is necessary is a greater degree of scientific assessment of the effectiveness of this communication. The objective must be to bring about a situation in which no one is ignorant of his social rights. I am anxious to concentrate some of the continuing advertising campaign of the Department on the routine issues related to making claims, approaching the Department or other relevant services etc.  People should be helped to deal with the various aspects of the social welfare system simply and straightforwardly.</P>
    <P>I see the extension of social insurance to the self-employed members of the work force as a priority for action and I have initiated a farreaching and deep study of the various implications of such a development. Deputies will recognise that the extremely varied categories of persons in the self-employed sector of the work force gives rise to many problems.  These categories include professional and quasi-professional people, small traders, workers in independent crafts and services, many persons engaged in catering and the great bulk of those in the agricultural and fishing sectors.  The self-employed group covers, therefore, an extremely wide range from small shopkeepers, street traders, stall-holders and small farmers with earnings at or even below subsistence level to professional people in the highest <Col N="1344" /> income brackets.  To produce a scheme capable of catering for so diverse a group is a considerable task.</P>
    <P>It will be necessary to consider the possibilities of providing coverage by means of a compulsory or voluntary scheme; the difficulties of financing such schemes in the context of our tripartite contribution system for a category lacking one of the three usual contributors&mdash;the employer; and the very real issues of the relative poverty of many persons classified as self-employed. I can envisage a beginning by means of pilot or experimental schemes geared to the specific needs of definable groups, not least in cases where a clear desire for such coverage has been indicated to my Department.</P>
    <P>On the question of the home assistance scheme, my views have been expressed quite unequivocally.  In describing it as a disaster I was, I believe, echoing the opinions of those Deputies who, over the years, have put down many questions in this House and of many other informed critics.  While the scheme is now provided under the terms of the Public Assistance Act, 1939, its origins lie very obviously in the Poor Relief (Ireland) Act, 1847&mdash;a fact which should give rise to a sense of concern and even disbelief at this stage of our development.</P>
    <P>As things stand today, home assistance remains an essential support service of last resort which enables immediate and relatively flexible assistance to be provided for those in need who do not qualify for benefit or assistance under the State schemes.  It helps also those whose needs are inadequately met under those schemes and those confronted with emergency situations.</P>
    <P>This scheme is, however, most inadequate and characterised by many anomalies, not least the regional differences in conditions and levels of assistance.  It is in need of radical overhaul to fit it to fulfil its proper residual and support role within the income maintenance structure.  As presently administered, the scheme is working in an arbitrary fashion so that major inequalities exist as regards the standard of eligibility and standards of payment between one authority and <Col N="1345" /> another and even within the same authority in the treatment of basic needs.  I have had the scheme reviewed in detail and it is my hope that changes will be possible in the near future on the basis of recommendations drawn up by my Department.</P>
    <P>I have been giving consideration to the question of an extension of the social security system by the introduction of income-related pensions. This question was first raised some years ago in the full employment report of the NIEC.  There is now considerable evidence of public demand for such a scheme, or for a national occupational pension scheme of some kind.  Furthermore, the fact of our membership of the EEC raises the issue of harmonisation of social security.  Most of the other member States have income-related pension schemes of one kind or another. There are very many technical and administrative problems connected with the provision of such a scheme in this country.  I see the introduction of a scheme of income-related pensions as a necessary development of our system, for reasons of good social policy, and I am hopeful that worthwhile progress in this direction will be forthcoming in the near future.</P>
    <P>Deputies will recognise from the preceding remarks that my Department is pursuing an active course of development and that major advances in the structure, coverage and efficiency of the social welfare system are being planned and worked on.  As has often been stressed, by the very nature of social welfare&mdash;and because of its close relationship with economic progress&mdash;development of the system is a progressive thing and one can never claim that the ultimate stage of advance has been reached or is in sight.  What matters is that very clear objectives are identified and precise, workable plans for their attainment drawn up and implemented.  I want now to share with Deputies some of my thinking on the desirable lines of development in a number of areas of particular importance.</P>
    <P>The Statement of Intent of the National Coalition Parties included the commitment that &ldquo;a central <Col N="1346" /> feature of social policy will be a complete reform of the system of financing social services through the introduction of a comprehensive social security system covering all citizens&rdquo;. The implications of this statement require to be spelled out in clear terms and translated into action.</P>
    <P>My concept of a comprehensive social security system encompasses matters which, strictly speaking, fall outside the scope of this Estimate.  I see the desirable system embracing the present responsibilities of the Department of Health and Social Welfare with provision, at least, for the co-ordination of general services such as those for children.  This view arises from a conviction that the whole social service field can be seen as a complex of inter-related systems complementing one another.</P>
    <P>Quite simply, I hope to see developed a single system of coverage for all citizens which will provide for income maintenance, pensions and health or hospitalisation services as a matter of acquired right.  Such a system would require to be underpinned by an appropriate scheme of social assistance to provide adequately for those in real need or for persons who, for one reason or another, fall outside the qualification limits for the general scheme.  While I do not want, at this stage, to go into any detail in outlining my views on a system which will have to evolve through quite lengthy study and consultation, I would stress that it is essential to recognise that social services in modern society must go beyond the traditionally accepted elements such as basic income maintenance or hospitalisation.  There is a whole range of personal and community services which must be seen as essential to any really comprehensive programme and which must provide a flexible and sensitive set of supports for those in need of one kind or another.</P>
    <P>I would like, at this stage, to refer to the question of the financing of the social services in general and of social welfare in particular.</P>
    <P>I have already indicated the rate of growth in both total and Exchequer <Col N="1347" /> spending on social welfare over recent years.  In the light of these facts a few comments appear timely.</P>
    <P>It is necessary to ensure that the best return, in terms of genuine social service, is obtained for such high increasing levels of public expenditure. The continuance of certain schemes, or the general availability of certain categories of payment may, in fact, be at the expense of directing adequate funds to the relief and eradication of particular hardcore problems.  We must look critically at the effects of what we are doing, a task calling for planned research.</P>
    <P>Those who foot the bill have a very real interest in this question of the effectiveness of the social welfare system.  In this country the major share of cost is borne by the general Exchequer.  It might be thought that such a situation implies a major element of vertical redistribution of income in this country.  However, it needs to be borne in mind that as much as two-thirds of the general taxation raised in this country comes from various forms of indirect taxation. Indirect taxation tends to be regressive&mdash;and the same tendency can be detected in the basically flat-rate system of social security payments in Ireland.</P>
    <P>I see in this whole area a field of necessary and fruitful study and policy consideration in which the fundamental relationship between the tax and social security systems would be examined in detail.  The principle of equity must prevail in this matter.</P>
    <P>Within the ambit of EEC social policy we are contributing to the development of the European social budget and other related indicators of the scope, structure and main trends of social expenditure and financing.  I can see the advantages of this approach, not least for the educational point of view.  The more people know about where the money they contribute to the general taxation pool ends up&mdash;and particularly about its uses in the social field&mdash;the greater the hope that they will respond positively to the demands which any Government must make upon them.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1348" /> In the prevailing inflationary situation, it is to be expected that the relationship of social security provisions to the cost of living will be a most legitimate concern.  Our purpose, in the last two budgets, has been to cushion the many thousands of social welfare recipients and their families from the impact of price rises upon their already precarious standard of life.</P>
    <P>I am very conscious of the situation in which many families and individuals find themselves in such a period and I am anxious to devise a satisfactory method whereby the system of social welfare payments will, of itself, provide protection against inflation.  The practice over the years has been for the annual review of social welfare at budget time to be carried out in the light of the development of prices in general.  This does provide some measure of guarantee of the maintenance of the purchasing value of social security benefits.</P>
    <P>Thus, as the EEC Commission has pointed out, the real income of pensioners, widows, the permanently disabled and other social welfare recipients may remain relatively constant but their income, as compared with the average earnings of the working population, tends to decline and the provision of a guarantee to maintain the purchasing power of social security benefits is rare even in the most advanced systems.  So rapid has been the rate of increase in the weekly earnings of industrial workers in this country that rates of social payment, for instance old age pensions, may not have kept pace and the pensioners may well be falling behind to some extent.</P>
    <P>I welcome the inclusion, in the social action programme of the Community of the long-term aim of bringing about a &ldquo;situation in which all beneficiaries of social security benefits can share in rising prosperity by linking the real value of social benefits to the increase in incomes enjoyed by the productive sector of the population and thereby help to guarantee adequate social protection to all groups&rdquo;.  I look forward to our active co-operation in this aspect of a Community policy and I am anxious <Col N="1349" /> that a suitable system for inclusion in our national scheme should be evolved as soon as practicable.</P>
    <P>The provisions of this year's Social Welfare Bill have added yet another set of assistance schemes to a system which has become a conglomeration of individually desirable but collectively unwieldy attempts to meet situations of deprivation.  I am happy that we have been able, within fifteen months, to show our practical concern for unmarried mothers, single women aged over 58 years, adult dependants of non-contributory old age pensioners and the families of long-term prisoners.  In particular, I am satisfied that very many persons in these categories have been removed from dependence on the home assistance scheme.</P>
    <P>However, such a piecemeal approach to the development of the assistance services is not satisfactory. It does represent the determination of the Government to maintain momentum in that development, but it adds up, in fact, to an exercise in the plugging of welfare gaps, rather than a planned approach to the expansion and improvement of a necessary service.</P>
    <P>It is my concern to see developed a single scheme, planned in such a way as to be an adequate complement to the comprehensive scheme of social insurance, providing supplementary income maintenance to any person in genuine need.  Such supplementary support should be available as a social right, and should be backed up with a proper set of personal and community services geared to the long-term solution of social problems.  As a matter of basic logic in the approach to such problems of deprivation there should be a working link between social services of this kind and the national employment and manpower training services.</P>
    <P>Such an assistance scheme would eventually encompass the existing assistance payments services and would have responsibility for the various ancillary services such as provision of free transport, free electricity, etc.  The criteria should be <Col N="1350" /> simplified, as far as possible, to become equated to need.</P>
    <P>I am personally convinced that the development along progressive and effective lines of the assistance services, and indeed, the proper evolution of our total social welfare system, depends upon the solution of certain very pressing issues of definition and classification of objectives.  One of these relates to the much discussed concept of a minimum family income. The statement on social policy published in December, 1972 by the Catholic Hierarchy's Council for Social Welfare recommended that &ldquo;the principle of a guaranteed minimum income, related to the cost of living index, for each household, whatever the circumstances, ought to be accepted&rdquo;.  The policy statement on poverty published by my town party at their annual conference last autumn contained a call for the acceptance of the same principle, related to family size and other relevant factors.</P>
    <P>I accept these views as valid and as of the utmost importance.  It is, however, necessary to realise that the definition of a standard of this nature which would command general acceptance in the community raises difficult and complex issues which extend beyond the field of social welfare. For example, such a departure could have very obvious implications in the field of collective bargaining. These various issues will take time to resolve.  The definition and acceptance of a guaranteed minimum income would, of course, be a valid and, I believe, most necessary element in any review of the whole social security structure.  It is a task to which serious consideration will have to be given.</P>
    <P>I am concerned also that continuing study should be undertaken on the adequacy of the services provided and the various payments made under the schemes administered by my Department.  It is necessary to recognise that, in an inflationary situation and in a social setting in which expectations and standards are changing rapidly, the provision of social services <Col N="1351" /> must be kept in line with prevailing needs and attitudes.</P>
    <P>Social protection and social security are not an exercise of communal dogooding &mdash; they are the discharging of the real and solemn responsibility of the community to citizens who, for one reason or another, are in need of support.  This responsibility is fully discharged only if the social services are adequate to the needs of the people.</P>
    <P>These remarks on adequacy of services and on minimum family income lead me to the subject of research. That research is necessary in relation to many social problems in this country cannot be denied.  Indeed, it is a commonplace of all discussion on such problems to deplore the lack of good and reliable date upon which to base policy decisions.  We need better information, more relevant information and we need it as soon as possible.</P>
    <P>I recognise that research has its particular and proper place in the overall approach to the evolution of social policy.  I agree, also, with the views of the director of the Economic and Social Research Institute when he wrote that &ldquo;the potential contribution of research should not be exaggerated and it is important to be clear at the outset about its role&rdquo;.  I accept as valid Dr. Kennedy's threefold definition of this role in which he pointed out that research can help to awaken the public conscience to major social problems; to evaluate alternative solutions in terms of their relative costs and relative effectiveness and to identify and draw attention to future problems before they reach major proportions, thereby offering the possibility of preventive treatment.</P>
    <P>I have been engaged recently in most useful discussion with many of those actively involved in the field of social research and hope to develop these contacts further.  The preparation and implementation of a programme of social research, particularly in areas such as poverty, the problems of children and other key <Col N="1352" /> groups in the population, social administration, planning methodology and the medico-social field, is a necessary and urgent priority.</P>
    <P>As a preparatory step towards the establishment of a permanent working relationship between my Department and the research area, and in order to ensure that development work with the Department is co-ordinated internally and externally I am taking steps to create a special research and development section. This section will become the central point of policy and programme development; it will work with those engaged in relevant research and will have the task of interpreting and assimilating research findings which relate to the work of the Department and to the future direction of social policy.</P>
    <P>I regard the development of the social policy of the EEC as one of the most important elements of the work of the past year and as one of the major determining factors of much of our work in the future.  I would like to say a few words on this subject.</P>
    <P>The position of the Government on the Community's social policy was made clear in a most comprehensive statement submitted to the Council of Ministers last December.  That statement said:</P>
    <P>The commitment of all member states to change the whole approach and scale of social action within the Community by undertaking an active programme of social reform was clearly expressed in the Paris summit communiqué.</P>
    <P>The aspirations of that communiqué for the future of Europe were progressive.  It was recognised that economic expansion was not an end in itself and that its first aim should be to bring about social progress.  As much importance was attached to social progress as to the achievement of economic and monetary union.  This declaration of the Heads of State or Government raised considerable expectations for future policy in the Community.  In particular it gave to the community as a whole the task of proving, in <Col N="1353" /> practical terms, that it is capable of providing for all of its citizens the social fruits of the economic achievement to which they have contributed so much.</P>
    <P>It is against the standards implied in the Paris summit communiqué that I have continued to evaluate the work, and the decisions, of the various institutions of the Community and, in particular, of the Council of Ministers which has the ultimate political power and responsibility.</P>
    <P>The social action programme adopted by the Council last January and now being worked on at various levels represents, in my view, the minimum in terms of scope and urgency which will meet the responsibilities of the EEC in this policy area.  Each of the actions provided for must be proceeded with in the timetable laid down.</P>
    <P>It is the basic position of the Government that a genuine social action programme for the Community must make provision for social problems arising from employment and for social problems outside the field of employment. For this reason, and not merely because they fall in functional terms within my responsibility, I place very particular emphasis upon those elements in the social action programme which go beyond the employment area.  I refer to the programmes dealing with the handicapped, with poverty and with the extension and harmonisation of social security systems.  These are actions of great potential importance and their full development &mdash; with adequate resources made available for their purposes &mdash; will be a true test of the social and political will of the Community.</P>
    <P>The situation in respect of the European Social Fund is unsatisfactory. The fund for this year 1974 amounts to 328 million units of account &mdash; less than £140 million &mdash; which is only 6 per cent of the total budget of the EEC and which is equivalent to around 60 per cent of the cost of administering the Community itself.  Last year, the supplementary sum sought by the Commission was slashed by more than 60 per <Col N="1354" /> cent.  It is clear that many worthwhile social programmes will have to be curtailed as long as expenditure is maintained at this low level.</P>
    <P>Quite simply, the funds available for social programmes are grossly inadequate and it is not going to be possible to devise a worthwhile social policy as long as this situation continues. There is no point in drawing up agreed programmes as long as the necessary financial means are not also agreed.  I have the greatest sympathy in this matter with the officials of the Commission, and with Vice-President Hillery, whose efforts have been so often frustrated by the lack of political will at the level of the Council of Ministers.</P>
    <P>During the past 15 months I have attended three meetings of the Council of Ministers at which, in collaboration with the Minister for Labour, I have taken a very firm line on this question of the expansion of social policy.  I hope that in the period of Ireland's presidency of the Council next year we shall be able to give some positive leadership and direction in this vital area of Community development.</P>
    <P>I have been in regular contact with Vice-President Hillery during the past year and we have met in Brussels and Dublin.  His staff and the staff of my Department are collaborating on many aspects of social policy and we were recently pleased to welcome in Dublin the Director General for Social Affairs, Mr. Michael Shanks and the Director of the European Social Fund, Mr. Rifflet.</P>
    <P>I believe that we must continue to work hard for a progressive social policy in the Community.  Our approach cannot be that of looking to Brussels to solve our social problems &mdash; that is our political duty and responsibility here in our own country. Community policy can however support and give real impetus to policy and action developments here and it can provide us with the valuable fruits of the experience of our fellow member states.  Above all a valid social policy can ensure that the European Economic Community becomes <Col N="1355" /> what it must become if it is to be of real and lasting value to its people&mdash;a social and economic community in which the fruits of economic growth are made available to all the people and to meet their real needs.</P>
    <P>In the statement of intent of the National Coalition the commitment was made that &ldquo;the elimination of poverty and the ending of social injustice would be a major priority in the next Government's programme&rdquo;. I believe that the clearest possible evidence has already been given of the Government's will to honour that commitment.  My concern is to ensure that, in so far as it is a proper function of my Department, the work needed to achieve full success is planned and carried out.  I have absolutely no illusions about the size of the job which we are facing and I am making no facile promises about easy solutions or fast conclusions.  The struggle against inequality and poverty in society is a long and difficult one.</P>
    <P>When I attempt to interpret the commitment contained in the statement of intent in practical terms, as a guide for action and for the drawing up of our long-term plans, I am drawn to the following main conclusions.</P>
    <P>The complex and intractable nature of the problems of poverty and deprivation must be recognised.  We are here dealing with what is in human terms the most significant aspect of inequality in our social and economic system.  It is a sad fact that even having regard to the major economic advances of recent years social inequality remains.  Such inequality is capable still of turning men against men in our society.</P>
    <P>It is clear that the roots of inequality are deep in the economic organisation of our society.  Poverty, based on inequality, can only be ended if the structures and institutions of our socio-economic system are altered profoundly.  This is a policy goal which is both radical and long-term, calling for related and co-ordinated policies in economic, fiscal and broader social fields.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1356" /> But the need to press for effective long-term policies against poverty does not remove from us the responsibility to combat the existing and obvious effects of poverty. By whatever measure one approaches the issue, a large proportion of the people of this country are living below reasonable or acceptable standards of welfare and human dignity.  The best available information suggests that almost one quarter of the population have a personal income inadequate for their needs.  When one looks at the total number of persons in receipt of social welfare payments&mdash;over 767,000 &mdash;it is important to realise that they include 219,000 child dependants, a figure which is more than one-fifth of all the children in the country.  That is why the elimination of poverty is a long-term policy priority of this Government and why its alleviation is one of the key immediate priorities.</P>
    <P>This immediate priority calls for a continuation of the policy of the Government in respect of the allocation of resources to the social welfare system.  The budgets of 1973 and 1974 have greatly increased these resources, as is reflected in the provisions of the Estimate now before the House.  We must ensure that not alone are the payments made to the recipients of social welfare maintained at their present levels of purchasing power but that they are brought into line with reasonable and decent standards of social provision.</P>
    <P>The fact that social welfare protection is a right arising out of citizenship is a primary consideration which I feel cannot too often be stressed. This consideration calls for enhanced provision of usable information to all citizens and for the highest standards of service and help for all claimants and recipients in their dealings with the Department.  I am concerned to ensure that the premises in which the public carry out their business with my Department are improved and brought up to desirable standards, particularly in respect of privacy, and that all members of the Department's staff are provided with proper training, working facilities and back-up to guarantee a first-class personal service.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1357" /> It is impossible to discuss social policy today without a serious reference to inflation.  I have no doubt that inflation is to be seen as the crucial world economic problem of this era, just as unemployment was the key economic problem of the inter-war world.  Here in Ireland we share the world's concern with inflation, and we still have high and persistent unemployment. The impact of inflation &mdash;the more so at the levels at present being experienced&mdash;is clear and most harmful.  Beyond all its economic illeffects, inflation tends to make inequalities worse and it bears most harshly on the poorest groups in the community.</P>
    <P>Inflation can lead to big changes in people's views of the economy, of their place in it and of the correct manner of distributing its fruits. When we are discussing the impact of inflation on social welfare payments, as we must, we should put our discussion clearly in the context of public attitudes towards wealth, income and taxation policy.  We need to be honest about our standpoints on these matters.  The approach of the Government to tackling poverty will demand the support of everyone in the national community, who must be prepared to respond along the lines spelled out recently by the Tánaiste when he said that.</P>
    <P>the whole population must be prepared to give support, politically&mdash; with their votes&mdash;and economically through taxation, in accordance with their incomes and responsibilities. A caring community is one which does not merely express verbal concern about needs but one which is also ready to give of itself in terms of support, of personal service and, most important, of money.</P>
    <P>If we talk about a caring community, then we must talk also about one which is prepared to give every citizen a share in the fullness of its life.  Perhaps that is an appropriate guideline for our policies, at least in the short-term.  This idea was expressed most interestingly in a recent report to the Government of New Zealand on social security.  It was argued in the report that every citizen <Col N="1358" /> should have a level of income which enables him</P>
    <P>to belong and to participate &mdash; so that no one is to be so poor that he cannot eat the sort of food that citizens usually eat, wear the same sort of clothes, take a moderate part in those activities which the ordinary citizen takes part in as a matter of course.  The goal is to enable any citizen to meet and mix with other citizens as one of them, as a full member of the community &mdash;in brief, to belong.</P>
    <P>That seems to me to be a useful starting point for debate.  And debate there must be, as I hope there will be on the Estimate which I am now presenting for the House's consideration and recommending to it for approval. The development of our social policy calls for the most wide-ranging and complete discussion and argument, both about objectives and methods.</P>
    <P>In taking this approach to the presentation of my Department's Estimate today, I fully realise that I have taken a risk.  I have raised a wide and comprehensive range of issues and I have moved, at least by implication, into areas of controversy or of indirect relevance to my direct responsibility. I want to conclude by stating that it is my belief that any society is to be judged by the care which it has for its poorest members and that it is worth some political risk&mdash;of mis-interpretation or of implied broken promises&mdash;to bring the issues related to providing this care to the attention of the House and of the public at large.</P>

    <P>This is one of the most important Estimates which comes before the House because it caters for the poorer sections of the community, the unemployed, the sick, the aged, the <Col N="1359" /> handicapped, widows and orphans, the underprivileged of our society.  On our commitment in this area of government can be judged our real concern for people.  Since it is such a short time since we discussed the Social Welfare Bill authorising the increases in social welfare payments in the budget perhaps I should begin by picking up the threads where I left off on that occasion.</P>
    <P>I pointed out then that the increases being made available by the Government were insufficient even to keep pace with the inflation over the past year not to mention the inflation which must be faced in the coming year or the improving of the standard of living of the people who are dependent on the State for help.  The Parliamentary Secretary complained in his reply that I did not take what he termed my usual reasonable attitude in relation to the Bill.  Quite frankly I cannot understand why he should say this as it appeared to me not only reasonable but my duty to underline the havoc which inflation was playing on the incomes of those in the lower income brackets.  I felt it was my duty to point out the fact that the Coalition themselves, by their increases on VAT on many essential items, such as clothing and fuel, had contributed greatly to the inflationary spiral.  I also felt it my duty to underline the need for a further urgent survey of the situation.</P>
    <P>Before that debate I had made a very careful survey of the situation and I clearly indicated in my speech that the trend, in my view, was very much more serious than would appear from the statistics which were already to hand.  I doubt if anybody can accuse me of making rash statements. I suppose, to some extent, I suffer from the political disadvantage, if it is a political disadvantage, of being over-careful to ensure that what I say is factual.</P>
    <P>However, it now appears that possibly the reason why the Parliamentary Secretary was perturbed by the speech I made was because he knew at <Col N="1360" /> that time, from official statistics which were not issued for a couple of days after the debate, that my summing up of the position was correct and that the inflationary situation was getting out of hand, with a resultant serious deterioration in the living standards of all social welfare beneficaries.  The official figures issued on 14th June showed that inflation had gone up by over 16 per cent and that the value of the £ in February, 1973, had dropped to 83p in May, 1974.  From May, 1973 to May, 1974, the value of the £ had dropped by 14 pence.</P>
    <P>If we were to take, for example, the present contributory old age pension of £7.20 its value as compared with May, 1973, would be approximately £6.15.  In other words, £6.15 in May, 1973, would buy as much as £7.20 in May, 1974.  The increase in pension in July is £1.30 and taken at May, 1973 values that would equal about £1.11, so that if the increase were to be granted the pension would total about £7.20 in terms of May, 1973, which is approximately the same amount as was available in value when the increases were granted last year. Of course, the increase will not be available until July and by that time the inflationary process will ensure that the actual amount, in buying power of May, 1973, will be actually less than it was in 1973.  This means that the contributory old age pensioner after he gets his increase in July will be worse off than he was last year in terms of purchasing power.  On top of this he faces a year of inflation when the value of his income will continue to decrease.  Special consideration should be given to this aspect of the matter.  This is exactly the case I made when dealing with the Social Welfare Bill last week, the only difference being that the public now see clearly from the statistics published by the Government how right I was in the case I made.  I pointed out then, and I repeat now, that speaking of total amounts granted in increases without referring to the balancing factors of the loss in buying power of money is unreal and does not do any service to the cause of those in need.</P>
    <P>To take another case, the widow's <Col N="1361" /> contributory pension is now worth £6.60.  The increase to be granted in July is £1.20 and the new total will be £7.80.  If we were to take it that £7.80 was granted in May, 1974, instead of in July, 1974, this £7.80 would buy as much in 1974 as approximately £6.60 in May, 1973.  Therefore the pensioner would be facing the next year of inflation with no real increase either to meet the inflation or to improve her standard of living.</P>
    <P>As in the case of contributory old age pensions this increase will not be available until July, which means that the pensioner will start at a worse level than he did last year, that he will have no reserves to meet the increased cost of living in the coming year from July, 1974 to July, 1975, and of course there will be nothing in real terms available to him to improve his living standards.</P>
    <P>There is no need for me to go through the various categories because the same pattern emerges.  I believe I have done sufficient calculation to show that there is an urgent need to examine the whole social welfare system and to relate it to the present-day exceptional increases in the cost of living if we are to be realistic and if our treatment of those who are unable to help themselves is to be realistic.</P>
    <P>Very briefly I should like to refer to the exceptional opportunity that the Coalition had to improve the whole social welfare system.  They inherited from us a buoyant economy which is the real basis on which it is possible to build a sound system of social welfare. They also had available to them the £30 million which was saved on agricultural subsidies because of our entry to the EEC.  I am aware that the Coalition are not particularly anxious to refer to this £30 million.  I suppose the Fine Gael Party would like to forget it because they would prefer to pretend that the increases came from our own resources.  The Labour Party, of course, opposed our entry to the EEC and if they had had their way the £30 million would not have been available at all.  However, the fact is that it is available and one <Col N="1362" /> would have thought that in these circumstances the Coalition would have put more thought into the developing of our social welfare code.</P>
    <P>I should like to comment on some aspects of the development of our social welfare code under the Fianna Fáil administration.  Fianna Fáil have had an exceptional record in relation to the development of social welfare. They took over rather simple social welfare services in 1932 in much the same state as they were when the British left.  The record in this field has been one of continuous and steady progress.  Many major advances have been made along the road towards the development of a comprehensive and adequate social security system in this country.  The services already there were developed and down the years many new categories of people who were in need of assistance from the State were added until we reached a stage where we had a well laid foundation and were building a worthwhile social welfare code.</P>
    <P>We can now point to the fact that under Fianna Fáil the development and the rate of expansion of our social welfare code compared favourably with the developments in other countries which were much better off economically and which had begun the development of their social welfare services long before we had an opportunity of starting development. While I do not feel it is necessary to go into any detail regarding the progress which was made over the years, nevertheless I believe I should very briefly mention some of the landmarks in the development of our social welfare code.</P>
    <P>We brought in the unemployment Assistance Act 1933, the Widows' and Orphans' Pensions Scheme, 1938, which provided contributory and non-contributory pensions for widows and orphans, the Intermittent Unemployment Insurance Scheme, 1942, which was popularly known as the wet time insurance, a general scheme of children's allowances in 1944, paid for entirely out of State funds, the Social Welfare Act, 1952, which provided for a co-ordinated system of social insurance covering practically all <Col N="1363" /> employees between the ages of 16 and 70 for a wide variety of benefits and which also provided for many significant improvements in the social assistance and in the non-contributory schemes.  We introduced the contributory old age pension scheme, 1961, the superseding of the old system of workmen's compensation by the scheme of occupational injuries insurance, 1967, retirement pensions at 65, an invalidity pension for permanently incapacitated people, a death grant, pay related benefit scheme, free electricity and television licences, free travel for old age pensioners and so on.</P>
    <P>The list I have given is not intended to be exhaustive but simply to give a very brief outline of the progress and the development achieved over the years and of the sound foundations on which the present and future Governments can build.  The Parliamentary Secretary in the course of his speech pointed out that the development of our social welfare system was something which was progressive and where everything cannot be done immediately.  I am simply underlining this because of the fact that some criticism was levelled at this party because we had not done while in Government everything the Coalition Government had done since they came into office.</P>
    <P>The schemes providing free transport for old age pensioners and those receiving blind pensions, the free electricity scheme and the provision of free television licences to those who are eligible are, in my view, very important schemes and I am glad to know there is a broadening of the scope of these schemes.  It is true to say that the Parliamentary Secretary had not a full appreciation of the value of these schemes originally because I can remember one occasion when some stress was laid by this side of the House on the fact that the Fianna Fáil Government introduced a free electricity scheme and he said: &ldquo;If you have money you can get electricity&rdquo;.  Perhaps he missed the whole point of these schemes and while speaking of a new concept in <Col N="1364" /> regard to human relations and social welfare recipients he failed to grasp that the provision of these fringe benefits to old people was an exceptionally worthwhile exercise in human relations.</P>
    <P>The question that should be asked is this.  If, for example, an extra sum of money were allocated to old age and blind pensioners instead of the benefits mentioned, how many of them would utilise this extra money for the purpose of travelling from one place to another?  How many of them would ensure that the money was spent on providing the extra comfort that free electricity and free television licences make available to them?  The introduction of the free travel allowance had a psychological effect of gearing old people's minds towards travel, towards being interested in moving around from one place to another and meeting people.  It would be impossible to estimate the pleasure and satisfaction old people got and still get from their ability to travel free of charge, nor would it be possible to estimate the number of years that this particular scheme has added to their lives.</P>
    <P>A very worthwhile day's work would be done if further consideration were given to the development of schemes such as these.  Vision and imagination was shown in the introduction of these very worthwhile ideas.  I feel that practical assistance in the generation and in the development of further ideas could be had from many voluntary organisations dealing with old people.</P>
    <P>I believe one of the most important new schemes which was brought into operation by the Fianna Fáil Government was the prescribed relatives allowance.  It is natural that old people would prefer to spend their remaining days in their own homes with their own relatives and among the neighbours they have known all their lives. To send them to a home, however well run it may be and however kind the staff may be, is a traumatic experience for them.  We have only to note the anxiety of most people in ordinary hospitals to get home, however comfortable they are, to have some appreciation <Col N="1365" /> of the sadness, the loneliness and the feeling of not being wanted which must tear the hearts of old people who leave their homes forever. In some instances the fault may lie with the relatives who are not anxious to be burdened with their parents, but generally speaking people are sent to old people's homes because of financial difficulty or because of lack of accommodation in their own homes.  If we were to provide a reasonable amount of money for relatives or anybody willing to take over the responsibility of looking after old people and if we provided the necessary facilities I have no doubt that many of those in old people's homes or those who are about to go there would be cared for where they would most prefer, that is, in the surroundings to which they have been accustomed. When one considers the cost of keeping an old person in a home there is little doubt that the cost of keeping such an old person in his or her own home would be much less.</P>
    <P>This is an aspect which should not of course be a major factor.  The motivation towards change should be to ensure that our old people, to whom we owe so much and to whom so much lipservice, if I may say so, is paid, should end their days in conditions congenial to them.  I have often wondered why for so long we should have been willing to continue to send the aged into homes when the cost is so much greater than it would be to keep them in their own homes and I could only come to the conclusion that this had been the position for so long and we had become so accustomed to administering it in the way we do that no one thought of making a change or, if anyone did, there was some idea that it would really be too much trouble.</P>
    <P>The introduction of the prescribed relative's allowance was the first step towards change.  It is true that many of our aged will still need to be sent to a home for medical and other reasons. It may have been felt that while the homes were there we might as well make full use of them.  If we are to solve the problem we shall have to face up to it in a big way and provide <Col N="1366" /> the financial assistance in the home to the extent necessary, providing additional accommodation where that is needed; to the extent to which we are prepared to make money available for this purpose we will show our real concern for our old people.</P>
    <P>This is basically a family problem and it should be dealt with as such.  I have visited old people's homes in my constituency and I have found them excellently run.  I have noticed the exceptional kindness of the staff towards those placed under their care. For most old people, however, and particularly for new arrivals, all of this does not compensate for the dramatic change which takes place in their lives.  For the future we should plan at developing the scheme in relation to allowances to prescribed relatives.  I note the Parliamentary Secretary has done this to some extent in the Social Welfare Bill.  A comprehensive scheme should be worked out to enable as many of our old people as possible to end their days in the surroundings they have known and loved for so long.  The prescribed relative's allowance was introduced some time ago.  It was improved by us and it has been improved again now but we have not by any means reached the end of its development.  It could be extended to cover other individuals willing to take over the responsibility of looking after old people in their own homes.</P>
    <P>Our population is growing older. The death rate is down and life expectancy is up due largely to improved health services.  Aging today involves many problems, not quite the same problems in every case but nevertheless very definite problems which must be solved if we are to deal adequately with improving the lot of our old people.  Due to better health services our older people today are much healthier than were their parents and grandparents before them.  Because of this and because pensions are made available by the State some people might believe that old age no longer presents a challenge to society.  This is very far from being the case.</P>
    <P>To arrive at a true picture of the <Col N="1367" /> position in which our old people find themselves one has only to relate the pension rate with the average wage paid to those working in the same employment as the pensioner worked in before going on pension or, better still, compare the annual weekly increase for those in employment with that for those on old age pensions. Even allowing for the more modest needs of the elderly this comparison underlines the fact that these people are living at a relatively low level. The Parliamentary Secretary made a somewhat similar comparison in his introductory statement.</P>
    <P>From what I have read the proportion of people who continue to work after reaching retirement age is relatively small.  This is particularly true of women.  Surveys made elsewhere show that most people who continue to work after retirement do so because they need the money.  I understand very few go on working just for the purpose of keeping busy and fewer still for love of their profession. This underlines part of the reason why the commission suggested community aid to guarantee the elderly against loss of income due to premature retirement.  Despite what we find in such surveys it is, of course, equally true that some active ablebodied men and women are compulsorily retired on reaching the age limit and want either full-time or part-time employment; these must be catered for.</P>
    <P>As well as financial difficulties there are also psychological problems related to retirement.  There is the problem of boredom, of feeling useless and of solitude.  There is the problem of housing.  The latter does not come directly within the scope of this Estimate except in so far as it relates to whether or not we should concern ourselves more with keeping our old people in their own homes.  That is the ideal solution.  Old people have always been respected in this country. I hope that the scientific and technological achievements will not tend to change this attitude as they are tending to change it in other countries.  The old people of today have helped us towards a better society <Col N="1368" /> and, looking at the matter from the most selfish standpoint, we ourselves will be the old people of tomorrow.</P>
    <P>Up to now we have concerned ourselves with trying to ensure that proper financial provision is made for retirement.  We have still got a long way to go in our efforts to ensure that our old people will spend their remaining years after retirement in reasonable comfort.  We must direct more of our energies and resources towards achieving this.  In conjunction with our efforts to improve the financial situation of our old people we must also concentrate our efforts in endeavouring to make our old people happier, thereby making old age a more fruitful time.  It is estimated that men who retire at 65 can look forward to living for another 12 years and women to a somewhat longer period. The term &ldquo;look forward&rdquo; suggests pleasurable anticipation.  A more common reaction on the part of those approaching retirement is apprehension. The idea is growing that it might be sensible to prepare people for retirement, thus helping them to adjust to its limitations and to benefit from its advantages.  It is understandable that many of these people, particularly those who have not had the benefit of a liberal education, suffer from boredom and frustration.  Those who have worked for 40 or 50 years have had their lives conditioned by their daily work.</P>
    <P>I was very pleased, therefore, to see recently that pre-retirement classes are being held for the first time in the Cork Municipal School of Commerce; they had already been in operation for quite some time in the Dublin Institute of Adult Education.  I would like to emphasise the tremendous need there is for courses of this kind not only in Dublin and Cork but throughout the country.  I have often wondered whether it would not be possible to have day release courses at that end of the scale just as we have them at the point where people are entering into employment.</P>
    <P>Dealing as we do, as public representatives, with many types of retirement problems, it is brought home to us time and again how traumatic an <Col N="1369" /> experience it is suddenly to find oneself in a situation which is completely different from the one to which one was accustomed for, in many cases, 40 years.  The newly retired person's whole life has been moulded by his work, by his association with people at work, by his ambitions and his successes and failures at work.  Suddenly and without warning, as it were&mdash; because without being prepared, I suppose, is equivalent to being without warning&mdash;he finds himself cut off from a situation which had the apparent stability of being everlasting, cut off not only physically but mentally as well from his friends and associates, and feeling, in a sense, rejected and useless.  If he is not mentally adjusted to such a situation and prepared in a practical way to face up to it, then his future is bleak and life after retirement will not only be dull and boring but very often short as well.</P>
    <P>When I say that the person going into retirement is cut off mentally as well as physically from those with whom he spends his working life, I should point out that this stems from the fact that he no longer has the same interests as they have and therefore is unable in a natural way to involve himself as he had been involved.  I can particularly remember an old teacher in my early teaching days who was a very active member of my union during his whole teaching career.  In fact, he was a member at the time when to be such put his job at risk.  He was a very regular attender at branch meetings, rarely if ever missing one.  He was for years a member of the county committee, and so good a trade unionist had he been during his life that on his retirement the branch made him an honorary member, which gave him the right to attend branch meetings whenever he wished.  He attended a few meetings and he then ceased to attend.  The fact was that he could no longer, in his changed circumstances, identify himself with the aspirations, hopes and fears of the teachers who were still in the service. Fortunately for him he was a man of many parts and he involved himself in other matters such as the Pensioned Teachers' Association, and he continued to play a worthwhile and <Col N="1370" /> valuable role in society for many years.</P>
    <P>I simply mention this case to show that it is not possible, in the vastly changed circumstances of a retired person's position, to continue on in life as if nothing had happened.  If this were not possible for a man who had been so active, both mentally and physically, as my friend had been, how much more difficult is it for the many who would not have his potential to adjust without adequate preparation?</P>
    <P>Subjects covered in courses for retirement could include living on lower incomes, hobbies and leisure, adjusting to retirement, health and diet.  Courses could be held for those about to retire and perhaps in our circumstances for those who have already retired.  In some of our more heavily populated areas there are clubs for old people run by voluntary organisations. These should be encouraged by the State.  I have often felt that it might be better still if we could help these old people to join clubs catering for particular hobbies in which the individuals are interested.  This would help them to continue to develop and they would not feel, as they might tend to feel in clubs catering for their own age groups, that they were cut off from society.  I also think, particularly in urban areas where there are a number of old age pensioners in the district, that many of them have skills which because they are no longer working they do not use and which they could very easily use to help one another.</P>
    <P>While my earlier remarks related to preparations for retirement, obviously a crucial matter when a person retires is his income.  All I have said in relation to courses is valid, but it is very difficult, if not impossible for people trying to eke out an existence on a low income to benefit from these courses or to ensure that they will have a happy retirement.  We should, therefore, see to it that these people are fairly catered for financially.  In these very difficult days of massive price rises and galloping inflation, that is something, as I said in my opening remarks, with which we should be particularly concerned.</P>
    <P>While it is some years since the Fianna Fáil Government introduced widows' and orphans' pensions, in <Col N="1371" /> recent years more attention has been focussed on the plight of widows than had been the case.  This has been caused by a changing social awareness but more particularly by the efforts of the widows themselves in recent years in putting their case to the public and to those in authority and in a position to help.  This underlines what I said on a number of occasions, that there is need for voluntary organisations to continue to search out and to spotlight aspects on which there has not been, to date, sufficient emphasis.</P>
    <P>The initial stage of widowhood is a frightening experience.  The breadwinner is gone and the widow is left to face the future alone with her children. Money difficulties are among the commonest and the most worrying of the many problems which face widows. The more fortunate may benefit from savings or investments, but the vast majority must rely on social security and social assistance, and trying to make ends meet with the present provision and the situation of rapidly rising prices is not easy.  The amelioration of the means test limit is of some benefit to a widow on a non-contributory pension and is to be welcomed. However, as in the case of the old age pensioner I would like to draw attention to the particular plight of the widow with a family who is unable to go to work because of the need to take care of her family.  She is in most difficult circumstances.  Special recognition should be given to this fact by granting some type of supplementary allowance.</P>
    <P>In the case of a widow on a contributory pension similarly circumstanced, home help should be made available to give her the opportunity to go out to work if she so desires. In last year's budget the provision whereby the widow who paid full insurance contributions while working but received only half the benefit while unemployed was changed.  I am aware of the arguments in favour of this practice but it was wrong that a person who paid the full contribution, a contribution equal to that paid by other workers, should only receive half of the benefit when unemployed. <Col N="1372" /> I welcome the change in this regard. However, I fail to see why the change was made in the manner it was.  While the widow will now not pay her share of the stamp she will still only be entitled to half of the benefit if she becomes unemployed.</P>
    <P>I cannot understand why the difference between widows and other workers should be maintained.  The Parliamentary Secretary should have a survey carried out to see whether widows would prefer the system as it is or whether they would prefer to pay the full contribution and receive full benefit when unemployed.  The Parliamentary Secretary has pointed out that because the widow does not have to pay contributions she will save more than £1 per week.  I accept that this is so but I should like to draw attention to her less favoured sister, the widow who for family or other reasons cannot go out to work.</P>
    <P>While the change made in respect of widows who work is justified it is equally obligatory to help in some way the widow who cannot go out to work. I was glad to note the development of a widows' association.  I am convinced that such an association can do more in practical ways and can deal with emotional and social problems better than any State agency.  Such an association can help widows overcome the feeling of loneliness, to find suitable employment and help in the bringing up of children.  Nobody can appreciate what widowhood is like, what the emotional stress and strains are like and what the effect of a large reduction in income is like more than those who have experienced it.  Individually widows might not have been able to give much help but as a body drawing on the resources and experiences of many they can be particularly effective.</P>
    <P>The Fianna Fáil Government made available allowances to deserted wives, something which was badly needed. It is only in relatively recent times that we have come to appreciate the problems and difficulties facing deserted wives, particularly those with young families who are suddenly left helpless endeavouring to bring up a family without the normal support of <Col N="1373" /> the other partner in the marriage.  To this is added severe mental stress.  The plight of the deserted wife is very much akin to that of the widow with the added psychological effect.  Her great problem until recently was that she was not entitled to any assistance from the State and while this matter has to some extent been rectified we must continue to ensure that the allowance is kept at a proper level.</P>
    <P>Much more has to be done than merely making a contribution to the financial support of the deserted wife and her family.  We should inquire into the reasons for desertion and see what we can do directly and also through assisting voluntary bodies to overcome the problems which ultimately lead to desertion.  We pay unemployment benefit and unemployment assistance to those out of work but we do not confine ourselves to this.  We throw as much as possible of our national resources into providing more employment so as to make employment available for those who are unemployed.  In other words, we recognise that it is much better to have our people employed than to have them depending on social welfare payments.  Equally I feel we should be doing all we can to eradicate the causes of desertion.  We can best do this by assisting financially community councils and the various societies and organisations who are doing so much to overcome this problem.</P>
    <P>Where community councils are operating effectively they have marriage counsellors who not only devote themselves to helping overcome the problems of those who are faced with a break-up of their marriages but also give time voluntarily at pre-marriage courses to help those intending to marry.  At such courses they give advice and assistance which helps to reduce the likelihood of a breakdown in the marriage.  In this way they help to strengthen the whole social fabric of the community. If these community councils are to survive State financial assistance on a much larger scale than the relatively small amounts which are made available at present is urgently required.</P>
    <P>One of the great difficulties facing <Col N="1374" /> voluntary organisations in regard to pre-marriage courses is that a large proportion of those who would benefit to a considerable extent from the courses do not attend them.  Further financial assistance to the organisation concerned would help them to seek out and encourage such people to attend courses.  As a rule marriage counsellors or part-time voluntary social workers are married.  They must have special qualities for this delicate work.  The help the married counsellor tries to give is not of the &ldquo;putting you right&rdquo; kind.  Through friendly and sympathetic discussion with either one or both of those involved an effort is made to understand the difficulties in the marriage and see what, if anything, can be done to improve relations between the husband and wife.  If necessary the counsellor can call on his supporting team of consultants, doctors, psychiatrists and solicitors to help.  In recent years marriage guidance has been developed to cover educational and preventive work as well as remedial work.  Over the years it has been realised that young people need help and some counsellors have specialised in conducting discussion groups in schools, youth clubs and similar organisations.</P>
    <P>While most of us are aware of the many reasons for marriage breakdowns some research was done in my constituency and it showed that apart from the general lack of preparation for marriage, the problems of heavy drinking and gambling, one of the causes of breakdown of marriages was the incapacity of some parents to bridge the generation gap.  Certain parents are incapable of communicating with the children with the result that the love which is so necessary for the full and proper development of the child is missing.  The young teenager tends, in such circumstances, to look elsewhere for the feeling of security and love that he or she needs. He tends to seek this love and security within his own age-group and, believing he has found it, gets married at a very young age without preparation of any kind.  Very often this type of situation leads to disaster and to the breakup of marriages, a problem that <Col N="1375" /> is very much on the increase among the young.</P>
    <P>In this country there are a number of community centres and councils that are endeavouring to combat this situation.  These groups are anxious particularly to have established preschool centres and day-nurseries so that parents can be involved with their children at the most important and effective time&mdash;while the children are very young&mdash;to a degree that was regarded previously as not being possible. Where this has been tried it has been found that in cases where parents failed on their own initiative to understand their children or where they did not appreciate the need for such understanding, they were delighted with the new circumstances and the children were assured of the love and security that are so essential for their well-being, both physical and mental.</P>
    <P>While I recognise that the school situation is not the direct responsibility of the Department of Social Welfare, nevertheless there should be close liaison between the Departments in this very important sphere of child care and the Department should provide finance to assist community care centres to develop the excellent work being done by them in this field.</P>
    <P>There is the problem also of the deserted husband.  The father of a young family whose wife deserts him is in a very difficult position.  One of his main problems is that of continuing to go to work while at the same time attending to the needs of the children.  Part of the solution to this problem might be the provision of home help.  Here again voluntary organisations can be of vital assistance, but from my experience of these community councils I am aware that they cannot operate as effectively as they would wish unless they have further financial assistance.  The amount of money available to them from the State and from local authority funds is very little.  Much greater financial help must be allotted to them if we are to endeavour as best we can to deal with this problem of <Col N="1376" /> desertion.  Apart from the provision of financial assistance we must endeavour also to eradicate the root causes of desertion.</P>
    <P>In the course of his speech the Parliamentary Secretary referred to the question of poverty research.  I commend this development because any scheme which will tend to throw light on the special problems of poverty is worthwhile.  However let me repeat what I have said already in my budget speech&mdash;that I would hope that this investigation of poverty areas would not be used as an excuse to overlook the very obvious poverty areas in our society or to put on the long finger any effort to overcome these problems.  I mention this because of the raging inflation that we are experiencing, inflation caused partly by Government policy and for which the Government must accept responsibility.  Most of those who are in receipt of social welfare payments are in a poverty situation. It is well to remember that shortly after the budget statement regarding social welfare provisions there was an increase in the price of butter, that the price of margarine increased phenomenally, that there were increases also in the prices of cooking fats and oils, that the price of milk increased and that bottled gas increased in price to an exceptional degree.  All of these are commodities which are used to a considerable extent by those on lower incomes.  Therefore in the announcements of price increases on one day the standard of living of people in the categories to which I am referring was reduced significantly.</P>
    <P>The first problem is to define what constitutes poverty and to get agreement on that definition.  This is essential if we are to make any progress towards the elimination of poverty. Without such a definition the phrase &ldquo;elimination of poverty&rdquo; can become a political catchcry, sounding well to the public ear but doing little to achieve the expressed aim.</P>
    <P>In order to eliminate poverty we must eliminate discrimination and in so far as possible ensure that equal opportunities are available to all.  Perhaps, then, it would be better if we referred to the elimination of poverties <Col N="1377" /> rather than to the elimination of poverty because there are many sources of poverty.  There is the poverty that arises from unemployment.  This is a very real poverty area and its elimination can be effected only by the development of our economic resources so as to provide increasing employment not only for those leaving school but for those who are on the unemployment register.  We must also probe deeply into the mental attitudes of people who have been out of employment for so long that they have given up the struggle and to whom even the offer of a job is not the solution.</P>
    <P>There is also territorial poverty, that is, poverty arising from the area in which people live.  For example, the position of people in the West of Ireland creates a particular problem because of lack of resources.  The question arises as to whether poverty in the West of Ireland means the same as poverty in so far as people in Dublin are concerned.  The question arises also whether we can treat in the same way the poverty situations that I have mentioned.  For instance, when we are allocating money for projects designed to assist in the elimination of poverty we would need to be careful in regard to making available money on the basis of density of population alone.  If the moneys were to be allocated on a population basis we could have, say, a situation in which £300,000 would be allocated to Dublin while only £3,000 might be allocated to Donegal.  While the amount of money allocated to Dublin might be sufficient to make some headway towards achieving the desired aim, the amount allotted to Donegal might be insufficient to make any progress in this direction.  For example, if we were concerned with health centres the amount of money allocated to Dublin might be very helpful while the amount allocated to Donegal might be useless.</P>
    <P>There is also the poverty of illness and of insurmountable physical and mental handicaps.  There is the poverty of the aged and the poverty which very often is associated with large families.  There is also poverty of isolation &mdash; the many people, particularly <Col N="1378" /> those living alone with no social support and who lack information and, therefore, are unable to make use of the facilities available to them. There is, too, education poverty.  It is a foregone conclusion that if a person is labelled as being disadvantaged or dependant, he will be left behind by the main stream of society.  The extent and influence of this cultural gap is highly individualised. No set programme can hope to close this gap in a short space of time.  One component, given our present social structure and future social expectations, holds the key.  In my view the greatest single structure which could be classified as a social equaliser giving freedom and responsibility to respond to the social needs is education. This is generally accepted.</P>

Deputies have not received copies of this statement or, indeed, any intimation of its contents.  Is the Parliamentary Secretary satisfied that that should be so?

I do not think in that condition of ignorance that I ought to make any statement about it or offer any explanation.  The Deputy will recall when this kind of matter was raised by the Leader of his party two or three weeks ago the arrangement was that the Whips on each side would consult as to how what is evidently an unsatisfactory arrangement in regard to the circulation of documents of this kind could be improved.

      <P>When the debate was adjourned last week I was saying that the first point raised by Deputy Andrews was invalidated instantly by the reply to the question which he asked me across the floor of the House, namely, where was the Attorney General?  The question was in connection with his allegation that once the office of Director of Public Prosecutions was created the position of the Attorney General would become redundant.  When I told Deputy Andrews that the Attorney General was in Norway in connection with the torture trial he admitted that that was an extremely important function and an important job for the Attorney General to be doing.</P>
      <P>In a very striking way it underlies the emptiness&mdash;and I do not mean that it was not seriously meant&mdash;of the criticism of Deputy Andrews in regard to this Bill.  The torture trial in connection with which the Attorney General was absent on that day has absorbed colossal quantities of the time of the Attorney General ever since the complaint was lodged, which was before the change of Government. I am told that the amount of time which that case alone has absorbed in the Attorney General's office is roughly equivalent to onehalf of the total volume of work on ordinary criminal prosecutions arising within this State, That gives, in very graphic form, a picture to the House of how the work in the Attorney General's office has exploded in recent times.  This single case alone has taken up half the total amount of the time of highly-qualified and responsible people, which time is devoted in an average year to criminal prosecutions arising within the jurisdiction.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In my opening statement I referred also to other sources from which an increased burden of work has accrued to the Attorney General and particularly to the work arising from our membership of EEC.  Perhaps even more important than that is the enhanced burden on the Attorney General in connection with advising the Government on legal matters which arise in connection with the <Col N="1381" /> situation in Northern Ireland and the situation as between us and the British in connection with Northern Ireland. The whole Sunningdale arrangement was preceded by an immense quantity of consultation and work to which the Attorney General was privy and which depended in no small measure on his advice in the months preceding it.  Although that peak has been passed there is no reason to assume that that kind of burden on the Attorney General is going to become less.</P>
    <P>The general picture, when one looks at the legal complexities arising from membership of the EEC and the increasing volume of legislation, all of which has to be referred to the Attorney General at drafting stage in some shape and form, the enormous demands imposed by a single case like the torture complaint before the European Court and the other very serious matters, in all of which the Attorney General is central, arising from the Northern Ireland situation, shows that what used to be his main function, namely, directing criminal prosecutions within the State, has shrunk by comparison with the whole and that the rest of his work is really almost more than enough for one man without the burden of ordinary criminal prosecutions having to be carried by him.  I hope if Deputy Andrews were here that he would agree that that disposes of the suggestion that the office of the Attorney General would become somewhat redundant once this director was appointed. It will not become redundant but the Attorney General will be free for carrying out extremely important tasks which are of national importance. He will be freed from the routine burden of considering the initiation and direction of public prosecutions.</P>
    <P>The debate last week was fairly acrimonious in places.  I do not want to bring it back to that level.  I would like to dispose at the outset of the most contentious matter raised by Deputies Andrews and O'Malley, namely, the matter of patronage. It particularly stuck in Deputy Andrews' craw that my opening statement had said that allegations of patronage <Col N="1382" /> in regard to the distribution of State work whether true or false tended to undermine confidence in the administration of justice.  He described it as a bit of hypocrisy and humbug that we should have said: &ldquo;whether true or false&rdquo; when we knew perfectly well that they were true.  I replied to him across the floor that I thought that reference was intended to be pacific &mdash; in other words, that it was intended to raise as few weals as possible.  Unfortunately in the report the word &ldquo;pacific&rdquo; has come through as &ldquo;specific&rdquo;, which takes all the sense out of it.</P>
    <P>What I intended to do was to keep away from a consideration in the House of how much basis there is for the allegations.  If Deputy Andrews wishes, I will freely admit that allegations of patronage have in very large measure been true and in small measure false.  If I were to pursue that line, I could keep the House here for the rest of the afternoon with a description of how matters stood under the former Administration, but I would sooner remain pacific.  Therefore, I will restrict myself to mentioning one or two matters on which he and Deputy O'Malley laid particular stress.</P>
    <P>The present Attorney General was accused of exercising a merciless system of patronage since he came into office 15 months ago.  Just as there is no use in Fianna Fáil denying that its principle political weapon at all levels and in all professions was patronage, there is no use in my denying that in the last 15 months Coalition supporters in the legal profession have certainly got the big end of State work.  There is no point trying to hide that fact, because it is true. Those Coalition supporters for the most part at all levels of seniority, senior and junior counsel alike, men who raised families, were people who under a fair and equitable system of the distribution of State work or of appointment of judges would either have been judges on their merits long ago&mdash;some of them have since become judges&mdash;or would have had their fair share of State work.</P>
    <P>The Attorney General announced shortly after he took office that he <Col N="1383" /> proposed to do away with the system of political patronage.  It would have been an act of superhuman virtue on his part had he, with the full intention of introducing this Bill, spent the remaining 15 months continuing in their lucrative positions the Fianna Fáil supporters who had been dining fatly and richly off the people of Ireland for the former 16 years while giving nothing to the people whose principles forbade them to appear to support Fianna Fáil even though they might have enhanced their own incomes very substantially by doing so. As I said, it would have been an act of superhuman virtue.  I am not so sure it would have even been virtue, but it would not have seemed so to the men who had felt themselves not only passed over but humiliated in the eyes of their profession by being thrown aside by those to whom they had struck through thick and thin.</P>
    <P>I admit, and this would be as true of the Fianna Fáil side as it would be of ours, that in all matters of patronage it is not very often so much the money that counts as recognition. There have been cases in the last 15 months of gentlemen, supporters of the Fine Gael or Labour Parties, who got State work who never had it before, after perhaps 20 or 25 years practice at the Bar.  They did not get very much but what little they got was enough to reassure them that at least their refusal to go along with a side which used to boast freely that they would never be put out of office, and their willingness to put up therefore with never getting State work, had been recognised once the Government changed.  I hope that will not seem like a sophistical defence of patronage, although I am afraid there may be a trace of that in it.  I would not support the continuance of that system and I am thoroughly in favour of ending it.</P>
    <P>So much stress was laid here last week on what has happened over the last year that I must ask the House, in fairness, to consider whether the Attorney General would not have been thought to be doing wrong had he continued what was a blatant injustice over the previous 16 years and <Col N="1384" /> if he had neglected to give the big end of State work to the men who, because of their political affiliations, had been left out of State work for 16 years.</P>
    <P>When we talk about State work we are not talking about work of a political nature or work in which there is a political dimension, which in the nature of things would require that the advocate should be a political supporter of the party in power.  Of course, there are such cases.  We are talking about cases which have no political dimension but which were cases involving public interest, as all criminal prosecutions do and in which the people of Ireland are entitled to the best service that can be got.</P>
    <P>It is far from me to imply that the gentlemen briefed by Fianna Fáil were not competent.  I believe the majority of them were and are competent to do State work.  What I say is that the pool from which prosecuting talent was drawn was the pool not of the Irish Bar but of the Irish Bar less those of its members who happened to support Fine Gael or Labour&mdash;in other words, half of the Bar. That, of course, represents a wrong way of doing the public's business because you are not getting the best brains available from the whole pool; you are only getting the best brains available from half the pool.  Apart from the individual unfairness to the men concerned who were being penalised for their principles, there was an unfairness to the people of Ireland who were being denied a service, whether on the bench or as State advocates, of roughly half the barristers' profession.</P>
    <P>I acknowledge gladly that the last Fianna Fáil Attorney General enjoyed esteem among his colleagues and that there was a slight loosening of the ruthlessness which characterised the distribution of State work when I was at the Bar, some 12 or 13 years ago.  I acknowledge that and would not begrudge that admission.  I do not go along with the impression created by Deputy Andrews that the element of political patronage had totally disappeared under the Fianna Fáil Administration. Anybody who studies the figures which are elicited in this <Col N="1385" /> House year by year of money paid for State briefs can make the computation himself.  He will see that gentlemen prominently identified with Fianna Fáil&mdash;that is men who are high up with Fianna Fáil&mdash;got in State work over a period of two, three or four years sums like £20,000 or £30,000.  There were others who did not, who were far lower on the scales. There were some Fianna Fáil supporters, such as Deputy O'Kennedy who admitted it here openly, who were never on the State panel.  I do not know how the former Attorney General arranged his affairs.  I acknowledge freely that he enjoyed steem from the whole profession.  I acknowledge also that some State work was given to people who were not his political allies but the really big end of State work was reserved for the legion of the rearguard.  That is the simple fact of the matter.  I cannot let Deputy Andrews get away with the suggestion that we are only now institutionalising a system of fairness which Fianna Fáil, in fact, had practised. They did not practise it.  They did not pretend to practise it.</P>
    <P>The last point I want to mention in regard to this question of patronage was raised by Deputies Andrews and O'Malley who described it as hypocrisy that we should be introducing this Bill.  I must say that though I make every allowance for the fact that it is a new experience for Fianna Fáil to find a Bill being introduced in this House which shatters in the hands of any and every Government a very powerful political weapon&mdash;it must be a new and uncomfortable feeling for Fianna Fáil to find that happening and to find themselves deprived of that weapon when they are next back in power&mdash;making all allowance for that, I have to say that it is a new definition of hypocrisy to me that you should be called a hypocrite for reforming a bad practice of which you yourself are not entirely guiltless.  How is that hypocrisy?  I understand the word &ldquo;hypocrisy&rdquo; roughly to mean preaching one thing and practising another.</P>
    <P>That is not what we are doing here. We are preaching one thing and practising <Col N="1386" /> it.  We are preaching one thing and ceasing to practice the other. That is what has been called hypocrisy. The word &ldquo;hypocrisy&rdquo; has been strung out so much in politics that it has been devalued to the point of being worthless, and I do not take it at all too seriously when I hear it coming from that side.  I do not suppose they take it too seriously when they hear it coming from us.  However, I must say that this is a usage of the word which is quite new to me &mdash;that a man who takes it on himself to reform a practice, of which he himself has not been completely guiltless in the past, should be called a hypocrite. If you are to preach about reform and do nothing about it, that would be hypocrisy, and that is a charge which we often enough have had to level at the other side.  When something is done about it when it need not have been done, when you deprive yourself of the means to carry on this ill-practice when you could, if you wished, have held on to it, how is that hypocrisy?  If it comes within the four corners of order, I should like one of those Deputies to explain that at a later stage of the Bill's passage.</P>
    <P>A fair number of fairly serious points were made by the three Opposition Deputies who spoke.  I will deal with them as well as I can.  I have drawn the attention of the Attorney General to all of them&mdash;I understand he will conduct the Committee Stage of the debate.  I have drawn all these points to his attention and, of course, he has read the debate as well.  In the meantime, I can give the Government's answer to the more substantial points.</P>
    <P>Deputy Andrews spoke about the provisions in the Bill regarding the qualifications for becoming a Director of Public Prosecutions.  His view was that the only person who could be acceptable was a barrister with wide experience of criminal work.  I accepted that serious argument, perhaps even an appealing one, but I should just like the Deputy to know the Government's reason for sponsoring the section in the form in which it is. The Government felt that the choice <Col N="1387" /> of Director should be left as wide as possible.  It seems to me, for example, that Deputy Andrew's argument&mdash;I do not know whether he has considered this or not&mdash;would exclude from consideration for the post of Director anyone who was a solicitor. Solicitors plead in criminal cases only in the inferior courts&mdash;they are very seldom seen on their feet in the High Court or the Supreme Court.</P>
    <P>The argument of Deputy Andrews would exclude solicitors, and although it might easily be, looking into the future, that not many solicitors would be even interested in this post or would be likely to apply for it or would even be likely to be appointed if they did apply, the Government felt it would be wrong to narrow the choice to exclude from consideration automatically somebody who might be a very good choice.  That is why the qualifications have been drawn so widely.  Although, as the House knows, I do not believe in taking examples from the English when we have clear indications in our own country of what the right thing to do is, it may not be irrelevant to remark that of the four Directors of Public Prosecutions there so far have been in Britain, two have been solicitors. Although it is not orderly to mention names even of non-nationals, one of those solicitor Directors of Public Prosecutions is admitted to have been the most distinguished they have had and was regarded in the legal profession in Britain as having established the post for good in a position of high regard in the public eye.</P>
    <P>Needless to say that is not necessarily a headline for us, but the Government's feeling, rightly or wrongly, was that the qualifications should be drawn as widely as possible so as to give the Government and the selection committee as wide a field of choice as possible.</P>
    <P>I should like to emphasise that there is envisaged in the Bill a very high powered committee to advise the Government on this appointment and although it is true that the Government are not bound by the provisions of the Bill to follow the committee's <Col N="1388" /> decision, or to appoint only a person named by the committee&mdash;I think it is the practice in legislation that a Minister or the Government are not ever compelled to follow the advice given him or them&mdash;it seems to me entirely unlikely as a practical proposition that this Government or any Government would ignore the recommendation, which can be of more than one name, sent up by this committee.</P>
    <P>Under section 2 (7), the committee will consist of the Chief Justice, the Chairman of the General Council of the Bar of Ireland, the President of the Incorporated Law Society, the Secretary to the Government and a senior legal assistant in the office of the Attorney General.  Does anyone in the House seriously imagine that a committee consisting of the Chief Justice and the Chairman of the Bar Council are likely to allow a name to go forward of somebody grossly incompetent or even partly incompetent in the matter of directing public prosecutions?  It seems to me to be a totally unlikely proposition.  I concede that the section does not require the Government to accept the committee's recommendation, but I am sure the Opposition spokesman will admit as a practical matter that it is highly unlikely the Government would ever depart from the name or number of names submitted to them by the committee. I think the committee are a guarantee that, so far as a man's quality or work can ever be gauged beforehand for a particular job, no fool, no bigot, no megalomaniac, no pedant will ever be appointed to this post.  The person appointed to this post will be somebody who, taking all things into consideration, including legal experience, will be the person whom this very broadly based committee think to be the best qualified.</P>
    <P>I do not wish to make little of the argument of Deputy Andrews&mdash;I realise it was seriously meant &mdash; but for what it is worth, that is the Government's view&mdash;the reason behind the section standing as it is.</P>
    <P>The Deputy also mentioned the possibility of a conflict between the Attorney General and the Director of Public Prosecutions because of what he <Col N="1389" /> took to be the disjunctive effect of Article 30.3 of the Constitution which provides that crimes and offences are to be prosecuted at the suit of the Attorney General or some other person authorised in accordance with law to act for that purpose.  It is not to me, I confess, absolutely clear whether the Article has the disjunctive effect that the Deputy attributed to it, but even assuming he is right I cannot see as a practical proposition that any danger is likely to arise from the possibility that in the two cases reserved to the Attorney General in regard to reference of matters to the Supreme Court, the possibility of a conflict is a very serious one.</P>
    <P>Even putting it at its worst, even if one were to say there might be a conflict and there will be a conflict, as I see the Bill what it means is that if either of them wishes the point to be referred further upwards for consideration by the Supreme Court, it will be done even though the other might not have wished to do it.  That may be a situation of tension within the Attorney General's office but it is not a national disaster.  If these two law officers are in doubt or in dispute as to whether a point should be raised further upwards, the balance should go in favour of the officer who wishes it referred up.</P>
    <P>Certainly if I am right in looking at the section as exposing that possibility, I would defend that interpretation of it, and I cannot see that the public interest could possibly suffer from having a point of law decided at a higher level.  However, again I recognise it is a serious point and is seriously intended, and I know the Attorney General will have given it serious thought and that when the section has reached the Committee Stage the Deputy will be answered more fully.</P>
    <P>Deputy O'Malley and Deputy Andrews thought that the idea of allowing a subordinate officer to exercise the functions of the Director or the Attorney General in this context might be unconstitutional.  Section 4 (1) (a) provides:</P>
    <P>A law officer may direct any of his professional officers to perform on his behalf and in accordance <Col N="1390" /> with his instructions any particular function of the law officer in relation to a particular case or cases or in all cases in which that function falls to be performed.</P>
    <P>Deputy Andrews said this is possibly unconstitutional because Article 30.3 is specifically designed to exclude such delegation.  Again I accept that as a serious point and certainly the Attorney General will deal with it in great detail when the section is reached. But I would respectfully disagree with the Deputy.  I do not read that subarticle in that way at all.  The Article only says that crimes and offences are to be prosecuted at the suit of the Attorney General or now the Director of Prosecutions when this Bill is enacted.  Of course in the citation of the case a prosecutor will still appear as the Attorney General or the Director of Public Prosecutions. There is nothing in the Article which prevents a subordinate official of the attorney or of the director from doing all the necessary work in the office, so to speak, on the basis of which the Attorney General or the Director puts his name to the prosecution.</P>
    <P>The argument is correct to this extent that the person who is responsible for the prosecution is the Attorney General or the Director, they cannot constitutionally escape that responsibility, but the preliminary work leading up to the final decision to institute the prosecution is effectively already done by members of the Attorney General's staff, and all that is being done is institutionalising that situation.  I cannot see&mdash;I do not say this in a contentious spirit&mdash;that Article 30.3 is breached by that, because the person at whose suit the prosecution is being brought will still be the person envisaged by Article 30.3, namely, the Attorney General or the Director of Public Prosecutions.</P>
    <P>The last point in regard to the Director himself and his position was raised by Deputy de Valera, who said he thought the Director should change like the Attorney General with a change of Government.  It was a quite new point not raised either by Deputy Andrews or Deputy O'Malley, and I <Col N="1391" /> presume Deputy de Valera will pursue it here again on the Committee Stage. To him it seems a fairly basic flaw in the Bill that this civil servant&mdash; because he will be a civil servant&mdash; should be privy to what he thought was a political function during the tenure of one Government and should then be expected to turn round and exercise his job from a quite different political perspective.</P>
    <P>That is not how the Government see the office of Director of Public Prosecutions at all.  The political content in his work will be very small; in fact, it will be non-existent except in so far as routine prosecutions are brought under an Act which itself has got a political complexion, and of course that Act should be applied by all Governments so long as it remains an Act.  If it is not, is it a matter of reproach to that Government and has been here in this House a matter of reproach in the past in circumstances of which the House is well aware.</P>
    <P>This civil servant is, I think rightly established as such.  I think it would be quite wrong if it were somebody who changed with the Government going out of office because that would identify him clearly as a political creature.  That would be wrong because it would encourage the public to do what this Bill is designed to discourage.  It would encourage the public to believe that political pressure or political croneyism of some sort brought to bear on the Director of Public Prosecutions could be effective.  Since naturally he himself would, because he would lose his job as soon as the Government went out, have an interest in holding on, it would instantly give him an interest in bending to that political pressure brought in favour of some member, at high or low level, of the party which is then in power.  Therefore I cannot see, with all respect to Deputy de Valera, the faintest substance in his argument.  I can understand the steps by which he reached it, but I think the argument is more than counterbalanced by the obvious damage to the public interest and the stultification of the main purpose of this Bill which <Col N="1392" /> would result if the Director of Public Prosecutions remained a political creature who would change with each change of political fortune.</P>
    <P>There are just two other points I want to deal with.  They both arise out of the provision in section 6 connected with the making of communications or representations&mdash;the House will forgive me if I say &ldquo;representations&rdquo; because that is what they are &mdash;to persons who have a function in the institution of prosecutions.  The purpose of this section was to prevent people, except the very large category of exempted persons, from making representations in regard to the institution of criminal prosecutions. Let me begin by putting some emphasis on what was overlooked by the Opposition.  The class of persons who still may make such representations is very large and absolutely adequate for all legitimate purposes. Communications or representations can still be made by people as described in the Bill:</P>

      <P>Deputy Browne may like to hear what Deputy O'Malley said.  I made a note of it; on a couple of points he said the opposite to what had been previously said by Deputy <Col N="1393" /> Andrews.  This is what Deputy O'Malley said at column 857, Volume 273, of the Official Report of 11th June, 1974.  I had interjected that the Minister for Justice had no function whatever in the matter of influencing the bringing or non-bringing of prosecutions and that there was no reason to include him here among the list of people at the beginning of section 6.  I had said the Minister for Justice was not there because he had no function in the matter.  Deputy O'Malley replied : &ldquo;Having been there for three years&rdquo;&mdash; he means in the Department of Justice &mdash;&ldquo;I am well aware that the Minister for Justice has not such a function but, unfortunately, one could never convince the public of that or indeed Members of this House&rdquo;.  That is the answer to Deputy Browne and to Deputy Esmonde with whom, possibly for geographical reasons, he shares a common point of view.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanBrowne" hpid="Mr. Browne Mr. Browne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>Surely the Minister is there to receive representations when they are honestly meant and given even if he has not any great function?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMKelly" hpid="Mr. Kelly Mr. Kelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>The Government's point here &mdash; and, again, we are not supermen; we could be wrong and Deputy Browne could be right&mdash;is not that Deputies are corrupt or could be corrupted or are not able to distinguish between a deserving and a non-deserving case.  That is not the point.  That is a subsidiary point altogether.  The point is that for so long as Deputies and Ministers can be approached to try to get prosecutions stopped&mdash;even though the Deputies or Ministers may ignore these representations or not pursue them if they feel the case is not well founded&mdash;the public cannot be convinced that it was not politics that resulted in a particular person not being prosecuted while somebody else was.  And, when I say the public, naturally I do not mean 100 per cent of the public but everyone knows&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnMKelly" hpid="Mr. Kelly Mr. Kelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to flap this in the face of my constituents if I get that kind of representation and I shall have to take the consequences.</P>
      <P>Deputy O'Malley admitted that the Minister for Justice was under pressure even though he has no function in the matter at all.  He admitted that Members of this House were also. We all know it is true.  It is not a question of it being insulting to Members of the House to exclude them from the possibility of making communications; that is not the point. The point is that it is important to remove from the public mind the idea that communications channelled via somebody who is sensitive to them because of his dependence on political support can have an effect on the institution of a criminal prosecution, either by way of having it brought or, as is much more often the object, not having it brought.  That is the object of the exercise from the Government's point of view.  It is not to try to make life easier for Deputies but to try to reform the public mind in regard to the regularity of justice, to correct the public impression that because So-and-So was friendly with Deputy X or Councillor Y he was never prosecuted on that drunken driving charge, whereas his neighbour down the road, who was on the wrong political side, was prosecuted.  As Deputy Browne knows, that kind of allegation is flung around, certainly wrongly.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I will concede, so far as I am aware anyway, that considerations like this have not weighted in the Attorney General's office, under this or the previous Government, in regard to the <Col N="1395" /> bringing of prosecutions.  But the public cannot be persuaded of that and the object of this section is to do so.  The object is to persuade the public that there is no future in going to their elected representatives unless the elected representatives fall within the categories envisaged by subsection (2) simultaneously with being public representatives.  There is no point in going to them asking them to stop a prosecution because the Deputy can say: &ldquo;Look, it is unlawful for me to have anything to do with this, good or bad and, even if I do, it is going to be torn up as soon as it reaches the table of the official responsible.  If I make a representation, the official's duty, under this section is to tear it up.&rdquo; The point, I think, has gone through in regard to the Civil Service Commission although I can see Deputy Browne beginning to smile again&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanBrowne" hpid="Mr. Browne Mr. Browne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>I am thinking of a certain major company in this country which allowed everybody make representations to it, except elected representatives, as far as employment <i>et cetera</i> was concerned.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMKelly" hpid="Mr. Kelly Mr. Kelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>Was it a private company?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanBrowne" hpid="Mr. Browne Mr. Browne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>It was a semi-State company but everybody was honest. That was the way the thing read. This will probably read likewise as far as the public are concerned.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMKelly" hpid="Mr. Kelly Mr. Kelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not know about this company.  I do not know what company the Deputy has in mind and I shall not comment on it.  But there is somewhat of a difference between the importance of establishing, in the public mind, the incorruptibility and immunity from political influence of the judicial process and the question of employment in a company.  They are both important but one is infinitely more so than the other.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It was said also by Deputy Andrews that it was foolish to enact a section which contained no sanction.  It is true that section 6 does not make it a criminal offence to make a representation <Col N="1396" /> about a prosecution.  It simply declares it to be unlawful.  It is not true that the section contains no sanction.  As I have already pointed out, there is implicit in it a very serious sanction, namely, service discipline for a member of the service or any of the persons involved in instituting a prosecution who receives representations.  Clearly, that is a serious breach of his duty and is specifically made so now even if it was not implied so before.  As I said in my opening statement, the reason why a criminal sanction is not being attached to the making of representations is the hope that the fact that it is unlawful&mdash;even without a sanction &mdash; will sink in and make itself felt with the public.  If it does not sink in, the Government will not hesitate, at a convenient moment, to attach a sanction to this particular act of unlawfulness.</P>
    <P>It was felt also that it might be thought harsh or unfair of the Oireachtas to, as it were, spring a new offence on the public, particularly when the act constituting the offence had for so long been regarded as part of the day's work if anyone belonging to you or supporting you politically was in trouble with the law.  It was felt it might be harsh to institute this offence, more or less overnight, the sense of which would take some time to percolate down and which would involve the prosecution, if the law were enforced, of a large number of people who would not have been conscious of having done anything wrong. It would take some time for this to percolate and it is the duty of all Members of this House to make sure that it does percolate.  If it fails to percolate and if the situation seems to warrant it, the Government will not hesitate to give the section greater teeth than it possesses now.</P>
    <P>The last point of a specific kind I want to make arises from that also. Deputy Andrews, when I told him it was not true to say that the section contained no sanction, when I pointed out that there was an implicit sanction in the fact that a breach of duty by a member of the, broadly speaking, public service, the people envisaged in section 6 subsection (1) would <Col N="1397" /> automatically expose him to discipline, said this was discrimination. That was his instant reply.  It is a good advocate's instant thinking on his feet but there is no substance in it because, of course, there can be a transaction&mdash;and there are plenty of examples of it already&mdash;which, on the part of one person to it, is not criminal or, perhaps, even blameable but, on the part of another person to it, would be highly so.  That is not unusual.  Examples of it exist in life all around us.  I shall not bore the House with instances.  They will come readily to mind to any Deputy who reflects on it, but the simple and short answer to Deputy Andrews is that discrimination, in the legal sense, namely, not treating two citizens alike, not treating people as being on the same footing in the eye of the law, does not exist because Article 40.1 of the Constitution, where it mentions the equality of citizens before the law says: &ldquo;This shall not be held to mean that the State shall not in its enactments have due regard to differences of capacity, physical and moral, and of social function&rdquo;.  Of course, there is a difference of social function in the sense of Article 40.1 between a citizen who makes a representation and a police officer who receives it.  That seems to me to be as clear as daylight.  That alone would rebut the idea that, in the implicit existence of a sanction for a member of the Garda, or somebody in the Attorney General's or Director's office who receives the representation and the non-existence of any sanction for somebody who makes the representation, any discrimination is visible.  If it is there, I certainly cannot see it.</P>
    <P>That is all I wanted to say in reply to most of the important individual points raised by Deputies from the far side of the House.  In spite of the rancour of their contributions in regard to the patronage question I should like to thank them for the serious way in which the substance of the Bill was treated and to promise that all their points have been considered and will be further debated with the seriousness they deserve when the Attorney General handles the Committee Stage debate.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1398" /> In conclusion, I should like to draw the attention of the House to the fact that this Bill, viewed as a whole, represents an immensely important departure in the legislative and public life of this country.  It may not have struck home to observers that this is the case, but I do not know of any Bill that has gone so far towards reforming the operation of public life in the broadest sense by making patronage impossible and gone so far towards reforming public morality by discouraging the making of representations which very often are based on genuine compassion and the knowledge of genuine extenuating circumstances but often enough also based on the fact that somebody is a political friend or supporter.  It is a huge break-through, if it works.  I sincerely hope it will.  Its importance cannot be exaggerated because, once passed, this Bill will be a headline for what I hope will be a succession of similar Bills designed to raise the general level of political existence and, of course, of the immunity of the judicial function and the political atmosphere generally of this Republic.  I commend it to the House.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Faulkner</NameTxt>
      <P>When I reported progress I was speaking on the poverty research programme and I mentioned that education was one of the most important matters in our efforts to eliminate poverty.  Special educational facilities and opportunities must be provided for young people living in disadvantaged circumstances and also for older people who have not opportunities in earlier life through adult education programmes.</P>
      <P>Much can be learned from the Rutland Street project where the State, with the assistance of the Van Leer foundation, has been carrying out experiments over a number of years in an effort to provide a suitable educational programme for children who have not the advantages in our society to develop to their full potential.  As time goes on and what has been learned there has been applied in other areas we shall begin to overcome this aspect of poverty.  It was noted particularly in this programme that once the parents understood what was involved they involved themselves deeply in it and became more anxious that their children should have a chance in life denied to many of themselves.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The children themselves advanced to a stage where they could compete educationally with other children of the same age group in better-off areas. This is one area where much can be done to help to eliminate poverty and its root causes.  It can be done through <Col N="1400" /> applying the knowledge gained in the Rutland Street project, through reducing the size of classes, the provision of more remedial teachers and thereby focusing the attention of the young people and their parents on the means whereby they can have a better future. In this way, not only will we be endeavouring to reach a position of equality in educational opportunities but we shall be training our young people to make the best possible use of the facilities for advancement which are available and which they often fail to use.</P>
    <P>Further, it will be necessary to continue the efforts being made over the years to change the emphasis from the academic to vocational and technical education.  There are further aspects of this matter we could consider: what are the norms to be attained? Are we concerned with the development of the human being or the development of the social class? The system should be responsive to poverty and we should not try to impose a social structure.  In other words, it would be quite wrong when dealing with people involved in poverty situations simply to ask ourselves: &ldquo;Why are they not like us?&rdquo; and then base our proposals on attempting to make them just like us.</P>
    <P>We should also remember that people are very sensitive to being on the receiving end of assistance and we must take care how we make them the subject of poverty programmes. The effect of labelling a person must be considered.  Careful planning is a fundamental necessity.  Recently we have been including more people on boards dealing with matters in which they are involved.  For example, we now have students on the governing bodies of Universities.  Equally, there is need to involve the people affected in these poverty programmes because nobody can have the same appreciation of what it means to be deprived or discriminated against as the person who is himself deprived.  He may not have the solution : indeed one of his great problems is a feeling of helplessness, but he has an awareness of the situation which people in better circumstances do not have.</P>
    <P>I remember hearing of the reaction <Col N="1401" /> of a social worker involved in helping those unable to help themselves to a project undertaken by a young man who lived in London and who decided that he would live as a down-and-out for a few weeks to experience for himself how people lived in such circumstances. The social worker's reaction was that while this man might learn something he would miss the most important element.  Because he knew this sort of life for him would end shortly he could not feel the hopelessness which a man who was really in that situation would feel.</P>
    <P>We should try to involve the people themselves and have a local tie-up with voluntary bodies and their professional helpers.  Obviously training is most necessary if we are to involve people who are in this situation. It will be appreciated that it is unlikely that people who are in this type of situation would be able to give very much assistance if they were not trained but nevertheless we should try to involve them in this particular programme.</P>
    <P>Research into poverty and other such programes have been carried out in other countries but, so far as I can gather, they have not been a conspicuous success.  Very often the most positive result was that those engaged in the studies learned what not to do. I suggest to the Parliamentary Secretary&mdash;I am sure it is being done&mdash; that the committee might, with considerable benefit, carefully study some of the programmes to learn from them and to avoid the pitfalls which caused some of them to be counter-productive.</P>
    <P>There is little doubt that much poverty is caused by unemployment and the development and improvement of the economy to create more jobs is a basic element in the fight against poverty.  Seán Lemass had a saying that is relevant here, namely, &ldquo;a rising tide lifts all boats&rdquo;.  While we recognise that poverty has many other faces, we must agree that the elimination of unemployment would go quite a considerable way to break the back of the problem.  Therefore, training in technical skills is a must. Young people must be educated for flexibility and we must try to understand <Col N="1402" /> the attitudes of those we regard as unemployable.  It is only by understanding these attitudes that we can ever hope to create the conditions to change them.  For instance, when itinerants are properly housed and looked after, they take up work in industrial and other types of employment and prove themselves exceptionally good at their work where previously they would not settle down to what we would regard as employment.</P>
    <P>We should also remember that many of the people who are in a poverty situation do not realise another kind of life exists and, of necessity, they lack the motivation to reach out for it.  Because they lack the understanding of other type situations they have little or no hope.  They see another kind of life around but it means nothing to them.  They are convinced it is not for them and is something to which they cannot aspire.  There is a huge public relations job to be done. There is a product, we know what it is, and we must sell it to those who do not understand or appreciate it.  This is of the utmost importance if we are to make real progress.  We must enable people who are living in poverty to appreciate that there is a life that is different and is attainable.</P>
    <P>We must make the opportunities available to those who are capable of helping themselves, and also we must help those who are unable because of inadequate personalities to accept them.  In the case of an inadequate person, very often money is not put to the best use.  We must rehabilitate those with personality difficulties, to provide more money and make available education in its broadest sense to provide equal opportunities. The Parliamentary Secretary was not present when I mentioned that in relation to the programme generally one of the most significant factors was education.  It is the social equaliser.</P>
    <P>We must endeavour to overcome the futility experienced by those living in poverty, the feeling that there is no way out.  We must try to get them to understand the system, to assimilate them into the mainstream of the system by making it flexible <Col N="1403" /> enough to absorb them.  We must recognise the need for counselling to eliminate the psychological disadvantage of poverty.  We must accept the people concerned as a viable part of the community without a tag.  If you tag people you immediately make them a people apart.</P>
    <P>I wish the committee well in the work they have undertaken and I have no doubt it will rebound to the advantage of the underprivileged.  I recommend the inclusion on the committee of people who are in the poverty situation after they have received the necessary training.  In case the Parliamentary Secretary might get an unbalanced view of what I have said, I was speaking about poverty for some time prior to the time progress was reported.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PadraigFaulkner" hpid="Mr. Faulkner Mr. Faulkner">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Faulkner</NameTxt>
      <P>The whole question of physical and mildly mentally handicapped should be examined, not only in relation to the amount of money being made available but, more particularly, in relation to employment. The Parliamentary Secretary also referred to this matter in his speech. This may not appear relevant to the discussion on this Estimate and I will be brief.  I believe it is relevant because for some time this country and the other member countries of the EEC&mdash;and this was underlined in the statement on social policy issued at the summit meeting of the six original countries some time ago&mdash;have been concerned not only with the payments to social welfare recipients but also with improving the quality of life for them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If we can ensure employment for physically and mentally handicapped people, we are doing something for them that social payments in themselves cannot do.  We are accepting them as worthwhile and useful citizens and are raising them in their own estimation to a point where their whole outlook towards life changes for the better and where they can <Col N="1404" /> reach a state of fulfilment that otherwise they could not have known.  I know that some may be critical of me in making a statement that in circumstances where we give to the handicapped their rights we will be accepting them as worthwhile and useful citizens, but the cruel fact is that when we do not ensure their right to employment we are condemning them to believe that they are not capable of developing as they should and can develop.</P>
    <P>I am aware that many handicapped people are employed and that voluntary organisations are doing exceptional work in this area but we should ensure by legislation that a reasonable number is employed.  I have never met a handicapped person who was anxious that he be employed simply because of his disablement but I have met many handicapped people who believe they can make a worthwhile contribution to the development of their country in all its aspects and are anxious to be given an opportunity of doing so.</P>
    <P>Therefore, I would ask the Parliamentary Secretary to convey to the Minister, and through him to the Government, that we should not only make available cash payments to handicapped people but endeavour to ensure their right to work and to attain full maturity.  I know I will have the full sympathy of the Parliamentary Secretary in this.  I do not wish to go into this matter in any great detail.</P>
    <P>The disabilities of the blind, the deaf and the disabled are obvious. They are placed in a special category with need for treatment above the ordinary.  One can imagine the fear of poverty that goes with the loss of sight in later life.  This fear must be dispelled.  The nearly blind person must be assured that he can live in reasonable comfort in the future.  The needs of the blind and other physically handicapped people should be properly assessed, and here the help of voluntary organisations should be sought. This assessment should include not only the objective of helping the individual but also of helping his family to understand, for example, the effects <Col N="1405" /> of visual handicap and how to live with it successfully.  Blind children and their parents require very special attention.</P>
    <P>The introduction of the pay-related benefits scheme was a significant step forward in the development of our social insurance system.  While we cannot hold that there was anything particularly new in the proposals which had already been a part, in one form or another, of schemes in operation in the EEC countries, nevertheless it constituted another move in the right direction in the evolution of our social security system.  The scheme was devised to make adequate provision against loss of income by insured workers and their families during periods of illness and unemployment. While it is a fact that we had down through the years been making very considerable improvements in the flat-rate benefits, it was obvious that it was not possible within the system as it stood to adequately provide for people whose earnings differed widely, resulting in different levels of financial commitments. It is a fact that people tend to live up to the level of their own particular income.</P>
    <P>They very often make plans related to that income without a thought of possible unemployment or ill health. In fact they very often have no alternative. They enter into mortgage arrangements in the knowledge that if they remain in good health and if they remain employed they will be able to meet their commitments.  It is a very frightening experience when the breadwinner in the family, having entered into those commitments, suddenly finds his income reduced drastically. He is no longer able to meet his commitments.  Not only does this affect his present position but very often its effects are carried over many years of his life because having been forced into debt, very often through no fault of his own, he finds that even when he returns to work he is unable for years to catch up with the backlog of debt.  This has a very serious impact on himself and on his family and very often of itself it induces illhealth. For these reasons and for many others, the efforts in this <Col N="1406" /> scheme to improve the position by relating both benefits and contributions to earnings to some degree and to provide rates of benefit which will better enable people to maintain a standard of living during sickness and unemployment reasonably close to that to which they were accustomed is very welcome.</P>
    <P>In introducing the pay-related benefits scheme it was clearly indicated that this was just a beginning in this particular field.  In the Bill it was proposed to supplement unemployment benefit, disability benefit, maternity allowance and occupational injuries benefit.  This was intended only as a beginning.  The framework is there to extend the scope of the scheme quite considerably and close attention should be paid to the provision of means and methods by which it can be extended as soon as it gets under way in respect of its original specific provisions.  I am referring here to complementary schemes of pay-related contributory pensions, retirement pensions, invalidity pensions, widows' pensions and so on.  The Parliamentary Secretary also mentioned the question of the self-employed.  This is a question which is of vital importance and I am glad to note that he proposes to operate some pilot schemes in relation to this matter.</P>
    <P>One of the most traumatic experiences in the life of any human being is to be told at a relatively young age that he is no longer employable because of age.  This is a time of very rapid change.  Men and women are becoming redundant in their present jobs for a variety of reasons&mdash;the introduction of automation, the fact that the trades which they have are going out of date and so on.  It is not so long ago since a person serving his time to a particular trade regarded this as training for life.  That day is gone and it is reckoned that most people will have to train and retrain two or three times in their working lives.  I am aware of the excellent work that is being done in this regard. However, many will not have the opportunity to retrain and even some of those who retrain may not procure new employment.  I recognise <Col N="1407" /> that this is not, strictly speaking, a matter for the Parliamentary Secretary but I want to make the point that many people find themselves at a relatively early age being told that they are too old when they apply for work and one of the reasons given is that the company concerned have a pension scheme and they say it would not be possible for administrative or financial reasons to include the person at, possibly, age of 40 in the pension scheme and that therefore they cannot employ him.</P>
    <P>This may be a matter for another Department but I feel very strongly about it.  I would urge the Parliamentary Secretary, if it is his function, to look into it with a view to rectifying a deplorable situation.  When a person becomes redundant or leaves his employment, in the vast majority of cases his pension contributions are handed back in the form of a lump sum which is a relatively small amount.  Such contributions should be transferable to new employment so that he could have continuity of pension rights and that one stumbling block to his future employment would be removed.  I came across this excuse for refusing to employ men as young as 40 years of age.  Whether it is real in substance or whether it is only an excuse I cannot be certain, but I would like to see it removed as an excuse.  I am not pretending this is a simple problem. The difficulties are there but they are not insurmountable.  Apart altogether from the question of employment it is not right that a worker who has had the prospect for many years of getting a pension at the end of his active working life should see his hopes of this pension dashed for one reason or another over which he has no control.</P>
    <P>In the course of his speech the Parliamentary Secretary referred to the need to inform citizens of their rights. I want again to put on the record that I am very strongly in favour of this.  I differed from the Parliamentary Secretary about the manner in which it was being done; I expressed my views on it, which are not only my views but the views of others.  Nevertheless, <Col N="1408" /> this is not to be taken as being opposed to ensuring that all those who are entitled to benefit under the social welfare code should have full information on this matter. I would like to see the format of the advertisements changed to eradicate any feeling there might be that there is any political content in them.</P>
    <P>Voluntary organisations can be of very considerable help in disseminating this type of information.  Perhaps the Parliamentary Secretary could make use of the branch managers in the social welfare field.  They could be asked to provide information centres in their offices to deal not only with unemployment benefit and assistance but also with other aspects of social welfare benefit.  The information could be got across in this way because those people live in the smaller towns. They are well known to the people and even though they do not deal directly with other benefits or types of assistance they are very often asked to give that type of information. There could be a close liaison between the home assistance officers and the branch managers regarding the alleviation of hardship on the spot where hold-ups occur for technical reasons.</P>
    <P>The Parliamentary Secretary, when replying to the debate on the Social Welfare Bill, said he thought the local pensions committees were not of much assistance.  Whatever the Parliamentary Secretary's attitude in relation to these is I ask him at present at least to consider a change in the format of the document which is sent by the committees to applicants.  This often states that the committee have awarded the applicant the pension and gives the amount, but underneath it is pointed out that the pension officer has appealed against the committee's decision.  I ask for this change because the applicant does not usually read the small print and when he gets the document he is convinced that he has been awarded the pension.  As the Parliamentary Secretary will appreciate, his disappointment is great when in cases such as this he is later informed that he is not entitled to a pension or is entitled to a much lesser amount that he originally thought.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1409" /> When dealing with the older people in our community we should try to avoid this type of thing.  I was, for a considerable length of time a member of an old age pension committee.  Our committee worked well but some committees do not.  Our basic consideration must be the old people and, having examined the matter carefully, I am sure the Parliamentary Secretary will do whatever he thinks best in the circumstances.</P>
    <P>No matter how near-perfect the social services made available by the State may have become and despite much progress made we are still far from having perfect services.  The need for voluntary organisations in this field will always be there.  The more the State enters into the social welfare sphere and the more complex the situations dealt with become, the more will be the need for voluntary organisations which can deal with certain types of problems which the State will never be able to attend to adequately. Voluntary organisations are close to the people.  They are not inhibited by the varying degrees of red tape with which officials are bound, no matter how well disposed those officials may be.  Voluntary organisations with a long tradition of social work have experience which is of great value and they can get to the heart of the social problem in a way in which it is difficult for the State services to do.</P>
    <P>There are families who are overwhelmed by their many problems to such a degree that they are unable to give adequate care to their homes and their children.  The parents may have deep-seated personality problems which make it difficult for them to establish satisfactory relations with others or to profit from the social welfare services generally available to the community.  They need help if their families are to keep together and if the children are to be given a chance of developing satisfactorily.  Voluntary organisations can be of exceptional help in such cases.</P>
    <P>We are very fortunate in this country to have such a large number of voluntary organisations operating in the social welfare field.  In some countries <Col N="1410" /> the idea of such organisations makes passions run high.  Some people feel that Voluntary work, and even voluntary social services are an anomaly in modern society and that the unpaid labour which they associate with inferior work should be discouraged. On the contrary, I am convinced that in an ideal society we should all be doing our share of voluntary work.  Such work helps to improve the standard of social services. This is also true of countries whose social services are developed to a greater degree that ours are.</P>
    <P>I have no doubt that voluntary organisations, as I said earlier, will be called on to play a larger and not a smaller part in the coming years.  It is well to remember that many of our present social services have resulted from the pioneer work of determined people who, having recognised the needs and problems, got down to doing something about them.  It is well to remember, however, that one problem which consistently faces a voluntary organisation and limits their effectiveness is the shortage of money.  The bulk of the money available to these organisations is received by them through voluntary contributions.  The State and the local authorities should make a better allocation of money to these organisations and be much more flexible in their attitude towards the use of the money provided.</P>
    <P>I recognise the difficulty of dealing with numerous organisations and I accept, from my own experience, that each individual organisation, consisting of highly dedicated people, finds it difficult to appreciate that the money available to a Department has many calls on it and that worthy though its particular calls may be, all the money it needs cannot be made available as there are many other equally worthy causes also requiring help.  Where these organisations, retaining their own individual identities, come together to form a community council, with all the aims and aspirations of community councils, to create a better society and improve the quality of living of the people among whom they work, then I think that the Minister and the Parliamentary Secretary should get down to discussions <Col N="1411" /> with such councils, listen to their views, take cognisance of their aims and see in what way financial and other assistance can be made available to them for the purpose of furthering the excellent work presently being done by them.</P>
    <P>One aspect of this work to which particular attention should be paid is the training of voluntary workers. This is something which has come to be recognised as essential.  If we are to pay proper attention to this crucial matter of training this, in turn, leads to a greater selectivity in choosing the right workers for the job.  As a consequence of the developments of training and selection procedures not only will the quality of service be improved but the damage caused by well-intentioned but unsuitable and ill-equipped individuals, who have been, I may say, the target of much criticism, will be rectified.  However well-disposed these people may be, if they are not the persons for the job and if they have no training, the damage they can do in a very delicate area can reach quite serious proportions.</P>
    <P>It should be remembered that voluntary organisations are not simply concerned with the material side of things; they are equally concerned with helping people over the severe emotional strains which face them.  It is not difficult for those who have an understanding of a problem to appreciate the severe emotional stress experienced by a woman on the death of her husband.  The breadwinner has been taken away and the family feels alone and isolated from the community. Neighbours very often help and the State helps but, as I said earlier, the widows' association, whose members have been through it all, can really be more helpful, not only in explaining to the widow the rights she has but in being able to identify with her emotional state and being in a position to help her to adjust to her new circumstances.  Only those who have experienced such a situation can appreciate what this kind of help means.  There are other instances in which such help can be of the greatest possible benefit.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1412" /> In Drogheda there is a community council and a community centre.  It is in a sense an amalgam of the various organisations in the town, statutory and voluntary, each maintaining its own particular identify but working in much closer co-operation than they did hitherto and in this way making the best possible use of the skills and experience of each organisation since each organisation is made fully cognisant of the work done by the others. As a result, efforts are channelled in such a way as to obtain the greatest possible beneficial results.  While the scope of the work of community councils goes outside the scope of this Estimate, nevertheless, much of the work done by them concerns this Estimate in that such councils endeavour, through the various organisations, not alone to supplement the income of social welfare recipients in need of help but also doing what I believe should be our aim, namely, running parallel with better financial benefits from the State and local authority sources, that of improving the quality of life of those in social welfare categories. This is done by employing trained social workers and by training voluntary workers who give of their expertise in helping others to overcome emotional problems and to cope with the strains and stresses of modern life.  In an affluent society there are of course many problems affecting people's lives detrimentally.  Many of the problems are the products of the affluent society.  The most important aspect is, of course, the fact that these organisations show that the community as a community cares for its individual members.</P>
    <P>In a practical way the community centre makes valuable information available regarding social welfare services generally, particularly in relation to benefits, entitlements, eligibility and so on.  These are of special importance to those suddenly faced with the need for such services.  Above all, people know where to turn for advice.  Despite the efforts made by the Department in the past and at present there are still people who may not be aware of their entitlement.  Despite efforts by public representatives and so on to ensure that people know their rights there are <Col N="1413" /> people who may not have that information. Where the community centre is concerned they now have some place where they can get the information.</P>
    <P>The centre also concerns itself with pensioners and their problems, with those with marital problems, with the problems facing the deserted wife or the deserted husband, with the problems of the unmarried mother and so on.  The financial assistance from the State from the point of view of the very useful work done by the centre is, to say the least of it, very meagre. If the work is to continue it is essential that full recognition must be given to it in the form of a worthwhile financial subsidy.  I am convinced that the work done at local level by bodies like these is irreplaceable and I urge the Parliamentary Secretary to do his utmost to help.</P>
    <P>The Parliamentary Secretary referred to the European Economic Community. It is only natural that we should concern ourselves with social welfare trends in the other member States.  We have much to learn.  It is also true to say that they have quite an amount to learn form us.  It is difficult to make comparisons between our social security system and the systems operating in other Community countries. All have different systems and so far there has been no harmonisation of the systems.  The differences are understandable because the systems grew up independently.  They were developed to serve the needs of different situations.  Even from the point of view of the percentage of GNP devoted in each country to social welfare generally, it is difficult to make comparisons.  The total amounts in each case are concerned with different aspects.  Sometimes the totals include salaries and wages.  In other cases they are concerned solely with the actual money made available to people for social security purposes.  Therefore, unless one were to spend a very considerable time on research, one could not, with any degree of accuracy point to one system as being vastly better than another.</P>
    <P>One thing we can say is that our own system, in scope, compares favourably with any of the other systems. Basically, what is needed is more <Col N="1414" /> money for recipients of social welfare and for the development of the system in all its aspects including more than purely material aspects.  It is wrong to constantly decry and disparage our own efforts in this field.  While ensuring that we avoid complacency, we should accept that the framework is good but must be greatly developed.</P>
    <P>We should remember that this State pioneered the children's allowance scheme and that we had widows' pensions here before many of the countries which would be regarded as advanced nations.  While continuing to develop our services to suit our own needs we can, of course, learn much from the countries which are now our partners in the European Economic Community.  Let me repeat that, in relation to the various groupings benefiting under our social welfare code, there are few areas now being catered for in other countries in the community which are not being catered for here.  We need to study the additional or supplementary benefits which are available in some of those countries and which are provided for the very needy, and also the extension of the scope of social security to other classes not included, for example, the self-employed, a matter which was referred to by the Parliamentary Secretary in his speech.</P>
    <P>The Parliamentary Secretary referred to the social policy in the EEC. He referred to the Paris summit meeting in October, 1972.  Its most marked and decisive feature for the future of Europe is the fact that the Heads of State, or Heads of Government, emphasised that they attach as much importance to vigorous action in the social field as to achievements in the economic and monetary union.  This is very important.  The solemn recognition of the importance of the development of a coherent social policy for the Community is accompanied by an indication of the means to be used which will help to integrate the social aspects into the general body of Community policies.</P>
    <P>I also noted that much the same statement as the Parliamentary Secretary made is in the preamble of the declaration of the summit conference. It states:</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1415" /> Economic expansion is not an end in itself.  Its first aim should be to enable disparities or living conditions to be reduced.  It must take place with the participation of all the social partners and should result in the improvement in the quality of life as well as in standards of living.</P>
    <P>We should act vigorously towards the achievement of that aim, that is, an improvement in the quality of life of those who are dependent on the State for sustenance.  I agree with the Parliamentary Secretary when he states that the situation in respect of the European fund is unsatisfactory.  I have no doubt that he is pressing the Community for change in that respect.</P>
    <P>While I am my party's spokesman on social welfare it will always be my endeavour not to play narrow party politics with the plight of the less favoured members of society.  On the wider plane, however, as I said earlier, I could not let the occasion pass without referring to the serious situation relating to the inflationary trends which are with us at present and will be with us for quite a considerable time.  It is absolutely essential that the Parliamentary Secretary and the Minister should take another look at the situation and ensure that those who are dependent on social welfare will be able to live in relative comfort.</P>
    <P>Social welfare is not merely the concern of the Department of Social Welfare.  It is the concern of all the social Departments, Health, Education, Local Government, Labour, as well as Social Welfare.  As an instance of what I have in mind I will refer to the Department of Education because it is one of the Departments I know most about.  The tremendous changes which have taken place in the whole education, field, particularly during the past decade, apart from anything else, will ensure that we will be turning out our young people with a basic knowledge and training which will so equip them so that they will, in every increasing and, in that sense, fully employed and, in that sense, they will be contributors to our society <Col N="1416" /> rather than being a burden on it as they might be if they were not properly trained.</P>
    <P>In this matter of social welfare we should accept, on the one hand, that the State has a duty to provide adequately for those who, for one reason or another, are unable to provide for themselves.  On the other hand, we should not let ourselves lose sight of the fact that the dignity of the person is very much enhanced through his being able to provide fully for himself.  We have a very special obligation in the field of social welfare to those whom I would describe as our senior citizens.  They have contributed much to the nation and they deserve well of it in the latter years of their lives.</P>
    <P>Let us remember that the State cannot supplant the voluntary organisations engaged in social work.  By all means let the State gives the maximum assistance to such bodies, but let us not for one moment lose sight of the fact that voluntary work in the social welfare field enriches and ennobles the lives of those engaged in it, and shows the beneficiaries that there are people in the community who are concerned with their plight.  The State in its administration of the social services must, of necessity, play an impersonal role for the most part.  On the other hand, the voluntary social worker is largely in direct personal contact with the people who are benefiting from his efforts.</P>
    <P>I should like to take this opportunity to pay tribute to all those unselfish people who contribute so much towards the welfare of their less fortunate brethren.  I should also like to thank the civil servants in the Department of Social Welfare for their courtesy to me.  This does not mean, of course, that I will accept for example delays in payment of benefits. Nevertheless, I should like to make it clear that I appreciate their courtesy.</P>
    <P>I found when researching our social welfare system that there appears to be far too great a diversification of responsibility between Departments of State dealing with community care generally. I remember nothing this when I was Minister for Education in <Col N="1417" /> relation to care of the mentally handicapped. Their education was my responsibility; their care and maintenance was the responsibility of the Department of Health.</P>
    <P>Speaking on this Estimate I find myself forced to deal with the whole question of care in the community in a very restricted manner because I constantly find the need to move into the preserves of the Departments of Health, Local Government and Education. When speaking in relation to benefits, health, housing for the aged, and care of the handicapped one must necessarily refer to other Departments and for this reason any discussion on these matters would be deemed out of order in a debate on this Estimate.  It is difficult to have as wide-ranging a discussion as one would like to have so as to enable us to tackle in a full and comprehensive manner the needs of the community.</P>
    <P>The Parliamentary Secretary seemed to agree, to some extent with this.  I would like to see the Parliamentary Secretary further examine this situation with a view to necessary re-organisation which would result in much greater efficiency and a better social code.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FrankCluskey" hpid="Mr. Cluskey Mr. Cluskey">

      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to congratulate the Parliamentary Secretary on what I consider to be a very sound speech, one full of thought and the type of one we like to see coming before the House for subsequent comment. While the spokesman for Fianna Fáil made a valuable contribution he could have been more involved with the future philosophy of social welfare policy.  I do not wish to enter into a political discussion on this because in my view this is not a field for party politics.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I was pleased to note from the Parliamentary Secretary's remarks that there has been a rapid and welcome increase in the expenditure of the Department in recent years, especially since the National Coalition came to office.  I was pleased to note that the current rate of expenditure, compared <Col N="1418" /> with that for the year 1972-73, shows an increase of almost 100 per cent.  As far as I am concerned this is proof positive of the social welfare commitment of the National Coalition Government, a policy which I support fully.</P>
    <P>In my view the last Fianna Fáil Government became a bit removed from the feelings of the people in this matter and there was a great awareness among the people that social services were inadequate under that Government.  I am satisfied that the commitment which the Government have shown has been welcomed and the ordinary person is very satisfied with the way this Government are tackling the obvious problem that exists in the field of social security.</P>
    <P>However, we cannot be complacent particularly when, as the Parliamentary Secretary stated, about onequarter of the population do not have adequate incomes.  While this situation exists the National Coalition are fully committed to tackling it.  Allied to the increase in expenditure the Parliamentary Secretary has pointed out the difficulties in coping with the broader spectrum of social welfare services available and the installation of the computer should help in the long-term in this regard.</P>
    <P>While I am pleased to note that the staffing problems are being tackled it is important that the whole Department should be moved out of Dublin. The National Coalition Government are committed to a policy of decentralisation and the Department of Social Welfare, which is not a particularly controversial Department, could be moved from the city.  Its presence in Dublin is not vital to the existence of the Government.  Perhaps the upper echelons would have to be retained in Dublin but I see no reason why the Department itself could not be transferred down the country.</P>
    <P>The accommodation problem which has been referred to by the Parliamentary Secretary could be tackled more easily and at a more reasonable cost down the country than in Dublin. It is easy for me to say that I would like to see the Department being moved to Waterford, my own <Col N="1419" /> constituency, but I am not necessarily pushing that point when I suggest the moving of the Department.  While I would like to see the Department being moved to Waterford, in principle the question of it being transferred out of Dublin should be examined seriously.</P>
    <P>I was very struck with the emphasis which the Parliamentary Secretary put on the problems of research.  The new section which he has established for research and development is a very interesting step forward, a step in the right direction.  There is a vital need to pinpoint areas of problems, to pinpoint where there is a need for social welfare action, where there is a need to examine the Department's policies and to identify a different approach to existing policies.</P>
    <P>I welcome the establishment of an advisory committee on pilot schemes to combat poverty.  I feel sure that Sister Stanislaus, a person I know to be very dedicated, with the other members of the committee will play an invaluable part in the development of our social welfare policies.  It is this approach to the problems of social welfare that I welcome.  It is a step in the right direction and one which is not before its time.</P>
    <P>Under the last Fianna Fáil Government I was struck by the humdrum and mechanical approach to the problem, where increases were granted in pensions and benefits so much in excess of the previous year.  I would have preferred a more positive approach to dealing with the problem itself rather than lauding one's own party or Government.  I welcome the new assistance services which have been introduced by the National Coalition Government and the new schemes which are now available for unmarried mothers, for single women aged over 58 years, for adult dependants of non-contributory old age pensioners and for families of long-term prisoners.  The move by the National Coalition to give assistance to these classes is very welcome and a much needed improvement.</P>
    <P>It is this flexible approach of the Coalition to the problems of social <Col N="1420" /> Welfare that is very important.  It is not enough merely to say we have a certain scheme and we shall improve it by so much this year.  We must look continually for areas where it is obvious that new policies are needed. It is this approach of the Parliamentary Secretary that is very heartening.</P>
    <P>I welcome, too, the efforts being made in relation to the dissemination of information in regard to all the social welfare schemes.  We know that those people who are likely to require social assistance are those who very often are not in a position to ascertain information concerning the benefits to which they are entitled. I welcome in particular the setting up of information offices for this purpose and the proposals in relation to citizens advice bureaux.</P>
    <P>Another worthwhile improvement, though not of a major social nature, is the overlapping of payment of benefits on the death of a breadwinner.</P>
    <P>The Parliamentary Secretary referred also to the question of social insurance in respect of the self-employed. It is of vital importance that this area be tackled.  There are many people who are self-employed but who are not well off and who are in need of some State assistance.  I am not keen on the use of the term &ldquo;State assistance&rdquo;&mdash; I would prefer to use the phrase &ldquo;entitled to receive State moneys&rdquo;.  I have become aware of a number of small shopkeepers and small farmers, especially those in the older age groups, who are of well-todo families but whose circumstances have changed and who are too proud, so to speak, to avail of the facilities of the Department.  These people are solid citizens but in some cases their means of livelihood are little hucksters shops.  We should endeavour to devise a social insurance scheme for the self-employed with the least possible delay.  I know that such a scheme, of its nature, would not be easy to establish, but perhaps we could establish immediately a few pilot schemes with the objective of identifying the people who could be and who should be helped.</P>
    <P>I would urge the streamlining and <Col N="1421" /> simplifying of the process of hearing appeals in respect of applicants for social welfare benefits and assistance. An effort should be made to speed up the processing of appeals.  Although the delays involved may be relatively short in terms of movement within the Civil Service, shortage of money for a few weeks, or even for a few days, is of vital importance to the people concerned.  It is my opinion that a fair system of hearing appeals is being attempted but I wonder whether the whole process, both the nearings and the decisions, might be speeded up.</P>
    <P>The Parliamentary Secretary has told us that the various application forms for benefits and assistance are to be simplified and that there will no longer be a requirement to have forms signed by people considered qualified to do so.  This is a welcome improvement in the system.  It is not a matter of any inconvenience to me to sign my name on these forms but I do not know what is achieved by my doing so.  Those who apply for benefits must submit the relevant documents and these are proof of entitlement.  Therefore I can see no reason for any further certification.</P>
    <P>I am glad to note, too, that the application forms are being simplified. Time and again public figures are requested to fill in forms for applicants. Again, while we have no objection to carrying out this task, there is no reason why the form should not be simplified in a way that would not require the answers to many questions and the comprehensive information that is sought on the present forms. Again, this is a change that is not of a critical nature but which, nevertheless, is constructive.</P>
    <P>The role of voluntary organisations has been discussed here today, both by the Parliamentary Secretary and by Deputy Faulkner.  Voluntary bodies are invaluable in any society. Regardless of how sophisticated are our social welfare schemes, there will always be a need for the work done by voluntary bodies.  I should not like to have this work regarded as a necessity but it would be difficult to estimate the value to the community of <Col N="1422" /> the work done by those groups.  I have been involved in the establishment of a sheltered workshop in Waterford.  The enthusiasm which I witnessed on the part of members of the committee with whom I worked was very heartening.  In this connection I should like to pay a special tribute to the work done by the Rehabilitation Institute.  This organisation are doing an excellent job but in addition to the subvention they get from the State they must seek finance from outside sources.  Every help possible should be given to them to help them continue the wonderful work they are doing.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>In Waterford there is a community centre that was established entirely by voluntary effort.  The people concerned were fully qualified social workers.  These people, too, together with all the other voluntary bodies in this country, are performing a very important role.  Without their dedication it would be difficult to fulfil that role.  I was wondering whether community service centres could qualify for finance from the Department of Social Welfare in view of their policy with regard to the financing of citizens' advice bureaux.  These community service centres should qualify.  They should be helped in any way possible.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Parliamentary Secretary has expressed concern about the working of the assistance schemes.  They are of Victorian origin.  They are the last resort of people who need help urgently. The philosophy behind these schemes goes back to poor law relief legislation.  A new approach is needed. The assistance officers run the scheme. They are assisted by qualified staff. They work under the regional health boards.  They should come under the auspices of the Department of Social Welfare.  They perform work which should be done by officers of that Department rather than by the health boards.  Their role is difficult and is often much criticised.  They supervise means tests and examinations of a <Col N="1423" /> person's means and his health cards. They do so in relation to home assistance and other social assistance schemes.  I do not believe it is possible to devise a mathematical scheme which would include or exclude an applicant without this type of investigation. It is a problem that cannot be solved easily.  The people conducting means tests should work under the Department of Social Welfare.</P>
    <P>The policies of the Department of Social Welfare are geared towards helping to improve the incomes of applicants.  I was wondering whether we could have a change of policy or an additional policy in which the Department could examine the expenditure of the people who receive social welfare benefits and assistance. For instance, people are given weekly benefits and assistance but it is difficult to identify their expenditure and the importance of the various types of expenditure.  Would it not be a good idea for the Department of Social Welfare to pay the rates of social welfare beneficiaries or, alternatively, would it not be a good idea for the Government to derate houses with valuations of £10 or £15?  The most needy sections of the population should receive most help.  I know it is the policy of Fianna Fáil to abolish all rates.  I feel it would be more just to abolish first rates on houses of £10 or £15 valuation.  That would benefit the poorer sections of the community. These are usually the sections of the community who need the help of the Department of Social Welfare.  I would like to hear the Parliamentary Secretary's comments on this point.</P>
    <P>There is other expenditure to which the Parliamentary Secretary has already referred.  Schemes already exist in regard to the supply of free fuel and cheap footwear.  There is a free travel scheme and a scheme concerning television licences and free light. There are school meals.  I would like to see such schemes extended.  That is where the Department could help by identifying the expenditure of recipients of social assistance with a view to helping them not alone by boosting their incomes but also by trying to <Col N="1424" /> remove some elements of expenditure which they have to meet, such as ESB bills and turf bills.  Some people cannot afford to pay rates.  I have referred previously to rates.</P>
    <P>This whole question could be examined by the advisory committee on schemes to combat poverty.  The spokesman for Fianna Fáil dealt at length with the role of education.  I agree with him.  Education plays a vital role in the improvement of the quality of life of the nation as a whole.  We must do everything in our power to ensure that every person in our community gets adequate education while he is young and that educational facilities and encouragement exist for people who wish to avail of adult education courses.</P>
    <P>We must pay tribute to the work of the vocational education committees. These committees provide a very comprehensive range of courses.  All this plays a part in the improvement of the general education in our State. The more we can expand education to reach all sections of the community the better for us all.  Schemes should be expanded to help people who have not been privileged by receiving a good education in their youth.  As Deputy Faulkner has said, this is all part of a comprehensive policy to eradicate ignorance, on the one hand, and to improve the quality of life, on the other hand.  We should be committed to financing adult education courses.  This is all part of the social welfare discussion.</P>
    <P>We should help old people to a greater extent so that they can stay out of geriatric hospitals.  Many old people do not require hospitalisation but, because of lack of facilities and because they are unable to stay with sons or daughters or near relatives, they must seek refuge in geriatric hospitals.  This is expensive on the State but, even more important, it is wrong that many such people should be in these hospitals.  They should be encouraged to take their relatives home and this could be done by giving greater amounts to those who are prepared to care for them.  If they were housed in community homes they could keep their independence.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1425" /> Adequate staff could be provided to take care of their needs in such homes.</P>
    <P>The Holy Ghost Hospital, Waterford, was originally established by Henry VIII.  Thanks to the Department of Health it is now a modern system of chalets for old people.  This is the type of scheme I should like to see throughout Ireland.  The Holy Ghost Hospital is run by nuns who are doing a very good job.  The board of Governors, of whom I have the honour to be one, control the running of the hospital to the advantage of the old people.  Many of them prefer this type of independence to hospitalisation. The Department of Social Welfare should be encouraged to establish more of these centres.</P>
    <P>The question of the transferability of pension is very important.  Not only should there be a national right to transfer pensions from a Department to a semi-State or a State body, but there should be an attempt made to transfer pension rights from one job to another in the private sector.  This has not been tackled although it has been discussed. I would welcome a far greater involvement by the Department in this matter. The Department of Finance and the Department of the Public Service should also be involved.  A statutory committee should be established which would involve people from the Government and semi-State sectors, the trade union movement and private enterprise to discuss pension rights and the transferability of pensions.  In my view this would not be a waste of time.</P>
    <P>I welcome the introduction of pay-related schemes although they are very complicated.  I will not discuss them now because they are at a very early stage of development.  While I agree with the concept of pay-related schemes I would not like to see a poor relation type of scheme introduced where one class of person gets £5, the better-off class £6, the next class £7, and so on.  I am against that approach. I would much perfer to see a sound general benefit scheme.</P>
    <P>The Parliamentary Secretary referred to the establishment of a comprehensive social security policy.  Such a policy means greater social awareness <Col N="1426" /> within the community, greater social involvement in the field of social security and greater financial investment in proportion to the needs.  I fully support this.  The Department should produce a booklet comparing the various schemes in European countries and England with those which are available here.  We could then pick what is good in Europe and throw out what is bad.  We could gradually advance towards not only a harmonised social security policy but also a more beneficial type of policy based on the errors and successes of other countries.</P>
    <P>The Parliamentary Secretary referred to developments within the EEC on the social front.  The fact that the 1974 budget amounted to only 6 per cent of the total EEC budget and involved approximately £40 million has been a great disappointment to us and will, no doubt, hold us back from achieving a major breakthrough in the field of social security policy.  This is a pity.  Dr. Hillery is fully involved in this matter and has done good work towards establishing a proper EEC policy.  We wish him every success.  It is towards Europe we look for the availability of funds with which we can tackle the question of poverty.  We look forward to a far greater commitment on the part of the EEC in financial terms in relation to social security policy.  We should leave the EEC in no doubt as to our disappointment to date with their commitment to the question of the development of social security policy.</P>
    <P>I wish the Parliamentary Secretary every good wish in his very onerous task of improving the lot of our lesswell off.  I am sure he will have the full support of each Member of the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMoore" hpid="Mr. Moore Mr. Moore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moore</NameTxt>
      <P>It is natural that the Opposition should welcome the intention of the Government to improve the social welfare services.  Since the formation of our party it has been a primary object of policy to improve these services.  We can claim to be the forerunners and educators is bringing about a comprehensive scheme for the abolition of poverty and the general <Col N="1427" /> rise in the standards of living of our people.  On those grounds we naturally welcome any promise by the Government further to improve social services.</P>
      <P>A basic need, if we are to succeed at all, is that the staff of the Department would be accommodated in a central headquarters where they could work in proper conditions and with better organisation towards greater efficiency.  At the moment the staff of the Department are housed in various office blocks being rented by the Government. This is a dissipation of the social welfare pool which could be devoted to improving benefits.  Perhaps the Department should consider building their own office blocks.  It might mean that beneficiaries would not be deprived of some badly needed benefits.</P>
      <P>It is good to note from the Parliamentary Secretary's statement that the Government recognise the fact that benefits are being eroded by inflation, which is running at a rate of 30 per cent at the moment.  All our efforts should be bent towards cushioning the social welfare classes against the disastrous effects of inflation.</P>
      <P>It is wrong to think that the State alone can solve the problems of the less well off classes.  The State can relieve poverty but it cannot ease misery.  This is where the work of the voluntary organisations plays such a vital part in humanising the State's effort.  In this matter we should not follow blindly the examples in the so-called welfare states who provide excellent cushioning against poverty but in which there is an escalation to much greater problems.  We should appreciate properly that relieving poverty but giving a higher level of misery would not be a change for the better.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have the resources and the intent and the vast majority of our people have the desire to help the less well off people among us.  As I have said, we should be able to create a situation where the efforts of the State would be supplemented by the voluntary organisations.  It takes a lot of money to provide proper benefits <Col N="1428" /> and this would be a waste if the State's effort was not humanised by voluntary effort.  In these matters we should strive to win the goodwill of the people who produce the wealth, whether they be on the factory floor, in the shop or elsewhere.  In that way we would have a much healthier society.</P>
    <P>The Parliamentary Secretary said that economic and social policies must be linked with reality and not merely in rhetoric.  There is a lot of truth in that but I am sorry to say I do not notice the Government endeavouring to encourage people to think that economic and social policies must be linked with reality.  When the present Government were in Opposition they denied what they described as inadequate social benefits but when it came to providing the taxation to finance such benefits we had to fight hard to get it passed through the House.</P>
    <P>The Parliamentary Secretary referred to Britain.  I do not regard Britain as being the forefront in this context because running right through their system is a kind of Victorian attitude to which I would not subscribe. Neither would I regard other European countries as being an example we should follow in the matter of social welfare.  Of course we should always look at other countries and what they are doing, but we have our own inspiration, our own thinking in these matters and we should work out our own system.</P>
    <P>This is particularly necessary today when we see the family under attack in so many ways.  We believe that the family is the basic unit of our society but unfortunately we do not live up to that aspiration when we come to provide benefits aimed at safeguarding the family, such as children's allowances. They were first provided 40 years ago by Fianna Fáil.  That is only a start.  We should include in our social welfare system provision for proper housing, the basic need of man. The Parliamentary Secretary said that there was co-operation with other Departments in the drive against poverty.  He should have specifically mentioned the Department of Local Government so as to ensure that our <Col N="1429" /> people have proper dwellings.  Our social welfare efforts will have to be bent far more in that direction.</P>
    <P>It is not much good paying a man a very good social welfare allowance if he has to pay most of it by way of rent to a landlord.  We should take first things first, and I should say for the Parliamentary Secretary he is very much aware of the housing needs.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanTreacy" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Seán Treacy">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMoore" hpid="Mr. Moore Mr. Moore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moore</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not intend to pursue that.  The Parliamentary Secretary has mentioned the involvement of other Departments with his, but I shall leave it at that.</P>
      <P>I mentioned earlier the part that voluntary and religious societies could play in our whole economy.  I do not agree with the Parliamentary Secretary when he says in his brief that we have no history of research into poverty.  It was left to these voluntary societies.  Many years ago, even before the State was founded, these voluntary societies were doing good work.  Some of the most advanced hospitals in this city were founded by religious societies to care for the very poor in this city at that time. They have prospered and are held in high regard today by the people.  We should involve these voluntary societies with the State effort in order to give a proper blend to our society. Dickens wrote of the horrors of Victorian England and could make the suffering of the people very vivid in one's imagination.  While the religious orders did not write about the horrible conditions under which the very poor lived in the city, they were very much aware of them and built these hospitals and homes which alleviated those conditions and gave some meaning to our claim to be a Christian society.  Therefore, when we are being told today that the State must be the source of all our benefits, most of us will say we need these voluntary societies and organisations. It would be a very poor day for this country if the State took over all these endeavours.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In recent years our system of social <Col N="1430" /> welfare has been expanded greatly and there would be a very small number of people who are not benefiting in some way from the State whether it is through illness, housing or in some other way.  While with the advance in education most people can deal with application forms for old age pension or other benefits, a person should not have to go through reams of questions.  I am reminded of the form which has to be filled in when the window's pension is coming up for renewal, and a woman who is very old is asked: &ldquo;Have you remarried since last year?&rdquo;.  The Department should simplify the form.  The vast majority of people are very honest and do not want to hoodwink the State by making false statements. The staff of the Department are very dedicated.  They have great expertise in this field and they should make it easier for the person who is not that well educated to apply for benefit.</P>
    <P>The Department could also educate people into what they are entitled to. The latest booklet issued by the Department is excellent.  It conveys information in a way that is easily understood.  It may be very petty to mention this question of filling in forms, but very often there are delays because people did not fill them in correctly.  People may forget their social welfare number and so on, and this leads to delays.  When a person is out of work for some time and sends in his certificates and has to wait for some weeks for the money, I often wonder what he has to live on until the Department have examined the claim.  I know the Department deal with cases as expeditiously as possible but for people who have no other income such delays can be a great crisis in their lives.</P>
    <P>I know of a man who is 94 years of age and who has an old age pension and a pension of £3 a week from his former employer.  Every month or so there is income tax stopped from him.  Surely a man of 94 years of age should be let off paying this income tax which may be small to the State but is big to him.</P>
    <P>I appreciate that in recent years the benefits for handicapped children <Col N="1431" /> has been increased tremendously, but I still feel we are not doing enough for them.  Again, there is the case of the old person who may have been ill and who is put into an institution. Because he has no other home he is left in that place for many years. There is one institution in the city here which is doing excellent work for people who are ill in different ways, who are handicapped, but they are left there for as long as 30 years either because the family do not want them or the family has died out.  It is not a very pleasant prospect for these people to have to stay in these institutions, but at least it gives security.</P>
    <P>We ought to examine the possibility of extending the home help service. We ought to examine the possibility of getting these people into their own homes as much as possible.  We should examine the population of the homes to which I am referring and, in co-operation with the staffs running them, decide which people could possibly be sent to their own or another family and have the State pay a substantial subsidy to that family rather than have these people remain in an institution for years.  The prospect of remaining in such an institution is a frightful thought for any individual and this is the fate of many of our people today.  I am not criticising these homes in the least.  I realise and appreciate the good work being done by them.  I want also to record my appreciation of the dedication and service given by the staffs of these institutions. But I do not think it is fair to the staffs, or indeed to the patients, that they simply be put behind closed doors and left there with the attitude being adopted that at least they are not on the street.  If they were left on the street, it might strike our consciences that we must do something about them; but if they are safely in these institutions, we do not see them and our consciences are not wracked with concern for them.  This is one very large field I would suggest the Parliamentary Secretary could tackle with benefit to all concerned.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DenisJones" hpid="An Leas-Cheann Comhairle Denis Francis Jones">
      <NameTxt>An Leas-Cheann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy will probably agree that it is <Col N="1432" /> the Department of Health which would have to deal with that matter.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanMoore" hpid="Mr. Moore Mr. Moore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moore</NameTxt>
      <P>We have the one Minister for the two, Social Welfare and Health.  However, I shall not pursue the matter.</P>
      <P>I am intrigued by the Parliamentary Secretary's intentions on how to combat poverty.  I suppose somebody has yet to define just what is poverty.  It is a relative term, and while some people may feel they are poor, when they look at their fellowman they see he is much poorer.  I agree with the policy of the Government that this matter be examined in order to find out how we can eradicate poverty, if it can be eradicated in this world. I applaud the action of the Parliamentary Secretary in setting up an advisory committee on the question.  I hope that its findings will be published soon and acted upon.  I suppose it is the desire of most people in the world today that we should eradicate poverty, but it is not an easy task. The humanising of our State institutions is one of the large obstacles to this end.  One can see many ways in which one could eliminate poverty: (a)  one could ignore it and say it did not exist or, (b) one could tackle it and not be daunted by the tremendous problems it poses.  In respect of the vast majority of our people, I think the Government and the Parliamentary Secretary will find that this is a worthy ambition and that they will receive every backing in their efforts to combat the scourge of poverty.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Over the years the standard of living has been rising steadily.  However, at the same time, there is always a section of our people who do not seem to benefit.  One often hears talk of hidden poverty, of genteel people who cannot understand or cope with the problems facing them.  They are inclined to hide behind closed doors and not bother anybody until one day one of them is found dead, dying, or in a very poor state somewhere. How does one get through to this section of people to tell them &mdash; as it is said in the brief here &mdash; that this is not charity, that this is their right, that those who pay tax and create some wealth are entitled to <Col N="1433" /> have the benefits which the State has provided for them?</P>
    <P>The Parliamentary Secretary referred to the effect of inflation on social welfare payments.  This is a problem with which each one of us is very much concerned.  It is not a very easy task to try and insulate the recipients of any kind of State benefit against inflation.  Of course it can be done by continuing to increase the amounts of the benefits.  That is one way in which it can be done, but it is a highly inadequate one.  We hear a lot today about the &ldquo;green pound&rdquo; on the European scene in order to safeguard some section of our people.</P>
    <P>I wonder could we not have the &ldquo;welfare pound&rdquo; under which the pension book of an old age pensioner or a widow would be a guarantee to the holder, who is given X pounds per week, that if inflation erodes the value of the pension or income, some system will be devised under which at the end of the year some extra benefit will be given to compensate for that erosion.  Perhaps we could say to the suppliers of food to those people that if price increases occur, they must not be passed on to the pensioner but the State will compensate the shopkeeper afterwards for any increase legally permitted by the Government. I know it would take the brains of the Department to calculate that but I think something should be done in this regard to try and insulate the aged and infirm who, having got a State pension, find it hardly adequate.  I suppose one can never have an adequate pension for an old person but it should be as adequate as is possible.  Therefore I think the State will have to try to devise some system to ensure that, having given a person a pension of X pounds per week, or an increase of X pounds per week, that is not eroded in a few months by inflation.  I was glad to hear the Parliamentary Secretary refer specifically to this matter in his brief.</P>
    <P>On the question of home assistance or relief &mdash; I know we do not like the term because the connotation is of the old county home &mdash; I want to refer to a section of men in the city on <Col N="1434" /> strike at the moment not receiving any strike pay from their union and who recently sought social welfare help.  I know it could happen in the circumstances of any strike.  The decision made, for example, if a man had a family, was that he would not receive any money but would be entitled to some food vouchers.  Without going into the merits or demerits of the strike to which I am referring, I think this is altogether wrong because, although some of those men want to go back to work, for obvious reasons they cannot.  At least we should ensure that they be given some cash benefit, even in the form of a loan which could be repaid when they returned to work, because that aspect of poverty is just as real as that of the old or infirm person, or the person of inadequate means.</P>
    <P>There was reference also in the brief to the minimum family wage, something which has been referred to by Members from all sides of the House over the years and which has never become a reality.  I do not know if it can ever become a reality but since the Government are again thinking of it on this occasion we may well find there is a solution to it.</P>
    <P>We are trying to safeguard the lower-paid worker and ensure that he will have a certain minimum figure on which he can at least maintain a frugal existence.  I suggest the Parliamentary Secretary might begin by altering the present system so that a worker earning less than a certain figure would not have to pay for the social welfare stamp which is becoming dearer every year and is now quite an imposition on the lower-paid worker.  The Government might well decide that anybody earning less than a certain figure would not have to pay for this stamp.  I think that a widow who is working does not now have to pay for the stamp.  That is a start and I should like to expand this to cover other lower-paid workers.  I can see difficulties.  When one tries to introduce a minimum wage the minimum will become the maximum wage for many employers, over which they will not pay.  We must guard against <Col N="1435" /> that attitude developing.  The State should set the example by showing they recognise that wages or salaries under a certain figure are not adequate and saying that the better-off workers and employers should pay more and remove the cost of the stamp from the lower-paid workers. That would be a recognition that there is something wrong in our society when a man is paid so little that he cannot keep a family in frugal comfort.</P>
    <P>This could be easily done by the State and would set a headline.  Other people might try to claim this concession after a while but in any society we must look after those who most need help and hope that the others will recognise they have a duty, as well as the State, towards the less well-off.</P>
    <P>This Estimate covers a wide field. One could go on forever talking about social welfare but action is required to show the people that the Government are concerned and in earnest in trying to perfect our system. On this side of the House we share the Government's concern for the less well-off and it is part of our social policy to improve the social welfare code.  I have often thought that we might redraft the whole system and get rid of many of the anomalies in it so that it would not be merely something we have to ease our conscience.  The State should not have the sort of mentality that would say that having made a payment we are doing our duty or when we pay income tax we are already being taxed to help the less well-off and that finishes the matter.</P>
    <P>Everybody should be involved in this matter and unless there is total involvement of the people and the Government and State agencies we shall not get rid of poverty and have a proper social welfare code.  The Government, through their agents, shall not get ride of poverty and have a proper social welfare code.  The Government, through their agents, should try to create the attitude in every worker and producer of wealth that no matter what his place in society he should be involved in this drive to eradicate poverty and that all wealth produced helps to give our <Col N="1436" /> less well-off brothers a better life.  If the State fails in this and people lose faith in our establishments there is greater danger if the Government is not seen to be really and sincerely involved in this drive for a better society that cynicism can well be created amongst the people which will eventually bring down the State.  All over the world Governments are on trial on the issue of what they are doing for the less well-off people.</P>
    <P>I welcome the declared intent of the Government to take action on the poverty front.  I look forward to the publication of the report of the advisory committee and even more to what the Government will do about it.  In conclusion, I again welcome what was said in the Parliamentary Secretary's brief and I shall watch carefully what develops from it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JosephBermingham" hpid="Mr. Bermingham Mr. Bermingham">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bermingham</NameTxt>
      <P>I congratulate the Parliamentary Secretary on his statement this morning and on what he has been doing in the Department of Social Welfare since this Government took office.  I congratulate him particularly on extending social welfare services.  He has taken under the umbrella of social welfare categories of people not hitherto included.  This is important because it shows that the Government are concerned about people who are really on the poverty line and who were not catered for up to now.</P>
      <P>I also congratulate him on the increases effected in the various sections of social welfare.  While these are important they concern those whom at least were recognised as people who should get social welfare benefits but the fact that people have been brought within the scope of the services for the first time now shows that the Government have in mind the extension of those services to cover those in all spheres of necessity.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I agree with the Parliamentary Secretary when he states that social reforms, social welfare, elimination of poverty and all those matters must remain a major thrust of Government policy : that is as it should be. Despite all the good work that may be done by voluntary organisations it is the responsibility of the Government <Col N="1437" /> to ensure that people in the less well-off categories or who are unable to provide the necessities of life for themselves not only have the necessities of life but a decent living.  In the case of people who are unable to provide a decent living for themselves, their families and dependants the Government have a duty to see that their standards are brought well up to the ordinary standard of the majority of people who are in a position to look after themselves.  It is probably necessary to put on the remainder of our society some imposition that may not always be very acceptable, but it is one of the basic duties of a Government who have a social conscience. That is a policy of this Government and it is one of the reasons I support them.</P>
    <P>The increases given to social welfare recipients were probably quite good when they were given and in the latest increases account has been taken of the rise in living costs.  I have sympathy with the Parliamentary Secretary and with the officials in the Department.  They are doing a tremendous job in implementing the additional improvements being made in social welfare benefits but, as was mentioned in a debate last week, there have been delays in the receipt of benefits.  As the Parliamentary Secretary has readily admitted, a delay in dealing with a pension claim or disability application can cause real hardship to a man and his family.  It is important that the Parliamentary Secretary and the Minister recognise this fact.</P>
    <P>It is frequently the case that after contributing to social welfare for many years a man may fall ill and be obliged to claim for benefit.  If such a person gets sick at the weekend he may see his doctor on Monday and get a certificate.  The first certificate is merely a notice of illness; the man will not get paid on the following Friday because he has not a certificate to qualify him for benefit.  It may be the following Monday before he can obtain a certificate to cover the week of illness and apparently he is not then paid for the first three days.  It is quite possible that the man, perhaps with a few dependants, has <Col N="1438" /> not been in the habit of applying for social welfare benefit during his lifetime and is not familiar with the procedure.</P>
    <P>I realise that a certain amount of red tape is necessary to find out his family circumstances and the number of dependants but the time spent in forwarding certificates and returning them to the applicant, who must resubmit them, is quite considerable.  It may happen that the man will not receive benefit for three or four weeks and in the meantime he may have four or five people depending on him. I know the Parliamentary Secretary understands this problem and I will make a few suggestions about how we might help in the situation.</P>
    <P>I realise that the Department must know the family circumstances of the applicant, but the form that is used may, perhaps, be a little elaborate. The Parliamentary Secretary might consider the possibility of attaching to the first certificate a short form which would be sufficient to inform the Department of the family circumstances. The top portion of the form might be filled in by the doctor and the bottom part filled in by the claimant, giving details of his position with regard to benefits.  This would eliminate much of the procedure of sending forms backwards and forwards.  This may be all right for people who have a social welfare office in their area but it causes many problems in my constituency.  If there was a separate form for the first certificate, while the following certificates remain as they are, it would be of considerable help.  The notice of illness should have a portion attached to it &mdash; it just means the doctor would have to keep two books of forms.  My suggestion might help to speed up payment.</P>
    <P>Consideration should be given to the suggestion that the employer makes some payment for the first weeks of illness.  What I am saying may not be practicable in that smaller employers might not be able to do this but, in general, employers could pay the benefit for the first few weeks. I know some of the larger employers pay in full and recoup the money from the social welfare benefits.  That <Col N="1439" /> is all right if it can be arranged but the outlook is grim for those who may have to wait for three or four weeks before they receive social welfare benefit to pay for the necessities of life.  This is happening quite often and it must be rectified.  I appreciate that the Department have to deal with many new applications for benefits recently announced but we cannot wait until the reorganisation of the Department is completed before this matter is tackled.  That reorganisation will take a long time and some arrangement must be made to ensure that social welfare recipients get weekly payments.</P>
    <P>People in the lower income group cannot afford to lose one week without income.  There was a time when credit was more freely available to them but nowadays it is not available in the new stores throughout the country. A man can be in serious difficulty if he has no income from any source for a week or two.  When this happens he has to apply to the home assistance officer.  My suggestion with regard to the form or certificate would help to speed up the allocation of money.</P>
    <P>There should be some method of forcing employers to pay the first few weeks of social welfare benefit direct to their employees, to be recouped if that is necessary.  This situation has caused grave hardship in several families that I know.  They received no social welfare payments and no payments of any kind for a few weeks. The obligation should be imposed on an employer to see that the employee has at least the necessities of life for the first weeks of his illness until he clears his difficulties with the Department of Social Welfare.</P>
    <P>I know the Parliamentary Secretary is having a study made to see what can be done but I seriously suggest that it is vital for people living outside the city to have somewhere in which they can make contact with the Department of Social Welfare, somewhere in which their records or copies of their records are kept.  They could find out in those centres whether they are entitled to full benefit <Col N="1440" /> or the cause of delays when they occur.  It is very frustrating for a person who may not be very well educated, waiting for the postman to bring his weekly allowance, to find that it does not arrive.  Perhaps it does not arrive the next day either. The week-end may have arrived and he is desperate.  If there was some centre to which he could go it would be a help.  I know the Parliamentary Secretary is proposing to set up information offices in various areas but I believe that in any area where there is no social welfare officer one should be appointed as a matter of urgency. Some labour exchanges do have social welfare officers but they should be present in every labour exchange.  It is my experience that sometimes the man in the labour exchange, if he is not concerned with that business but is concerned with the other side of social welfare, is not helpful to people who are trying to get information on what they should do.  Whereever there is a labour exchange there should be at least one or two people concerned with disability benefits.</P>
    <P>I welcome the introduction of pay-related benefits but I believe that many people involved do not fully understand the position.  I know that the details have been published in the newspapers and that the Parliamentary Secretary has been doing his best to get the message across but I find that if people do not get benefits they do nothing about it and then they ask when they are to be introduced.  They feel they should come automatically. They do in some instances but in other instances they do not.  People find it difficult to understand this.  Again, I stress the necessity of an information bureau in any town of any size and in villages if possible because it is most frustrating not to be able to find out exactly what is happening in one's case.  It may of necessity go on for some time.  There may be a lot of checking to be done.  The pay-related benefit scheme is a wonderful one but I know of one or two people who do not believe they will ever be paid. They believe it is so complicated that they cannot deal with it at all.</P>
    <P>I should like to congratulate the <Col N="1441" /> Parliamentary Secretary and the Government on the wonderful improvement in the matter of the means test for social welfare assistance. This was long overdue and it should be continued in the years ahead until we have a situation where everyone who might need assistance will have it.  There has been a wonderful easing of the means test in the case of non-contributory old age pensions <i>et cetera</i>.  In the case of unemployment benefit I understand that at present one can earn some little income and still get full benefit but it is very small.  Even people who are officially unable to work a full day and are in receipt of benefit could supplement their benefit by earning a little.  I do not believe people should be allowed to earn a normal week's pay and draw benefit of any kind but there are people who, perhaps, have a sideline and earn a few pounds.  I think there is a limit of £3 but that is very small now and I would advocate increasing it a little.</P>
    <P>The Parliamentary Secretary announced that the percentage cost of administration has gone down.  It is a good thing that most of the extra money that is being poured into social welfare is going to the recipients of the benefits but if the administration could be improved by extra expenditure and if the hardships caused by delay could be lessened by extra expenditure, I am convinced that that expenditure should be incurred.</P>
    <P>I want to congratulate the Parliamentary Secretary for setting up a commission to examine the problem of poverty in our society.  I agree that in certain areas it is very hard to combat this problem.  Old people who find themselves alone at the end of their days want to hold on to their homes and want to keep out of institutions if possible.  They may have enough money to provide food, drink and cigarettes but there is no one to help them to look after themselves. They are often lonely as they have nobody else to talk to if they are living alone.</P>
    <P>I may be digressing into the field of health when I ask that more social workers be provided.  They can help old people and do some of the work <Col N="1442" /> which they are unable to do themselves. Social welfare and health should be integrated so that those social workers can help those old people.  When local authorities engage on housing schemes they should also provide houses or flats for old people.</P>
    <P>The previous speaker said that you may give more money but you may not give a lot of happiness.  While I would not agree with that completely there is something more needed for old people besides money.  This matter should be examined closely by this commission which is being set up by the Parliamentary Secretary.  I am sure they will come up with ways and means of combating this problem. Many old people have mental and physical problems.  Some of them may have drink problems and it is only social workers who can really help them.  I notice the membership of this commission covers a wide range of skills and experience and I look forward to their report coming before the House.</P>
    <P>The Parliamentary Secretary has asked for comments from the public to help in the problem of combating poverty.  I know on all sides of the House there is agreement that we should eliminate poverty as far as is humanly possible.  If that is the desire we can go forward and feel we are doing something worth while.  There is very serious poverty in many areas of this country, despite the great increases in social assistance which have been given over the years.  I have found poverty in the most extraordinary places.</P>
    <P>You often hear of a particular craftsman who becomes old and may not have a family to look after him or they may have left to find employment elsewhere.  This man has pride in his work and is trying to carry on with a craft that is now dead.  He is often in very poor circumstances because he will not admit he is not making enough money on which to live.  The Minister for Social Welfare should as soon as possible introduce social insurance for the self-employed. There are many small shopkeepers and self-employed people in various areas of the country who are now old <Col N="1443" /> but cannot obtain assistance.  They may get non-contributory pensions but some of them are so proud they will not apply for them.  The self-employed will have to be brought into the category of social insurance.  A start should be made as soon as possible.  I quite agree that there are many different kinds of people to be catered for, as the Parliamentary Secretary pointed out, but some start will have to be made in devising a system through which these different categories can contribute and subsequently have the right to the benefits of social insurance.</P>
    <P>In an ideal society there should be no need for home assistance and, therefore, no need for home assistance officers.  Unfortunately there is a need for both at the moment.  There is some doubt in the minds of home assistance officers as to their future. In my opinion they should be officials of the Department.  They distribute money for the local authorities.  Many are employed by the health boards and they are also working for the Department.  It is very difficult for them to know what the future holds for them.  The Parliamentary Secretary described these as a support service of last resort.  As I said earlier, they are there for the purpose of helping those in need to keep body and soul together until the benefits to which they are entitled are sanctioned. They provide some kind of income for people who are temporarily without any income.  They have always been regarded as being there for the purpose of relieving destitution. These officials could be used for disseminating information on social welfare benefits and advising people as to their rights.  They could also get in touch with the Department of Social Welfare officials to ensure recipients get what they are entitled to with the greatest possible speed.</P>
    <P>I hope we will go on improving our social welfare services.  I hope that in time we will have an overall scheme covering the entire community, a big task but not a superhuman one.  The incomes of most people must now be fairly apparent through their income tax returns and it should be simple <Col N="1444" /> enough to devise a scheme of contributions which would enable them when the time comes to draw the appropriate benefit.  Most people would prefer to draw benefit rather than assistance.</P>
    <P>Once more I congratulate the Parliamentary Secretary and the Minister on the good work they are doing.  I trust that the few suggestions I made may be helpful in bringing about improvements in social welfare. I believe the benefits should be increased to enable the recipients to enjoy a standard of living equal to that of the well-paid average citizen.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Brien</NameTxt>
      <P>I compliment the Parliamentary Secretary on his very fine brief.  Since March, 1973, the improvements in social welfare have been very obvious.  In March, 1973, the old age pensioner was receiving £6.20; now the old age pensioner will receive £8.50.  These increases go right through the entire field of social welfare.  Children's allowances have been increased and a wife can now claim these allowances as a right. That means that a real income is coming to her.  The means test has been relaxed and one can now earn up to £5 a week without suffering a diminution in a non-contributory pension.  This is a good start.  I know it is only a start and that there will be further improvements in the future. We have only been in office since 1973.  This is June, 1974, and already great improvements have been made, improvements which highlight, as the Parliamentary Secretary said, the Government's intention to bring about reform.  One of the best features has been the setting up of a committee to inquire into poverty.</P>
      <P>When we are talking about social welfare or social assistance we realise that the payments must be as high as possible.  It is time for us to do an in-depth study to find out why we have poverty and what can we do to eliminate it.  It is very good that we should pay weekly amounts to people who are poor but the danger is that this situation will perpetuate itself.  In society, poverty tends to breed within the areas in which it is allowed to develop.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1445" /> This is not a job for the Parliamentary Secretary only.  It is a job for the Government.  Most of the Departments will have to be examined to ensure that we get the type of society we want, an equitable one in which everybody has a chance to improve himself.  This can only be done by a Government with a firm commitment to ridding society of poverty as far as possible.  We will always have people who will have to be assisted and helped.  As a Government we must have the attitude of mind that we want to minimise poverty.</P>
    <P>Great credit is due to the Parliamentary Secretary for getting together an excellent group of people on this committee under the chairmanship of Sister Stanislaus, who is an expert in this field, to make an in-depth study. Admittedly they are starting a pilot scheme, but we hope we will get a clear indication of where the problems are, and how we can tackle them urgently, so that when we come to the end of our term in office we will be able to show our achievements to the people.  In our 14 point plan in 1973 this was one of our commitments.  In a very short period work has started with a new dimension.  We are tackling it as it should be tackled.  We are trying to find out the source of the problem.</P>
    <P>I should like to say a few words about people who unfortunately are unemployed and have to go to those wretched places called labour exchanges, particularly in the big urban areas.  I can speak for Dublin only.  These places dehumanise people. They are worse than jails.  When you go in you are made to feel that you are a lesser being than your fellowmen outside.  I would ask the Parliamentary Secretary to look at this urgently.  I know this might involve another Department or two but it is a social welfare problem.</P>
    <P>They should not be called labour exchanges.  They should be called manpower agencies.  We should have a list of people who are unemployed but employable, and a list of people who definitely are not employable. There is no point in saying we have so many people unemployed.  If a <Col N="1446" /> person is not employable he should not be categorised as unemployed because that sounds as if he can be employed again.  The unemployable should be dealt with separately rather than having to sign on a couple of times a week.  People who unfortunately are knocked out of work for one reason or another should have manpower agencies, places to which they could go to collect their unemployment benefits.  There should be people to meet them and discuss their problems.  There should be sociologists, people with knowledge of career guidance and people from AnCO to help them.  They should be told about retraining.</P>
    <P>We must make them feel that they are part of our society and still have a place within society.  If somebody signs on for a year or a year-and-ahalf in some of the places we have in Dublin, he will certainly be unemployable for ever because his spirit will be broken and he will no longer be able to contribute to society.  I would ask the Parliamentary Secretary to look seriously at this problem.  I know his feelings on it.  Let us take action.  Let us get our people back to work and give them a sense of pride, a sense of being wanted, and not of being social outcasts.  Any time I went into a labour exchange that was the impression I got.</P>
    <P>When will we get away from the system of paying social welfare benefits in dingy post offices?  We are now a social welfare State.  People, and particularly the elderly, have to go out on wet days and queue outside post offices which are fit to sell stamps and postal orders only.  They certainly cannot cope with the heavy demands now made on them as a result of the reform in our society.  Nothing is being done about this.  We see palatial banks dealing with other problems but old age pensioners, widows, mothers collecting children's allowances, have to queue outside post offices.  The staff do their best but they are not trained in this work.</P>
    <P>In the urban areas there should be a social worker at the social welfare centre to advise people on their entitlements and their rights, and to <Col N="1447" /> advise them on any matters.  I would ask the Parliamentary Secretary to look at the overall situation in this regard.  In some cases social welfare payments could be made through banks.  There is no reason why that should not be so.  They are larger establishments than post offices and they would be better able to cope.  It is <Col N="1448" /> important that we come to an arrangement whereby people will not have to queue outside in the rain to collect their entitlements.</P>
    <P>Progress reported: Committee to sit again.</P>
    <P>The Dáil adjourned at 5 p.m. until 3 p.m. on Tuesday, 25th June, 1974.</P>
