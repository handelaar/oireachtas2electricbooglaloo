    <Speaker pid="ThomasJVMeaney" hpid="Mr. Meaney Mr. Meaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Meaney</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Taoiseach the number of sows and gilts in pig in this country on 1st March in 1973 and 1974.</P>

      <NameTxt>Parliamentary Secretary to the Taoiseach (Mr. Kelly)</NameTxt>
      <P>An enumeration of pig stocks is not carried out in respect of 1st March.  The latest information available relates to December, 1973, when the number of sows in pig was estimated at 61,400, the number of other sows kept for breeding at 44,300 and the number of gilts in pig at 13,300.  The corresponding figures for December, 1972, were 63,200, 41,100 and 13,500 respectively. Thus the total breeding herd was estimated at 119,000 in December, 1973, compared with 117,800 in December, 1972.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesMGibbons" hpid="Mr. J. Gibbons Mr. J. Gibbons">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Gibbons</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Parliamentary Secretary say in the context of this drop in breeding herds, the beginning of which is only revealed by his reply, how the issuing of a licence to a bacon plant in West Cork can be justified?</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanTreacy" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Seán Treacy">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>That is a separate question.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnMKelly" hpid="Mr. Kelly Mr. Kelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>Perhaps the Deputy did not understand what I said in the reply. <Col N="486" /> In fact, the number of the breeding herd in December, 1973, was a little greater than it had been in December, 1972.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMGibbons" hpid="Mr. J. Gibbons Mr. J. Gibbons">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Gibbons</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Parliamentary Secretary seriously suggest that the situation now is that there are more breeding pigs than there were a year ago?  If he does he is talking nonsense.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMKelly" hpid="Mr. Kelly Mr. Kelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kelly</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="JeremiahCronin" hpid="Mr. Cronin Mr. Cronin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cronin</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries if, in view of the considerable drop in pig numbers and the consequent fall-off in market demand, he will make a statement on the prospects for grain producers in respect of the coming harvest.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MarkAClinton" hpid="Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries (Mr. Clinton) Mark A. Clinton">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries (Mr. Clinton)</NameTxt>
      <P>Producer prices for milling wheat and malting barley for the coming harvest have been agreed between the growers and the trade interests concerned.  The price of home-grown feed barley must, however, be related to the price of imported grain and will depend on world market conditions at harvest time.  As production of feed barley is expected to fall substantially short of our requirements, producers should have no problem in disposing of the crop.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJVMeaney" hpid="Mr. Meaney Mr. Meaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Meaney</NameTxt>
      <P>Did the Minister say that producers should have no bother disposing of their crop and if he did would he say if he meant on the home market or abroad?  It is quite likely that he will not have the pigs and cattle in such great numbers as before to use up this grain.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MarkAClinton" hpid="Mr. Clinton Mr. Clinton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Clinton</NameTxt>
      <P>We have a shortfall of feed grain in this country in the region of 400,000 tons and there is a very big shortfall in the North of Ireland as well.  I do not think there will be any difficulty in this regard.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMGibbons" hpid="Mr. J. Gibbons Mr. J. Gibbons">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Gibbons</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister not accept that in the current situation with regard to the relation between the price of pigs and the <Col N="487" /> price of pig feed that it is now vitally necessary for farmers who can do it to produce their own barley and store it?  If farmers do that they will be able to produce the pig rations a great deal cheaper than if they have to purchase from manufacturers. Since this is so&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesMGibbons" hpid="Mr. J. Gibbons Mr. J. Gibbons">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Gibbons</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;would the Minister urgently consider the introduction of a special scheme of grants for the storage of barley on the farm?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MarkAClinton" hpid="Mr. Clinton Mr. Clinton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Clinton</NameTxt>
      <P>I have exhorted farmers on numerous occasions to do exactly as the Deputy has suggested. The Deputy is also aware that there are substantial grants available for grain storage on farms.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cronin</NameTxt>

    <P>4.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JeremiahCronin" hpid="Mr. Cronin Mr. Cronin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cronin</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries the sums of money due to each meat factory in respect of intervention beef at 31st March, 1974.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MarkAClinton" hpid="Mr. Clinton Mr. Clinton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Clinton</NameTxt>
      <P>With the permission of the Ceann Comhairle, I propose to take Questions Nos. 3 and 4 together.</P>
      <P>The total amount due to meat factories on 31st March, 1974, in respect of purchases of intervention beef was £2.6 million.  Of this £2.3 million has since been paid and the balance is in course of payment.  It is not the practice to publish any information which might be regarded as confidential in the case of individual firms.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The large amount of beef being sold to intervention caused some <Col N="488" /> delay in making payments but there should be no undue delay in making future payments.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GerardCollins" hpid="Mr. G. Collins Mr. G. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister state when the £2.3 million was paid?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Clinton</NameTxt>
      <P>Since 31st March.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MarkAClinton" hpid="Mr. Clinton Mr. Clinton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Clinton</NameTxt>
      <P>I cannot give day and date for the payment of each individual amount but it has been paid since 31st March.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FlorenceCrowley" hpid="Mr. Crowley Mr. Crowley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Crowley</NameTxt>
      <P>It took a Parliamentary Question to have it paid out.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GerardCollins" hpid="Mr. G. Collins Mr. G. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Collins</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Clinton</NameTxt>
      <P>That is not true and the Deputy knows it.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>Question No. 3 specifically asked the reason for the delay in payment and I did not catch anything in the Minister's reply relating to that question.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MarkAClinton" hpid="Mr. Clinton Mr. Clinton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Clinton</NameTxt>
      <P>We had some difficulty in getting the necessary staff together initially.  We have now got the organisation working and we now can ensure that people will be paid within three weeks.  I have given that assurance to the trade.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesMGibbons" hpid="Mr. J. Gibbons Mr. J. Gibbons">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Gibbons</NameTxt>
      <P>Can the Minister tell us whether, as a result of the new arrangement made by the Commission in Brussels for the uptake of intervention beef from the stores, there will now be a freer flow of cattle into intervention in the Irish market at present?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MarkAClinton" hpid="Mr. Clinton Mr. Clinton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Clinton</NameTxt>
      <P>I suggest that there would be less need for intervention. I hope the market will harden sufficiently to make intervention unnecessary arising out of the measures being taken.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Clinton</NameTxt>
      <P>In the case of the subsidy on exports to the UK there is no delay and all properly documented claims for payment are being met as they arise.  In the case of subsidy on exports to non-EEC countries the amounts due to exporters in most cases are counter-balanced by amounts due by exporters in respect of monetary compensatory export charges.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JeremiahCronin" hpid="Mr. Cronin Mr. Cronin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cronin</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries if, in view of the prolonged crisis in regard to cold storage facilities for intervention beef, he will now indicate to producers the likely storage position when peak supplies of beef come on the market about July next.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MarkAClinton" hpid="Mr. Clinton Mr. Clinton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Clinton</NameTxt>
      <P>It is not practicable to forecast what freezing and storage facilities will be needed from July onwards because the needs will depend on the market situation then obtaining.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardCollins" hpid="Mr. G. Collins Mr. G. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>Could the Minister tell us whether or not he has any proposals to increase the country's capacity for storage?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MarkAClinton" hpid="Mr. Clinton Mr. Clinton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Clinton</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes.  I approached the IDA some months ago in relation to this.  As the Deputy is aware, they had ceased paying grants for freezers and storage space for frozen beef, and I have asked them to resume that again.  They have agreed to do so, and we would expect increased storage space by the autumn.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanCrinion" hpid="Mr. Crinion Mr. Crinion">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Crinion</NameTxt>
      <P>In view of the negotiations the Minister had yesterday, would he like to state what he thinks the position will be in the autumn?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MarkAClinton" hpid="Mr. Clinton Mr. Clinton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Clinton</NameTxt>
      <P>I would hope that the measures agreed upon yesterday would substantially improve the beef market situation.  I would not like to forecast that there would be no need for intervention in the autumn.  We in this country will always be first into intervention.  I had hoped that stronger measures would be taken against imports from third countries, but it was impossible to get agreement <Col N="490" /> on a ban on imports from third countries.  However, at least as a result of trying very hard on this, it was agreed that if the measures taken yesterday were not seen to be having effect, in a few weeks time the matter will be reconsidered to see if additional measures will be necessary.  I do not think anybody wants to see a situation where intervention would become the rule rather than the exception.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMGibbons" hpid="Mr. J. Gibbons Mr. J. Gibbons">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Gibbons</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister not think that the situation that now obtains within the Community of the disposal of beef by the Community at reduced prices to such institutions as schools and hospitals, and re-export abroad, is totally anomalous? While we do not wish to take from the Minister's efforts on behalf of this country in Luxembourg, we would point out&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanTreacy" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Seán Treacy">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>Could we have a question, Deputy?  We cannot delay unduly long on any question.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMGibbons" hpid="Mr. J. Gibbons Mr. J. Gibbons">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Gibbons</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;that it is anomalous for the Community to be actually subsidising the sale of intervention beef and, at the same time, permitting people like the Germans to import hundreds of thousands of tons of frozen meat into their own country and re-export their own cows into our market in Britain.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MarkAClinton" hpid="Mr. Clinton Mr. Clinton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Clinton</NameTxt>
      <P>I made this case very strongly yesterday, but I think the Deputy will accept that the increase in the export refunds to third countries which is approximately £50 a ton should be a help in exporting to third countries, and the additional charge on the import of beef into the Community of £50 a ton should be a great help as well.  I agree with him that these measures are not adequate, but they were certainly the most we could get agreement on.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>Was it considered at all that instead of having a system of 50-50 there should be a 70-30 ratio?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MarkAClinton" hpid="Mr. Clinton Mr. Clinton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Clinton</NameTxt>
      <P>When I made the suggestion first, that is about six weeks ago, I was doubtful as to whether it would be accepted at any <Col N="491" /> relationship, and personally I was quite pleased that they were agreeable to have a one-for-one system, as they so describe it.  I do not think we would have got more.</P>

    <Speaker pid="LiamAhern" hpid="Mr. Ahern Mr. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries whether the staffs of his Department and of the committees of agriculture are fully briefed on the operation of the farm modernisation scheme.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MarkAClinton" hpid="Mr. Clinton Mr. Clinton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Clinton</NameTxt>
      <P>The answer is yes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LiamAhern" hpid="Mr. Ahern Mr. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>Farmers have come to me and asked what they are to do with their farms.  Who will certify them?  Could the Minister say if it is the county committee of agriculture, the instructor appointed by him or somebody from the Department?  The situation is very vague at the moment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MarkAClinton" hpid="Mr. Clinton Mr. Clinton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Clinton</NameTxt>
      <P>The original arrangement was that the advisory officers at local level would prepare a programme and decide what category an applicant came into.  There is some <Col N="492" /> difficulty about this at the moment, as the Deputy knows.  Now if the farmer sends his application form direct to the Department the Department will deal with it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LiamAhern" hpid="Mr. Ahern Mr. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>Therefore, we can take it that the advisory services and the Department are at loggerheads?</P>

    <Speaker pid="MarkAClinton" hpid="Mr. Clinton Mr. Clinton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Clinton</NameTxt>
      <P>No, I would not so describe it.  There is a dispute between the advisory services and the Department?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LiamCunningham" hpid="Mr. Cunningham Mr. Cunningham">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cunningham</NameTxt>
      <P>Not alone would I ask the Minister to give the committee and other people concerned about the operation of the farm modernisation scheme details of the scheme, but would he make full details of it available to Members of this House how it operates and who is entitled to benefit under it?  Would he, above all, ensure that money is being spent on farm grants?  Will the Minister tell this House now whether grants for all classes of farmers are being paid on foot of the farm modernisation scheme or any other scheme?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MarkAClinton" hpid="Mr. Clinton Mr. Clinton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Clinton</NameTxt>
      <P>The answer to the first part of the Deputy's question is that I understood every Deputy got a detailed description of the scheme.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LiamCunningham" hpid="Mr. Cunningham Mr. Cunningham">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cunningham</NameTxt>
      <P>No.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Clinton</NameTxt>
      <P>Certainly if they did not, I shall see that they do.</P>

    <Speaker pid="LiamAhern" hpid="Mr. Ahern Mr. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>May I ask the Minister who is going to certify the applications? Apparently the local advisory services cannot do it because there is some disagreement with the Department. How is the farmer who is interested in the farm modernisation scheme fitted in now?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MarkAClinton" hpid="Mr. Clinton Mr. Clinton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Clinton</NameTxt>
      <P>I answered the Deputy on that.  If the application form is sent direct to the Department of Agriculture and Fisheries it will be dealt with.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LiamAhern" hpid="Mr. Ahern Mr. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>The fact remains that the local advisory officer is no longer the certifying officer.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MarkAClinton" hpid="Mr. Clinton Mr. Clinton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Clinton</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy probably knows the answer to that already. The advisory services have been looking for several concessions and improvements in their employment conditions. I had discussions with them on the 17th January.  I undertook personally to see what could be done for them in the interim period between this and the final reorganisation of the services.  I offered them 70 additional promotional opportunities, which they refused to accept.  They continued not to co-operate, and there has been correspondence coming and going between the Department and the advisory services.  Last Tuesday, I understand, the executive of the General Council of Committees of Agriculture had a meeting with the advisory officers.  I asked an assistant secretary of the Department to attend and give the information from our side.  There were discussions, and further discussions are taking place next Friday.</P>

As well as that, I would like the Minister to let us know whether or not he feels his action in getting directly in touch with the chairman of the County Committees of Agriculture helped in the situation as it is?</P>

      <P>Classification of farms under the scheme is not based on acreage.  The example referred to by the Deputy merely illustrates one possible situation on a 40-acre farm. In other situations, for example, with a more intensive level of operation, or a different mix of enterprises, such a farm could well come into the development category.  Even in the example referred to the farmer in question could, after a further period of expansion of his existing resources, hope to achieve development status.</P>

      <P>I do not wish to take No. 14 at the moment.  There was a lot of confusion about this matter. <Col N="518" /> Yesterday when we were on the Second Stage of the Local Elections (Petitions and Disqualifications) Bill, 1974, the Minister for Local Government indicated that he would let me have information regarding the intention of the Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries and the Minister for Education in relation to the categories of employees which would be excluded from standing for election to local authorities and that this information would be given to me early in the morning, at least well before Question Time.</P>
      <P>I accept that the Minister only became aware of the fact that I had not got this information half way through Question Time and he kindly gave me a copy of it which has an addition in biro which is not included in the copy which has now been circulated to me officially by the staff.  I have just had a request now to speak to an official of the House concerning amendments to this Bill.  I had to tell him I could not speak to him until I had dealt with this.  This request came at 4 o'clock just as you were about to conclude Question Time so I would ask the Minister to agree to postpone taking the Committee Stage of the Bill until we have had an opportunity, first of all, to study the papers which have now been circulated which affect the Bill.</P>

      <P>I am a bit surprised at Deputy Molloy's suggestion&mdash;perhaps, I am not.  I thought he was as anxious as I was to have this matter clarified so that we could have everything in order for the local elections.  I told him yesterday I would arrange to let him have the list to which he refers this morning and then he pointed out that there was a funeral this morning which both he and I would be attending.  I suggested that I would let him have the list before 4 o'clock.  I understand the record says so.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>At 1 o'clock today the documents were in the House and were left in the pigeon holes for each Deputy.  I know that possibly Deputy Molloy had already taken his post out and for that reason may not have got it but it is not of vital importance because of the fact <Col N="519" /> that the categories mentioned are very easily identifiable.  The only one I would like to refer to concerns the vocational teachers who are not included in the document which has been circulated but are people who will be allowed to stand for the local elections.</P>
    <P>With regard to the other matter which the Deputy refers to, the question of laying the order before the House, in fact, he agreed with me yesterday that because of the time available he would be prepared to to accept a certain way of doing it.  He asked: &ldquo;Will I put down an amendment or will you put one down?&rdquo; I think those are the words he used.  I put down an amendment which, in fact, does what Deputy Molloy was prepared to agree to yesterday afternoon. If it was all right yesterday afternoon, I wonder why it is not all right now.  I am prepared to facilitate Deputy Molloy any way I can.  At the same time, I think it is urgent that we have the matter dealt with as quickly as possible and for that reason I would ask the Deputy if he wants to adjourn it that he should put it back for a short while.  I am prepared to agree to adjourn it for another hour if that would satisfy the Deputy.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. R. Ryan)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>This Bill is designed to repeal, from 6th April, 1974, the 20-year tax exemption for profits arising from scheduled non-bedded minerals and to replace the exemption with effect from the same date by a special scheme of tax allowances.</P>
      <P>Deputies are already aware that an interdepartmental committee was set up in 1971 to review the taxation and royalty arrangements in relation to the exploitation of our mineral resources. It was envisaged that this review would assist in the formulation of sound long-term fiscal policy for mineral exploitation which would give the State an equitable share of profits and which would at the same time be sufficiently attractive to the mining companies to ensure the continued development of our mineral resources in an orderly and efficient manner.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Following this study the Government concluded that the 20-year tax exemption was unduly generous by reference to comparable concessions elsewhere and that it was no longer appropriate in the light of the present state of development of the mining <Col N="521" /> industry in this country.  It was clear that the same economic benefits could be secured for the country, together with additional benefits from increased tax revenue, by less prodigal incentives.</P>
    <P>World-wide changes have occurred in recent years in the climate of public opinion and in the framework of government policies within which the mining industry has to operate.  Regardless of the terms of fiscal legislation when investments were first initiated, many countries have subsequently taken steps to increase their revenue from mining.  For instance in Canada a new scheme of allowances applicable to mining is replacing the tax holiday; in the Philippines a percentage depletion allowance, which results in a reduced rate of tax, is being progressively withdrawn; and in Australia certain mining investment allowances have been repealed and the withdrawal of other allowances is being contemplated.  There has also been a marked trend towards greater State participation, from part sharing to outright nationalisation in some places. Mining companies are conscious that they are operating in a highly sensitive area in exploiting the natural resources of host countries.  It is clear from the mining press and journals that the industry recognises the universal and ineluctable character of these new attitudes and has, in fact, come to terms with them.</P>
    <P>Apart from the international change in attitudes to exploitation of natural resources the difficulty in meeting sharply rising demand for base metals has led prices to rise to record levels with commensurate increases in mining companies' profits, which in Ireland have been completely free of tax up to now.  World demand for base metals, the discovery of the Navan mine, which promises to be one of the largest of its kind in the world, and other mining developments and possibilities in Ireland have fundamentally altered the mining situation in this country and made realistic appraisal of the 20-year tax exemption imperative. It was inevitable in these circumstances that Irish public opinion should strongly react against the continued <Col N="522" /> exemption from taxation of profits arising from the exploitation of irreplaceable mineral resources.  The Government, for their part, were duty-bound to act by recasting the tax concessions available as respects non-bedded minerals in order to ensure that the fruits of exploiting our mineral resources would be applied to the greatest extent possible for the economic and social development of the country.</P>
    <P>I wish to avail of this opportunity to emphasise that the special circumstances which necessitated a change in the Government's fiscal policy as respects non-bedded minerals do not apply to industry in general, particularly manufacturing industry.  There is a vital distinction between the proper attitude to adopt to the exploitation of mineral resources, which are wasting assets, and manufacturing industry, which is intended to be permanent.  When a profit making asset is wasting and irreplaceable, it must be taxed while it exists or it will pay no tax at all.  Irish mining assets fall into this category.  Unlike manufacturing industry, tax incentives are not required to locate mineral resources in Ireland; they are either here or they are not.  On the other hand incentives have been recognised as necessary to attract foreign industrialists to Ireland to establish permanent industries which in the absence of tax incentives might not be set up here.</P>
    <P>By virtue of the 20-year tax exemption which could be claimed once mining operations commenced before 6th April, 1986, most of the mining companies would never pay any tax. Manufacturing companies will pay tax when reliefs, such as those for exports, are exhausted and will confer a continuing benefit on the community.  The changes in mining fiscal policy do not of course imply any intention whatsoever to change the tax reliefs in respect of export sales by manufacturing industry.  Every Government since 1956 have continued the reliefs for manufacturing industry and there will be no change in policy in this respect.</P>
    <P>Taxation is but one of many considerations to be taken into account by <Col N="523" /> companies in deciding the allocation of resources between different areas and countries.  In particular the growth of the Irish mining industry in recent years cannot be attributed solely to the tax exemption.  This development was also due to relatively favourable and well documented geology, improvements in technology, good mineral legislation and the impetus given by the Tynagh discovery in 1961.  It is indeed significant that all the mining companies which have made exploitable discoveries here were engaged in mineral exploration before the announcement of the 20-year tax exemption.</P>
    <P>When the Government announced last autumn that it had been decided that the 20-year tax exemption for profits from the mining of non-bedded minerals should be withdrawn and be replaced by an alternative system of tax allowances, a statement of the proposed new allowances was issued and interested parties were invited to submit their views.  Subsequently I discussed the proposed scheme of allowances during the course of a series of meetings with the mining companies.</P>
    <P>I am grateful for the constructive manner in which these consultations were held.  Following these representations the scheme proposed last October was modified in some respects.  In particular it was decided that in addition to the reliefs already announced certain allowances should also be provided in respect of abortive exploration expenditure and the cost of acquiring scheduled mineral assets. The revised scheme of allowances is now set out in the present Bill.</P>
    <P>The various definitions used in the Bill are described in section 1.</P>
    <P>Under section 2 of the Bill immediate allowance is provided against any mining profits of a person from working a qualifying mine for the full amount of exploration and development expenditure as it is incurred, on or after 6th April, 1974, in any part of the State.  Deputies will note that all exploration expenditure, whether successful or abortive, will qualify for <Col N="524" /> immediate allowance against mining profits.  Where however abortive expenditure is incurred on or after 6th April, 1974, by a person commencing mining operations, relief will be limited to abortive expenditure incurred within seven years prior to the commencement of mining.  This seven-year restriction will in practice apply only to persons starting to work a qualifying mine after 6th April, 1981.</P>
    <P>Section 3 will in certain circumstances enable abortive exploration expenditure incurred before 6th April, 1974, but not earlier than 6th April, 1967, also to be set against mining profits.  The qualifying term of seven years for abortive exploration expenditure is considered reasonable in the interests of the Exchequer and the mining industry.  In the absence of such a time limit there could be claims in respect of abortive exploration expenditure incurred in different parts of the country and regardless of when it was incurred&mdash; perhaps over periods of ten, 15 or 20 years.  Since the 20-year tax exemption, which is now being terminated, commenced on 6th April, 1967, it is considered that this date would be an appropriate starting point and it gives a qualifying term of seven years. Provision is also made in section 3 to prevent persons arranging matters so that successful mining companies would take over unsuccessful exploration companies in order to set their abortive expenditure against the taxable mining profits of the successful companies.</P>
    <P>In addition to the reliefs which I have referred to, special provision is made in section 2 of the Bill to enable companies already carrying on mining operations before the withdrawal of the tax exemption to claim an immediate allowance of any unallowed balance of exploration and development expenditure incurred before 6th April, 1974, which qualified for relief under existing law.  Section 7 accords similar relief in respect of any unallowed balance of capital expenditure incurred on plant and machinery brought into use before 6th April last.</P>
    <P>As an encouragement to higher investment in new plant and machinery <Col N="525" /> by the mining industry, provision is also made in section 7 of the Bill which will, in effect, allow 120 per cent of that expenditure to be set-off as it is incurred against mining profits. The relief in question will apply to expenditure incurred on or after 6th April, 1974, to new plant and machinery used in connection with the mining of scheduled non-bedded minerals in any part of the country. No terminal date will apply in the case of this relief.  As a further incentive to encourage exploration for non-bedded minerals, section 6 provides for a special investment allowance of 20 per cent of expenditure on exploration incurred on or after 6th April, 1974.  This is in addition to the 100 per cent allowance for exploration expenditure allowed under section 2, to which I referred earlier.</P>
    <P>I am satisfied that these provisions will afford adequate incentive to further prospecting and exploration so as to ensure the continuation of a satisfactory level of development of the country's mineral resources.</P>
    <P>Section 4 is designed to cover the case where exploration expenditure is incurred by one company in a group of wholly-owned subsidiaries and mining profits are earned by the parent company or by another subsidiary in the group.  In such cases the exploration company may elect to have its exploration expenditure, whether successful or abortive, attributed to any other subsidiary in the group or to the parent company so that the exploration expenditure may be set off against mining profits wherever they arise within the group.</P>
    <P>Section 5 provides relief for exploration expenditure incurred by a person who finds a scheduled mineral deposit and then sells the assets to another person who develops and works the mine.  In such a case the latter will be able to claim in respect of the exploration expenditure incurred in connection with the mine.</P>
    <P>As regards the cost of acquiring deposits of scheduled minerals, section 8 will enable this expenditure, where incurred on or after 1st April, 1974&mdash;the date of circulation of this Bill&mdash;to be spread over the life of the <Col N="526" /> mine or 20 years if shorter.  The allowance will also be given to persons commencing to trade on or after 6th April, 1974, where the expenditure in question was incurred before that date, since such persons would have received no benefit whatever from the tax exemption provisions.  It would, however, be invidious to allow gains from sales of scheduled mineral deposits to escape taxation because the owners elected not to work the deposit but to dispose of their interest.  Consequently, section 11 imposes a charge to income tax, and section 12 imposes a charge to corporation profits tax in the case of a company, on the proceeds of sales of scheduled mineral deposits occurring after 31st March, 1974.</P>
    <P>Sections 15 and 16 terminate, with effect from 6th April, 1974, the exemption from income tax and corporation profits tax, respectively, of profits from the mining of scheduled minerals.  Section 10, however, ensures that relief will be provided for marginal mines which might otherwise cease to operate because of the potential tax burden.</P>
    <P>Sections 13 and 14, which relate to the tax treatment of dividends paid on profits previously entitled to exemption, are consequential on the repeal of the exemption.  In particular, provision is being made to ensure that dividends paid, after the repeal of the tax exemption, but out of profits which fell within the exemption period of 20 years will carry the benefit of the income tax exemption.</P>
    <P>Whatever misgivings, real or imaginary, may have been expressed at the time of the announcement of the intention to end the tax-free holiday on mining profits, all the indications since demonstrate that interest in mining in Ireland is not only continuing; it is on the increase.</P>
    <P>I am satisfied that the new scheme of taxation for mining dealt with in this Bill, together with the other advantages of operating in Ireland, will ensure the ongoing development of mining here to the benefit of the mining interests and the people of the country as a whole.  Because of the generous allowances now being provided, the gain in additional revenue to the Exchequer in the next few years <Col N="527" /> from the new tax arrangements may not be significant but, over the next 20 years, it is estimated that the likely tax yield on the basis of present information, will be of the order of £125 million.  I commend the Bill to the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>Fianna Fáil's criticism of the Government in their approach to mining was not, as a number of Government speakers from time to time have tried to suggest, because we objected to the community getting more from the mines; on the contrary, as I propose to show, Fianna Fáil's approach was to encourage development of our mineral resources and to get the greatest possible return for the community consistent with that encouragement. Indeed, the Minister has stated that objective in his speech in perhaps better language than I have put it in, but our criticism of the Government's proposals were based on three main grounds.</P>
      <P>First, this Bill before us is unnecessary and introduces enormous complications, whereas under what I might call the Fianna Fáil legislation there was virtually no limit to what could be recovered for the community on foot of royalties in a clean, simple way. We believe that this Bill is largely a window-dressing operation designed to fool some of the supporters of the Government.</P>
      <P>The second ground for our criticism was that the imprecise Government announcement followed by a long delay in producing this Bill created great uncertainty in the mining industry and caused the postponement or cancellation of plans for the expenditure of very considerable sums of money on mineral exploration.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The third and the most important ground on which we criticised the Government's attitude on this matter was in relation to the cancellation of the statutory exemption of existing mines, as distinct from new mines, from income tax.  We believe that, in relation to existing mines which were benefiting from this exemption, cancellation was both inequitable and damaging to our hard-won reputation in the field of industrial development <Col N="528" /> as a place where a deal made was a deal kept.  We, on this side of the House, intend on Committee Stage to try to amend this Bill to undo the damage caused by the Government in so far as it is possible to do so now.</P>
    <P>As the Minister indicated in his speech, and as I propose to show in more detail, we, when we were in Government, were endeavouring to work out the maximum amount that we could recover for the community from new mines consistent with encouraging mining in Ireland.  That is one matter.  It is quite a different matter when one is taking away from existing mines a concession granted to them by both Houses of the Oireachtas, solemnly enshrined in legislation, and then trying to reassure people, as the Government tried to do in relation to industrial development, by offering written undertakings by the Taoiseach and other members of the Government that this kind of thing would not happen in relation to industrial development.</P>
    <P>We suggest that this kind of approach is very damaging to this country's efforts to attract industry and create new employment, which should be our first priority, and that it was quite unnecessary.  The term that might be applied to new mines starting up would not be, I believe, a matter of major controversy, but the taking away of what had been offered to existing mines and under which they had been operating is quite another matter, and it is not good enough for the Minister to gloss over that in his speech, as he has done.</P>
    <P>In considering this legislation it is probably necessary and, I would hope, worthwhile to look back a little at what has been happening in this country in regard to mining.  It must be remembered that up to relatively recent years all the experts told us that there were no mineral resources in this country.  Despite that, a State company known as Mianraí Teoranta was set up to explore for mineral deposits. This operation, although it cost a great deal of money, was not successful.  There were at the time complaints about the money being <Col N="529" /> spent on Mianraí Teoranta.  If we had continued with this policy&mdash;and on a bigger scale as would have been necessary&mdash;there would, no doubt, have been an outcry about voting money in this House every year for holes in the ground.  That is what they would have been described as, and were described as in the past.  It might be argued that the State could have bought the latest technical know-how to improve exploration methods. While this is all right in theory in practice it is difficult and may well be impossible to bring about.</P>
    <P>As a consequence of this experience it was decided to change the general approach to mineral exploration and to offer inducements to private enterprise to explore for and develop mineral resources.  That this policy was successful in locating very substantial finds of minerals and is likely to result in further similar finds in the future is now well known and accepted.  It is of some significance that, so far as I know, no worthwhile exploration was carried out in Northern Ireland until recent years when it was triggered off by the findings of mineral deposits in the Twenty-six Counties.  I believe that the significance of that is that inducements such as we offered were not available in the North.  It is difficult to believe in a small country like this that the geological deposits conform with the Border.  There must be some other explanation for the finds in the South as against the lack of finds in the North.</P>
    <P>There is in this country a very voluble group&mdash;I do not know how large they are but they are certainly voluble&mdash;who demand the nationalisation of our mineral resources.  I did not hear demands of that kind being made in any voluble way when we had a State company exploring for mineral resources.  I do not remember these people or people like them advocating at that time the expenditure of a great deal more money on exploration or on the purchase of know-how from abroad or of more up-to-date technical equipment.  What these people are now advocating is that private enterprise, having done <Col N="530" /> the work and risked capital, should have the fruits of their labours and investments confiscated.</P>
    <P>It is frequently forgotten that a number of companies have spent a great deal of money on exploration and drilling with no success whatever. Even if one were to accept the proposition that we should nationalise the mines at this stage one must face the fact that very large amounts of capital would be required and that the amount of capital available to the State for the building of houses, schools, factories, hospitals and so on, is limited, as the Minister for Finance knows only too well.  Consequently, if we were to nationalise the mines we would have to cut back on the capital we are putting into such projects as schools and hospitals, or we would have to try to find abroad, and to attract here, specific mining capital in order to invest it in our nationalised mines.  To succeed in this, we would have to offer very considerable inducements and financial returns so that the net effect of this, while it might be called nationalisation, would not be very different from the present position in that a great deal of the profit would be going to outside interests who had invested capital in our mining enterprise.</P>
    <P>It must also be remembered that when we originally offered inducements it was in a situation where the prospects for mining in this country were very poor.  As our mining finds developed, the State's bargaining position improved so that it is now possible to get much greater returns for the State from mining and, in other words, to give much smaller inducements than was possible in the past. It is quite unrealistic to compare the present situation with that which obtained when we first introduced our mining inducements.  It is also important to remember that no new mining lease has been granted for over eight years and that the negotiations for that lease took place considerably earlier.  In other words, we have not had an opportunity of improving the returns to the State from mining since the mining picture in Ireland improved to the extent where <Col N="531" /> we could reflect that improvement in the returns we got for the State.</P>
    <P>The former Government were very conscious of this situation.  As indicated by the Minister in his speech, they set up an inter-departmental committee in 1971 to examine and advise the Government on the best approach, from the State's point of view and the point of view of the community, to the kind of terms that should be demanded in any new mining lease. The mining lease for Navan was held up for that reason.  It should be realised that we were in a position, as I have indicated earlier, under the previous legislation to improve the returns for the State almost without limit on foot of the royalty clauses which we could impose in new leases. We could do so while still arriving at a figure that would ensure an adequate return for those investing in mining.</P>
    <P>It is quite clear, therefore, that Fianna Fáil originally tried the approach of using a State company and found that this did not work.  They then changed policy and offered inducements to private enterprise.  They found this policy was very successful. When that success had put us in a much better bargaining position, Fianna Fáil were preparing to extract the maximum benefit from that bargaining position for the community, but they left office before it was possible to complete the implementation of this policy.</P>
    <P>The question of a smelter arises whenever one considers the situation in regard to mining in this country. There is no doubt that the erection and operation of a smelter here would be very valuable to the economy and would result in our getting much more of a return from minerals than if they had to be exported to foreign smelters.  The first requirement for a smelter is that there be an adequate supply of ore to keep it going.  It is for this reason that owners of smelters around the world are major sources of investment in mining operations and in the development of mining. From their point of view investment in mines means that they can be sure of having a supply of ore to render <Col N="532" /> their smelters economic but, consequently, one of the conditions of their investment is that a certain proportion of the production of the mines must be guaranteed to be supplied to their smelters.  This brings us again to the problem of capital. It is clear that if a smelter is to be erected here a great deal of capital may be required from the Government because alternative sources of capital for a smelter will create the problem I have mentioned, that is, of endeavouring to tie down part of our ore supply for a foreign smelter.</P>
    <P>When the Minister is replying I should like him to clarify whether the operation of a smelter would be subject to the provisions of this Bill. Such clarification would be helpful.</P>
    <P>The next matter I wish to deal with is one to which I referred when speaking in this House on budget day after the Minister had made his statement. On that occasion I referred to the situation regarding an offer made for shares in Tara by a company called, I think, Cominco.  At the time I was subjected to a considerable amount of abuse and interruption particularly from the Minister for Industry and Commerce but I note that, subsequently, in his speech on the budget, he made no reference to this matter. Perhaps I could recap the position: it appears that this company made a bid for Tara shares that was much greater than the market value.  People do not understand how that company could do so if they were in the same position as ordinary Tara shareholders and as members of the general public who did not know what were the details of the Government's taxation proposals or, indeed, the terms of the lease to be granted and the royalties to be paid in respect of Tara.</P>
    <P>On the face of it, Cominco had information that was not available to the ordinary public.  Anyone in possession of such information could stand to make a fortune.  I ask the Government, even at this late stage, to state categorically that no member of the Government, that no one on their behalf, gave such information either directly or indirectly to Cominco.  In the absence of such a categorical assurance <Col N="533" /> public interest requires a public sworn inquiry into the matter.  I am not accusing the Government of anything. I am saying that the situation, on the face of it, requires an explanation.  It is open to the Government to explain it and I am calling on them to do so.</P>
    <P>Another matter to which I referred also on the occasion of the budget and to which the Minister for Industry and Commerce took grave exception was the effect on industrial development of the Government's announcement in relation to mining legislation.  I do not know whether the record of this House shows precisely what happened on that occasion but what did happen was that the Minister for Industry and Commerce became very agitated when I referred to this matter.  Three times I asked him if he were denying that problems had been arising in regard to industrial development because of the Government's announcement.  It was only after being asked the question three times that the Minister replied and then he denied that what I was saying was true.  However, in his speech on the budget he referred to the matter and said that I had produced no evidence to substantiate what I was saying.  He said also, I think, that I was guilty of shyster tactics in this regard.  We, on this side of the House, in common with many people, including in particular some of our own supporters, suffer by reason of the fact that, having been in Government, we are a great deal more conscious of the risks of damaging the national interest than were the Opposition with whom we were faced.  The reason for this was that they had not had experience of Government.</P>
    <P>There have been a number of matters on which we have remained silent because we deemed it to be in the national interest to do so but there comes a time when it is not in the national interest to allow a coverup of steps being taken by the Government which are damaging, as in this case, to our economic prospects.  I do not propose to mention the names of any private firms in this context but I propose to draw the attention of the House to the fact that after the announcement was made by the <Col N="534" /> Government regarding the withdrawal of the statutory tax exemption on existing mines, a number of members of the Government very quickly were speaking about this matter.  So far as I can recall the first one to do so was the Minister for the Gaeltacht.  He was followed by others, including the Minister for Industry and Commerce and, ultimately, by the Taoiseach. They spoke at considerable length in efforts to reassure the people.  Indeed, the Minister for Finance said the same thing today in his speech.  They went so far as to say that they would give written undertakings to the effect that the tax exemption applying to industrial firms engaged in the export market would not be withdrawn.</P>
    <P>I ask the House and, in particular, the Minister for Industry and Commerce, whether it would have been necessary for members of the Government, including the Taoiseach, to make such speeches and to offer such undertakings in writing unless it had been discovered that the Government announcement in regard to their mining proposals was causing difficulty in the industrial field?  Let us suppose for a moment that no difficulties were being caused in that sphere by this announcement, as the Minister for Industry and Commerce tried to convey to the House.  In that case would even this Government, despite all the mistakes they have made, begin drawing the attention of potential industrialists to the possibility that the export tax relief might be withdrawn? It would be insulting to the intelligence of the Minister for Industry and Commerce to suggest that he and his colleagues would have made speeches to that effect and would have offered written personal undertakings if there were no problems arising. It is beyond belief that any Government could do something so silly.</P>
    <P>It passes beyond belief that any Government could do something so silly.  Therefore, I suggest that the evidence is clear from the actions of the Government itself, and in particular of the Minister for Industry and Commerce, that the announcement of the Government's intention in regard <Col N="535" /> to mining did cause considerable difficulties in regard to industrial development. It is useless for the Minister for Industry and Commerce or anybody else to come here and try to deny that that is so.  They may argue that it was an inevitable consequence of what they announced, that it was unavoidable and worthwhile. If that is the argument they want to make let them make it.  But that is not what they said.  They said that no difficulty was caused by the Government's announcement.  What I have just outlined is clear evidence that there was a backlash and a problem arising and that potential investors in industry here were being frightened off not because the Government were proposing to impose taxation on mining and profits from mining, but that the Government were proposing to repeal in relation to existing mines a statutory exemption which had been passed by both Houses of the Oireachtas, and, as far as I know, without opposition.  That is the reason the trouble was caused and that is why we objected to the Government's announcement.  We pointed that out at that time and it is no use now trying to pretend that damage was not caused.  It was.</P>
    <P>We believe that even at this late stage equity and the interests of this country in securing investment from abroad in industrial projects require us to undo, as far as possible, the damage this Government has caused. On Committee Stage we intend to try to do this.  However, at this stage I cannot anticipate what attitude the Minister and the Government will adopt in this regard.  Therefore, I must deal with the Bill on certain assumptions, including the assumption that the Minister will not accept the proposition we will put forward. On the assumption that the Minister will not try to remedy the breaching of the statutory promise to existing mines, would he indicate whether the conventional preceding year basis of assessment will be applied?  If it is, it would appear to contradict what I understand was an assurance given by the Minister to mining interests when he met them on 11th January <Col N="536" /> last.  Furthermore, if the preceding year basis is to apply, there would appear to be a certain lack of logic in the Minister's report.</P>
    <P>Sections 13 and 14 dealing with dividends provide that the benefit of the tax exemption cannot be given to shareholders on the payment of dividends out of profits earned after 5th April, 1974, but that it must be given in relation to profits earned before that date.  It seems clearly illogical to charge the profits earned before 6th April, 1974, to tax while at the same time requiring that dividends paid out of those profits should be tax-free dividends.  I suggest that unless the Minister can confirm to the House that the conventional preceding year basis will not be applied, it would behove him to take some action in this regard, possibly on the lines of what he proposes to do with regard to the income taxation on farmers announced in the budget.  That might meet this problem.</P>
    <P>In regard to section 2, it would appear that interest on money borrowed to meet development expenditure as defined in the Bill will be allowed as part of development expenditure, if it is incurred on or after 6th April, 1974, but not if it is incurred before that date.  If this is so this would appear to be discrimination against existing mines.  I ask the Minister to confirm the position as to whether I have stated it correctly, and, if I have, to explain the thinking behind this provision.  Furthermore, if interest on money borrowed for development expenditure is to be allowed as a charge, why not apply the same treatment on money borrowed for exploration expenditure before the mine starts production?  Perhaps the Minister would explain the thinking behind that also.</P>
    <P>In regard to section 3 which relates to expenditure on abortive exploration, the Minister proposes to allow this with a seven year time limit.  I understand that exploration may take five to seven years, appraisal another two years and development thereafter approximately another five years.  If this is so, it would seem clear that the seven year period proposed by the Minister is <Col N="537" /> quite unrealistic.  Perhaps when replying he would deal with this point, explain the principles he has in mind and whether he accepts the estimates of time involved which I have given. If he does not, why not?</P>
    <P>There are provisions in section 8 and 11, if one takes them together, under which existing mines, which dispose of scheduled mineral assets, become liable to tax but without the benefit of the relief provided for in section 8 which is given to new mines. This appears to be further discrimination against existing mines.  I would appreciate if the Minister would explain the thinking behind this or, alternatively, make provision to change this approach in the Bill.</P>
    <P>There is another matter which arises under these sections.  If a farmer sells land to a mining company, this Bill will make him liable to tax at the normal tax rates on whatever price he receives.  If, however, he sells the same land for another purpose, say, to a builder, he will only be liable under the White Paper proposals to capital gains tax on the increasing value of the land since the 5th April of this year.  This, on the face of it, appears to be an anomaly requiring rectification.  I would ask the Minister to have a look at that problem.  I would ask him also to state the reason he proposes to allow as a deduction in such cases only the cost of acquisition and not the cost of exploration or development.  I would ask the Minister also to note the phrase in section 2 (1) (b) &ldquo;in the opinion of the inspector&rdquo;.  Would the Minister confirm that such an opinion would be subject to the right of appeal?</P>
    <P>In regard to section 6, I should like to ask why is the investment allowance in relation to expenditure on exploration to be allowed only on expenditure incurred after 6th April, 1974?  Again, on the face of it, this appears to be discriminating against existing mines.  If the statutory exemption from tax is to be taken away from existing mines, surely the least they can expect is that all mines, existing and new, will be treated the same way for tax purposes?  Perhaps <Col N="538" /> the Minister will explain the thinking behind that provision.</P>
    <P>In regard to section 7 (2) I would ask the Minister to consider amending that to provide that the right as to the amount of unallowed expenditure on plant and machinery claimed as a deduction for the year of assessment, 1974-75, would be at the election of the company on the same basis as he provides in section 2 (2).</P>
    <P>With regard to section 10, which deals with marginal mines, I am somewhat unhappy at the vesting of the power provided in that section in the Minister for Finance as such.  On the face of it this would seem to be quite inappropriate.  I note also that there is no provision for an appeal against whatever decision the Minister would make.  Indeed it is difficult to see how you could provide an appeal if one adheres to the Minister's proposals to vest this power in the Minister for Finance.  It would seem to me that a better arrangement would be to give the power to the Revenue Commissioners with the right of appeal to the Appeal Commissioners.  It may be that the Minister will be able to show us that there is something wrong with this approach and that it is necessary to have the power vested in the Minister himself, but the reasons would want to be very compelling to justify a provision of this nature.</P>
    <P>Furthermore, I believe this section would be much improved if it laid down some guidelines as to how the Minister for Industry and Commerce, the Revenue Commissioners, the Appeal Commissioners and, above all, the taxpayers were to approach the problem of marginal mines.  I do not think the section really gives any guidance as to how this problem is to be approached and what criteria are to be operated by the Minister for Industry and Commerce or the Minister for Finance in exercise of the powers under this section.</P>
    <P>I have tried to outline some of what might be called the technical problems that I see arising in regard to various sections in this Bill and on which I would appreciate the Minister's comments.  I repeat that I have <Col N="539" /> put these forward only on the assumption that the Minister would not accept the proposition that the existing exemption should not be removed from existing mines.  If that were accepted most of the points I have raised would not arise at all.  We believe, in the interests of equity and in the interests of the economy, that this exemption should not be removed from existing mines.  I repeat from existing mines, quite distinct from new mines, which can be treated on a completely different basis.  There is no obligation on anybody to treat them in the same way as existing mines.  This is a very important point. I would ask the Minister, even at this stage, to give very serious consideration to the implications of what he is proposing to do in this Bill in relation to existing mines, the implications not merely in the mining field but overall in relation to industrial development, which is vitally important to the people of this country. If the Minister does a rethink on this, most of the points I have raised will not arise; but if he does not most of these points do arise and I would ask the Minister to comment on them when replying.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FergusOBrien" hpid="Mr. O'Brien Mr. O'Brien">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Brien</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to welcome this Bill.  Any sane-minded person or country would not have given away the wealth of the nation like this.  There was a 20 year concession on the wealth of Ireland.  No doubt international mining companies could not believe they were in for such a bonanza, and bonanza it was.  All the Irish people would have got out of this was holes in the ground and mounds of dirt because those international companies would have ensured that they cleaned out the wealth of Ireland within this time. Because a Bill went through ensuring this 20 years it behoved any Government with a social conscience to ensure that action was taken, that if not all the wealth of this nation, at least a good deal of it, would accrue to the Irish people and not go somewhere else.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is talk about this having reprecussions on other industrial development. <Col N="540" /> This is not true.  The Taoiseach and Ministers had to make clear statements of intent that industrial development would not be touched because we had an Opposition going around the country preaching doom, saying that this Government were going to welch on all international companies. That is the reason.  There were no other reasons.  The mining concerns are quite happy with the deal they have got.  They are not complaining.  There was conjured-up hysteria, workers being led astray and marching when we all knew the wealth was still in the ground and that no mining company would pull out or no mines would close.  This is the type of thing that was being conjured up at the time. One cannot imagine why.  The wealth that would have accrued to the nation from mining would help our industrial development and the development of our nation in general.  Any developing nation that gives its wealth away, as we were, remains under-developed and poor.  We have seen some of the South American countries that were exploited. This Government are not prepared to allow this nation to be exploited.  We encourage industrialists and mining companies to come in here. We have the facilities for them and in this Bill we have concessions for them. No international company today expect the kind of deal the previous Government gave.  They sold out the nation.  Thank God we had a change of Government and a change of attitude.</P>

      <P>They welched on legislation that had the sanctity of this House and the Seanad around it.  The Minister for Industry and Commerce, Deputy Keating, in reply to a question on 12th July, 1973, as reported in the Official Report, Volume 267, column 903, said:</P>
      <P>The same sort of considerations apply as applied in the question answered just now by the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs.  Where commitments have been entered into they will be honoured.  The country cannot continue its industrial development if it makes agreements and breaks them.</P>
      <P>I submit that that is exactly what this Government have done.  The Government have broken agreements; they have flagrantly cast aside legislation that was guaranteed in this House to give in to a few vociferous protests in the Dublin area.  Nobody objects to the welfare of the Irish nation being protected by any legislation and this Bill would have the full support of Members on this side of the House if it applied only to new mining companies and if there was no retrospection.</P>
      <P>I concur with the statement made by the Minister for Industry and Commerce which I quoted.  The country cannot continue its industrial development if the Government flagrantly breaks agreements as they have done.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Crowley</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Creed is trying to bluff.  He does not know what is going on in his own area or in his constituency.  I submit that because of the statements that were made on mining two valuable industries I have referred to did not come to Ireland.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I regret, in particular, that they did <Col N="545" /> not come to my constituency.</P>
    <P>We all accept the fact that our mineral resources are a wasting asset and, in that light, cannot be compared to industrial development.  But we must remember also that not long ago all the experts here were telling us that we did not have any worthwhile mineral deposits.  Our own experience, by setting up a semi-State body to investigate the possibility, did not come to fruition and probably cost the Exchequer what was then a considerable amount of money.  Those people who cry out for the nationalisation of our mines would do well to ponder on the experiences that were met then.  As Deputy Colley has pointed out, all that was produced was holes in the ground.</P>
    <P>As a consequence of that the Government at that time decided, rightly, on a change of policy.  They decided to encourage private enterprise into the field by various forms of inducement to explore and develop. It cannot be contradicted that this policy was very successful in locating where mineral deposits were.  The enormous sums involved in exploring and endeavouring to exploit our mineral resources are so vast that the Government could not contemplate undertaking this work.  A semi-State body could not do so either.</P>
    <P>The amount of expertise that is so necessary is not available here.  Some of the people who have come in here to explore for mineral deposits have been described as foreigners and speculators, but the people involved in the work at Tara Mines are Irishmen who emigrated and did well.  They returned to this country and invested their money here.  They had the good fortune to discover substantial deposits of mineral ore in that area.</P>
    <P>I do not deny that, as our recognition of our mining potential and as a promise of greater deposits evolve, the State should demand its pound of flesh.  I have no objection to the lessening of those incentives or inducements to new companies coming in.  It is difficult to imagine how so much ill-informed criticism came about in relation to the mining industry because we know that a big number <Col N="546" /> of prospectors have spent a considerable amount of money and have had absolutely no return from that expenditure as yet.</P>
    <P>There are groups saying we should nationalise and take over everything, that we should take it off all the free enterprise operators in the country and make it as difficult as possible for them.  The amount envisaged by the Minister, £125 million over the next 20 years, is considerable even by modern standards, where inflation is running at such a rapid rate that those large sums seem to contract quickly in the space of a couple of years.  We could have had all that sort of protection without any of the consequent damage if we just ensured that only new companies coming into the field would be subject to the new restrictions.  It is always difficult in a situation like this to try to draw the line, especially in relation to mining where, as the Minister said in his brief, we are talking about something that is a wasting asset and on which we have to capitalise to the maximum maybe in a short space of time.</P>
    <P>I do not think any of our development, mining or anything else, can be taken in isolation.  We must recognise the fact that legislation enacted specifically in relation to mining can have repercussions elsewhere.  The most important exercise that we and the Government should involve ourselves in is to ensure that we never again have a recurrence of what happened in relation to this legislation and that we will never again be in the position of scaring off potential investors.</P>
    <P>It is quite easy to make statements, and it is probably hard for Ministers on that side of the House who have been in opposition for so long to adjust to the fact that they are Ministers and that every statement and every commitment by them carries far more weight than when they were mere Opposition spokesmen.  They have been used to pleasing the protestors, the complainers and other people for so long that as soon as any sort of mini-lobby comes along, especially one that was as articulate as the antimining lobby, they run scared in front <Col N="547" /> of it and do irreparable damage to the country.</P>
    <P>Our policy in Government has always been to attract as much investment as possible to this country, because we recognise that by attracting investment we are not alone attracting the capital that is so important for the creation of extra jobs but we are also importing what we so badly need, namely, technical know-how and expertise in the various fields of the companies that invest here.</P>
    <P>No short-term gain should jeopardise our whole industrial future.  It is quite popular to talk about taxing wealthy people like mining companies, large farmers, large industrialists, and other people like that, but in this country we either have a free enterprise system or we have not.  It is an easy thing to debate.  If you want a completely socialist State, there are lots of good arguments for it, but at the moment we have a free enterprise system operating and, therefore, the inflow of capital is a vital ingredient for the success of the economy.  Any steps we take that restrict or stem that inflow will have very serious long-term repercussions.</P>
    <P>As I say, the inflow of capital is important.  However, statements that have not been thought out properly and socialistic clichés about taxing the wealthy, such as have been thrown out <i>ad lib.</i>, cause an outflow of capital, which is very serious.  This Government must be tremendously strict with themselves and remember that they are the Government of the country now, that they are no longer the irresponsible Opposition that they were, and that every decision and every statement made by them has vast repercussions for all of us.  Therefore I would ask the Minister for Finance to take very special note of the quotation that I gave from the Minister for Industry and Commerce when he said: &ldquo;The country cannot continue its industrial development if it makes agreements and breaks them&rdquo;.  I submit that as a result of the breaking of an agreement entered into by the former Government this country has lost considerably.</P>
    <P>The Minister said that he has had <Col N="548" /> discussions with the mining companies, that they are now very ameniable to his proposals and are not prejudiced against this Bill introduced by him.  Nevertheless, I do not think they are the ones that have got to be the primary concern of us all.  The Minister, when he is replying, could very well answer the charges levelled by Deputy Colley: how did a company with absolutely no connection with Ireland have the knowledge&mdash;because prior knowledge must have been necessary&mdash;to pay such a substantially greater amount than the apparently true value of the Tara shares at the time?  The Minister owes it to the country to make a categoric statement. If he does, it would help to clear up quite a lot of disquiet in regard to that question.  The Minister can give an explanation of why it was necessary for the Taoiseach and some of his Ministers to make statements to the effect that they would personally guarantee that there would be no breaking of agreements in relation to any industrialists coming into this country.</P>
    <P>It is extraordinary to have the Taoiseach and his Ministers putting themselves in the position of having to make such statements.  The only conclusion I can draw is the obvious one &mdash;that some industrialists were pulling out while other industrialists were reluctant to consider coming here and that this type of reassurance was necessary.  If the Government have learned nothing else from this episode that itself would seem important.</P>
    <P>The Minister spoke about the development of the mining industry and said that it was due to relatively favourable and well-documented geology.  If our geological surveys were so well-documented, how is it that the State body which was set up to investigate the position in regard to mineral ore deposits in this country was not able to locate such deposits? The Minister said it was so when he was making the point that the growth in the Irish mining industry cannot be solely attributed to tax exemptions but was also due to relatively favourable and well-documented geology, and also the improvements in technology, good mineral legislation and the impetus <Col N="549" /> given to the Tynagh discovery in 1961. I submit that this is a lot of poppycock and that the reason the mining industry was successful was the enlightened legislation enacted by Fianna Fáil.  It brought the proper type of people here with the expertise to exploit and explore the mineral resources which we had available.  I submit that saying that one of the reasons for it was the well-documented geology is an attempt to cloud the issue completely.</P>
    <P>Even at this late stage the Minister must, in fairness, reconsider the whole position in relation to the way the Government have welched on the deals entered into by the former Government. As the Minister for Industry and Commerce so rightly said, the country cannot continue industrial development if it makes agreements and then breaks them.  I submit that our industrial development is in jeopardy because of the irresponsible acts of the members of the Government.  Let us hope that they will learn the lesson of the past and ensure that industrial development is not inhibited in any way because of some socialistic cliches coming from members of the Labour Party or, indeed, the Fine Gael Party also.  Let us make sure that we present a proper image of this country as a Government that always honour their commitments.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMoore" hpid="Mr. Moore Mr. Moore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moore</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Crowley mentioned the claim made for our adequate geological surveys and the knowledge we had on this subject. Many years ago I read an article by someone whose name I have forgotten. He stated that people interested in mining could forget about this country because they had tried all the resources and the results were nil. Luckily for us, in later years there were people in Government who did not accept this.  They set out to prepare the way for full exploration and development of our resources.  Having enacted legislation and attracted to this country outside concerns who had the expertise and the organisation to probe for our mineral resources, they set a path for further development. If names like Tynagh and others come to mind we can take great pride in them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="550" /> The Minister stated that, unlike manufacturing industries, tax incentives are not required to locate mineral resources in Ireland.  He stated that the minerals are either here or are not.  That is a very simple statement. How does one discover whether there are minerals?  Having done so, does one leave them lying in the ground or does one take all possible steps to ensure that they are taken from the ground and converted into their finer forms?</P>
    <P>As a result of Fianna Fáil action over the years not alone in Ireland but abroad, we had built up an image of a go-ahead country wishing to develop all its resources and which had not insular ideas of trying to keep the resources but rather the idea of giving the opportunity to outsiders to come here and help us develop our resources.  A change of Government brought about a change of outlook on this matter.  This is where one feels afraid because the Government have decided to change this.  I know that not all members of the Government agree with this policy, but the Government have decided to change the plan of developing these resources. We must think of the damage that may have been done to our image abroad.  Steps may be taken which will hinder the full development of our resources.  Such action does not enhance our standing in the world today.  It does not help us when it is noted that because of the change of Government there is a radical change in the approach in financing and general encouragement in regard to the development of the country's resources.</P>
    <P>Perhaps, as Deputy Crowley suggested, it is not too late for the Minister to review the present attitude and to amend the legislation as it goes through the House.</P>
    <P>The Government did not have the task of convincing outsiders of the presence of mineral resources in this country.  Fianna Fáil had that task and had to take the initial steps towards attracting mining prospectors. Of course, we were prepared, too, to introduce the legislation that was necessary to make it easier for outside <Col N="551" /> firms to explore here.  Therefore, what is happening now is, in effect, the second stage of the development, but instead of letting matters run smoothly as they have been, the Coalition are now making changes with which I am sure many members of Fine Gael do not agree.  These changes may result in grave injustice being done to the people of this nation by reason of the fact that they may not allow our mineral resources to be developed to the full.  The Government's attitude may be based solely on some political prejudice against Fianna Fáil.  I would not expect everybody on the benches opposite to agree with what Fianna Fáil have done in this sphere but I would suggest that the Coalition should not run the risk of jeopardising the welfare of our people.  They must realise that in order to provide a good standard of living for our people in the future it is necessary that every ton of our mineral resources be exploited.</P>
    <P>The Government may very well be turning back the clock so far as the mining industry is concerned.  We are aware of a certain uneasiness among some members of the Cabinet, especially the Fine Gael members, in regard to the Government's attitude. These people are hoping that their colleagues will realise the wisdom of the thinking of Fianna Fáil Governments. Despite any promises that may have been made during the election campaign, or at some other time, the Government should reconsider what they are doing.  Not only will the development of our mineral resources provide gainful employment for our people but they are necessary if we are to provide a higher standard of living for all our people.  This is an area in which the Government should not play party politics.</P>
    <P>The Minister stated that he wished to emphasise the special circumstances which have necessitated a change in the Government's fiscal policy in respect of non-bedded minerals and said that these would not apply to industry in general, particularly the manufacturing industry.  On that basis, having removed the mineral from the earth, will the Government go <Col N="552" /> ahead then to make attractive the task of refining the metals or will the metals be exported in bulk form? The Minister might well admit that the Government have made a miscalculation as to what are the best incentives to attract people from outside to explore here.  If this is the case they should seek the confidence of the House and tell us that the decision they have made may well have far-reaching implications abroad, that it may damage our image of being a country which, having made a decision, is not prepared to stand by it.  In any case, let the Government not endeavour to show that Fianna Fáil were not <i>au fait</i> with all aspects of the mining industry or that we were over generous.  I would not accept that Fianna Fáil were over generous because, in the first place, we had to prove that there was a possibility of gainful mineral finds here so as to attract mining exploration companies to come here with all their expertise. That was a very big step and, of course, we had also to convince our own people of the existence of these minerals in quantities great enough to provide a viable industry.  Any Government must take a chance in relation to decisions made from time to time but in this case they had sound guidelines available to them. I do not know why they deviated from these guidelines.  One can only guess that their motive was political but that can hardly be sufficient reason for rescinding the legislation in respect of this industry.  Therefore, we must assume that there is another reason but whatever that reason the Government should examine their whole attitude in this regard and, before untold damage is done, they should examine this legislation line by line so that they might amend it in a way that would ensure that no harm would result to the mining industry. Apart from the value of any minerals that might be exploited one can envisage a situation in which we could take our place in technology with other peoples of the world so that they might benefit from us as we have benefited from them in regard to their resources of oil or natural gases.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="553" /> We must ensure that from this Legislature emanates the basis for the establishment of a viable mining industry. We must ensure, too, that the legislation we enact in this respect will be such as to ensure that nothing will be left undone that will enable every available ton of mineral to be taken from the earth and to be used for the good of our people.  I believe that the Minister for Finance could be <i>avant garde</i> in relation to the development of our resources.</P>
    <P>He was influenced by other people who feel we should be more socialistic and hammer the mining moguls.  That may sound well in speeches at political party meetings but it has no place in this world today where a country with a wealth of minerals is the envy of others.  Major wars have been caused in the past by greed for these minerals.  Their excuse was that the natives were not capable of developing their own resources.  Then the bigger nations stepped in to do the job for them.  It would be a terrible thing if because of this Government's attitude and decisions other powers might take action&mdash;not physical action&mdash;against us to show us that we are not capable of developing our natural resources. They could use international financial considerations to make sure that we did not progress very far.</P>
    <P>If the Government examine this legislation, they will realise that they may do untold harm to the image of the Irish nation if they are accused of breaking their promises.  That would be very serious.  That could damage our mining prospects which would be a major disaster.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Foreign Affairs (Dr. FitzGerald)</NameTxt>
      <P>It is clear to the people and accepted by virtually everyone outside the ranks of the Fianna Fáil Party that the tax concession involved here for the last 20 years was a mistake. It was a mistake for which the blame was shared.  Primarily, the blame for such a blunder rests with the Government of the day who took that action.  The Oireachtas generally failed to appreciate its significance at that time.  As a result, we were left with the situation in which, if this <Col N="554" /> Government had taken no action, the legitimate benefits which should accrue to this country from these natural resources would, to a disproportionate extent, have gone to the private interests largely outside this country to whom these benefits would have flowed through the outflow of untaxed profits. Something had to be done about that.</P>
      <P>Public opinion on the subject was acute.  Then it became clear from the scale of mistakes that had been made and from the scale of the discoveries of ores here, how much this blunder might cost this country.  The weight of public opinion directed to the subject made it necessary for action to be taken by whatever Government was in power.  It is hard to believe that if the Opposition were in Government they would not have taken the necessary responsible action to retrieve the blunder which was made.</P>
      <P>The work of the resources study group played an important part in the development of public opinion.  Their work in my view contains errors, exaggerations and, in its interpretation by others, it has given rise to misconceptions as to the scales of the sums involved.  Nonetheless, they helped to alert public opinion to this subject.  They created a climate of opinion in which it became clear that certain action had to be taken. There have been misconceptions as to the scale of what is possible in this matter.  It is a mistake to talk about sums of money involved and the value of the ore.  A very large part of that value relates either to the actual cost of extracting the ore or to its subsequent processing, some at least of which would have to take place beyond the shores of this island.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>What we are concerned about is the value added in Ireland which would accrue in the absence of taxation or royalties to the enterpreneurs concerned.  The question is how much of that should be diverted for the benefit of the Irish people and by what method that should be done.  There have been suggestions from the Opposition that this should have been done solely by a process of charging royalties. I do not think the Opposition have thought out the implications of this suggestion.  Either such a process <Col N="555" /> would have been so geared as to bring in small sums of money or a certain sum of money which would have been a good deal smaller than the amount which will accrue by the methods proposed by this Government or, alternatively, if they mean that the sums of money which will accrue by taxation and royalties, could have been secured through royalties only, then an attempt to act in that way would have been very damaging. That would have involved a level of royalties which would have been out of proportion to royalties in similar cases elsewhere.  That would have been seen as a dishonest attempt to retrieve a blunder.  That would have brought to this country considerable discredit.  Given the mistake which was made, the only thing to do was to attack it frontally and honestly and not try to pretend that we were leaving the concession there while, in fact, imposing totally unreal royalties unrelated to the normal level of royalties elsewhere.  The course of action we have taken is absolutely right.</P>
    <P>We made it clear that we regard as unacceptable that the tax concession mistakenly given by the previous Government should be maintained. We have discussed with the companies concerned the implications of this action and have sought to arrive at a reasonable solution.  This solution will be designed to ensure that existing mines will continue to be worked and deposits of minerals will be explored and worked in the future.  It is very important that the action we take should not have an adverse effect.  If we had acted otherwise and been unreasonable in the implementation of our new legislation this could have led to a situation in which existing mining might have stopped in certain places where it is marginal or is not yielding profits or maybe incurring losses.  We must maintain a balance.</P>
    <P>The balance requires that the tax remission granted by the previous Government should be changed.  That should be done openly and honestly and not through a process of trickery as the Opposition seem to propose by <Col N="556" /> fiddling royalties to achieve this result. At the same time, in the implementation of this policy there should be a realistic and reasonable attitude to the Government which would meet the legitimate needs of those mines which are not completely economic or yielding significant profits, and ensure that they are kept open.  We must also ensure that the benefits from these mines which are, or would, be highly profitable, accure in a reasonable share to the Exchequer and through the Exchequer to the Irish people.  The balance of the package proposed is right.  The action was necessary in the interests of the Irish people and the type of action taken was adjusted to the needs of the situation.</P>
    <P>There was talk about this having an adverse effect on confidence.  It obviously has not.  There is no sign of a slackening of interest in our mining deposits, no indication that they are less willing than they were earlier last year to explore or to undertake expenditure of that kind here. Indeed if anything there is an indication of greater confidence at this time in the form of an evident interest in the establishment of a smelter here.  The establishment of such a smelter must be a primary aim of Government policy.  In our dealings with the mining companies that must be uppermost in our minds.  It is encouraging that there does appear to be an interest in this possibility at this time.  It certainly gives the lie to any suggestion that the action taken by the Government has affected confidence in the mining industry, in this Government and their method of handling these matters.</P>
    <P>Of course the mining situation is, of its nature, completely different from that in manufacturing industry.  No one in this country that I am aware of has ever challenged the wisdom of tax reliefs for manufacturing industry. They are necessary to attract industry, entrepreneuriship, know-how, and capital to this country which, because of its peripheral location, is less than ideal for many manufacturing purposes. They have been accepted as such by our people.  They have never <Col N="557" /> been challenged and indeed the question of the extent to which they could be safeguarded under EEC conditions was one of the main issues at the time of the negotiations.  It is quite clear that most people regarded the maintenance of these tax concessions as of vital importance.  They could not be less controversial.  There is no question of their being in any way in dispute because it is clear that they are totally in our interest.</P>
    <P>In the case of mining the position was different.  Given the existence of mining deposits here it is unnecessary to create artificial attractions to encourage people to come and exploit these minerals.  It seems clear that the scale of minerals here is sufficient now to have this power of attraction of its own account.  The tax relief for 20 years introduced by the previous Government was something which at the time it was given was regarded by the companies concerned as a bonanza which they did not expect to get and did not indeed think they deserved.  I recall myself being asked to meet, as an economist, and talk to one particular group.  They were concerned with the possibility of investing in mining here and they wanted to know something about the climate of opinion here.  The advice I gave them on the particular matter was that they should enter into an agreement of some kind with the Irish State or a State enterprise for joint operations as that would clearly identify them with the interests of this country and would ensure that their operation would be one that would be highly acceptable.  Nothing came of that but in the course of these discussions&mdash;this was at the end of the 1960s&mdash;they remarked that the 20 year relief was of course absurd, that the kind of relief which would have been appropriate would be five years, but that naturally companies like themselves would look for ten with a view to getting five.  They failed to understand how a Government could, off its own bat, accord a 20 year relief, given the situation of mining in this country.  The people concerned were the representatives of one of the major mining groups in the world.</P>
    <P>It is clear that this was an error, an error that had to be retrieved in the <Col N="558" /> interests of the Irish people.  It had to be retrieved honestly in a straightforward way and not by attempting to get around the problem.  The legitimate concern of people involved in marginal mining had to be met.  This is done by this Bill, while ensuring that an adequate return to the Irish people from these resources will not have the effect of closing down any existing activity.  I think the balance that has been achieved is correct and the evidence is there in the continuing interest in mining exploration in Ireland since the publication of this legislation&mdash;indeed the evidence of confidence in the future exists in the form of the growing interest in the possibility of a smelter being established here.</P>
    <P>I would regard the establishment of such a smelter as a primary aim of Government policy because of the significant addition to domestic added value it would yield directly and perhaps also in terms of a later use of some of the products.  Those who are concerned, and there are many in this country, that we should maximise the use of these minerals at home and ensure that they are processed as far as can possibly be done at home, are, I am sure, right.  It should be our aim to achieve that and, if possible, to move beyond the smelter to the establishment of industries based on these minerals.  How feasible that would be remains to be seen but it is something with which the Government must be concerned.</P>
    <P>These are points that seem to me to be crucial.  I am not in a position to enter into technicalities or details. It is not a particular area of speciality of mine.  I thought I should like to make these points at this stage in reinforcement of what has been said by the Minister and in order to clarify the issues which can at times be muddied in Parliament when it suits an opposition to confuse some of the issues.</P>
    <P>The Bill is one which can be heartily commended to the House.  The benefits accruing from it will stand to this country in the years ahead.  I am doubtful whether the Opposition <Col N="559" /> in criticising the Bill are doing either the country or themselves any good.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MylesStaunton" hpid="Mr. Staunton Mr. Staunton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Staunton</NameTxt>
      <P>I rise to support this Bill.  It seems to me we are reaching the stage where we can begin to be a little more sophisticated in our approach to development and in particular to the price which we must pay for development.  As a developing nation some years ago, when there were critical problems of severe unemployment and an undesirable structure of employment in the country with so many people engaged in primary employment, we had to pay an extremely high price for development especially development by interests outside this State.  This was the background to the extremely liberal approach which successive Governments adopted to foreign investment.  We are today reaching the stage when we should pose certain questions.  It would seem to me that it is not enough simply to have development occur.  It is somewhat more relevant at this stage of our development to ask what price we should pay for what development is occurring.  It is desirable in the national interest to review these matters quite frequently.</P>
      <P>If we put this legislation into context and if we try to compare the fiscal policies, the incentives, and the attitude to investment that exist in this country with that of other countries in the developed world, we find that in general the attitude here is extraordinarily liberal.  On the other extreme we have Japan, where there are great brakes on investment within that country by foreign interests, even to the extent that companies may not be set up unless they are joint ventures with specific Japanese participation in such industries.  Again we go to countries on the European mainland which are much less generous in welcoming development for the obvious reason of their greater level of development than here.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is relevant to point out, as the Minister and Deputy Fitzgerald have done, that mining is in an entirely different category to manufacturing industry if you are seeking development. Mining, as has been pointed <Col N="560" /> out by the Minister, is a wasting resource. We have only so much mineral wealth in this country and when that is exploited or developed that is the end of the story.  There is no continuity beyond that particular point. In the case of manufacturing industry it is an on-going thing.  To a degree it is an artificial type of development in that in many cases we are not developing a native, indigenous resource. We have for that reason been extremely generous in regard to complete relief from taxation on export sales of manufacturing companies.</P>
    <P>It is relevant to point out, as Deputy Fitzgerald has done, that where the nation is concerned there is a capital investment in manufacturing industry; and beyond the point when the tax relief years will have ended there will, hopefully, be an ongoing situation with continuing investment, employment and profits.  In view of the immense public pressures there have been and in view of the interesting statistics produced by the study group, it seems to me that the National Coalition Government were obliged, on taking office, to take a hard fresh look at policy.  The previous Government were in office for a great many years and probably found it difficult to take a fresh look at the situation which they had developed so far as legislation was concerned.</P>
    <P>My view is that the Government acted rightly.  They made a decision last autumn.  That particular decision was obviously socially desirable.  The only debate at that time was one where many interests, especially vested ones, tended to get hot about the collar, not so much about the social desirability of the legislation in so far as our people were concerned but rather about the economic desirability of the issue in so far as the development of the nation was concerned.</P>
    <P>It seems to me that the Government's decision was also economically sound in addition to being socially desirable.  It is interesting that at the time of the original announcement there was a reaction which in general came from mining interests and certain financial interests.  If the reality was as they stated it to be&mdash;that this was to <Col N="561" /> be the end of the development of mining resources in this country, that it was to be the end of profit and employment in the mining industry&mdash; then certain things logically should have followed.  There should have been a crash on the stockmarket.  Not only should shares have temporarily dropped, but permanently dropped; and there should have been a recession in the mining industry.  It seems to me, looking at what has happened in the eight months since the original announcement, that the Minister's idea has been vindicated totally from an economic point of view. Whilst there was a temporary drop in mining shares the reality is such that in broad terms there has not been any crisis.  The mining industry continues to be healthy; negotiations have been entered into with the mining companies by the Government and the results seem to have been satisfactory.</P>
    <P>When we look at the mining situation in other countries we see that in Canada, which is the parent base for many interests in this country in the mining field, there has been a move away from tax incentives to the mining industry.  The reality is that the mining interests outside this country are aware of the fact that the Government, pragmatically, had to introduce the type of legislation which has now been introduced and that this is a good thing.</P>
    <P>The reality of business, the reality of industry, is very simple.  Investment will continue to flow into this country into these areas where it seems there will be an adequate return on investment.  It seems that with the price of these metals and the activity around the world in mining, the scarcity of certain mining resources, the availability of these resources in this State simply means there is a good deal to be had and that there is an adequate return on investment. For this reason the pragmatic investors and entrepreneurs in the mining industry will continue to invest their funds and there is every reason to believe that this is increasing rather than declining in this country.</P>
    <P>I suggest we should take the Minister's speech at face value because a certain amount of research went <Col N="562" /> into it.  He suggests in the latter part of his speech that over the next 20 years it is estimated that the likely tax yield to the nation, because of the introduction of this particular policy, will be of the order of £125 million.  If development continues and the mining interests are pleased because they are getting an adequate return on investment, there will be primary employment in the industry within the country.  In addition it is proposed that there will be a yield of £125 million for the benefit of this nation and a resulting investment in the national interest.  It seems to me therefore that the case is unanswerable and that the Government are completely vindicated in doing what they have done.</P>
    <P>I should like to refer to the question of tax incentives, on manufacturing industry, to which Deputy Fitzgerald referred.  I believe this policy is excellent, that it was necessary for a great many years and that it is still necessary.  There is one distinction which should be looked at in that regard.  Whereas at the present time this incentive of complete relief on tax from exports is available to industry in this country, I believe we are reaching the stage where we should begin to take a look at this incentive so far as Dublin is concerned. The greater part of the manufacturing industry in this country is located in this city and we like to suggest that there are no special incentives in this area.  There should not be any change in the position so far as any manufacturing industry already under the umbrella is concerned; but after a certain date new industries developing in the Dublin area should not get this incentive, because it is leading to lobsided development in this country.  I want to endorse completely the Bill the Minister introduced and also what he said in regard to it.  I want to compliment him and his colleagues in the Cabinet.</P>

      <P>Having listened to the dyed in the wool true blue Toryism from the opposite side of the House in today's debate I feel that the blood <Col N="563" /> of Enoch Powell would appear as a very wishy-washy duckegg blue in terms of the royal blue of Fianna Fáil 1974 vintage.  How can any democratic party justify to the electorate that the workers' pay packet of £10 a week should be raided for income tax while other people can make probably tens of millions of pounds out of mining and pay no tax?  It seems to me unintelligible and certainly without any reasonable explanation, unless their motivation is an unworthy one.</P>
      <P>Deputy Colley called this short and simple Bill an involved and intricate piece of legislation.  There are merely 17 sections in it.  That reminds me that when Deputy Haughey introduced the 20 year tax exemption bonanza for the mining industry in 1967, he said he did it because he had received representations from the mining industry asking for certain allowances and set-offs in respect of exploration and development expenditure but that he considered that to give them would have meant producing an involved piece of legislation and that the simple thing to do was to totally exempt them.  That was the action of a lazy Minister; that was the action of a thoughtless Minister. The fact that he and his Fianna Fáil successor were not prepared to do the work necessary to draw up a simple piece of legislation to deal with the peculiar problems of mining is a fair indication of the lethargy which existed in the Department of Finance when Fianna Fáil held the roost.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>During the budget debate I received an exhortation from Deputy Haughey to follow the good example of the late Gerard Sweetman whom he commended, very properly, as one of the greatest Ministers for Finance we ever had.  One of the great virtues of Gerard Sweetman was that he was a thoughtful man.  If he thought hard he also worked hard and he never shirked work.  I remember him telling me of the surprise with which he heard Deputy Haughey say in 1967 that he was going to abolish taxation of mining profits.  He said he was so surprised that he nearly fell off the <Col N="564" /> chair.  He was a man who was interested in mining.  No person relieved of taxes is likely to complain about it and he did not complain, and nobody in the mining industry complained. There would be no justification for failure to take action when we resumed power and replaced lethargic and thoughtless Ministers with a Cabinet which was both thoughtful and ready to do whatever hard work was required.</P>
    <P>As we go about this campaign of tax reform we are certain to meet with complaints and obstacles from people who have not previously been taxed and will be asked to pay a share of tax in the future.  The fact that we have heard so little complaint from the mining industry is a good indication that we have treated them fairly.  We have treated them on lines which are operable in all comparable countries in the world.  If we had done as Deputy Colley and Fianna Fáil are suggesting, either that we do nothing affecting existing mines or even future mines&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>We never suggested that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am prepared to accept that.  Or if we had done as recommended by Deputy Colley, not touched the taxation holiday but made a fraud of the taxation holiday by providing instead penal royalties, then I believe untold damage would have been done to our reputation.  We would have shown the world that statutory provisions could be nullified by ministerial order; that tax exemptions could be destroyed by imposing royalties at rates far beyond what exist in any part of the world.  That would certainly have called into question our integrity; that would certainly have meant that nothing provided for in legislation of this country would be trusted.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Therefore we never for a moment considered such a solution to the problem. It was a problem and, in fairness to Fianna Fáil, within four years of giving the tax exemption in 1967 they realised their mistake, because in 1971 they set up an elaborate commission to study the matter to find out where they had gone wrong and how they could put the matter right.  Whatever else that commission examined or recomialit <Col N="565" /> mended, they never recommended that we should make fools of ourselves and fools of others by imposing a royalty or a rent on the mining industry to take away whatever benefit might have been conferred by statute.</P>
    <P>Of critical importance to this debate is to recall that there is no mine operating in this country as a consequence of the 1967 legislation.  All the mines which are operating here operated prior to the concession given in 1967, and most of them are operating as a consequence of the thoughtful and imaginative legislation introduced by the late Gerard Sweetman when he was Minister for Finance in 1956.  It is interesting that the concessions then given, which were less sophisticated than those we are introducing today, were the bait which attracted the mining interests from across the world into Ireland at a time before some of the very significant technological advances of recent years made Ireland more attractive than it ever had been.</P>
    <P>There have been allegations here and elsewhere that we have gone back on deals which we had made; but to have a deal there must be two parties and if there is an offer there must be acceptance.  The concessions offered in 1967 were not accepted by anybody so that there was no contractual obligation, no contractual relationship and nobody had acted on foot of the 1967 legislation in any way which would entitle them to say that having so acted they were entitled to have the concession which was offered in 1967 extended to them.  That is the short answer to Deputy Colley's criticism that benefits which we are offering to future exploration and development are not being as generously given to those who have operated under previous legislation.  The truth is they have not operated as a consequence of what was promised.  The fact that the success which the Irish mining industry now enjoys arises out of the 1956 legislation is proof that the 1967 concession was unnecessary, and that it was a prodigal incentive given by somebody who would not take the trouble of thinking or of drafting legislation which is available in many other countries as a precedent even if he was unable or unwilling to do the <Col N="566" /> work himself.  There were ample precedents available which could have been used to guide the form of legislation required in this country.</P>
    <P>I do not think there is any obligation on a Government at any time to respond to malicious and irresponsible charges made by Opposition spokesmen or any others.  Deputy Colley, a lawyer, I am sure in the course of his legal practice has given advice to people who have been libelled that it is better to ignore the libel rather than to endeavour to refute it because to endeavour to refute it is only to give double publicity to the original libel. That is why we have not taken up the malicious campaign of Fianna Fáil suggesting there was some leakage of information by members of the Government to a Canadian mining interest which led them to make bids for Tara mining shares.  There is of course absolutely no foundation for that allegation nor is there any foundation for any suspicions which even innocent people may now have in their minds because of the unfounded allegation which was made.</P>
    <P>If people make what they consider to be good commercial decisions, or if they make commercial decisions good or bad, they are entitled to make them without having slanders of this kind uttered by politicians endeavouring to seek advantage for themselves and cause embarrassment to others.  Following the Government's announcement last September of their proposal to introduce a reasonable package of tax allowances and incentives to replace the tax exemption, the 20-year holiday, there were movements on the stock market in the shares of Irish mining companies.  That was to be expected but, not for the first time, the market over-reacted.  When people thought a little more deeply and studied the Government's package they saw how reasonable it was and how well it compared with other countries and the market improved substantially.  Some people made courageous decisions while others were prepared to panic. That is a normal experience in the market and the fact that it has happened should not be interpreted by people as anything particularly sinister.</P>
    <P>I would have thought that any <Col N="567" /> prudent person, if he had the money, would have been only too happy to avail of some of the panic selling which occurred last autumn.  But these are matters upon which individual investors and other people have to make up their own minds and make their own calculations.  However, as the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Deputy Staunton and Deputy O'Brien said today, the fact that there is such tremendous interest in the Irish mining industry is proof of the reasonableness of the Government's measures and of the fact that any allegations of undue interference with mining interests were totally without foundation.</P>
    <P>Deputy Colley once again tried to underline what apparently is Fianna Fáil propaganda, even though it is without foundation, as any inquiry from the IDA would establish, that the announcement about taxation on mining profits caused certain potential foreign investors in manufacturing industries at least to postpone their investment in Ireland.  Of course, there is no foundation whatever to that.  Deputy Crowley went a little further, as is his wont, and actually named the company which he said had pulled out of Ireland as a consequence of the Government's announcement regarding mining profits.</P>
    <P>The truth is this.  The company to which Deputy Crowley referred and which he said was interested in establishing itself in his constituency in Cork made its announcement to pull out at least a month before the Government's announcement regarding mining profits.  This decision was based upon two factors which had nothing whatever to do with mining profits: the first was that they found unacceptable conditions which the Cork County Council attached to approval for planning permission&mdash; perhaps Deputy Crowley would know more about that&mdash;the other was that redundancy at their plant in Mexico led them to transfer the Cork project to that location.</P>
    <P>Far from there being any evidence <Col N="568" /> whatsoever to support the malicious Fianna Fáil campaign, which is typical of their destructive campaign whenever they are out of office, that there is any dimunition in industrial interest in Ireland, there was a record level of job approvals by the IDA in the year 1973-74, and the projects for the coming year are even greater. It is very important that these facts should be recited and recorded, because they will make apparent to people just how malicious Fianna Fáil are if the party are prepared to act in such an irresponsible way when they are in opposition.  When they have to act in the open, one can just imagine what they might do if the people were ever again, by any mistake, to let them back to power.</P>

      <P>Fianna Fáil have not been helpful to the national interest by allegations that doing the right thing by Ireland in relation to mines was an indication of the Government's intention to commit breaches in relation to the relief of export profits from income tax.

      <P>&mdash;&mdash;of what was done by Ministers for Finance on this side of the House, they would find a great wealth of thoughtfulness, wisdom and hard work which compares more than favourably with their long history of running away from problems because they feared the backlash. Deputy Colley's backlash was produced once again here today.  Now we know why he was such a failure as a Minister: he feared the backlash, real or imaginary; somehow it was very real to Fianna Fáil, because again and again they failed to do what they acknowledged was the right thing to do.  They never had the courage to do it of their own accord.  Even though they did it they always had to have years and years of advance study of the matter by committees and by commissions.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Colley had a number of specific comments to make on the Bill itself, and I should like to deal with those.  Deputy Colley asked, in relation to section 2, if there would be provision for an appeal against the inspector's opinion.  The section, as the Deputy is aware, deals with the application of the Income Tax Act, 1967, and section 245 of that Act provides for appeal.  Accordingly, the normal provisions will apply and this would include the right of appeal from the opinion of the inspector.</P>
      <P>Deputy Colley said he thought that section 6 discriminated in favour of future mines as against existing mines. It certainly is a section which contains an incentive to exploration in the future.  That is what we intend, and it is with the future we are dealing.  It would be wrong to overlook the fact that because of taxation exemption granted to existing mines in the past they already enjoyed a benefit which will not be available to mines in the future.  In fact, there is discrimination, if it can be called such, both ways.  We are making the situation equal as far as we can by this particular section.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not making a fractious point but I would ask the <Col N="571" /> Minister to consider whether the section does not appear to be retrospectively operating against the existing mines.  I am sure that is not the Minister's intention.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>The existing mines have enjoyed a great bonanza which future mines will not enjoy.  It could fairly be said that the exemption that they enjoyed included this one and many others.  I do not think this contains any element of retrospective disadvantage. I will certainly have a look at the section in case it does.</P>
      <P>Deputy Colley also referred to section 7 and wanted to know whether the right to claim unallowed plant and machinery as a deduction in charging the profits for the year 1974-75, would be at the election of the person or mining company.  It would be at the election of the person concerned.  We will table an amendment.  In fact, I had already an amendment in mind to spell out that by putting in the words &ldquo;at the election of the person&rdquo; after the word &ldquo;may&rdquo; on the eighth line of that page.</P>
      <P>What I said on section 6 would also apply in respect of section 8. Existing mines have got benefits that will not be available in the future.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I will, certainly.  On section 10, I am glad to hear the Deputy's high opinion of the Revenue Commissioners.  It is an opinion which all Ministers for Finance, past or present, have but it is not necessarily an opinion which is widely held.  There might be people who would prefer the power to be exercised by the Minister rather than by the Revenue Commissioners.</P>

Quite wrongly, people frequently visit their anger on the Revenue Commissioners when, in fact, the Legislature <Col N="572" /> are responsible for what the Revenue Commissioners do.</P>
      <P>The question of whether a mine is a marginal mine is one which would fall for determination in the first instance by the Minister for Industry and Commerce.  That is the position in regard to the concession which is being given to the coal-mining industry. It is a mixture of accountancy, good commercial judgment and knowing the market, the price for the product, the likely movement of prices in the following year and so on.  In fairness to the Revenue Commissioners it would be wrong to ask them to make a judgment of that kind.  They have not got that particular knowledge or skill immediately available to them.  If this was to be conferred on them by statute, they would have to consult with the Department of Industry and Commerce before coming to a decision.  It is tidier to say that the Minister for Industry and Commerce should make a judgment and that the Minister for Finance should issue the exemption having already consulted with the Minister for Industry and Commerce.</P>

It would really involve making an appeal to some body about the commercial judgment of the Minister for Industry and Commerce.  I would say that it would be difficult, but I will have a look at it.  I would not wish that there should be any undue restriction.  We have in mind to ensure that no mine closes down because of the burden of taxation.  If an appeal seems to be desirable, we would certainly be prepared to entertain it.</P>

      <P>Deputy Colley suggested that guidelines should be set out somewhere.  In the course of our discussions with the mining interests this matter was raised but the consensus appeared to be that it was better to leave it open rather than set out guidelines.  As has happened so often in the past, guidelines in legislation can frequently become constraints in the future.  There might be factors in the future which we would not think of in legislation now. Even the use of a phrase such as &ldquo;without prejudice to the generality of powers&rdquo; would probably not be adequate.  The matter is open for any mining interest to make their own case.  The Minister for Industry and Commerce and the Minister for Finance can make an assessment accordingly.</P>

      <P>When speaking last night, I referred to the capital budget as opposed to the current budget, the capital budget being at least as important but not one which gets any great attention as a rule.  It contains considerable economic significance within itself.  The most significant fact in relation to the budget estimate for 1973-74 was that the balance of the capital budget would be financed by what are described as residual borrowings of £37.7 million, but the provisional out-turn for 1973-74 so far as residual borrowings were concerned came to £99.8 million, which was approaching three times as much as had been estimated.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is no particular area in which any Government can borrow that is more dangerous or damaging to the national economy in the long run than this residual borrowing which for the most part is either foreign borrowing or is brought about by the inflationary use of moneys which were designed to be held by the Central Bank or by Departmental funds.  We have the rather frightening situation that as well as borrowing £44 million odd abroad&mdash;all of which has to be repaid over various periods and for the most part out of current taxation &mdash;we have the situation whereby the Central Bank contributed £20 million towards the capital budget in an effort to balance it for the purchase of Government stocks.  We are not sure, because we are not told, where this £20 million came from but it is a fair guess, as has been suggested by Deputy Colley&mdash;and he has not been contradicted by anybody&mdash;that that money came from deposits held by the Central Bank from the commercial banks, deposits that were taken out of circulation deliberately by the Central Bank in an effort to deflate certain aspects of the economy here which they considered, and rightly so, needed deflating.  Therefore, to use £20 million of that money for something that is inflationary is, I suggest, doubly inflationary <Col N="575" /> because it was taken out originally to prevent inflation and is being used in the opposite way to what was the original intention of the Central Bank.</P>
    <P>In addition to that, we have something that has never happened before on anything like the scale we are now witnessing.  I refer to a balance of £35.6 million to make up the residual borrowing which was got by what to some people is little more than a bookkeeping exercise but, nonetheless, one which is both inflationary and dangerous for other reasons, that was, the reduction in liquidity of departmental funds to the extent of £35.6 million.  These funds which, among other things, go towards social welfare, are normally well in credit.  It is necessary that this is the situation so that beneficiaries and potential beneficiaries can benefit from the funds.  They are funds that usually are invested from a fairly longterm point of view.  We find that these funds have been used to pay for the capital budget at a time when it was totally inappropriate to use them in that fashion.  The proof that this was inappropriate is contained in page 7 of the publication, <i>Capital Budget</i> 1974.  I quote from paragraph 13:</P>
    <P>The amount provided by the Exchequer from its normal resources was £149.6 million, some £40 million less than expected...  Receipts from sales of securities to the non-bank public, at £35 million, were below expectations, largely because the unsettled state of capital markets prompted many potential investors to remain liquid.  Receipts from small savings were also below the budget estimate even though improvements were made in the terms of Savings Certificates, Investment Bonds, National Instalment-Saving Scheme and the interest paid by the Savings Banks.</P>
    <P>That paragraph is very significant because it tells us that one of the reasons for the fall in receipts by the Exchequer through its normal resources for financing the capital budget was the fact that the unsettled <Col N="576" /> state of capital markets prompted many potential investors to remain liquid.  At the same time £35.6 million was taken out of the balances in departmental funds.  Table 1 in this capital budget summary contains many interesting figures.  One of these is that in the normal Exchequer resources the estimate of sales of securities to the public for 1973-74 was £55 million whereas the actual receipts were £35 million.</P>
    <P>We are living in a time of rampant inflation and one might say that, as a matter of course, any estimate made on a particular date nowadays will, as a general rule, be considerably higher 12 months later because by then money will have inflated at the rate of 10, 11 or 12 per cent.  The rate of inflation during the 12 months between the preparation of the budget estimates for 1973-74 and the end of that financial year was 10½ per cent but, notwithstanding that fierce inflation, the total amount obtained from the public by way of sales of securities was £20 million less than estimated.  The banks, also, took in £10 million less than was estimated and small savings, which form an important part of the Exchequer's normal resources for the capital budget, dropped disastrously by £10 million to £18 million despite, as the publication points out, improvements in the terms of saving certificates, investment bonds, the national instalment-saving scheme and interest paid by the savings banks, including the Post Office savings bank.  Therefore, during the past 12 months we have had an extraordinary situation whereby, although inflation was higher than ever before in the history of this State, less money was available to the normal resources and more money had to be borrowed from abroad at increasingly higher interest rates.  When this money is being paid abroad to those from whom it was borrowed, it is paid free of tax and the interest paid abroad is in many ways at least one-third higher than it appears to be by virtue of the fact that the tax is not being recovered on it as would be the case if it were being repaid to residents of this country.</P>
    <P>The capital budget is very significant <Col N="577" /> as an indication of the general economic well-being or otherwise of the country in any given year.  The figures published in this summary and the reason given for the decrease in the figures indicate clearly that a serious situation exists.  If we must resort continually to foreign borrowing on a scale comparable with last year's, the national debt will increase at a colossal rate and we will be faced with a situation in which the cost of servicing that loan means that tens of millions of pounds more each year must be obtained from the ordinary taxpayer.</P>
    <P>When discussing matters arising from the capital budget it is no harm to refer to the unemployment figures which were issued within the past two or three days.  These figures related to the second week in April of this year and they show, rather significantly, an increase of 600 unemployed on the previous week's figure and indicate that the total number of unemployed was 261 fewer than for the corresponding week last year.</P>
    <P>This is in spite of the fact that a lot of people who would have been classified as unemployed last year are no longer so classified because they are in receipt of old age or retirement pensions to which they would not have been entitled at the same age last year.  Therefore, the figures are not strictly comparable because several thousand people would have come off the unemployment register in any event.  Notwithstanding the fact that they did, we discover that the number returned as unemployed is only 261 less than last year.  I suggest, therefore, that on the basis of a true comparison the number of unemployed has actually risen in the last 12 months.  If you combine that situatiton with the fact that we are in an inflationary period and that our domestic Exchequer resources for capital formation are in serious difficulties, it seems very doubtful, unfortunately, that the underlying basis of our economy at the moment from this point of view is a sound one.</P>
    <P>The matter which dominates all economic problems and thinking here is, of course, inflation.  This above all <Col N="578" /> else affects everybody whether he is poor or rich.  Of course, it affects the poor to a greater extent than it does the well-off.  It is the greatest single problem which needs to be tackled and overcome.  The manner in which the economy has been run in the past 12 months leads us to believe that this Government have a vested interest in the continuation of inflation.  I should like to give an example.  At column 30, Volume 272, of the Official Report, Deputy Brennan asked the Minister for Finance the estimated increase in revenue in the current financial year from the latest price increases in (a) beer and spirits and (b) petrol and fuel products generally.  The Minister replied:</P>
    <P>The estimated increases in revenue in respect of the items mentioned in the Deputy's question are £400,000 and £450,000, respectively, for the current financial period April to December, 1974. These figures do not take into account the possibility of a consequential diversion of expenditure from other consumer items, which if it took place would tend to keep the overall yield from VAT at the figure forecast for budgetary purposes.</P>
    <P>These increases were not increases in excise duty but simply price increases. As a result of the increases of 1p on the pint, 1p on spirits and ½p on petrol, the Exchequer got, according to the Minister for Finance last week, £850,000 extra, practically £1 million.</P>
    <P>The March report of the Prices Commission came out ten days ago. It contained 121 price increases over a huge variety of products and items. Generally speaking, the increases were considerably greater, in percentages and money terms, than those I have mentioned.  I should like to know, and I have put down a Parliamentary Question to this effect, what will be the increase to the Exchequer from VAT as a result of the 121 price increases.  That covers only one month.  Each month for the last year has not been substantially different from last month.  My point is that <Col N="579" /> every time there is an increase in price, the Exchequer benefits enormously. More and more tax is collected. That in itself helps to put up prices and retain the inflationary situation which is liable to strangle us all if a stop is not put to it soon. More and more money is pouring into the Exchequer as a result of these constant price increases, not just every month as they used to, but almost every week now.  We have a situation in which the Government would not be able to continue in power if these tremendous price increases, which are the consequences of inflation, were not constantly taking place.</P>
    <P>That is why I feel I am justified in saying that this Government have a vested interest in inflation.  Inflation enables the Government to get along from month to month and from the beginning of the financial year to the end, limping along and keeping their heads above water, because these vast extra sums are coming into the Exchequer which would not be coming in if prices did not rise.</P>
    <P>I look forward with interest to discovering next week, if I can, what the additional revenue to the Exchequer from VAT will be on the 121 items which were increased in price this month.  This is an appropriate time to discover whether there are any items of any description which have not increased in price since February, 1973.  That question was asked six months ago.  At that time there were about ten items which had not increased in price, some of them a little unusual and not used very frequently. They included exotic things such as neck mutton.  I could never discover, unfortunately, just how many commodities there are on the consumer price index.  Presumably it could run into several thousand commodities if some of the single items we speak about are regarded as separate items for that purpose.  It is very interesting to compare the grandiose promises which were made in February, 1973, with the situation which exists at present. <Col N="580" /> I want to refer now to some of the Minister for Finance's proposals which he mentioned in his budget statement, particularly in relation to taxation on farmers.  As we are aware it is proposed at first&mdash;I emphasise the words &ldquo;at first&rdquo; because these were the words used by the Minister in his speech&mdash;to impose income taxation on farmers with a valuation of&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelPatMurphy" hpid="Mr. M.P. Murphy Mr. M.P. Murphy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M.P. Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>They are also the words used by Deputy Lynch.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;£100 or more. One thing which is more important than that and likely to have long term social and economic significance, is the Minister's proposal, which has got little or no publicity up to now, to disallow half of the personal allowances of a taxpayer in respect of his non-farming income if he owns a small farm and would not, of course, be liable for income tax on that farm.</P>
      <P>The budget does not spell out how large or how small a holding has to be. We can only presume that it applies to the average man in the situation envisaged by the Minister in his speech, a small farmer whose farm is too small to enable him to support himself and his family without taking up outside employment.  It is no harm to point out that there are a great many such farmers in this country.  One estimate I have been given is that there are at least 60,000 farmers in that situation, that their farms are too small to be economically viable from the point of view of supporting themselves, their wives and children and they have to go out to work in a factory or some other place.  They have always, and this was only fair, been allowed their full allowances against their non-farming income.  In other words, they were in exactly the same position as a person who had no small farm or piece of land at all.  Therefore, they paid the same income tax as the man who did not have any land and they were treated in exactly the same way as he was.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It was stated in the budget, although those people were not informed of this fact to any great extent by the propaganda service of the Government <Col N="581" /> which put across the good parts of the budget very eloquently indeed, that they are facing a situation in which half of their allowances for income tax will be disallowed on their non-farming income.  If a man is at the moment paying £3 in income tax on a weekly wage of £30 he, if he owns some land, will lose half his allowances and will pay approximately £6 per week in income tax for this current year on the same salary but the man working beside him in the factory or shop who does not have any land has, of course, his full allowances allowed to him against his employment and will pay the same or slightly less tax in most cases than he did last year.</P>
    <P>I do not think this situation is realised yet by the 60,000 or more small farmers who are forced by economic circumstances to seek employment outside their farms.  I think there was general agreement in this House and outside it with proposals some years ago of the then Minister for Lands, Deputy Seán Flanagan, regarding the desirability of encouraging part-time employment for farmers to enable and to encourage them to stay on the land.  Great efforts have been made over the past ten years to encourage industry in places like the west, south west and north west of Ireland in particular, where there are a great many farmers of this kind, to provide off farm employment for them.  If they are now to be treated as is apparent from the budget speech, in a way which is totally unfair to them, if they are going to pay approximately twice as much income tax as the man who has no land, I cannot see many of them wishing to remain in their off farm employment.  I can see many of those jobs being given up because of the crippling blow which this double income tax will be on them.</P>
    <P>The tragedy of it all is that when those jobs have to be given up those men cannot just go back to the farms because the farms are unable to support them.  The reason why they took up this off farm employment in the first instance was that the farms could not support them.  Therefore, it is out of the question to go back <Col N="582" /> there and expect to support oneself and ones family out of a farm one already had to leave.  The only alternative is to go elsewhere and, unfortunately, elsewhere, in the context of the west of Ireland, means Britain. We may well be back if this proposal goes through to a situation that we felt we had seen the end of in the last few years.  We had net immigration into this country in the last few years instead of net emigration, a thing I am sure many of us thought we would never see.  A trend which had started as far back as the 1840s stopped and, in fact, was reversed in the years 1971 and 1972.  There were more people coming back into the country than were leaving it.</P>
    <P>There is a provision also, of course, that where a farmer's wife is employed in non-farming employment she would get only half the allowance. I must say I concur with that proposal. I think it is only fair that that should be so in relation to a wife because there was a considerable inequity in the situation that existed up to now where in many cases farmers wives who were quite well paid as teachers or as nurses or anything else, often perhaps with salaries of up to £2,000 a year or so, were free or almost free of income tax when other women, whose husbands were not farmers, were taxed very heavily, indeed, because all the family allowances, as between the two of them were usually used up on the husband's income.  I have no objection whatever to halving the allowance in respect of the farmer's wife in these circumstances but I have the most serious objection to the halving of the allowance of a small farmer because it is going to drive these men out of the employment they got, not just back to the farm because there is no future there without off farm employment, but into the emigrant ship.</P>
    <P>However, it would not at all surprise me if this proposal in relation to the income taxation of farmers did not go through because we had a not dissimilar situation in last year's budget where the Minister for Finance blithely announced that he proposed to abolish the £70 interest that was <Col N="583" /> allowed free of tax on deposits with the commercial banks and the savings in post office banks.  A number of us, including myself, pointed out that this was lunacy, that it had already resulted in the movement of a certain amount of capital out of this country since the announcement was made.  When the Minister replied to us he pooh-poohed the whole thing and told us we were wrong and stupid and ignorant but a couple of weeks later when the Finance Bill appeared there was no provision in it removing the £70 exemption because good sense had at long last prevailed with the Minister for Finance and he had accepted what was told to him from this side of the House not when we were telling him but when other people told him, presumably officials of his own Department and persons connected with the banks, who confirmed to him that what we were saying about an outflow of capital was correct.  Lo and behold, without any apology this provision did not appear in the Finance Bill.</P>
    <P>I am making the forecast now that, because of certain things that appear to me to have been said by the Minister for Finance in his budget speech this year off the top of his head without considering the consequences of them, some of those provisions will not appear in the Finance Bill either. I certainly hope for the good of this country, and particularly for the good of the less well-off people in the poorer areas with small quantities of bad land, that this infamous proposal to have the personal income tax allowance of a small farmer in respect of his non-farming income taken into account will not appear in the Finance Bill this year.</P>

      <P>I did not mark the part of the budget speech which contained the statement I am talking <Col N="584" /> about because I did not anticipate it would be challenged that such things were said.  I will get it for the Parliamentary Secretary if he bears with me and I will read out the precise words of the Minister for Finance from his budget speech.  I am quoting from Volume 271, column 1454, of the Official Report.  I will read out the entire paragraph so that there will be no question of my misquoting the Minister.  He stated:</P>
      <P>Finally, I should refer to one of the incidental&mdash;and unjustifiable effects of the exemption of farmer's profits which has attracted adverse criticism from many quarters.  It arises from the fact that, because farming profits are exempt, a married farmer, for example, may set the full personal allowances appropriate to a non-farming married couple, both of whom are at work, against any income his wife earns. Thus, not only is the farmer himself free of income tax but in such situations his wife may pay little if any tax on her earnings.  The same issue arises where the farmer, whether married or single, has non-farming income of his own.  To deal with such cases, it is proposed that, in the case of farmers not now being brought within the scope of income taxation, only one-half of the appropriate personal allowances will be set off against non-farming income, whether of the farmer or of his wife.  This restriction will apply as from 6th April, 1974.</P>

The Parliamentary Secretary has walked into it good and proper.  There is no bottom limit on the farmers to whom this applies.  It can apply to a man with a valuation as low as £1 or a man with a valuation as high as £99.

      <P>The changes of mind on the part of the Minister for Finance almost amount to a saga in themselves.  I recall last year on the Finance Bill that Deputy Tunney and I pointed out what we regarded as the gross inequity of what was described then as the &ldquo;claw-back&rdquo;.  We heard about that in 1973 but we are not hearing anything about it this year. The claw-back was a kind of disguised inequity of increasing the income tax of certain people so far as children's allowances were concerned or, to put it the other way, of on paper giving them increases in children's allowances but taking the whole lot back by increasing their income tax.  I do not know who thought of the name &ldquo;claw-back&rdquo; first but it had a lot of notoriety last year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Tunney and myself, among others, remonstrated with the Minister for Finance about the inequity of it, the fact that it was done in a concealed and surreptitious fashion and that it could possibly be as long as six months or more before a lot of people who were affected by it realised the way they were being treated. The Minister was quite scathing in his reply to Deputy Tunney and myself. He told us that the claw-back was entirely justifiable, that he was <Col N="587" /> not going to change it in spite of the suggestions made by us and that he was never going to change it.  Deputy Tunney quoted what he said in volume 272, column 223.  The Minister last year said:</P>
    <P>Does he not know that the whole science of competent, progressive Government is to transfer the burden from those who canot afford to bear it to those who can?  That is what we have done and we make no apology for it.  We will do it again next year and we will get the support of the people.</P>
    <P>What did he do this year?  Very quietly and I would say almost surreptitiously, without ever referring to the words that were so beloved by him last year, he did away with the claw-back. He said he was saving £2 million last year by having the claw-back, that it was taken from the rich to give to the poor, that it was inequitable to a large variety of people and the number of children a man had was not taken into account at all. There was a saving of £2 million which could be given out as a result and anyone who suggested there was anything wrong with the clawback was only interested in the rich and all the rest of it.</P>
    <P>This year in the budget the claw-back is gone and we have an increase of 30p per month, or 7p per week, in children's allowances given to everybody. All the elaborate paraphernalia introduced in the claw-back last year on different income tax allowances for different children, depending on the income of the father, is all gone and there is a flash allowance this year of £200 and everyone gets the £200 for every qualified child irrespective of income and irrespective of the age of the child.</P>
    <P>The net result of this had been, and this has not been commented on at all, that while the less well off, those under £2,500 per annum, get this wonderful increase of 7 pence per week&mdash;one of our Deputies described it yesterday as just about enough nowadays to buy a bag of crisps and <Col N="588" /> an ice pop&mdash;those over £2,500 per annum have this year got an increase of £1.80p per month because they get last year's £1.50p, which they did not get last year because of the claw-back, which has now gone and they get the 30p as well.  They are doing very well.  I do not grudge it to them. I do not say it is a wrong thing to do. All I do is comment very wryly indeed, on the fact that the Minister for Finance saw fit to jeer and sneer at Deputy Tunney and others on this side of the House when they suggested the arrangement was inequitable. They were told it was not inequitable and the Government would do it again this year and continue to do it.  It is interesting to note now what they have, in fact, done.</P>
    <P>This is another one of the changes of mind the Minister for Finance has had.  He has these when he calms down now and again, when he has one of his more lucid intervals which, fortunately, he does have from time to time.  It will be interesting to see whether the provision which Deputy Murphy, the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries, did not seem to know about until I told him about it this evening&mdash;something he will no doubt get on his bicycle about and endeavour to keep out of the Finance Bill&mdash;will appear in the Finance Bill because, as the Parliamentary Secretary now seems to think, I do not think it will appear.</P>
    <P>On the question of income tax generally, and the way in which it has been dealt with this year, a great many people have been misled by a comparison of the personal allowances as they were and the personal allowances now proposed in this budget.  The figures quoted were correct.  There was this considerable increase in personal allowances but what was never got across to the public was the fact that earned income relief, one of the most valuable reliefs for the ordinary working man, has, in fact, been abolished. The public were not told that at all. The net result is that, when you take into account the fact that this has been abolished, the saving in income <Col N="589" /> tax for the average man is very slight indeed.  It is as little as £30 in the year for the average wage earner, about 60p per week or thereabouts.</P>
    <P>A number of things come to light as one examines the budget, things one could not clearly see because of their being hidden in the budget. There are some interesting facts.  As a result of the abolition of earned income relief and the proposal for a lower first rate of income tax, and the abolition of the standard rate as such, and the lowering of the first rate for the first £1,550 of taxable income from 35p in the £ to 26 point something pence in the £, you have the situation that those who are getting relief at the moment on things like life assurance premiums, mortgage interest repayments, voluntary health insurance premiums and bank interest generally will now be faced with a situation in which, having saved 35p in the £ in taxation last year, they will save only 26 point something pence in the £ this year if they are within that particular income bracket; in other words, to that extent they are worse off.</P>
    <P>They are the people paying the lowest rate of tax but, as a result of the abolition of surtax and the introduction of one single system, which is something I agree with in principle, those who are at the highest level of taxation, which in this budget is 80 pence in the £, will find themselves in the situation in which on things like life insurance premiums they will get relief from the Revenue to the extent of 80 pence in every £ they spend.  The obvious thing for them to do is to borrow as much as they can up to the new limit of £2,000 interest, take out as much life insurance as they can up to the limit of one-sixth of their income, owe as much on their houses as they can and have as high health insurance as they can because they will get value for these.  In effect, they will only pay 20 pence in the £ even though they are actually shelling out 100 pence in each £ because the other 80 pence would go to the Revenue Commissioners anyway and it is just as well to get value for it and let them have some return.  More <Col N="590" /> power to them if they do this and this is what they will do.</P>
    <P>What I object to is the giving of this rate incentive to those at the top level of incomes, those paying at the highest rates on the highest incomes. The contrary is the case with those paying at the lowest rate because, instead of saving at the standard rate of 35 per cent, as they did last year, they are now getting relief at the new low rate of 26 point something per cent, which is the rate applicable to the first £1,550 of taxable income.</P>
    <P>Were these consequences, I wonder, foreseen by the Minister when he introduced his budget?  Now that they have been seen, are we going to see anomalies and inequities of this kind introduced in the Finance Bill?  I sincerely hope we will not.  I think we will have a repeat of last year.  Lots of things in the budget will not appear in the Finance Bill; it will not be just the one or two things that we had last year.</P>
    <P>Another consequence of the abolition of earned income relief is that the man who lives on investments becomes better off <i>vis-à-vis</i> the man who works for his living.</P>

      <P>In the last 12 months very few of those who live on investments have all their investments, or even a high proportion of them, in anything like national loans. So far as the national loan is concerned, since the Parliamentary Secretary brought it up, it is no harm to give the House a few figures in regard to the 1973 National Loan.  This was the loan originally advertised as an 11 per cent loan at 94.  It opened for subscription on a Monday morning. On Tuesday morning there were frantic telephone calls to the Department of Finance to say nothing had come in on Monday.  As a result of <Col N="591" /> frantic consultations and decisions in the Department on the Tuesday, it was announced that as and from Wednesday the 11 per cent loan would be on issue at £92 instead of £94.  It went on sale at £92 and they got from the public, notwithstanding the extraordinarily attractive terms, less than half the amount obtained in the national loan in the previous year.</P>
      <P>Those unfortunate people who were foolish enough to buy the 11 per cent national loan at £92 last autumn&mdash; only nine months ago&mdash;now find that the loan for which they paid £92 is today being dealt in on the Dublin Stock Exchange at £76.</P>

      <P>The Parliamentary Secretary should not interrupt.  It was better when he was reading his book. There has been a loss of £16 on £92 in less than nine months.  According to my calculations, that would be about a 17 per cent capital loss in less than nine months.  That is the achievement of the National Coalition Government in trying to raise money from the people.  Those who were unfortunate enough to lose 17 per cent of their capital because they invested in the last national loan might well be given a chance in the budget&mdash;they deserved a break.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One of the other interesting aspects of the budgetary and taxation policy of the Government is the fact that not alone does the Minister for Finance frequently change his mind but he never seems to be of the same mind as other members of the Cabinet and of his own party.  There have been numerous examples of this in recent weeks.  In this connection I shall quote a short item in today's <i>Irish Independent.</i> It was in a corner on an inside <Col N="592" /> page and readers of the paper might well have missed it.  If so, they would have missed a gem.  Under the heading &ldquo;Capital Taxation&rdquo; there was the following item:</P>
    <P>The Government's White Paper on capital taxation was considered at a special meeting of the Cork Branch of the I.F.A.  A number of Dáil Deputies were in attendance and one Fine Gael T.D. was quoted as saying that he saw no place for himself in the party if the legislation concerning wealth tax went through. He described it as doctrinaire socialism and he might have no option but to vote against it in the final analysis.</P>

      <P>That is one of the first reports of the private or semiprivate meetings that have been going on throughout the country in the last month.  My information is that similar sentiments were expressed by other Deputies of the same party at meetings in various parts of the country. To the best of my knowledge they were not reported in the papers and I cannot quote them.  However, I have no reason to believe that what I heard about the other meetings is less inaccurate than what happened in relation <Col N="593" /> to the meeting of the Cork branch of the IFA.  Happily, or unhappily as the case may be for the Parliamentary Secretary, my information is that the Deputy who made that statement was not his distinguished colleague in south-west Cork, Deputy O'Sullivan.  I do not know if the Parliamentary Secretary would prefer if it was Deputy O'Sullivan but that appears to be the situation.</P>
      <P>While that is very interesting and topical, we have a statement from an even more distinguished member of Fine Gael than the Fine Gael TD who made the comment I referred to.  I am speaking about the Minister for Defence, the man who personally directs the security of the country and is on hand at all times to see that things are as they should be.  He made a speech on this motion and there are a few short quotations to which I should like to refer as I wish to comment on them generally.  What the Minister for Defence said was not a slip of the tongue in the course of a long speech.  The sentiment was repeated approximately seven times throughout the speech.  At column 195 of the Official Report dated 25th April he said:</P>
      <P>The Minister for Finance has indicated the position.  His speech was considered by the Government and it is the policy of the Government. I shall not take interruptions from people who do not seem to know very much about economics.</P>
      <P>Later in the same column the Minister stated:</P>
      <P>The Deputies opposite, in a mischievous way, are trying to mislead the people about a fair and open proposal from the Civil Service regarding a substitute for death duties.</P>
      <P>At column 197 he stated:</P>
      <P>Any proposals in the White Paper are wide open for change.</P>
      <P>Later in the column he said:</P>
      <P>I am not defending one line of the White Paper.  It is not mine, neither is it the Cabinet's.</P>
      <P>At this point he waved but that does not appear in the Official Report.  He continued:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="594" /> The proposals in the White Paper were produced by civil servants to replace death duties.  There are more ways of killing the cat than by choking it with butter.  There are enough brains in the Cabinet to find the right way to handle the matter.  Fianna Fáil and Deputy Haughey in particular, in a despicable political act, want to pin the White Paper on us but it is not ours.  If Fianna Fáil wish, they can make representations and they will be seriously considered after 30th June.  If a 100-page representation comes in after 30th June that will be carefully considered before anything is done with regard to the White Paper.  In the meantime, if representations prove there is a glaring omission or mistake in the White Paper, it is open to the Government to decide tomorrow to change it.  It is political trickery for anyone to try to pin the White Paper on the Government and it will not be tolerated.</P>
    <P>At column 198 the Minister for Defence said:</P>
    <P>If they hear anyone in a pub saying the White Paper is ours, let them check if he is in a Fianna Fáil cumann before they make their decision.</P>
    <P>When he was concluding he said at column 199:</P>
    <P>Let nobody think that matters that are not of the Government's making can be pinned on the Government.</P>
    <P>We have a situation that a White Paper issued by the Government is disowned by a member of the Government in the most public place in the country, in this House, someone we are told by the papers from time to time who is a senior and respected member of the Cabinet, a confidante, we do believe, of the Taoiseach, who advises him apparently on what he might or might not do in certain situations.</P>

      <P>Some weeks ago the Government's resolve began to weaken in relation to the White Paper when they got what is called the feedback which was 100 per cent hostile, from every section of the community.  The first sign we saw of the white flag very tentatively <Col N="597" /> beginning to go up was when the Parliamentary Secretary to the Taoiseach made a speech one night saying that these were proposals in general terms and that, of course, the details of them could be looked at again, or thought about again, and the Government were not totally committed to them all.</P>
      <P>As I recall it, he made that speech on a Friday night.  He was followed on the following night, the Saturday night, by the Minister for Labour who dealt with exactly the same question but took a totally and radically different view from that of the Parliamentary Secretary.  He told his listeners at some Labour Party meeting in Dublin that night that this was a White Paper and, because it was a White Paper, the Government were totally committed to the principles in it, and that the principles in it would not and could not be changed because it was a Government decision to adopt the White Paper and that, while some minor details could be changed in the legislation as it was going through the House without infringing the principles and that might well be done, no principle involved in that White Paper could or would be changed.</P>
      <P>That was in direct contradiction to what the Parliamentary Secretary had said the night before.  The reason the Minister for Labour felt compelled to come out so quickly to make this speech was that he was afraid of his life that Fine Gael, who realised they had made a grievous error, would try to backtrack out of it and he wanted to block them.  He made what was in my view a factual and correct statement of the situation in relation to the publication of the White Paper by the Government.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A White Paper is not a discussion document.  It is not for discussion so far as the principles in it are concerned. They are Government policy and the Government in publishing it commit themselves finally and irrevocably to those principles.  They may not commit themselves to all the details but they irrevocably commit themselves to the principles.  If they wanted to issue a discussion document, <Col N="598" /> where there was no commitment on their part or anyone else's part to what was contained in the document but they simply wanted to give an indication of their thinking without committing themselves to enacting those principles afterwards, they could have issued what is called a Green Paper.  We were supposed to get one on education some months ago but it has not come yet.</P>
    <Speaker pid="CiaranMurphy" hpid="Mr. C. Murphy Mr. C. Murphy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. C. Murphy</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>In any event, there is a recognised traditional parliamentary procedure for getting the views of people on a discussion document and that is to issue a Green Paper and make it perfectly clear that it is only a discussion document and that there is no commitment to the principles enunciated in it.  The Government could have done that but they chose not to.  They chose to bring out a White Paper in which they committed themselves irrevocably to the principles enunciated.  The Minister for Labour was perfectly correct in the speech he made stating these matters.  Notwithstanding the fact that he was perfectly correct, all the rumours have it now that there will be a radical change in the principles enunciated in the White Paper and that, whatever about capital gains tax and whatever about gift and inheriance tax, we will not see wealth tax.</P>
      <P>I will be very happy not to see wealth tax because wealth tax has been recognised by us in this party, and recognised by pretty well everyone throughout the country who has not got a kind of doctrinaire socialist attitude to economic matters, as totally unsuited&mdash;certainly in the form in which it is proposed in this White Paper&mdash;to the situation which exists in this country, a country that is still developing, that is undercapitalised and that is in dire need of as much investment as it can get in order to create productivity and employment.</P>

Practically every organisation of any description which met over the past month or so and considered the terms of this White Paper has unanimously condemned it as being potentially a disaster.</P>
      <P>This is one of the tragedies of the whole situation.  The damage will not be simply done if and when the proposals in the White Paper on wealth tax are ever enacted.  A great deal of damage has already been done.  The very fact that this is proposed by the Government in a White Paper has caused an amount of panic.  Whether the people on the Government side like it or not, the fact of the matter is that there has been a substantial outflow of capital in the past six weeks which this country cannot afford.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I listened for the best part of two hours last night to Deputy Belton who devoted the greater part of his speech to the White Paper on capital taxation.  He did not find great fault with the capital gains tax or with the inheritance and gift taxes; he had some minor reservations about some of them, but he spent a very long time spelling out in some detail his reservations and doubts about the wealth tax.  He told the House from his experience of business, which is apparently considerable, how various proposals in the White Paper on wealth tax would have disastrous effects.  He made a fairly genuine effort, I suppose, from his point of view, to rally around the flag at the end when he said that he was in favour of 90 per cent of the White Paper but he was singularly unenthusiastic and unimpressive as the advocate <Col N="600" /> of what it contains.  He set out in some interesting detail&mdash;I look forward to reading it when the Official Report of last night's debate appears&mdash;the reasons why he thought the wealth tax was all wrong.  I heard his reasons and I agree with them.  In addition to the various reasons he gave, there are various other equally valid reasons why even the proposal of this tax in a White Paper, let alone its enactment, has already damaged the economy.</P>
    <P>One of the things to which Deputy Belton referred last night with horror &mdash;it is one that I know has affected quite a number of people&mdash;is that some wealthy foreigner who happens to have a residence here, even though his assets here may not be very great in comparison with his total wealth, may find himself, if he is living here, charged wealth tax on his entire assets.</P>

      <P>We tried while in Government over ten or 15 years to encourage investment but at the same time to share such wealth as was available as equitably as possible among as many as possible without providing a disincentive to those who created that wealth.  That has always been the basic problem facing any Government here; it is still a basic problem for this Government and it will face their successors.  I suggest what this Government have done in relation to capital taxation even if what is proposed is never enacted, has made people wary of investing in this country.  They have frittered away the goodwill and confidence slowly and laboriously built up over many years by organisations such as the IDA.  At <Col N="602" /> one fell swoop that confidence so difficult to build was lost.</P>

      <P>If this proposal were never enacted enormous damage has been done.  It is difficult to quantify it because one cannot sum up mathematically what one never had.  The real problem is: how much is not coming here now that would have come if this foolish document which is so properly and openly berated by the Minister for Defence, among others, had never appeared?  What a pity that the Minister for Defence and those who think like him were outvoted at the Cabinet meeting which produced it and how despicable it is that he should now seek to wash his hands and those of his colleagues of a document that they know has got them politically and the country financially into a great deal of trouble. How low can a Government go who say that something that has proved very much a hot potato was never thought up by them or approved by them but was something got out by the civil servants without reference to the Government?  It is contemptible that such a suggestion should be made.  The honesty of the Minister for Defence in saying what he thought of the White Paper&mdash;how unsuitable, unsatisfactory and improper it was&mdash; is diminished very considerably by his amateurish and childish dishonesty in attempting to fob the whole thing off on the civil servants.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>No Government ever produced a White Paper that they did not stand behind.  To say that this one was not produced by them and that they knew nothing about it and that the Fianna Fáil people who described it as a Government White Paper were misleading the people shows how keenly he is aware of the wrong steps which have been taken in relation to the proposed taxation of capital.  If he is so aware of it that he is prepared to come into this House and repeat seven times in the course of the debate on the budget that he does not stand over one line of it; that none of it <Col N="603" /> is his and that it all belongs to the civil servants then how clearly does he, as a member of a Government with collective responsibility, realise how foolish, how stupid and how damaging this wretched document is? I hope we never see this document so far as the wealth tax element of it is concerned, in any Finance Bill before this House either this year or at any time in the future.</P>

I have a great deal of sympathy for Deputies, such as Deputy O'Malley, trying to make some kind of case out of a very bad brief.  Deputy O'Malley has endeavoured to do just that but his endeavours have been in vain because the budget speaks for itself.  The budgetary statement was unique in many respects.  Its simple language can be conveyed without difficulty to anyone who takes the trouble to read it and it is pleasing to note that so many people, knowing that there were such good things contained in it, did take the trouble to read it.  In contributing to this debate I feel there is very little to convey to the people because most of them have already digested the budget.</P>

      <P>I was delighted to see aid being given to the people who are near retirement; people who have given lifetime service to this country.  Those benefiting include the self-employed, shopkeepers and farmers who are not in the favoured jobs or in the insurance groups.  Last year the Minister for Finance broke the barrier for old age pensions which was set down by the British Government in 1908.  In that year the British Government set 70 years as the qualifying age for an old age pension.</P>
      <P>During my membership of the Dáil I appealed, repeatedly, to Fianna Fáil Ministers to bring about a change in that position.  In 1972 I remarked that almost everything had changed in the previous ten or 15 years except the qualifying age for old age pensions. The National Coalition undertook to do something about this.  We got the sledgehammer to this and brought down the qualifying age.  Last year this was done and we did something more for our old people.  We stated that it was unfair for a man and a woman of 69 years of age to be penalised and to have 50p taken from them because they stipulated that they must have the right of residence in their own home until their death.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Then what happened?  These are facts that are interesting to our people at the retirement stage.  Fianna Fáil said to a single man: &ldquo;If you have more than £25 in your pocket, irrespective of whether you have a house or not, you are not entitled to the full pension.&rdquo; To a married couple they said: &ldquo;If you have more than £50 in <Col N="606" /> your pocket you are not entitled to the full pension; we are going to take 50p a week from you.&rdquo; What did we do last year?</P>

      <P>What did we do in this important field?  We said to the man and his wife, to the businessman, to the farmer, to the selfemployed person: &ldquo;If you have savings, you can retain approximately £4,500, retain the right to live in your own home, keep your maintenance as well, and you will get the full pension from us.&rdquo; That was last year.  This year Mr. Ryan had something to say on the 3rd of April.</P>

      <P>Deputy Fahey should keep his mouth shut.  Fianna Fáil had 16 years in office and they did nothing about that.  Even though many people studied the paper quite well, there was an exceptional innovation that some of them were rather doubtful about, but it was something that was in keeping with the policy of the Government when they settled down in office.  It was the introduction of an allowance for the pensioner's wife irrespective of her age.  The net result is that on the first Friday of July a man who attains the age of 68, who has, say a wife aged 55, 60 or 65, £5,000 in his pocket, by virtue of the easement of the means test, will get, not £4.90 as was there when Fianna Fáil were in office, but two £5 notes and 95p for himself and his wife, just 5p short of £11.</P>

      <P>I want to emphasise that in this House tonight, because I have been listening to the drivel of Deputy O'Malley who spoke in terms of 7p per week children's <Col N="607" /> allowances.  Repetition is no harm in this field.  This is the outstanding item I see in the Government's proposals. Many thousands of people throughout the country are therefore thanking their stars that Deputy Ryan is Minister for Finance and not Deputy George Colley.  In this budget we are mainly dealing with unorganised groups of people, the people who are not in sheltered employment, people who are not in insurable employment; we are dealing with the small farmers about whom we heard so much from Deputy O'Malley and their liability for tax.  These are the type of people who will get £10.95p on the first Friday of the month.  I believe that is a great breakthrough on the part of the Government.  It is the first time that a non-contributory old age pensioner has got an allowance for his wife.  Taking all the circumstances into account, particularly the fact that so many other reliefs and benefits are embodied in this Yellow Paper, and the fact that the Minister was able to do this without imposing any crippling taxation, we owe a deep debt of gratitude to the Government, and I am sure that debt will be acknowledged when the people have an opportunity of expressing their voice through the ballot box.</P>

      <P>This to my mind was the outstanding feature of this budget, and I think it deserved the extra few minutes which it took me to repeat what I am sure other Deputies have said on this question already.  There is an obligation on public funds to certain people, and we must have priorities.  Last year and <Col N="608" /> this year this Government set down their priorities clearly.  They are spelled out in this Yellow Paper.  Our old people are first.  I dealt with non-contributory applicants.  So far as contributory pensioners are concerned, everybody knows that the increases are <i>pro rata.</i> There is no need to impose on the time of the Chair and of the House in reading out the significant advances made in the rates payable as and from 1st July next.</P>
      <P>What do we find when we come to page 3 of the Yellow Paper?  We come to the widows' contributory pensions in which there is a sizeable increase. We come next to the deserted wives' allowance.</P>

      <P>This is no laughing matter.  I do not understand what my colleagues on the benches opposite are laughing about.  Unfortunately the position is that in this country, as in other countries, a number of women have been deserted by their husbands.  This is an unfortunate fact of life.  Such women find themselves in difficult circumstances. Do we close the door on them?  Do we close our eyes or wear black glasses pretending that they do not exist?  This is not the way this Government do business.  We know they exist.  The action we are taking on their behalf is outlined on page 3 of the Yellow Paper.  I am sure that the deserted wives throughout the country appreciate the thoughtfulness of the Minister and the Government.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Other aids are available to these social welfare beneficiaries.  The Government are mindful of their obligations to all our citizens.  They try to effect reconciliation if at all possible between deserted wives and their husbands.  Many officers are employed by the State to help such people.  I need only refer briefly to the disability and unemployment benefits. The picture here is as bright as that in other sections.  There is an increase also in the maternity allowance. There is also a significant improvement in the orphans' contributory allowance.  I remember these people being given 5s. per week by the <Col N="609" /> people who are now in Opposition. The allowance now is £5.70 per week. The widows and deserted wives will get considerable increases.</P>

      <P>What did the old age pensioners get when Deputy Fahey's party were in office?  I remember a poor old woman in County Cork who had no home of her own. She had £40 in a little purse.  The purse was tied around her neck with twine.  When the pension officer came to investigate her pension, being a truthful woman, she told him she had £40 to bury herself because she did not want to be a charge on public funds.  This is absolutely true.  The pensions officer took away 5s. per week.  The poor old woman lost 5s. per week.  She is in heaven now praying for us all.</P>

The means test in relation to the non-contributory pension has been eased again.  We all agree that that should be done.  We used to forget about unmarried mothers and treat them as deserted <Col N="610" /> wives were treated&mdash;by forgetting about them.  They are a group of people and they require special consideration because of their difficulties and trials.  We all know about the advice in the gospel telling us not to throw the first stone.  This Government do not throw any stones.  They would not dare to.  As well as advice and guidance we will give these women £9.70 a week as from the 1st July next.

      <P>Regarding income tax, Deputy O'Malley had much fault to find on this score; but I suppose he was only following what was said by the Leader of his party, who referred to the budget as a disaster. Deputy Colley used the word &ldquo;fraudulent&rdquo; in his description of it. Perhaps in the eyes of Fianna Fáil it is fraudulent to grant an allowance to unmarried women of 58 years of age or to grant the various other allowances that are mentioned in the budget.  I see nothing fraudulent in this budget.

      <NameTxt>Mr. M.P. Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>I beg the indulgence of the Chair because I am not ready to quote for a little while yet.  When we were in Opposition there were times when I begged the then Government to simplify our taxation code and to put it into a language that the people could understand, so that at least they would know what they were paying.  It was impossible for many people, apart from those who were well-qualified, <Col N="613" /> to understand the taxation code that existed up to now.  In this context I shall quote from page 23 of the Budget 1974.  This is reported also at column 1446 of Volume 271 of the Official Report for 3rd April, 1974:</P>
      <P>In the interest of simplification the existing complex scheme of 18 different income tax child allowances, which is now virtually incomprehensible to most taxpayers, will be abolished&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      <P>It is a pity that Deputy O'Malley was not in the House to hear this because he told so many lies about it.</P>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash; and replaced by a uniform child tax allowance of £200 per child.</P>
      <P>The Minister outlined the simplification of the system and put it in reasonable language on page 22 of &ldquo;The Budget 1974&rdquo; which is also reported in the Official Report, column 1444, Volume 271, of 3rd April, 1974:</P>
      <P>I now come to tax relief.  Last year, in my financial statement, I adverted to the need to examine critically our present structure of personal income taxation.  The aim of this was to devise a reformed structure which would be simple enough for taxpayers to understand and to produce a reasonably stable system which could develop, but whose basic structure need not be fundamentally revised for a considerable period.  There are two major causes of confusion&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      <P>and these were real causes for confusion&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>The Deputy should listen to what the Minister says:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&mdash;and misunderstanding regarding the present system.  In the first place, it is not generally appreciated that the standard rate of income tax, at present 35 per cent, is effectively not more than 26.25 per cent for those with earnings up to £2,000 which qualify for earned <Col N="614" /> income relief.  Secondly, our progressive rates of income taxation are based on two forms of taxation, income tax and surtax, with somewhat similar, but not identical, charging rules and reliefs.  Simplification which dealt with these and other difficulties could be approached in a number of ways yielding different results.</P>
    <P>The Minister sets out in the simplest of language that even a child in senior infants could understand a simplification of the tax system.  One would need to be well qualified to understand the old system.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanCrinion" hpid="Mr. Crinion Mr. Crinion">

      <NameTxt>Mr. M.P. Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>Everyone dislikes paying tax but people who are fortunate enough to earn reasonably <Col N="615" /> large incomes must pay tax in order that the people in the less well-off sections may enjoy the benefits to which they are entitled and are getting under this Government.  The Minister could not please everybody.  One must remember that the old reliables, the pint, cigarettes and tobacco, were not interfered with so far as additional taxation is concerned.  Therefore, I think the Minister has made a reasonable start.  The main personal allowances under the new structure will be £500 per single person, £550 for a widowed person, £800 for a married person, a child allowance of £200, working wife's allowance of £200, housekeeper's allowance of £140, blind person's allowance of £140 and dependent relative's allowance of £80. All these allowances were increased but I can appreciate that people would like them to be higher.  Those of us who enjoy incomes above the average must recognise that we have to make a contribution towards public funds.</P>
      <P>I was worried because Deputy O'Malley did not like the idea of some people getting the benefit of this claw-back. He said that he did not think that people in the £2,500 income bracket should get the benefit of the full £200 in respect of children's allowances.  I will not elaborate further on that score.</P>
      <P>We were told that this was a rich man's budget.  If one reads the Minister's budget statement one will realise that that is not so.  The tax impositions are set down clearly.  For those in the higher income bracket the tax imposition at 80 per cent is rather steep.  There is nothing of a give-away about that.</P>
      <P>Another pleasing feature of the Minister's proposals was the tables he gave setting out in the simplest language, so far as income tax is concerned, a person's liabilities, rights and entitlements.  I will not delay the House by spelling them out.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>People who will benefit from the budget are those who have, down through the years, invested their money in national loans.  I was surprised <Col N="616" /> to hear Deputy O'Malley refer to them in such a sarcastic tone of voice.  Who are these people?  They are the people who were admonished by all parties to put their money in the national loans, to give it to the Government to develop the country and help employment and industry. If you have any saving what better place to invest it than in the nation? All three parties recited that litany here each November.  Perhaps the people giving the advice did not act on it but many people, including people in the lower income groups, with small savings, accepted the advice.</P>

The budgetary proposals will make some compensation to such people for the sacrifices they have made in contributing their money to the development of this nation.  Instead of a man and his wife with an income of £494 having to pay tax at the rate of 35p in the £ they will have up to £800 free and then when they have to pay tax for the first £1,550 it will be only at the rate of 26p in the £.

      <P>Inheritance tax and the other taxes set down by the Government are fair and reasonable. Those taxes are paid when you are alive and working, when you are able to earn the money, when you are able to supervise your holding and manage it.  They are not to be paid, as they were under Fianna Fáil, when you went into the coffin and your wife and family had to bear the burden after you.  It was about time to wipe out this system.  I always said it was unfair to have death duties, punishing a man so much in death.  The Minister for Finance had a great deal of foresight in drawing up the regulations in the White Paper.  How dare Deputy O'Malley or any other Deputy criticise him for doing so.  Fianna Fáil had 16 years from 1957 to 1973 to do this job but they did not do it.  We know the Fianna Fáil dodging.  The election race of 1973 was almost over, we had reached the last week, when the Fianna Fáil Party brought out this <Col N="620" /> rates waiver proposal.  That is the type of thinking they have.</P>

      <P>The general election was on the 28th February. The Fianna Fáil proposal was born about the 20th February.  Its birth was subsequent to the election advertisement that the shadow Minister for Agriculture, Deputy Collins, had already sent along to the Limerick paper asking for support for Deputy Noonan and himself.  It was not born at the time his election address was written.  I understand that was compiled about 16th February so I would put the date of the birth of this rates relief proposal as the 18th or 19th February, nine days prior to the 1973 General Election.  The going was bad for the Fianna Fáil Party then, the ground was yielding under them and for the first time it dawned on Fianna Fáil they would move to the Opposition benches.</P>
      <P>It was a good job Fianna Fáil moved to the Opposition benches.  I say that in all sincerity because now we have a fair Government.  We have a Government who are thinking about the people and we have a Government whose personnel have all the qualifications to govern.  They have the administrative capacity and they know what the people want.  They also have the ability to draw up proposals, such as those contained in the budget statement of the 3rd April.  That is an indication that this country is moving forward.  As I said here last night, in reply to Deputy Murphy, we are going through trying times so far as our pig industry in particular is concerned. We do not hide the problems.  We are outspoken.  If the position is not good we say so.  Somebody referred a while ago to preferential treatment.  We are moving away from that now.  That existed under the Fianna Fáil Party.</P>

The Minister in a recent statement to the Dáil said that since he came into office 12 months ago he appointed for the entire state 453 PCs from Malin Head in Donegal to Cape Clear Point in County Cork where I live.  All the PCs under the previous Government were appointed through the nomination of the Fianna Fáil Cumainn.  Do Fianna Fáil think they should have the appointment of the PCs or do they think that the Minister for Justice should still write to the Fianna Fáil Cumainn, as used to happen, to know who they would recommend for peace commissioners?  There is nothing wrong in that figure.</P>

      <P>Everybody knows the Minister for Finance well enough to realise that he has the capacity to make correct proposals. A budget is so wide ranging that you can speak on almost any subject.  I would not like to resume my seat without mentioning fisheries.  The Government are trying to expand this industry to get more money particularly for capital investment.  Things are moving very well so far as we are concerned and we are very pleased with the results.  We are trying to get the goodwill and the co-operation of our fishermen.  The outlook is very good today.  The Department of Fisheries want to work in close co-operation with the fishermen.</P>
      <P>We want to work as a team, with the fishermen of all grades, the crews, the skippers and others, the BIM and the Department and, under these budgetary provisions, I have no doubt that the capital will be available to continue the expansion of this industry.  I believe any proposal designed to expand this most important industry should meet with the approval of the House.</P>
      <P>I said at the outset that it was very difficult to make a contribution to this budget debate and, now that I have spoken, I realise my forecast was reasonably correct because one does not really know where to begin and one finds it difficult to conclude so good are the proposals contained in the budget; it contains so much that is so good, that we were looking for for so long, that one could go on talking on the budget and the Yellow Paper for half the day and still fail to do justice to it.  Think of the tax reliefs, the allowances, the various innovations, the reduction in the qualifying age for pension purposes, the allowance for the first time for a wife irrespective of the age of the non-contributory pensioner.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy O'Malley had much to say about the farmers being taxed.  He was almost trembling so excited was he about their welfare.  But it was not <Col N="624" /> just farmers he was concerned about; he had a qualification to make&mdash;poor farmers.  I have here a summary of a statement from a newspaper about a meeting Deputy Lynch had down in Waterford; he went along there to settle some internal dispute, something the Fianna Fáil Party suffered from in that constituency.  I do not know whether or not it has been resolved but when he mentioned agreement with the general principle enunciated by our Minister for Finance so far as taxation of the bigger farmers was concerned, according to Press reports, the farmers walked out from that meeting in Waterford. Did they go back in again?  Is he worried in case the Minister for Finance is losing the support of the bigger farmers?  Why not look into his own heart now?  Was he worried when the farmers walked out of that meeting in Waterford?</P>

      <P>I said I made a summary.  I referred earlier to the growing confidence of people generally as a result of this budget.  Instead of money being sent out of the country&mdash; that £8 million Mr. X exported according to Deputy O'Malley&mdash;money is coming into the country because there is confidence.  It is very pleasant, indeed, to note so much industrial development here, there and everywhere. That is the result of what this Government are doing.  They have the confidence of the people.  I had the very pleasant task again recently of <Col N="625" /> turning the key to open yet another little factory to help a small group of people.  Despite many difficulties this Government have got confidence from the people; they know the Government will treat them equitably and fairly.  The people can make their own assessment.  They have already made an assessment and the result of that assessment will be that this Government will be in office for a long, long time to come.</P>

The Minister and the Government deserve well of the people.  They are planning along the right lines.  They have their priorities right.  First are the social welfare classes and the retired; then we move to the industrial arm, helping industry to develop and expand, thereby creating employment opportunities.

I have a certain sympathy with the Fianna Fáil Party trying to oppose a budget like this, a budget they were incapable of producing and would be incapable of producing even if they were in office for another 16 years.  I am slow to make charges, but I think they have been unfair and, indeed, deliberately untruthful in their assessment of these budgetary proposals.  There is no need to dwell on Deputy Lynch's description of the budget.  Deputy Colley <Col N="626" /> amply indicated the kind of thinking there is in the Fianna Fáil Party. Fianna Fáil are vexed.  They are jealous.  They are envious.  They should try to be a little broadminded. We all work for the good of the country.  We are all desirous of seeing our people prosper.  We are all anxious that our people should find work at home.  We all want to ensure that the aged are cared for and looked after. That is something that is being done by this Government.  Let us pat the Government on the back now, wish them well and wish them many years of fruitful government.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Nolan</NameTxt>
      <P>Not one member of Fine Gael or Labour was here to listen to the Parliamentary Secretary's speech.  It was a pantomime.  I listened closely, particularly when he was speaking about agriculture.  I come from an agricultural constituency in Carlow-Kilkenny and I should like to tell him there is complete chaos in the industry at the moment.  Farmers do not know what to do, whether they should go into beef, cereals or beet.  The Minister returned from Brussels this morning but he could not tell them what will happen to the beef that is in storage. Apparently the Italians are imposing some duties but he could not explain that.  The Parliamentary Secretary would want to go further than Meath to find out what the farmers are thinking.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If farmers with a valuation of more than £100 are being taxed, why are stud farmers excluded?  I drive from here to Carlow and on the way I pass by some of the finest estates in the country; they have magnificent houses, tarmacadam roads, and a considerable amount of timber fencing to prevent the beautiful horses damaging themselves on bushes and scrub.  Probably these stud farmers have horses similar <Col N="627" /> to Tulyar where the fee could well be about £10,000.  We all know the old story: no foal, no fee.  However, many large fees have been collected by these farmers and are put into the back pocket.  This is happening while an ordinary worker on the farm, if he is single, has a take-home wage of £17.50 per week when deductions are made.  He will be obliged to pay income tax.  Why did the Minister for Finance not give us an explanation why these stud farmers are excluded from income tax liability?  Did the Taoiseach have a word with him?  Did he tell the Minister that these people are friends of his, that he meets them at Punchestown, the Curragh, Leopardstown or Fairyhouse?  We know the Taoiseach is a powerful man in the Government, but is it fair that a farm labourer whose take-home pay is £17.50 per week is taxed?</P>
    <P>The people would like to know why the stud farmers have been excluded from tax liability.  I am sure that some of the farmers in the Parliamentary Secretary's constituency in west Cork would like to know the answer.  Most of the Parliamentary Secretary's speech dealt with social welfare.  In every budget since the last Coalition Government in the mid-1950s benefits have been given to social welfare recipients.  Many of the schemes now in operation, the widows' contributory pension scheme, the children's allowance scheme and the health benefit scheme, were introduced by Fianna Fáil, as was the retirement pension scheme at 65 years.  I am not going to waste the time of this House in giving kudos for these things.</P>
    <P>The money distributed for social welfare was very little.  Last year the figure was £52 million but this year the figure is £16.97 million, a reduction of about one-third.  The reason is that we will have another budget in December. In his speech the Minister stated:</P>
    <P>The relief in income tax will cost the State £17.65 million.  The increases in social welfare for the nine-month period will cost £16.97 million, making a total of £34.62 million.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="628" /> When the Minister prepared his budget he was £21 million short.  In concluding his statement the Minister said:</P>
    <P>These factors bring the deficit to £71 million for the year or £81.15 million for the nine-month period.</P>
    <P>Where will the Minister get this money? It works out at £9 million per month. We know there will be a certain buoyancy in the revenue, that because workers have got an increase in wages they will be paying 26p out of every extra £ they earn.  The people are entitled to ask where the £81 million will come from and the Minister will have to give some explanation.  I realise that there is always the case of confidence tricks, that on 18th June we will have local elections.  It may be that the people will accept extra taxation, an increase in value-added tax, and perhaps an increase in income tax next December.</P>
    <P>The Parliamentary Secretary mentioned development in the capital budget.  It is not something that people talk about generally but the capital budget is a most important document. Recently a farmer came to me and told me he had been seeking a loan from the ACC in order to build a house.  The following day a small farmer told me he wanted to borrow a few thousand pounds to buy ten acres of land adjoining his farm.  Both were told by the ACC there was no money and I am putting that fact on the record of the House.  If a person owes a few pounds he cannot go to the ACC for money. That is the order from the Minister for Finance.  These are the facts and the Parliamentary Secretary cannot get away from them.</P>

I repeat that there is no money available from the ACC for a farmer who wants to build a private house, who wants to buy an extra ten acres to extend his holding or who owes a few pounds to a merchant or a bank.

      <P>The national wage agreement failed because the workers were not getting enough.  They had to pay too much income tax.  There were discussions with the Minister for Labour, with the Government and the ICTU.  The Taoiseach said to the Minister for Labour: &ldquo;Leave this to me.  You are a Labour man.  I will go in and tell them that we are giving relief on income tax.  I will make it big because I am the Taoiseach.&rdquo; What happened?  The Parliamentary Secretary referred to a yellow paper. This is the Minister's document and it has a yellow cover.</P>

I can assure the Parliamentary Secretary that the people expected a lot more in the budget by way of relief in income tax.  We were told that the 58 year old women were getting a few shillings.  Let us see what women got in the budget.</P>

      <P>It is a pity I have not got a civil servant to advise me.  That is one of the unfortunate things about being in Opposition.  The <Col N="630" /> widow's personal allowance is £550. The deserted wife is not mentioned.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelPatMurphy" hpid="Mr. M.P. Murphy Mr. M.P. Murphy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M.P. Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>We will look after the deserted wife.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasNolan" hpid="Mr. Nolan Mr. Nolan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Nolan</NameTxt>
      <P>The single person's allowance is £500 and the widow's personal allowance is £550.  The widow is probably paying for a house and she has only £50 more tax free allowance than a single person possibly living at home and giving £5 or £6 a week to the mother or father. Is it justice to give only £50 more to a widow?  We know the liability she has when her husband dies.  She has to adjust because, no matter how good she is, she probably will not earn the same wages as her husband earned.  She goes out to work and all she has by way of income tax allowance is £50 more than a single person, and we talk about social justice.  To me that is not social justice.  The least the Minister could do is to give that little £50 extra tax free allowance to the deserted wife.</P>
      <P>In the budget debate in 1971 Fianna Fáil were criticised for not giving a higher tax free allowance but in our 1972 budget we gave an increase of £1 a week across the board in tax free allowances.  We heard talk about the wonderful increases the Minister for Finance was giving.  Before the Parliamentary Secretary left the House he did not believe me when I quoted some figures.  Actually the person saves nothing.  In the 1973 budget no tax relief was given.  Since then even the lowest paid worker has got an increase of approximately £5.  He is paying 26p in the £.  Five times 26p is 130p.  He is saving about 70p.  In the two-year period he is paying about 60p per week more than he paid prior to this budget.  These are the simple facts.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There has been a lot of talk about the rates being reduced.  In my county the rate in the £ which was £6 last year is down to £5 but it is for nine months.  People on differential rents who were paying their rates weekly to the council got a letter the other day saying: &ldquo;Your rates have gone up 14p per week.&rdquo; They told me they thought their rates had gone down <Col N="631" /> and I said: &ldquo;Whoever told you that told you a lie.&rdquo; In the case of a person who was paying £36 rates last year for the 12-month period the rates have gone down by £1 in the £ from £6 to £5 this year but he has to pay his £30 within nine months.  Divide nine into £30 and you discover that it is about £3.33 per month.  Divide £36 rates by 12 and you discover that while he paid £3 per month last year over the 12-month period this year he is paying £3.33.  That is why a person who is paying his rates weekly has now suddenly discovered that the rates have gone up.  These are facts. Many of the things I have mentioned are connected with the local elections on 18th June.  Deputy O'Malley quoted the Minister for Defence speaking in the House the other day and the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries tried to defend him.  In Deputy O'Malley's quotation he said: &ldquo;Come back on 30th June and we shall explain this to you.&rdquo; Why 30th June?  Because it is 11 days after the count for the local elections.  Then you may talk about wealth tax and all these things.</P>
    <P>I shall not go into any more detail. We shall have the Finance Bill and the Social Welfare Bill on which we can discuss all these matters as they arise.  Every housewife is in the position that she does not know tomorrow morning what prices will be.  Every day there is an increase; it is sausages today, butter tomorrow, margarine the next day and jam the day after.  This is the Government which in its 12 point plan was going to control or freeze prices.  Now, to make matters worse, the Minister for Industry and Commerce says he will not publish increases in prices because they have become an embarrassment to him and the Government.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMKelly" hpid="Mr. Kelly Mr. Kelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kelly</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasNolan" hpid="Mr. Nolan Mr. Nolan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Nolan</NameTxt>
      <P>I suggest the Parliamentary Secretary should put this to the Minister for Industry and Commerce. I am aware that if a shopkeeper does not display the correct <Col N="632" /> price list showing maximum prices he can be prosecuted and many of them have been brought to court because they have not displayed the correct prices.  How will shopkeepers know the correct prices now when the Government have decided not to publish a correct maximum prices list?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMKelly" hpid="Mr. Kelly Mr. Kelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>As far as I know the practice of publishing at public expense the list of price increases is only about 15 months old and prices were zooming up long before then.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasNolan" hpid="Mr. Nolan Mr. Nolan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Nolan</NameTxt>
      <P>Agreed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMKelly" hpid="Mr. Kelly Mr. Kelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>I give the ex-Minister every credit of being for the innovation of publishing those price increases. That is to his credit, but until that time came&mdash;and it was very soon before the change of Government&mdash; there were no such publications.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasNolan" hpid="Mr. Nolan Mr. Nolan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Nolan</NameTxt>
      <P>Thank you very much for that but this is very important from a legal point of view.  No price lists will now be published and no Government public notice will be issued showing in local or national papers the maximum price for any article.  The inspectors of the Department of Industry and Commerce will go down the country and say to shopkeepers: &ldquo;You are overcharging for that article&rdquo;.  It may have happened that the wholesaler went into that shop that morning and said: &ldquo;The price of X commodity is gone up 2p retail&rdquo;.  The shopkeeper may say: &ldquo;How is that?&rdquo; and he will be told: &ldquo;The Prices Commission have agreed to it&rdquo;.  The shopkeeper may say that he did not see it in the paper.  How will this go?  That should be explained.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMKelly" hpid="Mr. Kelly Mr. Kelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>the situation which will now be resumed is the situation which existed for a very long time up to about two months before the change of Government at a time when prices were all the time going up.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasNolan" hpid="Mr. Nolan Mr. Nolan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Nolan</NameTxt>
      <P>My interpretation of it is that the Government do not want the embarrassment of publishing all these price increases day after day. When the people realise next December when the next budget comes that <Col N="633" /> not only will they have to pay the increases for next year but that they will have to provide this £81 million mentioned in the Minister's own statement as the amount that will be in deficit at the end of the year, then the cat will be among the pigeons.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Fahey</NameTxt>
      <P>The Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries certainly put up a great show in trying to defend the Government on this budget, but no matter what he does I do not think he will succeed in hoodwinking the people into thinking that this budget is something that it is not.  This is a sleight of hand budget and its full implications are not yet known to the people.  We have an obligation to make known the shortcomings of the budget as soon as possible.  The Government would not wish those shortcomings to be made known until after the local elections but with the intelligent electorate we have&mdash;I believe the Government are underrating this&mdash;the people will become aware that this is an effort to hoodwink them into voting for the Government candidates in the June elections.  On the day the budget was introduced some of the Government backbenchers were there to applaud the Minister when he concluded his speech.  He was not applauded by all of them.  Those who did not applaud were wiser than those who did.  They had already seen the shortcomings.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMKelly" hpid="Mr. Kelly Mr. Kelly">

    <Speaker pid="JackieFahey" hpid="Mr. Fahey Mr. Fahey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fahey</NameTxt>
      <P>It is evident here that we have had a lack of interest by the backbenchers in particular in the budget debate.  For most of this afternoon we had deserted benches on the Government side and this was very obvious.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Parliamentary Secretary made great play of the increases in social welfare benefits.  We welcome any increase in those benefits and we are glad to see our policy in this regard <Col N="634" /> being continued because we granted increases in budget after budget since 1957 onwards, since we took over from the last Coalition Government. The increases were greater in some years than in others but if we had the opportunity that the National Coalition Government have had in regard to increasing social welfare benefits I assure you the amount we would give would be far greater because, first, they had this windfall which we had committed ourselves to use for social welfare benefits had we continued in office.  I refer to the saving of £30 million on our agricultural exports. They had that saving again in the present year.  This sum had not to be provided and therefore it was available.  We had committed ourselves to using it to bring relief to the less well-off sections of the community.</P>
    <P>With the huge increases we have had in prices in the past 12 months and with the rampant inflation that we have, we regard the social welfare increases as being only about half what they should be.  Because of the price increases that are still taking place the increases that have been given to the social welfare classes will be eroded before they get them on July 1st.  Therefore, I say with confidence that the Government have nothing to boast about.  The increase in children's allowances, which amounts to no more than 1p per day, is nothing to boast about when one considers the cost of food and clothing for children today.  Any housewife or head of a household could tell the Minister how these costs have soared.</P>
    <P>When Fianna Fáil were in Government they gave numerous fringe benefits in their budget, such as free travel and free electricity but this budget does not give any such benefit to the less well off sections in our community.  The fringe benefits introduced by Fianna Fáil brought great relief to the hard pressed social welfare recipients.  When dealing with the question of free electricity, I should like to make a plea to the Minister to increase the number of units given free to such people.  The <Col N="635" /> number given free at present is too low especially in the case of old age pensioners who live alone.  It is often the case that such people are not in good health because they have not sufficient heat.  I believe some extra concession should be given to such people.</P>
    <P>Pensioners living in areas about to be supplied with electricity should be given some assistance by the Government because the cost of connecting, particularly in remote areas, is enormous and, in many cases, means that such people are not in a position to benefit from the service.  There is an exorbitant demand on people anxious to be connected to the electricity supply system and pensioners, and others in receipt of social assistance, cannot meet such demands.  I have many cases of old age pensioners in a particular area about to be developed by the ESB who cannot have the electricity installed because of the high connecting fee they are asked to pay.</P>
    <P>I should like to know what has become of the promise made by the National Coalition to have the non-contributory old age pension paid at 65.  I welcome the fact that the qualifying age has been reduced to 68 but this is a long way from what was promised.  A specific promise was given that non-contributory old age pensions would be paid at 65 and the National Coalition has gone back on that.  Those who accused Fianna Fáil this evening of not reducing the qualifying age should remember that Fianna Fáil gave a clear indication that it was their policy to do so.  Fianna Fáil introduced the retirement pensions at 65 years of age and, therefore, it can be taken from that that it was their policy to reduce the qualifying age for old age pensions to that level.</P>
    <P>Mention has been made of the increases granted to the old age pensioners but I cannot see that one has anything to boast about in the amount the non-contributory old age pensioner receives, a miserable sum of £7.30. That is not sufficient for a person of that age to survive on.  The greatest hardship is on those people who live alone and there are many such cases. <Col N="636" /> Such people who lead a very lonely life are being affected by the high cost of living we have today.  Anybody who says that £7.30 is sufficient for such people to live on is living in cloud-cuckooland.</P>
    <P>While we have people living in such poverty there is no need for anyone to spend £100,000 or any other sum of money, to carry out research in order to ascertain where poverty exists because we know it exists with our social welfare recipients.  Under Fianna Fáil the gap had been narrowed between those in receipt of social welfare payments and those in receipt of such payments in Great Britain and Northern Ireland but with the increases granted there, especially in social security, the gap has once more started to widen. This is to be regretted.</P>
    <P>Something should be done to encourage people to look after the aged in our community.  There should be some concession for relatives who have to leave work and stay at home to care for such people.  This is something which should be encouraged and money provided for this would be money well spent.  If such old people were to go into a home or institution it would cost approximately £50 per week to care for them.  It would be much more desirable that such old people should be cared for in their own homes.  The Minister should give every encouragement to people anxious to look after the elderly in the evening of their lives.</P>
    <P>The Government have nothing whatever to boast about in regard to income tax allowances.  When these allowances are gone into in detail, and when the people see their demands, they will realise that many of them are losing money because of the changes that have taken place. Instead of gaining, many of them will be losing under this budget. Taking into account the fall in the value of money and the rampant inflation income tax allowances should have been increased considerably.</P>
    <P>My greatest sympathy today is with people in rural Ireland who have to travel long journeys to work and who have to meet the cost of the upkeep of a motorcar to do this.  Many of <Col N="637" /> them travel 40, 50 and 60 miles and get no allowance whatever in their income tax for this.  These people cannot get to their employment without a car and some concession should be given to them.</P>
    <P>As the Minister for Finance is here perhaps, when replying, he would clarify the position in regard to small-holders. A smallholder or anyone else with a land valuation who is forced out to work will have his income tax allowance reduced by 50 per cent.  There are many small land owners who cannot make a living on their land but who are fortunate enough to have employment in some local industry in the village or in the neighbouring town.  It is far better that they would have this employment here at home rather than have to emigrate.  If they are going to be victimised now, I would ask the Minister to alter the situation.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>The small man will not be affected by that provision.  We shall have a provision in the Finance Bill to exclude the small man.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackieFahey" hpid="Mr. Fahey Mr. Fahey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fahey</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad of that because otherwise such people would be victimised.  However I would mention again the person in rural Ireland who has to travel to work by motorcar.  A car is no longer a luxury in rural Ireland; it is a necessity, and because of the high cost of petrol and oil I had hoped that the Minister for Finance would reduce the tax on petrol, in particular, in order to bring some relief to those people.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>At the outset I described this budget as a sleight-of-hand budget, but it is also a frightening budget when you think of the huge deficit for which we are budgeting.  With inflation at the high rate it is at now I hate to think of the deficit we shall have at the end of this year.  It must be remembered that we are facing another budget in December, because this is a budget for only nine months. This budget is a clear indication of the type of Government we have, a Government who are not facing up to their responsibilities, a Government who are borrowing at home and abroad.  I refer particularly to the <Col N="638" /> borrowing of £20 million from the Central Bank in order to keep the economy ticking over.  This is bad for the economy and severely affects the private sector who are now finding it impossible to get finance.</P>
    <P>The Agricultural Credit Corporation had been doing an excellent job in lending money to farmers for investment and development over the years, but money is no longer available. From dealings we have had with the ACC we find that the money is not there for the farmer who wants to erect a new house or to add a few acres to his small holding.</P>
    <P>Many industries are also affected because of a lack of finance.  In my own constituency there are industries in severe difficulties, and some of them have actually closed down. When Fianna Fáil were in office, if one industry closed down it made the headlines.  Now there are industries closing down and I have not seen any publicity given to them.</P>
    <P>Of course this money that the Government borrowed will have to be paid back, and some future Government will have to undertake this task. Money borrowed abroad puts a severe strain on the economy, because interest on that money will be going to some foreign country for circulation there and will not be in circulation here at home.</P>
    <P>One of the Government Deputies mentioned the efforts being made by all parties to get the public to invest in National Loans.  I said by way of interruption that our efforts on the last occasion were not successful in getting people to invest in the National Loan because investors, both big and small, had no confidence in the Government.  The last time that a National Loan was a failure was when we had a Coalition Government&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="GeraldLEstrange" hpid="Mr. L'Estrange Mr. L'Estrange">

He was boasting about the miserable increases to the social welfare classes.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>In deciding to raise this matter on the Adjournment I wish to state that the Parliamentary Secretary, in reply to a question on Thursday last, showed great concern for the position and made an appeal to all concerned to bend every nerve to solve the problem of this school transport service strike.  Unfortunately the media did not carry his appeal.  It was because of the urgency of the matter that I am raising it now in the hope that, by having it discussed here on the Adjournment, pointing out what is happening and making a <i>cri de coeur</i> here at this stage, the dispute might be settled and something done about it.</P>
      <P>Parents are very concerned, as is evidenced by a series of letters which Deputies on all sides of the House have received and by telephone calls they also received.  Deputies are aware that over the past few years a policy of amalgamation of schools has been in progress in order to provide better facilities for students in primary and post-primary schools.  As a result of this children have to travel longer distances than hitherto.  They depend on this transport provided at the expense of the Department of Education to reach their schools.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Any interference with the school transport service is a very serious matter.  Most of the comment in the <Col N="640" /> public Press has been related to the public examinations.  People have said &mdash;and there is a certain amount of truth in this&mdash;that the public examinations cannibalise the education system. To a certain extent this is true.  Nevertheless the examinations are important. They may be far more important in the eyes and minds of the people sitting them than in the eyes of more seasoned members of the community.  Anything that interferes with their studies, particularly in this stage of the academic year when revision is the order of the day and when the pupils are making up for lost time, is to be decried.</P>
    <P>If we can find any means for dealing with the interruption of school transport we should try to use them. The emphasis on the examinations puts the spotlight on the post-primary students.  There is also a serious problem in regard to primary pupils. I might even say that the problem in regard to such pupils is more serious. My own nephews and nieces, who are in a country parish where the schools were closed down, are now attending a central school which is serving that area and are affected by this strike. The post-primary students can take a chance and try to thumb a lift.  Because of their more tender years the younger pupils are in a much more difficult position.  At the moment many families have stopped trying to get the children to school, particularly those families which cannot provide, in unison with other families in the neighbourhood, daily transport for the children.</P>
    <P>This is a very important element.  It should cause us anxiety.  The children of our poorer citizens affected have little chance of getting to school at the present.  There is a social problem here also.  I know that the Parliamentary Secretary, when speaking at Question Time on this matter and answering a question put by Deputy J. O'Leary from Kerry, stated that certain moves were afoot to settle the dispute.  He said that unofficial disputes or strikes of any kind could not be condoned and did not come within the normal procedures for settling industrial disputes.  We all subscribe to that general principle.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="641" /> My difficulty is that I feel if one sticks to protocol and to certain methods of working the children will be the losers.  I said on Thursday also that a dispute like this which keeps pupils away from school&mdash;no matter at what level they are&mdash;is something quite different from an industrial dispute. By paying overtime and working longer hours or extra shifts production can be equalised later, but as far as a child in school is concerned, either at primary or post-primary level, the time lost is time lost forever. It cannot be made up.  The situation is different from that in an industry.  The protocol procedures and structures invented for dealing with industrial disputes do not apply in regard to schools.  They do not apply in so far as the effects of the dispute are concerned.</P>
    <P>I am not quite sure whether this dispute has been declared an official one since last Thursday.  The Parliamentary Secretary is now indicating that it has not.  I had hoped that it had been so declared, if this would have facilitated dealing with it.  Obviously it has not been declared official and that makes the position still more parlous.  The people involved in the strike are part-time workers.  If they were employed by CIE at a certain figure some years ago I do not see why that figure should not be increased now, just as other workers have had salaries and wages increased. I know that the Parliamentary Secretary has not any competence in this matter although if he brings pressure strongly to bear on CIE a solution might be found.</P>
    <P>Deputy Browne mentioned that there had been a long strike in Wexford.  This particular trouble is now added to that.  The disruption in school life in that particular area is very serious.  I want to appeal to the Parliamentary Secretary and to his Minister to harness all the influence that they undoubtedly have and which attaches to their respective offices to approach CIE privately, if that is the way to do it, and to soften them.  They might approach the union.  I understand there is now a union catering for these drivers.  They might talk <Col N="642" /> bluntly to the union itself and emphasise the points I have already made about a dispute like this involving children being quite different from a dispute involving the normal industrial worker.  They should be told that there is a duty on them as citizens to settle their dispute as quickly as possible and to make transport available for children both at primary and post-primary level.  The children are deprived of such transport at the moment.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to support what Deputy Wilson has stated. When I asked this Question last Thursday I inquired from the Minister for Education what steps the Government were taking in connection with the strike.  I believe that the Government as a body should intervene in this strike.  There seems to be confusion among the public as to what Departments are really responsible.  The drivers who are on strike say they are dealing with CIE.  Apparently their claim is to be processed by a body within the Department of Labour but it is the Department of Education who, through CIE, cover the cost of the transport.  The majority of the drivers in the country seem to be on strike and so far as I am aware there is a total strike in Kerry.  I appeal to the Government to make some effort to bring about a solution because the situation is having a serious effect on the education of the children concerned, both at primary and post-primary levels.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have been informed by some of the drivers that this strike could have been averted if there had been a little co-operation from the employers at the outset.  We all know that once a strike has begun it can be difficult to bring about a solution to it.  I had hoped for some action during the Easter recess but there was none.  The drivers are totally dissatisfied with their rates of remuneration.  They have a very good case.  There are some who would say that to meet their demands would be an infringement of the national pay agreement but we must have regard to the conditions of employment of these part-time drivers.  Their responsibility is great.  They drive heavy buses along roads that are sometimes very narrow <Col N="643" /> and dangerous.  They are responsible for the transportation of children to school at a time in the morning when there is very heavy traffic on the roads because at this time of the day people are driving to their places of employment and, also, there are lorries on the road transporting milk to the creameries.  These factors would have to be taken into consideration by any body concerned with the processing of the drivers' claim.</P>
    <P>I understand that some of the men have no intention of returning to work unless the terms of settlement are satisfactory but if they should resign it would cost a lot of money to replace them by full-time workers.  It is unfortunate, too, that children are suffering, not only educationally, but in other ways also as a result of this dispute.  I know of one area from which the children attending post-primary schools must &ldquo;thumb&rdquo; lifts for a distance of 20 miles.  No doubt some children will fail in the forthcoming examinations as a result of the present situation. Therefore, some provision should be made by the Department of Education. In so far as primary schools are concerned there has been a substantial falling off in attendance during the past week.  I am thinking in particular of areas in which schools have been closed and where the Department promised to provide transport to schools in other areas.  In many schools there is only a 35 per cent attendance at present.</P>
    <P>From the reply given by the Parliamentary Secretary to my question on the previous occasion I am aware that he is concerned personally with the problem but the Government, as a whole, should move quickly and ensure that the strike is settled as soon as possible.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DenisGallagher" hpid="Mr. Gallagher Mr. Gallagher">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gallagher</NameTxt>
      <P>I am happy to have an opportunity of joining with my colleagues in asking the Government to do everything possible to ensure that this strike is settled without further delay.  A few weeks ago I endeavoured to raise this matter by way of supplementary question but at that time the Parliamentary Secretary <Col N="644" /> informed me that I was raising a matter that was not relevant at that point.</P>
      <P>This strike is very serious from many points of view.  As has been stated by the previous speakers, the children who will be sitting for examinations shortly are the ones who come to mind immediately.  Their morale has been affected seriously at a time when they are most in need of encouragement.  This applies in particular to the weaker children who will be sitting for the intermediate or leaving certificate examinations.  We are all aware that the strains imposed on children by examinations are great enough without their having to face the difficulties caused by the present transport situation.  Teachers with whom I have been in contact in relation to this matter have informed me that this year has been bad so far as attendance is concerned because of a high incidence of colds and influenza. Therefore, the added burden of the strike is very serious.</P>
      <P>Another aspect of the situation with which the Government should concern themselves seriously is the disturbing effect that a strike of this kind can have on youngsters in general. While driving to Dublin yesterday morning I could not but notice the number of children who were congregated at crossroads and at various other points along the way, some of them hitching lifts.  Of course, while there are many children who are anxious to get to school there may be others who are happy that the situation is as it is.</P>
      <P>Another disturbing feature is that, as I have been informed by parents, children are not welcome on some of the regular services in cases where it was possible for them to avail of these services.  Perhaps this was because of overcrowding on the buses.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Another factor that has been brought to my notice is the amount of money it is costing parents in some cases to have their children taken to school by hackney drivers.  They are paying these charges because of their anxiety over children who will be sitting for examinations.  Too much <Col N="645" /> time has been wasted already so I trust the Government will act quickly now.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Tunney</NameTxt>
      <P>I shall avail of the one minute remaining to say that I noticed that the Department have been in touch with CIE on this matter, and rightly so.  During the week I heard the president of the Rural Federation of Workers speaking on a radio programme and he expressed the opinion that if CIE were prepared to talk with him, the strike could be solved or that, at least, the drivers could return to work.  I am wondering whether the Parliamentary Secretary has been made aware of that situation because, obviously, it is a very important aspect.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Education (Mr. Bruton) John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Education (Mr. Bruton)</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to indicate my appreciation of the remarks made by all four Deputies who spoke in supporting the appeal I made last week for a settlement of the dispute and a return to work by the drivers.  The Government and I share the concern of parents about the educational effects of the strike.  These effects will be more seriously felt by those children who are facing examinations in the very near future.</P>
      <P>It may help towards an understanding of the present difficulties if I outline the history of arrangements made by CIE with part-time school bus drivers.  Originally, when the free transport scheme was introduced, CIE negotiated individually with drivers to the exclusion of any trade union.  In February, 1971, the Labour Court recommended to CIE that it should in future admit the union's right to negotiate for these workers on a collective basis.  From then on claims were processed by the unions&mdash;mainly by the Federation of Rural Workers &mdash;with CIE.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The first claim by the union to be referred to the Labour Court was the subject of Court Recommendation No. 2594 of 5th December, 1971, which set the basic pay for school-bus drivers.  This settled their pay up to 20th February, 1972, and incorporated the 12th Round.  This settlement <Col N="646" /> was accepted by the Federation of Rural Workers and the Amalgamated Transport Workers' Union which represents some drivers in the Waterford area.  Since then, CIE implemented the 13th Round, 1st and 2nd phases, and the 14th Round, 1st phase for these drivers and the next increase under the national wage agreement will fall due on 1st July, 1974.  Following the Labour Court recommendation of 5th December, 1971, the Federation of Rural Workers referred a further wage claim to the Labour Court in 1972.  This claim was turned down by the court in Recommendation No. 2859 of the 6th December, 1972.  The union referred a further claim to the court in 1973 concerning CIE's application of the national wage rounds.  In its report of 11th September, 1973, the court upheld CIE's method of applying these rounds. In January, 1974, the Federation of Rural Workers lodged a claim with the Labour Court seeking, <i>inter alia</i>, parity with regular full-time bus drivers.  The court, having considered all the evidence as submitted, did not recommend the grant of the claim.</P>
    <P>While the latter claim was still with the Labour Court, some of the drivers decided to take strike action.  This strike was, and is, unofficial and is supported by only half of the drivers in this category although I appreciate that there are some counties where it is supported by almost all the drivers. As I said in reply to Deputy O'Leary's question on 25th April, the wages and conditions of these drivers are within the ambit of the national wage agreement, and that is something which needs to be reiterated, which provides machinery under clause 27 whereby disputes as to its interpretation may be resolved.  This machinery has not been utilised, as yet.</P>
    <P>I cannot emphasise too strongly that this is an unofficial strike and that it is a general and long standing principle of industrial relations, accepted by both sides, that unofficial strikes be neither condoned nor encouraged. Negotiations are therefore inhibited as long as the unofficial strike continues.  If the drivers returned to work, the conciliation services <Col N="647" /> of the Labour Court could be brought into effect, but while the unofficial strike continues there is nothing either my Department or the Labour Court can do.  I would appeal to the drivers who are still on strike to return to work and avail of the Labour Court conciliation services for a settlement of their grievances.  The strike has serious consequences for large numbers of children and is particularly serious for those taking examinations this year.  Nothing is to be gained by unofficial action of this sort and it is particularly unfortunate in this case because of its effects on the children who will shortly have to face terminal examinations.</P>
    <P>I should also like to point out that this dispute is between a category of CIE employees and their employer, CIE.  As Deputy O'Leary rightly pointed out, the Department of Education are not directly involved. This is an unofficial strike.  The workers concerned come within the ambit of the national wage agreement.  Their conditions have been the subject of successive Labour Court recommendations.  Their conditions have implications of course for other categories of workers within CIE.  I think I need say no more than that for the Deputies opposite to appreciate the implications therein. Their position under the national wage agreement has implications for all workers who are equally bound by the terms of the wage agreement.</P>
    <P>As I said, I am and have been in close contact with CIE in relation to this dispute and share the Deputies' concern in the matter.  Deputy Gallagher alleged that there were some cases, to his knowledge, where children found that they were not welcome on public transport.  I am very concerned about this and would appreciate it if he could supply me with details giving, as far as feasible, dates and routes.  I will then take the matter up with CIE.</P>
    <P>I thank the Deputies for raising this matter and again giving me an opportunity of appealing to those who are on unofficial strike to get back to work.  Then, normal negotiations can continue to the fullest extent.</P>

      <P>There are two categories of payment.  There are continuous overheads, which are inevitable because the buses continue to be there and need to be maintained.  We make those payments.  We do not pay what might be called &ldquo;current costs&rdquo; which would relate to buses only where they are actually rolling.  In other words, while we pay certain minimum overheads to keep the buses in existence, we do not pay any running costs if the buses are not running.</P>
