      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Hara</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Industry and Commerce if he is aware that a firm in Belfast finds it economical to send a fleet of lorries from <Col N="684" /> Belfast to collect the carcases of sharks landed at Purteen Harbour, Achill; and, if so, if he will consider setting up a factory for processing these carcases for producing fish meal, etc., and thereby give much needed employment to this Gaeltacht area.</P>

      <P>I am not in a position to express any opinion on the economics of the arrangements made by the firm in question for the collection of the carcases of sharks landed at Achill. A factory which has been built in County Galway by private interests for the processing of animal and fish material into feeding stuffs and fertilisers, will, I understand, be in production within the next two months. Other proposals relating to this industry have also been submitted to my Department but I cannot, at this stage, state whether they may proceed.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Industry and Commerce if he is aware that bog workers in the various bogs in Mayo are not satisfied with their present rates of pay and are migrating in large numbers to England where conditions generally are more satisfactory; and, if so, if he is prepared to recommend to Bord na Móna that substantial increases be given.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not aware that the position regarding bog workers employed by Bord na Móna is as stated by the Deputy.  As I informed the Deputy on 17th July, 1952, in reply to another question of the same kind, I have no function in the determination of the rates of wages and conditions of employment of workers employed by Bord na Móna.  I understand that the board's wage rates are standardised throughout the country and that there is no difference between the rates paid in Mayo and elsewhere.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>It could be done.  The Deputy should, perhaps, realise that one of the difficulties in getting this project started in Ballina is that it has become a matter of political controversy.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>One year ago the position was the project had been approved and that a grant of £70,000 by Foras Tionscail had been allocated.  The plans were proceeding.  They had reached the stage where architect's designs for the factory premises had been completed and I understand tenders for the construction of the <Col N="687" /> premises were being invited when one of the parties to the project decided to withdraw.  It is now necessary to reconstitute the project and I am hopeful that will be done, but it will help considerably if Deputies will stop trying to make political capital out of it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice (Mr. Boland)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move:&mdash;</P>
      <P>That the Dáil hereby approves of the Garda Síochána Pensions Order, 1953, made on the 1st day of July, 1953, by the Minister for Justice, with the sanction of the Minister for Finance, under Section 13 of the Police Forces Amalgamation Act, 1925, and laid before the Dáil on the 18th July, 1953.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="700" /> The Garda Síochána Pensions Order, 1953, which I am asking the House to approve contains three amendments to the existing pensions Orders.  The memorandum I circulated will explain what they are.  The first is to remedy an omission in the Dublin Metropolitan Police Pensions Order, 1922, to provide that time spent in the Civil Service by a particular officer will be counted for pension purposes.  The second one is to enable pensions to be awarded in certain cases by the Minister for Justice without reference to the Minister for Finance.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>The third is to enable members of the Garda Síochána who are over 60 years of age to opt for the new terms under the new Pensions Act whereby they can get a gratuity on retirement.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanCollins" hpid="Mr. S. Collins Mr. S. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>One thing puzzles me in connection with this Order.  What exactly is the significance of the change proposed from 62 to 60?  Paragraph 1 of article 5 of the Garda Síochána Pensions Order is hereby amended by the substitution in clause 3 of the subparagraph of the word sixty-two for sixty.  What does that cover?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>Members of the Garda Síochána are supposed to retire at 60 years of age.  In a few cases they were allowed to remain over that age and up to this they could not opt for the new terms under the new pensions scheme that was brought in enabling them to get a gratuity when they have passed the age of 60.  This is to enable them to do so up to the age of 62.</P>

    <Col N="701" />
    <Speaker pid="SeanMoylan" hpid="Minister for Education (Mr. Moylan) Seán Moylan">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Education (Mr. Moylan)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move:&mdash;</P>
      <P>That the National School Teachers' Superannuation (Amendment) Scheme, 1953, made by the Minister for Education, with the consent of the Minister for Finance, be confirmed.</P>
      <P>The purpose of this Resolution is to implement an agreement made at conciliation level with the national teachers, which arranges that pension rights in future are based on the final year's salary rather than on the average of the three final years' salary, as before.  The other main item in the Resolution is to give statutory effect to the payment of the gratuity to those who retired before January, 1950.</P>
      <P>Paragraph 9 is merely a book-keeping transaction.  Paragraph 6 is intended to bring the present proposals into line with the main statutory proposals. With regard to paragraphs 7 and 8, we find that it is desirable that a teacher who has retired and has come back, after a long period, to teach, should have his service previous to retiral qualify for a pension.  That will not affect any teachers who have retired before now and have come back but it will affect those who return to teaching after this proposal goes through.  In general, it affects very, very few people.</P>
      <P>Paragraphs 10 and 11 are really to include certain teachers in the scheme who would be excluded otherwise. There really is nothing contentious in the matter.  I think it can be agreed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichardJamesMulcahy" hpid="General Mulcahy General Mulcahy">
      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>It would be desirable to mention just one point as we pass this Resolution, that is, with regard to the payment that is proposed to be made to those teachers who retired prior to the 1st January, 1950. The Minister is to be congratulated on squeezing this additional grant for teachers who retired before the 1st January, 1950, out of the Minister for <Col N="702" /> Finance.  It is undersirable, I suppose, that you have these great changes in the conditions that affect teachers or that affect any other class of official simply because something happened on a particular date.  The Minister has indicated that he will not be able to pay this grant in one sum to the people affected.  The suggestion is that it will be paid in three annual instalments. The sum of money involved is £400,000. The Minister indicates that this is such a large sum it would not be possible to pay it all at once and, therefore, one-third is to be paid this year, one-third next year, and one-third the following year.  The resources and the credit of the State should be great enough to be able to pay this money to the teachers involved straight away.  Once the concession is being given, I have hesitated to press as to why it is not possible to have it paid now in one payment, when we consider the amount of money that can be made available for purposes that are less poignant in many aspects than the purpose of paying this grant to retired teachers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister is very well aware of the circumstances in which many teachers retire.  Their emoluments are not very great and, in the case of married teachers, the Minister is aware that marriage among teachers is very often a late marriage and teachers may find themselves retiring at 65 years of age with a family at a rather difficult stage, with young people at the tail end of their educational course and not yet in a position of earning.  These teachers on retiring find themselves in a very difficult position.  Many of the teachers who retired at that particular time retired in rather difficult family circumstances.  I have hesitated to put down a question asking the Minister how many of the teachers involved are likely to die this year, how many are likely to die next year and how many are likely to die the following year. There is the aspect, apart altogether from their circumstances, that the Government, once they have made up their minds to pay the grant, ought to be able to make up their minds to pay it in full, realising the circumstances in which these teachers retired, and particularly the difficulties in which <Col N="703" /> people with any kind of family responsibilities find themselves.</P>
    <P>I do not know whether there is anything in this scheme which would bind the Minister not to pay the amount in a lump sum after further consideration, but it would be a pity if the Minister by his attitude or statement to-day would tie his hands in the matter.  I am sure he appreciates the situation and that he will do everything he can to press that matter.  I am sure he will have the support of every side of the House in pressing the Minister for Finance to accede to any appeal he will make to that Minister to secure that this comparatively small sum of money will be paid in one lump sum.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LiamCunningham" hpid="Mr. Cunningham Mr. Cunningham">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cunningham</NameTxt>
      <P>I should also like to impress on the Minister the desirability of making this <i>ex gratia</i> payment in one lump sum.  A number of the ex-teachers will receive their total gratuity in lump sum, namely those whose total gratuity will be under £50. It would be a very small step to go the whole distance.  As a matter of fact, it would be less expensive for the Department to pay the gratuity in one sum to the remaining teachers who are entitled to it.  It would involve less clerical work in the Department and therefore would be less expensive for the Department.  It is not necessary to say that it would be a very great boon to these people who retired three years ago and who are still waiting for this sum of money to help them pay off commitments they entered into on the strength of this gratuity.  I urge the Minister very strongly to consider that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PeadarCowan" hpid="Captain Cowan Captain Cowan">
      <NameTxt>Captain Cowan</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to add my voice to the recommendation that there should be immediate payment of this gratuity.  Several people who will be affected have asked me to make that recommendation and I certainly would like to support the recommendation made.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. A. Byrne Mr. A. Byrne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. A. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>I raised this matter several times in the Dáil and I join with my colleagues in asking the Minister to pay the amount in one sum and <Col N="704" /> to do it quickly.  These teachers entered into commitments which were brought to the notice of every Deputy within the last year or so.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanCollins" hpid="Mr. S. Collins Mr. S. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>I think the Minister can take it that the House is unanimously behind him if it is possible to succeed in paying this gratuity in one sum.  There may be a case made on the basis of economic exigencies so far as the Government are concerned at the moment, but I would press the Minister to take the line suggested by Deputy Mulcahy and not tie his hands or bind himself in any way in advance. The Government have decided to pay this sum and perhaps we should leave it in this way: that we urge on the Minister in a unanimous way to try to get the Government to consider paying it as expeditiously as possible.  It may not be possible for it to be paid in one sum, but it might be practicable for the Minister to have the whole matter cleared up in two payments. There is general satisfaction on all sides of the House that the money is being made available and our main anxiety now is to make it available with the best possible grace to the recipients. The Minister should consider the unanimous commendation of the action he has taken and the unanimous pressure for the completion of this <i>ex gratia</i> payment as quickly as possible.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickJBurke" hpid="Mr. Burke Mr. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>I compliment the Minister on honouring his word to the retired teachers.  I welcome this scheme and I want to say that the steps which the Minister is taking to make this payment to the retired teachers are in accordance with their wishes.  During the time they had been making representations to me and to other Deputies they made the point that the payment should be spread over a period of three years.  While I appreciate the views of other Deputies that they would like to get it all together, I want to be fair to the Minister and say that he is definitely carrying out the wishes and desires of the people concerned when they were making representations. Some of them may have changed their minds afterwards, but on behalf of the people who made the representations I want to thank the Minister.</P>

      <P>It is most pleasant to find this spirit of unanimity in the House this evening.  I trust we will continue that for the remainder of the session.  Deputy Mulcahy has made a very plausible plea on behalf of the people concerned.  I am fully conversant with the difficulties of many of them, but Deputy Mulcahy, like myself, has had difficulties with Ministers for Finance before.  It is not always easy to persuade those who watch the Treasury to disgorge.  However, this Resolution does not contain anything that binds my hands in relation to payment.  Section 6 (a) of No.  11 says:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;An <i>ex gratia</i> grant shall be paid in such a manner as the Minister, with the consent of the Minister for Finance, may direct.&rdquo;</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanCollins" hpid="Mr. S. Collins Mr. S. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>We have no desire at this stage to delay the passage of this Bill.  It can be fairly said that with the co-operation of the House and the cooperation of the Minister it has emerged from Committee a well improved measure from the time of its initiation in the House.  I feel that it is right that we should have a certain sense of pride in the unanimity and the general approach of the House on this measure.  I have no hesitation in saying: &ldquo;Well done&rdquo; to the Minister for the various improvements he has been able to effect.  As I have said before on Bills of this nature, it is only right and proper that we should try to co-operate with the Minister to get this type of legislation through the House as expeditiously as possible so that we will not in any way delay the benefits that may flow to a needy section of the community.  We can all say, as we will inevitably, that this is not the best Bill, but at least let us be honest and say it is a very substantial instalment going towards meeting some of the long outstanding claims.  I feel that this Government with a Minister who has the sympathetic view towards this problem which the present occupant of that office has, had to be limited in the scope of this Bill.  He has done very well within the walls of what he was able to wrest from the Department of Finance, and the regret I have is that somebody who has in his own personal view such a wealth of sympathy towards this problem was forced into that position at the finish. As the Minister himself said in the course of the debate, this is not likely to be the last Bill of the kind.  Most probably either the Minister or whoever may succeed him may be forced into bringing in other instalments.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think that generally speaking there will be a good deal of welcome in particular for the last amendment which the Minister has moved which was initially advocated on the Committee Stage by Deputy Captain Cowan. <Col N="709" /> People who have to undergo treatment in St. Bricin's and have to spend that period away from their employment or from their home will appreciate this Act.  I can say honestly on the Final Stage of this Bill that I regret myself very considerably that we have to have a succession of these measures.  I would like to see, as was suggested by both myself and, I think, Deputy Cowan during the course of this debate, some kind of committee sitting down in the unanimity of spirit that exists and the will to do the best we can for all these people, particularly a committee charged with the job of finding a final settlement for these people, because I do not like to feel that any organisation of people who have served this country in the way that the people did in that particular period should be forced to come constantly after politicians of all descriptions and all persuasions to try to find an airing for their grievances.  It has not been possible to do it in this Act, but I think there is a tremendous number of people who are going to be immensely grateful for this instalment. My earnest hope is that as this Bill goes on to the Statute Book the way is cleared to obviate and finally settle outstanding differences so that before such time as they may be called from this land to their new home we may be able to deal with any problems that still remain unsettled where that particular generation that I like to style the generation of achievement is concerned.</P>

      <P>I think it is only right that in a Bill such as this where the Minister has met the House in the way he has met it we should avail of the Final Stage to pay a well-deserved tribute to the Minister, even on the amendments he has introduced to-day which have been accepted by the Dáil.  They were amendments of importance suggested to him on the last stage of the Bill and the Minister, in the course of the few days which he had at his disposal, accepted those amendments.  I think that everyone can say that as far as this Bill is concerned it is a Bill that has the unanimous support of Dáil Eireann and that as far as the recipients are concerned they should realise that what has been passed into law now has been passed unanimously by Dáil Éireann at the instance of the Minister for Defence.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>During the Second Stage and the Committee Stage I mentioned, as did Deputy Collins and other Deputies, the matter of the suggested committee to look into these Army Pensions Acts. As the Minister knows and as the House knows, they are very difficult and complicated and there are, undoubtedly, within the Dáil Deputies who have excellent knowledge of these Bills and knowledge of the difficulties and obstacles that are in the way, perhaps, of applicants.  They are <Col N="711" /> aware also of certain anomalies that have grown up in the legislation itself. I think the Minister would be happy to have the assistance of a committee of Deputies who would examine all this Army pensions legislation and would make recommendations to him to remove the anomalies that have been mentioned from time to time during the course of the debates. That committee could suggest codification and I think in the long run it would be a great help to the Minister as well as to the people who should benefit under the Acts.  I hope that when the Dáil reassembles after the recess, early steps will be taken by the Minister to get such a committee going.</P>
    <P>I want to say a couple of words on behalf of a special section.  Those are the widows and the children of deceased officers of the Defence Forces who are entitled because of the Defence Forces legislation to pensions because of the lenght of service of their husbands in the Defence Forces. There is not a very large number of those widows, but the surprising thing about them is that nearly every family and every widow has a pension almost peculiar to herself or to her own family.  This is another one of those cases in which anomalies have grown up because of ranks and because of date of death and a number of matters of that kind.  Those persons concerned have come together to examine their own position and they are now in a position to make certain recommendations to the Minister. The Minister has very kindly indicated that he is willing and anxious to meet them at any time.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Traynor</NameTxt>
      <P>On my side, I want to thank the House for the manner in which, right from the beginning, they have approached the examination of this Bill.  I must certainly admit that the discussions which took place and the suggestions which were made, in the main, won my sympathy.  I could see where, perhaps, it was a question of three, four or five heads being better than one or two.  By reason of the suggestions made, and the examinations which I had carried out following these suggestions, it was possible to produce the amendments. I must say, however, in fairness to the Minister for Finance, that when I approached him &mdash; and I approached him not all at once: I had to approach him on two or, perhaps, three occasions and more or less harried a man who was himself as full of business as one could be and who was, to some extent, rather worried about his own difficulties&mdash;he met me in the fairest possible manner.  It is only right to say that the amendments were produced as a result of discussion with him and agreement by him to the recommendations which I made.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I thank the House again for the manner in which they approached this whole problem.  I feel certain that it will act as an example of feeling towards the people who will benefit as a result of the Bill and that the Seanad, when I bring the Bill before them, will deal with it in the same expeditious manner in which this House has dealt with it.  If that is <Col N="713" /> possible, I can see a large number of people benefiting almost immediately from the provisions of the Bill.  I must say that, for myself, I think that the most deserving type of persons who will benefit are the widows, who have been very hard hit, the disabled men and the people who have been awarded special allowances.  These are the people who, in my opinion, at the present moment need help most and they will get it through this Bill.  The House has done everything possible to expedite the securing of whatever awards will be available to these people.  On their behalf, as well as on my own behalf and on behalf of the Government, I want to thank the House for the manner in which they received this measure.</P>

    <Title>Workmen's Compensation (Amendment) Bill, 1953&mdash;Second Stage.</Title>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Minister for Social Welfare (Dr. Ryan) James Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Social Welfare (Dr. Ryan)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move that this Bill be now read a Second Time.  The main object of the Bill is to supplement the compensation payable to injured workmen who are married or who are widowers with children.  This will be achieved by the payment in a case of total incapacity of an additional amount of 12/- a week in respect of a wife and 7/ a week in respect of each of two children with suitable proportions in the case of partial incapacity.  In so providing for dependents the Bill follows the practice under the Social Welfare Act, 1952, in the case of disability benefit and unemployment benefit.  The liability under the Bill will, however, fall entirely on the employer. State funds are not involved except to the extent that the State is itself an employer.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The rate of compensation for cases of total incapacity is, at present, restricted to 75 per cent.  of pre-accident earnings, with a maximum of 50/- a week, so that a married man with a wife and two or more eligible <Col N="714" /> children will, as from an appointed day, become entitled to 76/- a week, provided that this amount is not more than 75 per cent.  of his pre-accident earnings.  A man with a wife only will receive 62/- and with a wife and one child 69/-.  Where the workman is a widower with a child he will receive 57/- and with two or more children 64/-.  Deputies will remember that the basic rate of disability benefit under the Social Welfare Act is 24/- and that a man with a dependent wife and two or more children receives 50/- a week.</P>
    <P>I had hoped that it might be feasible to have a greater measure of uniformity with the Social Welfare arrangements by applying to this scheme the definitions of wife and child in the Social Welfare Act but there are a number of objections to doing this.  Accordingly, the limiting age for children will be 15 as is the case for juvenile dependents at present under the Workmen's Compensation Acts.  Again, the supplemental allowances, as they are described, will be payable only in respect of wives and children who were alive at the time of the accident, but they will, of course, be payable as from the appointed day in current cases.</P>
    <P>The Bill also provides for increasing the compensation payable in fatal cases.  Such compensation takes the form of lump sums and the amounts have remained unchanged since 1934. The provisions of the Bill are designed broadly to double the amounts payable. The scheme of benefits is rather complex varying with the degree of dependence and with the number and ages of juvenile dependents, but it will suffice to say that:</P>
    <P>(i) where the workman leaves an adult who was wholly dependent on his earnings the minimum lump sum will be £400 instead of £200 and the maximum £600 instead of £300.</P>
    <P>(ii) where the workman leaves a juvenile or juveniles who were wholly dependent on his earnings the amounts of the children's lump sums will be doubled, the minimum being £400 instead of £200 and the maximum £1,200 instead of £600 and</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="715" /> (iii) where the workman leaves both adult and juvenile dependents the maximum amount of the aggregate of the lump sums will be £1,200 instead of £600.</P>
    <P>A further clause in the Bill deals with non-manual workers.  At present, such workers earning more than £500 a year are excluded from the scope of the Workmen's Compensation Acts and it is proposed to increase this figure to £600, thus bringing it into line with the scope provisions of the Social Welfare Act, 1952.</P>
    <P>I have also included a provision to remove a hardship to injured workmen which came to light recently.  In certain circumstances a workman may consider he has grounds for a common law action for damages against his employer, but the Act requires him to make a choice between workmen's compensation and claiming damages. Some workmen may accept payments of compensation before deciding to take proceedings but if they do they are debarred&mdash;by recent court decision &mdash;from subsequently taking the proceedings. Clause 6 of this Bill provides that acceptance of compensation will no longer be a barrier to succeeding in an action for damages, but a time limit is imposed within which the action for damages must be commenced and provision is also made so that the employer will not have to pay twice over in respect of the same injury.</P>
    <P>The other provisions of the Bill are consequential, or of minor importance.</P>
    <P>I am aware that there are other defects in the present scheme of workmen's compensation, but in this short Bill I have made what I consider to be the most important amendments, namely, giving increased compensation to those in greatest need of it.  There is already a considerable difference between the rates of weekly payment for single persons under the workmen's compensation scheme and the social welfare scheme, and I do not feel justified in widening the gap further, particularly as to do so, would add to the difficulties of introducing in due course a social scheme for industrial injuries.  The latter problem has been engaging the attention of my <Col N="716" /> Department for some time but, in view of the multitude and complexity of the issues involved and indeed of their importance, I am not yet in a position to indicate when a decision will be taken on the matter.</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. O'Higgins Mr. O'Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputies will appreciate that this Bill has been introduced by the Minister by reason of the Private Members Bill proposed by Deputy Norton some months ago. The discussion on that Bill was availed of by the Minister to give an undertaking to the House to introduce some reform in workmen's compensation within some months.  The Bill, of course, differs radically from the Bill put forward by Deputy Norton.  The Minister does not propose to increase workmen's compensation as such, though he does adopt other suggestions in that Bill introduced by Deputy Norton.  The Minister's proposal is to maintain compensation at its existing level, but to supplement it in accordance with the family circumstances of the injured workman by the provision of dependent allowances and an allowance in respect of a wife.  It is a matter about which I am sure there will be a difference of opinion in the House&mdash; as to whether it would be better to do as Deputy Norton's Bill suggested, to increase the compensation to a figure, I think, of 90/- a week or to do as the Minister suggests, to maintain compensation at its existing level but to introduce a new feature, namely, provision for dependent allowances.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should like to make it clear that we welcome any step that will improve the condition of an injured workman. We are inclined in this House, in our social legislation, to pay scant attention to statute law which merely creates rights or regulates affairs between citizens.  From time to time in the past we have been too busy with the paternal side of the State's work and have paid far too little attention to social legislation of this kind, where the State itself is not the dispenser of the service, but merely creates statutory rights which may confer a benefit on certain sections of the community. As I and other Deputies have <Col N="717" /> pointed out before in connection with workmen's compensation, we have always lagged far behind wage standards in relation to the compensation which we consider a workman should obtain.</P>
    <P>It will be recollected that the first Workmen's Compensation Act, the Act of 1906, did not undergo any amendment for some 15 or 18 years and that another period of some 12 or 14 years passed before the 1934 Workmen's Compensation Act was introduced. Again, from 1934 until some years after the commencement of the war, there was another long gap before a slight increase in workmen's compensation was provided, an increase to £1 17s. 6d. A number of years then had to pass, although wages were rising all the time, before Deputy Norton, in the Workmen's Compensation Act of 1948, provided for the present level of compensation of 50/- per week.  Now, some five years later, we are again seeing in what way compensation can be brought more in accordance with wage levels and the Minister proposes to do it in this way, by providing for dependent allowances and a payment in respect of a wife.  In so far as there is an increase in the compensation payable to an injured workman who is a married man, I think the Bill is a good one, but it does leave aside the question of the single man who is injured.  That is a very serious gap. However, I do not think there is any Deputy who would oppose the principle contained in the Bill.  From my own point of view, I should like to see it go a little further.</P>
    <P>I do not know whether it is a matter of policy or not, but the definition of a child in Section 3, the section which provides for these payments in respect of children and in respect of a wife is something which should be noted.  It provides that the child in respect of whom the benefit is to be paid must be a child born within nine months of the accident.  Obviously, that nine months' period may not be a correct period of time, but I suppose that is a matter that can be dealt with later; but is it the policy of the Government that a workman who may be a young married man and who may <Col N="718" /> suffer a very serious injury, making it impossible for him again to indulge in gainful employment, is not entitled to have a family or increase his family and obtain a dependent allowance in respect of any new child?  It appears to me that it is illogical to hold that point of view.  If we are going to provide that weekly compensation must be increased by reason of the family circumstances of the injured workmen, I do not think there should be any date from which children born to that workman should be excluded. I cannot understand why that restriction should be imposed in the section and I would urge the Minister to change it.</P>
    <P>Another matter of detail that I would like to mention is in connection with Section 6.  The question of workmen who up to this have accepted workmen's compensation and have found by doing so they had opted to forgo their common law rights has been a matter which has caused dismay to social workers, to lawyers, who are the greatest social workers in the country, and to Deputies in this House for some time back.  That particular rule, which grew up as a result of judicial decisions in England, has worked considerable hardship.  Deputy Norton very properly raised the matter in his Bill some months ago and sought to do roughly what the Minister is now doing in this Bill.</P>
    <P>I think that is a welcome reform of the Workmen's Compensation Acts and one that must have been inevitable but I would like to know, when we provide that a workman who accepts compensation shall not be deprived of his right to civil damages, why we seek to impose a time limit in which he is to take proceedings.  If the workman is to continue to have the common law rights to sue for damages in a civil court which he had before these Workmen's Compensation Acts were put on the Statute Book, why should we now, when we are giving him back some of his rights, only give him back portion of them as is done in effect here?</P>
    <P>For instance, if the workman is injured by reason of the negligence and culpable fault of his employer, why <Col N="719" /> should he merely have 12 months in which to take action for damages?  I know that the 12 months only apply where he has accepted compensation. I do not see the reason for that kind of time limit.  It has become the habit now&mdash;I think it is a bad habit&mdash;in the draftsman's office in all Parliaments in connection with Bill of this kind automatically to put in a time limit.  There is no sense in it.  The common law already has a time limit for most actions of tort up to four and six years. I do not see why an injured workman should be worse off than any other person who might be injured by negligence. I should like to hear the Minister in reply telling us the reasons which urged him to include a time limit in Section 6.</P>
    <P>There is only one other matter I would like to mention.  I want to say a word in favour of the much maligned doctor under the Workmen's Compensation Act of 1934, the medical adviser of the workmen.  The whole workmen's compensation legislation is based on the theory that an applicant has medical advice and assistance available to him.  An applicant or a workman who may have sustained an injury the care and treatment of which might go on over a period of years has to depend on the skill, at times on the indulgence and, above all, on the good nature of his medical adviser to see him through any court proceedings that may be necessary in order to secure compensation for him.</P>
    <P>I and other lawyer Deputies are aware of cases of workmen's compensation where quite a long period has elapsed between the acceptance and the eventual award of compensation and during all that period the workman's doctor gives his services free. When eventually compensation comes to be awarded to that workman&mdash;we need not shut our eyes to the fact that in 99 cases out of 100 it is an award against an insurance company&mdash;the only fee that can be paid to a doctor is a fee not exceeding £5.  That fee may have been considered an adequate one in 1934.  I do not know.  But I do not think anyone would suggest now, some 20 years later, that a fee <Col N="720" /> of £5 is an adequate fee for the care and attention that many of these doctors give to injured workmen.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PeadarCowan" hpid="Captain Cowan Captain Cowan">
      <NameTxt>Captain Cowan</NameTxt>
      <P>He only gets it if there is a court case once or if there is agreement.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. O'Higgins Mr. O'Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>That is so.  In fact, Deputy Cowan reminds me that it may happen&mdash;it does, in fact, happen&mdash;that in cases where an award of compensation is given the judge, on the application of the doctor&mdash;apparently it must be under the section&mdash;awards a sum of £5.  The employer or the insurance company possibly terminates that man's compensation in a month or two and brings about reversal proceedings under the Workmen's Compensation Act of 1934; in other words, a rehearing, more evidence and another judicial determination by the Circuit Court judge.  There cannot be a second fee of £5.  Having awarded the one fee of £5, the Circuit Court judge is <i>functus officio.</i>  For that reason I would urge upon the Minister to avail of this Bill to at least double that small fee of £5.  If he is not prepared to do it now, perhaps, he might consider an amendment which will be tabled on the Committee Stage to bring about that purpose.</P>
      <P>Those are the matters I wanted to mention.  Generally, the Bill is a welcome one but I think there are certain defects in it with regard to the single workmen and the other matters of detail which I have mentioned.  In so far as an increase is given to injured workmen who are really amongst the distressed sections of our community, the Bill has my wholehearted support.</P>

      <P>In so far as this Bill confers benefits on injured workmen, we are whole-heartedly in favour of it but I was disappointed that the Minister was not able to give some more information as to what he has in mind in respect of a national injuries code. I do not want to underestimate the complexities of evolving a national injuries code, particularly if that has to be done by advertence to our social welfare code.  I think it would have <Col N="721" /> been helpful to the House, when discussing this Bill, if we had got from the Minister some idea as to his intention so far as a permanent national injuries code was concerned, because one has got to view this Bill not merely so far as its contents are concerned but also against the background of whatever ultimate legislation will represent our permanent code in the matter of providing compensation for injured workmen.  We do not regard the present workmen's compensation as adequate or satisfactory.  In fact it never was satisfactory.  It was originally offered to the people of these islands as a simple way of enabling an injured workman to secure compensation when he met with an accident in the course of, or arising out of, his employment, but in fact it proved a particularly difficult Act.  It has probably been responsible for more court cases than any other single Act. Even to-day if you were to ask the lawyers, or even a judge who had dealt with workmen's compensation claims, you would find that the law is still by no means clear, although the original parent Act dates from 1906. The difficulty so far as injured workers are concerned is that the law is too technical for them.  It is far too costly for them as well, not only on the legal side but particularly on the professional side, where in order to assert their rights they have to equip themselves with very costly professional assistance.  Otherwise they are at a disadvantage so far as the employer or really the insurance company is concerned. The vast resources of the insurance companies are such that the insured workman is at a disadvantage in presenting his case under the present complicated legal code for determining claims for workmen's compensation.  There should be a speedy method of enabling workmen to secure not only compensation in cases of total or partial incapacity, but a speedy way also of securing compensation where the injured workman leaves a wife or children or other dependents. But nobody will pretend to believe that the present Workmen's Compensation Act provides workers with the easy access to these remedies which the Legislature should give in its <Col N="722" /> efforts to evolve a Workmen's Compensation Act.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Quite frankly, I would prefer to see this whole question of national injuries taken over by the State and administered by the State.  I do not think it is a matter for private insurance at all, and I am not satisfied that so far as the handling of this matter by private insurance companies is concerned that that handling is in the interests of the workers.  A private insurance company goes into business to make profits for the shareholders.  Its object is to have an annual dividend.  Its aim is to make sure that in passing out claims and benefits there will be a surplus to be utilised for the payment of dividends. I do not at this stage refer to the moral aspect of the case.  That is their outlook and they are quite entitled to it.  I am looking at it from a different point of view.  The question of insuring workmen and ensuring that they are fairly treated when they meet with accidents arising out of or in the course of employment ought not to be a matter around which dividends sprout for investors and insurance companies. I know no better way in which this matter could be dealt with more adequately or satisfactorily than by the State taking over the complete scheme of national insurance and running it on a non-profit basis.  I think an examination of the accounts of insurance companies in this field will show that out of every £ they collect in insurance premiums or contributions, not 10/-goes back to the insured workman.  I think statistics which I examined some years ago showed that the injured workman gets less in benefit than 50 per cent. of the premiums.  The rest is used up in administration costs, legal fees and medical fees, and in every way instead of paying a better rate of benefit to the injured workman.  If we have to choose between the desire of the insurance companies to hold on to workmen's compensation and keep it as one of their preserves, or the interests of the injured workers, I am all the time on their side, and we must evolve a scheme which will give them the best possible service and make sure that whatever is collected in premiums and contribution goes back in the main <Col N="723" /> to the alleviation of their difficulties and will not go for handling associated classes of business.</P>
    <P>People talk of the cost of administering a State scheme.  If the administrative costs of the Department of Social Welfare were put against the administrative costs of the insurance companies the comparison would definitely be in favour of the Department of Social Welfare.  It certainly could not but be more favourable than the administrative expenses of the private insurance company in relation to workmen's compensation business.</P>
    <P>I think a wide review of the whole compensation code is called for, but, of course, it is not possible to undertake that review in a limited measure of this kind, because it is merely a stop-gap measure.  Its purpose is to deal in the main with the improvement of compensation in certain cases in which death visits the injured workman and his family, and in the case of married workers who are suffering total incapacity.  The main purpose of the Bill is to provide, therefore, improved compensation in respect of death and improved compensation in respect of total incapacity where the workman is a married man or a widower with children.</P>
    <P>It would be no harm to look for a few moments at what exactly we are doing.  Under the 1934 Workmen's Compensation Act, we find that a workman was entitled to threequarters of his pay, if he met with an accident on duty or at work or arising out of his employment subject to a maximum of 30/- a week.  In 1943, under an Emergency Powers Order, that compensation was temporarily increased by 7/6 making it possible for the workman to receive 75 per cent. of his pre-accident earnings, but subject to a maximum of 37/6.  In the 1948 Act, the 37/6 was raised to 50/-, and then you had a situation in which the injured workman would be entitled to 75 per cent. of his pre-accident earnings subject to a maximum of 50/-.  I do not pretend to believe that that was very satisfactory.  It was an improvement on the previous position, but again it was only a temporary <Col N="724" /> measure intended to relieve the position of acute hardship at that time, and to step up the value of the 37/6 introduced temporarily in 1943, to something like the 1948 value of money.  I then contemplated that we should have a national insurance code, and I had hoped that that would be well on the way by now; that we would have something which in its general conception and in its functional approach to the problems of workmen's compensation would do something in a more satisfactory way for the injured workman than our present workmen's compensation really does.  In fact, we really have no workmen's compensation code of our own.  The 1934 Act is largely a copy of the British Act, and since then we have had no other major Workmen's Compensation Act so far as this country is concerned.</P>
    <P>What are we doing under this Bill? A change is proposed so far as total incapacity is concerned.  Where the workman is a married man with a wife and not less than two children, he will receive in future, instead of a total compensation of 50/- as at present, 12/- a week for his wife and 7/- a week for each of his two children making a total of 76/- per week instead of the 50/- now being paid but he will only get 76/- per week if that is 75 per cent. of his pre-accident earnings.  If he has a wife but no children, he will get an addition of only 12/- per week and if he has a wife and one child he will get 12/- plus 7/-.  At all events, his total compensation will be subject to a maximum of 76/- per week.  A single man, or a single woman who meets with an accident in the course of, or arising out of his or her employment, will not get one penny of an addition out of this Bill.  The maximum compensation remains the same for such persons&mdash;75 per cent. of their pre-accident earnings subject to a maximum of 50/-.  So that for the single workman or the single work woman, even those who are breadwinners for younger members of the family or who are maintaining an old father or an old mother, and who cannot because of that fact enter into matrimony, this Bill provides nothing. The maximum payment will still be 50/- <Col N="725" /> per week.  The Bill will provide no relief whatever for the single man or single woman no matter what age he or she may be, even though he or she may be maintaining younger brothers or sisters or maintaining aged parents. For them there is nothing in this Bill. The Bill leaves the position exactly as it is, in other words, exactly as it was in 1948.</P>
    <P>I do not want to make any political capital out of this Bill.  It is not a political question; it is a human question, a social question and I hope to elicit the support of Deputies of all Parties for doing something more than this Bill provides for these people. There is abundant scope in the Bill to improve the position of the injured workman or the injured work woman. It cannot be left in its present unsatisfactory position.  Look at what has happened since 1948.  There have been three rounds of wages increases since 1948.  In the first round of wage increases the average increase was about 11/- per week.  In the 1950-51 round, the average increase ranged from 10/- to 16/- per week.  In 1952-53, the average wage increase was about 12/6 or 13/- per week.  If you take the total average over the period from 1948 to 1953, you find that the average increase in wages in all, resulting from these rounds of wage increases, varied from about 34/- to 40/- per week.  That is the extent to which employers, the State and local authorities have measured the increase in the cost of living since 1948. It is the extent, in other words, to which money values have fallen since 1948.  If we are going to do something now in the way of improving the workmen's compensation code, how, in all reason, can we escape the moral responsibility of granting an increase on the 1948 standards, seeing that so far as wages are concerned, they have increased on the average, as the figures indicate, from 33/- to £2 per week.  Yet, in this Bill we propose to peg down the position of the single man or the single woman in industry to a maximum compensation related to 1948 standards, providing for not one penny increase to that injured <Col N="726" /> man or woman.  I put it to Deputies of all Parties that that is not a reasonable approach to the problem.</P>
    <P>If we have recognised that an amendment of our workmen's compensation code is necessary in order to give the injured workman some more compensation in 1953 than he was getting in 1948, surely we should not limit that increase to the married man?  In wage negotiations the increases granted have applied all round to married and single persons.  Yet in this workmen's compensation code we propose to say to the injured workman: &ldquo;If you have a wife and two children you will get 76/- compensation per week but if you have no wife or no children you will get no more in 1953 than you got in 1948.  It does not matter if you plead that you cannot marry or that you do not want to get married; the fact remains unless you have a wife and children, this Bill means nothing to you.  You have got to carry on in 1953 with the same scale of remuneration as far as compensation is concerned as you were getting in 1948.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The cost-of-living index figure in 1948 was 99; it is now 126.  In all reason, therefore, is there not a strong case for at least bringing the 1948 level of compensation up to the 1953 standard as a minimum?  I could argue for a substantial increase over and above the adjustment necessary arising out of the rise in the cost of living.  But is there not an undeniable case, at least, for adding 25 per cent. increase to the 1948 rates of compensation because of the fact that the cost of living has risen by not less than 25 per cent. since 1948?</P>
    <P>I think you can look at this whole question of compensation from an entirely different angle and I propose to do that for just a few minutes.  I do not think there is any economic or any moral justification for saying to the injured workman that there must be a ceiling to the compensation he gets and I do not know why it should remain there as a permanent feature of our legislation.  That has always seemed to me as something that had no real justification and the whole problem must be approached in an <Col N="727" /> entirely different way.  In a number of continental countries the injured workman may receive his full pay while he is suffering from an injury. In other cases he receives as compensation while injured a sum representing 60, 75 or 80 per cent. of his wages without any maximum.</P>
    <P>Under our code we say: &ldquo;You may have 75 per cent. of your wages,&rdquo; but we deny that man 75 per cent. of his wages because we stipulate that the maximum must be no more than 50/- Theoretically, if he has less than 60/- per week he can get 75 per cent. of his wages; if his wages are £4 per week he cannot get 75 per cent.; if his wages are £5, £6 or £7 per week he cannot get 75 per cent.  We say that the workman can get 75 per cent. of his wages, but we then put on a ceiling saying &ldquo;provided that 75 per cent. does not exceed 50/- per week.&rdquo;  By putting on that ceiling we prevent a man getting any more than 33? per cent.</P>
    <P>On the question as to whether one should pay more to a married man than to a single man I think the answer can be found by taking off the ceiling.  The Legislature cannot go into the domestic circumstances of the individual concerned, nor can the employer be expected to do that. Neither is it desirable that such an element should come into the calculation. The real remedy, therefore, is to go back to the old scheme&mdash;that is the present scheme&mdash;of stipulating that if a man is insured he will get 75 per cent. of his pre-accident wages. Any workman who is injured then in the course of his employment will know that he will get 75 per cent. of his pre-accident wages and the level of compensation will not be forced down through the introduction of this 50/- ceiling in the case of a single man and 76/- in the case of a married man irrespective of what family that married man has.  That would be a reasonable way of dealing with this matter.</P>
    <P>The average rate of pay in the crafts, skilled and semi-skilled employments to-day is £6, or £7 or £8 per week.  If a man earning £8 a week is injured, <Col N="728" /> under this Bill in its present form he should get 75 per cent. of that £8&mdash; that is £6&mdash;but, because of the imposition of this ceiling of 50/-, he will get no more than 50/-.  The married man, instead of getting 75 per cent. of £8 a week, will, because of the imposition of this ceiling, only get 76/- per week.  A more reasonable approach would be to remove the ceilings entirely so that the workman will know that he will receive a certain percentage of his pay and that that percentage will not be diminished by the introduction of this ceiling of 50/- in the case of a single man and 76/- in the case of a married man.</P>
    <P>I do not think it should prove impossible for insurance companies to devise an arrangement based on the payments of these amounts and no difficulty whatever would arise in providing a code of workman's compensation related to a precentage of wages without a ceiling. A strong case could be made for giving an injured workman his full pay.  In most European countries an injured workman does, in fact, receive his full pay.  To attempt to relate our workman's compensation code to our social welfare code at this stage will work out to the disadvantage of the injured workmen.  It is not unfair to tell industry that it should carry its casualties.  Since our social legislation by no means represents anything approaching perfection we will only achieve the marriage of workman's compensation to social welfare by putting those who previously benefited under an independent workman's compensation code at a disadvantage.  Up to now the pattern has been that industry must carry its own risks.  That is the pattern that obtains in many other countries.  It is only reasonable that we should follow it here.  There is sufficient justification for keeping this code separate from our social welfare code, and there is nothing to prevent each code being separate even though both are administered by the one Department.  It is time we made a radical step forward in this field and the best way in which to do that is by removing these ceilings since they only operate to the disadvantage of the injured workman.  The inadequacy of the <Col N="729" /> compensation which provides a ceiling of 76/- and 50/- respectively must be manifest to all.</P>
    <P>It is nothing short of a scandal that an injured workman has no remedy against an employer who has not insured.  The workman may take him to court and bankrupt him but that will not provide for the workman's family.  At present there is no remedy for that situation.  I do not know anyone more helpless than an injured workman trying to claim compensation from an employer who has not insured and whose assets are not such as to enable him to meet the impact of such a claim.</P>
    <P>There are considerable difficulties in relation to the question of compulsory insurance and I do not know in what way those difficulties can be resolved. At the same time, I do not think they are impossible of solution.  Some provision should be made&mdash;the practice is not unknown&mdash;whereby insurance companies would be obliged to yield up some portion of the premium income which they earn through workman's compensation policies and those moneys should be put into a fund to be administered in some way mutually agreed upon so that it might meet the impact of some of these bad cases where the injured workman is unable to sustain a claim for compensation against an employer, not because of the fault of the injured workman, but because of the fact, very often, that the employer is a man of straw and gets the protection of the court when faced with a claim for workmen's compensation.</P>
    <P>I think it should be possible to require the insurance companies to make a contribution to a fund of that kind so that there would be some possibility of meeting the claims of such persons.  I do not by any means suggest that it is the ideal scheme.  It is far from it, but it would be a far better scheme for workmen if they had an automatic right to benefit against an employer or against an insurance company or against the State until such time as a State administered <Col N="730" /> scheme comes in and is in actual operation. I think we are justified in asking the insurance companies to look at this question from the point of view of seeing the contribution they can make in dealing with cases of the kind that I have in mind.</P>
    <P>There are one or two points to which I should like to direct the attention of the Minister.  I think the law is unsatisfactory in this respect, although I realise that those with a more intimate knowledge of the law than I, happily, have, will be able to make perhaps a more expert contribution to the position.  The present position, with regard to average pre-accident earnings, is an extremely unsatisfactory one.  I understand the position to be that a number of judgments have been given on this matter so that nobody can say what really the law on the matter is.  The Act requires the judge, dealing with a case, to take into consideration the average earnings of the man over the previous 12 months. Very often, the man may have been unemployed for 11 months.  Then you take his average earnings for the three weeks he was employed.  If you begin to average out his earnings you find that his income for the previous 12 months was negligible.  In other cases, judges have taken the view that if a man was working on a job for a month you took the average for the month. There have been cases of a man going to work on a particular day, and meeting with an accident on that day.  His earnings for that day's work were accepted as complying with requirements of the statute.  In other words, his average pre-accident earnings were taken to be the day's pay he got for that particular day.</P>
    <P>There ought to be some clarification of the whole position.  I do not know that the case law on this matter has been sufficiently clarified.  I have discussed the matter with legal people who say to you: &ldquo;Well, it just depends; this view may be taken or that view may be taken.&rdquo;  I should like to see that matter put on a more satisfactory basis than it is at present. I think that what we might try to do for the purpose of ascertaining the average earnings of a man and of his entitlement to workmen's compensation <Col N="731" /> is to see what his wages were at the work he was engaged on in a particular week&mdash;to take that as the nearest known evidence of what his pay was and then relate his compensation to his earnings in that particular week.  If that is not acceptable, there is another method of finding out what would be his earnings, namely to take the earnings of a person in comparable employment in that particular area during the previous six or 12 months.</P>
    <P>If these were not satisfactory, then there should be some obligation put on the judge under our legislation to give the man X percentage of his earnings, leaving it to the judge to determine whether it was to be his earnings in that week, or that of a person in comparable employment on the same class of work in the nearest comparable district.  Anything could be better than the present situation, because one does not know what way exactly it will run.  I think, at any rate, there is room for an early improvement in our present workman's compensation code.</P>
    <P>There is another point I should like to refer to, and that is the question of instituting proceedings under the Workmen's Compensation Act.  The present position is that proceedings have to be instituted within six months.  That is not always very convenient from the point of view of the workman.  There may be long negotiations, or the man be ill.  There may be all sorts of delays, medical and legal, on both sides, and the six months may have elapsed before adequate consideration can be given to the case.  I know of no reason why the workman should be tied down to instituting proceedings within six months.  I think that, where we are dealing with the rights of workmen in these cases, we ought to give him a reasonable period of time.  Our attitude ought to be that we recognise that the injured workman is unskilled in law and unskilled in the procedural arrangements necessary in order to get his case heard in court.  I know of no justification for tying him down to a period of six months within which he must institute proceedings.  On the <Col N="732" /> Committee Stage of the Bill, I hope to put in an amendment, the purpose of which will be to open that door, and so give the injured workman a better opportunity of getting redress under the law than he has at the moment.</P>
    <P>These are some of the matters which have occurred to me in connection with the Bill.  It is not a Bill of principles.  It is really a machinery Bill, and one that probably will lend itself to closer discussion on the Committee Stage.  I hope, even if we have to sit next week, that we will get adequate time for putting in amendments for the Committee Stage, because this is a Bill of vital importance to workmen, particularly injured workmen, and so I hope that we will have an opportunity of having these amendments adequately discussed. If the Minister, when replying, would indicate that he has a receptive mind in regard to the suggestions which we have made, I hope that we may be able to get in our amendments quickly and have them accepted quickly.  In that event, a much better Bill will be sent out from the House than the one that has come into it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Captain Cowan</NameTxt>
      <P>What Deputy Norton has just said and what Deputy O'Higgins said earlier, indicates the tremendous difficulties that are in the way of legislation of this kind.  As I see this Bill and as I have looked at it from the beginning, it seems to me to be something in the nature of a temporary, or stop-gap arrangement, to provide an increase in compensation for a limited number of people who are married and have one, two or more children.  It seems to me, however, that the whole principle of workmen's compensation will have to be examined. I do not think it can be examined within the framework of this particular Bill.  Frankly, what I would like to see done is that the Minister would say that he was prepared to set up a parliamentary Committee representative of all Parties and views in the House to consider this matter of workmen's compensation, because it has been in existence for a long number of years.  It has been in existence here since the State was <Col N="733" /> founded.  We have had described already the steps by which it has been improved: by the Emergency Order which increased it from 30/- to 37/6, and by the provision made in 1948 when it was increased to 50/-.  Because of the altered value of money, there ought to be some improvement, some upward increase in compensation now. If the Minister were to indicate that he would accept the idea of a parliamentary Committee to examine into all the difficulties and to introduce legislation based on the report of that parliamentary Committee, this House could, possibly, without any difficulty, accept this Bill as it is, with some minor amendments, until such time as the parliamentary Committee had reported.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>At the moment, workmen's compensation is governed by insurance companies.  They administer the workmen's compensation code and they operate it.  Obviously, they operate the code in their own interests.  Personally, I must say that in any negotiations or discussions I have had with insurance companies, I found a reasonable approach to the problems but I know there have been cases in which the approach was absolutely unreasonable and unjust to the injured workman.  I am just wondering if this new idea of the payment of a marriage allowance and children's allowance, without more ado, would not result in pressure being brought to bear by way of increased premiums or otherwise by insurance companies to limit the employment of married people and married people with families.  That is a serious danger about which we must do something in this Bill.  Even if we are to accept it as a temporary expedient, there must be some clause put into it that no insurance company would be entitled to increase the premium for workmen's compensation because of the family circumstances of the worker.  That is vitally important because, if you leave it at large and if an insurance company has to pay more compensation to a married man and a married man with two or more children, obviously, the insurance company will require an increased premium and, if they require an increased <Col N="734" /> premium, the effect of that is to operate against the employment of married men.  That is a difficulty that I see.  It is a difficulty that we must meet in the Bill by making some provision whereby that power will not be operated by insurance companies to the detriment of the married man. That is a vital matter which must be covered in the Bill.</P>
    <P>I have always held the view that workmen's compensation should be taken over and administered by the Department of Social Welfare.  We will all have to face up to the situation that it is desirable and necessary that matters of injuries in the course of employment, matters of workmen's compensation, should be administered by the Department of Social Welfare.  The change over of the control and administration of workmen's compensation from insurance companies to the State is one of the matters that could be considered by the parliamentary Committee that I have mentioned.</P>
    <P>The basis of workmen's compensation at 75 per cent. of a man's earnings was, perhaps, reasonable enough at one stage.  I certainly would plump all the time for the principle that workmen's compensation should be the equivalent of a man's wages because if a man is injured and unable to fend for himself he has, in the ordinary way, the same responsibilities as if he were working and earning his weekly wage.  In actual fact the injured workman who has to provide medicines or some special food for himself requires something more than the equivalent of a week's wages to be in the same position as he would be if he were not injured.  Certainly, on general principles, under a State administered scheme, a person ought to receive while incapacitated as result of injury received during and in the course of his employment an amount equivalent to his weekly wage.</P>
    <P>Until that is done, I agree with the suggestion that the restriction or limitation to 50/- a week should be removed.  There is not much sense in telling a man who is earning £8 a week that he is entitled to 75 per cent. of his wages, which would be £6 a week, but that, because of the <Col N="735" /> operation of another clause, that is limited to 50/- a week.  There does not seem to be any sound principle behind that limitation of compensation to a sum of 50/- a week in the case of a single man or in the case of a man who has no family responsibilities.</P>
    <P>These are my views in regard to the general principle of this Bill.  The Bill prescribes an appointed day, the day that the Minister may say the Bill is to come into operation.  The Bill increases death benefits and compensation in the limited number of cases referred to in it.  The Bill should be redrafted. At least, that section should read that the Bill will become law on the day it is signed by the President, in the ordinary way, because, if there is a gap between the date that the President signs the Bill and the date that the Minister by Order appoints as the appointed day and if a fatal accident or serious injury occurs in the meantime the fact that there is that gap will cause grave hardship to the dependents of the deceased or to the workman himself.  There should be no appointed day so far as this Bill is concerned. It should become law the very minute it is signed by the President.</P>
    <P>I agree with what Deputy O'Higgins said with regard to a child.  There is a very dangerous implication in the section which says that a child is a child for the purposes of this Act if it is alive at the date of the injury or is born within nine months afterwards.  I am perfectly certain that the Minister has no intention of supporting the implication that is there.  I think that is a section which could be amended on the Committee Stage.</P>
    <P>Other points have been mentioned in regard to workmen's compensation which are really matters of principle. I would much prefer if these matters of principle were considered by the Committee I have mentioned.  As far as the Bill is concerned, it does provide certain benefits and, in so far as it confers these benefits, it has been welcomed.  I should like the Bill, in so far as it is conferring these benefits, to be passed into law as quickly as <Col N="736" /> possible.  The House could do that readily, provided certain important points of detail are dealt with. We should be able to deal with it in the course of the present week or next week.  But I should like an assurance from the Minister that the suggestion of a parliamentary Committee will be examined and that the idea will have his support.  If we have that assurance from the Minister, I take it we can get down to a very useful examination of the workmen's compensation code.  The many difficulties and injustices that are in it could be ironed out in a very short time by a Committee of Deputies who have practical experience of the injustice done to workmen by the present machinery and, in fact, by the principles that are behind the code at the moment.</P>

      <P>I agree with the other Deputies who have spoken that a measure of this kind designed to do something to alleviate the lot of those who are unfortunate enough to be injured in the course of their employment should be welcomed.  I regret, however, there is no provision in the Bill for those who are single.  I have not much knowledge of industrial employment; I know more about the agricultural side of it.  In that respect, the Minister could surely have made some reference to the fact that there must be a very much increased fund at the disposal of these companies in facing up to claims in consequence of the increase in agricultural wages and, particularly, the increase in the allowance for board and lodging.  Over the last five years there has been an increase of about 75 per cent. in what is demanded from the employer on an estimate of the cost of board and lodging.  The premium is based, per £100 paid, on the gross wages and board and lodging.  Surely the companies can meet this little additional charge without resorting to any increase in the premiums.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With other Deputies, I regret that this is not a more comprehensive Bill which would deal with many injustices that exist at the moment.  It would be in the interest of very small farmers who desire occasional help that they <Col N="737" /> should not have to meet the basic premium demanded from them at present. Many men who have worked all their lives as agricultural labourers and who would desire to give what is called in the country &ldquo;a hand&rdquo; for a day or two to one of their neighbours are precluded from doing so at the moment because that neighbour must pay an exorbitant premium for the day or two days that a person might be giving assistance to him.</P>
    <P>Single men are excluded from any benefits under this although they are as prone to accident as any others, in fact more so, particularly in connection with agricultural work.  Young men starting work on a farm are not as experienced as the older men in dealing with machinery or live stock.  Under this Bill there is no provision made for an increased allowance for them in case of accident, although the incidence of accidents in the case of younger men must be much greater.  Therefore, this cannot create a very great charge on the companies concerned.</P>
    <P>I agree with Deputy Norton that the House and the Government should seriously consider dealing with the whole question of workmen's compensation as a charge on a Department of State rather than on the great number of companies dealing with it at present.  The cost of administration at present is extraordinarily high.  I am also concerned with the difficulties which both employers and employees have in the case of accidents in rural areas.  The companies create a lot of fuss if the doctor who attends the injured man is not the local dispensary doctor, and that, in turn, brings a train of difficulties.  It is customary for the employer to bring the regular family doctor to an injured man's assistance&mdash;perhaps the dispensary doctor is not available at the time&mdash; and there ensues for everybody a train of difficulties.  I think that the present provision of £5 for medical fees is certainly not enough to cover the expense usually incurred in attending to an injured man.</P>
    <P>We welcome the Bill as some improvement, but we think that the distinction made between single and married men and in regard to the <Col N="738" /> number in family will create difficulties and increase the costs for those who have to administer it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RobertBriscoe" hpid="Mr. Briscoe Mr. Briscoe">

      <P>I welcome this Bill as far as it goes, and I think it would be a pity if its speedy passage were prevented by the introduction of controversial amendments or the bringing in of issues which we know are required to be considered at some time.  Section 6 of the Bill deals with a matter which was crying out for immediate attention.  That is the section which enables a workman who receives injury to be paid compensation on account without interfering with his right in law to recover full compensation if his injury turns out to be of a permanent nature.  I understand that within a reasonable time the whole code will be examined and that the ordinary workman in trying to get either weekly compensation or final compensation will be dealt with on the basis of a human approach rather than on the basis of a legal fight between three parties, the employer, the employee and the insurance company.</P>
      <P>Originally when this Bill was being discussed I hoped that there would be an increase all round in the weekly amount paid while a person is out of work, over and above what is now envisaged in the Bill, and including single men.  It now appears that under this Bill the main benefit will go to the man with a wife and children who are dependents.  That is quite good as far as it goes.  Whether it is going far enough is a matter for discussion, but certainly it is a great improvement on the present situation.  I refer to Section 6 (6):&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(a) acceptance by the workman of compensation under this Act, or of any payment purporting to be by way of compensation thereunder, shall not prevent the workman from maintaining proceedings independently of this Act, provided that the proceedings are instituted within 12 months from the occurrence of the accident.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>I heard one of the Deputies refer to six months.  I do not know whether the question of six months arises.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>Under the Workmen's Compensation Act the workman must bring the claim within six months, and if he accepts compensation he cannot proceed further.  In this particular case, if the workman accepts compensation, he is not stopped from proceeding further provided he does so within 12 months.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RobertBriscoe" hpid="Mr. Briscoe Mr. Briscoe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Briscoe</NameTxt>
      <P>That is what I said. The previous position was&mdash;and we had cases cited&mdash;that advantage was taken of the lack of knowledge on the part of the workman of his legal position. If he took any payment at all he was debarred from court altogether and could not assert his full, legitimate claim.  Now he is not in that position and the only limitation to his rights is that he must, if he feels he is entitled to claim under the courts, take proceedings there within a period of 12 months.  That is fairly reasonable.  I do not know how long it will take before the case is heard or when he will get his final compensation but, as I said on the last occasion we were discussing this Bill, I hope we will get as far away from the courts as possible so that the speediest decisions can be taken in these cases and so that people will not be held up for unlimited periods before they get compensation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I agree that the general code attaching to workmen's compensation is confusing.  There is a certain amount of doubt.  Employers do not object to the paying of insurance in the sense that they are protecting themselves against these claims&mdash;the premiums for which are paid on the basis of a percentage of the wages paid&mdash;but employers do want their work people treated reasonably well if, as a result of an accident, they are unable to continue in their employment. In addition to the precautions taken by the insurance company with whom the insurance is held to ensure that in factories and workshops generally workmen are protected as far as possible by all kinds of measures to avoid accidents, there is also a Department of State that sends officials around or is supposed to send <Col N="740" /> them around to inspect factories and try to make sure that there is protection for the individual.  Apart from the compensation that will accrue to a workman as a result of an accident, I would like to see more strict steps taken by the Department of State responsible for this to see that accidents should be avoided as far as possible.  I would like the Minister to indicate to the Department of Industry and Commerce that the smaller the number of accidents we have in factories, whether they are temporary injuries or fatal accidents, the better it is for our people, and that the insurance itself is only the last issue under the worst circumstances. That brings me to another point.  If there is a strict enforcement of protective measures in factories&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesHickey" hpid="Mr. Hickey Mr. Hickey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hickey</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RobertBriscoe" hpid="Mr. Briscoe Mr. Briscoe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Briscoe</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes. If there is a more strict enforcement of such measures which will result in fewer accidents, the question of increased premiums will not arise because the premium will be related to the amount the insurance company has to pay.  I hope we will deal with this Bill without the introduction of controversial amendments and that it will be treated as a great step forward in regard to the issues with which it deals.  Let us hope it will have a speedy passage and that it will be put into effect as soon as possible.  I do not think the appointed day will hold up its implementation very long.  It may be that certain matters must be considered before the Minister can announce the appointed day but I am sure he will tell us himself when he expects this appointed day will be.  I hope we will get this Bill through in this session.  I do not know how many more weeks we are going to sit, if we are going to sit any more weeks, but the Minister gave an undertaking earlier on in the session that he would do his best to present the Bill and have it passed as soon as possible.</P>

      <P>This amending legislation to the workmen's compensation code is long overdue and I welcome it. With the last speaker, I earnestly <Col N="741" /> hope it will go through quickly.  However, the Bill is being brought about by pressure because of cases of which we all have knowledge.  There are certain cases to-day where men with families have been drawing £2 10s. a week workmen's compensation for some time with no sign of its being increased.  I am not quite sure from reading the Bill whether it is the Minister's intention to give any increases to those who are at present drawing inadequate compensation.  I would like the Minister to make that point clear because if it does not give increases to those who are at present drawing inadequate compensation&mdash;in some cases for the last year or six months and some others for the last couple of years&mdash;then it will not give the benefit that this House had hoped for.  Take the case of an unfortunate man who met with an accident six or 12 months ago.  It was because the hardship in such cases was brought to the notice of members of the House who raised those cases in the Dáil that this Bill has been introduced.  If the Bill before the House is only to benefit future cases&mdash;I am not quite clear on the point&mdash;I would like to know what is to happen to those other unfortunate people?  Is it not intended to give those who are in receipt of inadequate compensation now increased allowances?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. A. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>I hope it will be by some substantial amount.  Take the case of a man with two or three children who is drawing £2 10s. per week.  I draw attention to a special case which the Minister has given me an opportunity of mentioning because in the latter portion of his statement he said in some cases people opt to take the benefit of the Workmen's Compensation Act, which means they get £300 in the case of death. Deputies will recall an accident which occurred within the last year in the centre of the City of Dublin.  A horse ran away from its van driver in the centre of the city, in O'Connell Street, and the driver was killed.  He was what we call a £7 a week workman, and he was taken from his home and his children and his widow and children got £300 between them. The <Col N="742" /> widow got £150 and the other £150 was distributed among his children.  Are cases like that going to be made right?</P>
      <P>I would ask the Minister is he to include under any section of the Bill an increase in benefit in the case of a person who was killed at work within a recent period, say a year or two years?  Will that widow's case be reconsidered and will she get any benefit? The case I have just mentioned is known to every member or at least to every Dublin T.D. It was in all the newspapers that a horse drawing a van threw the driver of the van and the man was killed and as I tell you a miserable £150 went to the widow and £150 to the children, that is £300 altogether.  I am sure that every member of the House disagrees with a verdict like that, and, had the woman been told or had she known that there was another way she could have acted, she could have gone to the court to seek damages.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I read in the papers where men have been killed at work and even £2,000 £3,000 or £4,000 compensation was given.  That is not, I think, in any way excessive.  It would not be excessive in many cases.  Where men had long lives ahead of them and a long expectation of life and wages, that they should get over £5,000 damages would not be excessive by any means. When one sees cases like that in the paper, that a judge and jury or maybe a judge, whether it be in Ireland or in England, gives reasonable and fair damages to a family who have lost the breadwinner, and then we read side by side with that of a workman killed in the centre of the city and his widow getting £300 I say that there is something wrong.  I would ask the Minister is it his intention to give retrospective benefits or rights to those people to appeal to a higher court over a decision which in their hour of blackness and trial they were advised to accept when they got only £300. Surely that woman should have the opportunity within a certain period of reversing her decision to take £300, under the workmen's compensation code, and go to the court and allow a jury and the judge in the court to decide what was adequate compensation. <Col N="743" /> The Minister has just told me&mdash;I accept his nod of his head as saying that these people who are in receipt of small allowances to-day are going to get an increase.  I know a case of a man on whom a bag of meal fell.  I do not know what was the weight of the meal, but it fell on him and injured his back severely.  That man was, I think, in what we call the £6 or £6 10s. a week class, and his family is still, after years, drawing £2 10s. a week.  I think it is no credit to the country.  While I welcome the Bill I would appeal to the Minister and hope that he will consider the points that I have made with other members of the House.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Hickey</NameTxt>
      <P>I hope you are right, but I am rather doubtful about it being <Col N="744" /> retrospective.  I am not going to go over the same ground that has already been covered by previous speakers. Deputy Norton has spoken about the merits and demerits of this Bill, and what it should be, and I am going to avoid repetition of what he stated. There is one point I think that is wrong, and that it that the computation of compensation should be on the basis of the actual earnings on the date of the accident.  I have a considerable objection also to the word &ldquo;average&rdquo; for compensation, making up the compensation that is due to the injured workman.  You take a man who is out ill for perhaps five or six months or longer and he resumes his usual occupation where he has been for a number of years and maybe a month after getting back that workman is injured.  Under this Bill now his average earnings are to be the basis of the compensation&mdash;average earnings over the previous 12 months.  I hope that the Minister will get down to this point and will not continue the old system that is there at the moment.</P>
      <P>I know a number of these cases because I have been dealing with them for a number of years, where men have been unemployed for a long period and out sick for a long period and maybe a week after going back to work they suffered from serious injury.  Such a man's earnings were only so much, or his average was only so much for 12 months, and he got compensation on that basis.  I think there is specific mention in this Bill of average earnings for the previous 12 months and it is emphasised under many sections of it.  I am satisfied that we probably will be able to get agreement that these averages must be cut out and compensation based on the wages paid on the date of the accident.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is also a stipulation there that a man must make his claim for compensation within 12 months under the common law, and even at the moment he has to make a claim for compensation within six months of the date of injury.  I think that there should be no such thing as defining a date.  There is at the moment an industrial disease which is not scheduled, and we have been asking the Minister and the previous <Col N="745" /> Minister to try to make it a scheduled disease.  It is very prevalent among miners and among lime kiln workers and so on.  I saw recently a case in England where the British Government have allowed two years to elapse in which these people can come into the workmen's compensation code where they prove that what they are suffering from is due to this disease.  It is a very hard name to mention.  It is pneumoconiosis. There were cases where workers joined the navy or the army in England.  This thing does not show itself very rapidly in their employment, and a period of two years was allowed to enable them to come under the workmen's compensation because this kind of disease due to dust and certain poisonous elements was the causes of their ailments. It would not show itself perhaps for two years or more and therefore I think we should cut out of this Bill the provision that applications must be made within six months or 12 months.</P>
    <P>There is another point which I would like to draw to the attention of the Minister, that where a worker is injured the employer is under no obligation under the Acts so far to re-employ the injured workman when he is certified fit for work.  A good many decent employers help their injured workers well and humanely, but quite a number of employers, if they have to give a lump sum in compensation for workman's injury and can well afford to find it will often not re-employ him in future.  There is even a kind of reluctance on the part of insurance companies to insure many of these men.</P>
    <P>I think that we will have to get down to some definite agreement about all these things being put into the Bill, because I am satisfied that once we have passed this Bill we can look for a very long period before we can get at the Compensation Bill we are looking for.  In many cases where men drawing workmen's compensation have suffered rather serious injury&mdash; disability in the leg or disability in the arm or in some cases where men have suffered very serious injuries to the back and all that sort of thing&mdash;<Col N="746" /> they are compensated to a certain extent by getting a lump sum, but the employers after doing that are not prepared to re-employ them.  That is another defect in this Bill.</P>
    <P>I agree also that the bringing of cases to a court within 12 months is very necessary.  I know of men who were employed in State organisations and who were injured and, even though the accident occurred maybe six or seven years ago, all they are drawing is the same 50/- per week. Prior to 1948 the amount they received was 37/6, and prior to that they received 35/-.  The maximum they received at the moment is 50/-.  If these men had been given a lump sum by way of compensation when they were fairly young they might have been able to do something else.  The tragedy is that they are kept there on that 50/- a week and later there is no question of giving them a lump sum. That can be said in regard to many of our State organisations at the moment.</P>
    <P>I know one young man who was injured about eight years ago.  He was a carter.  Just because he cannot straighten his hand, the State organisation which formerly employed him cannot re-employ him as a carter. However, they have been appealed to by me and by other people to give that young man alternative employment in their concern.  Because that young man is not fit to do the same type of work as that on which he was formerly employed, the concern will not re-employ him and he is now depending on 50/-a week.  When he was first injured, the amount he received was 37/6 per week.  All these things will have to be remedied in this Bill because there is a good deal of injustice in this connection.</P>
    <P>With regard to increasing the sum of £300 for the widow to £600, and to £1,200 if she has dependent children, I regret to say that I consider that the increase is still quite inadequate.  I know a number of cases similar to those mentioned by Deputy Byrne.  I know of two cases which occurred in the past 12 months of young men who were killed in the course of their employment.  One of these men left <Col N="747" /> four children and the other man left six children.  All the widow would be entitled to receive under this Bill would be £600 and £1,200 in the case of dependent children.</P>
    <P>The matter of workmen's compensation should be taken completely out of the hands of insurance companies.  I have been interested in the matter of workmen's compensation for quite a number of years and it is depressing to see the fight that is made between the doctors representing the different sides &mdash;and the poor unfortunate workman is the victim.  One doctor will say that the workman is fit for light work and another doctor will say that he is short of his pre-accident ability to work&mdash; and the struggle is there between, if you like, the vested interest and the insurance companies.  It is time to take the matter of workmen's compensation completely out of the hands of the insurance companies.</P>
    <P>Some time ago I was discussing this matter with some insurance representatives and I said to them just what I am saying here now, namely, that it is cruel to see profit being sought to be made out of the victims of industry. I said I would be willing to bet that not more than 50 per cent. of the money paid into the insurance companies went back to injured workers.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJKennedy" hpid="Mr. Kennedy Mr. Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>Workmen's compensation is not profitable to insurance companies.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesHickey" hpid="Mr. Hickey Mr. Hickey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hickey</NameTxt>
      <P>A man told me that the amount paid back is roughly 50 per cent. and I am quite satisfied that that is so.  I hold, however, that even if only 20 per cent. of it goes back to the insurance company, no profit should be made out of an injured workman, his wife and children.  I want to see this whole matter dealt with on an entirely new basis.  We have, also, another horrible feature in regard to workmen's compensation and it is not provided for here.  If a doctor says that an injured workman is fit for light work and another doctor says that he is not, the result is that the insurance company puts off payment of the <Col N="748" /> claim and, unless national health insurance can be drawn by that injured workman, he is held up and must wait until the Circuit Court sits and decides his case.</P>
      <P>Then again, there is the man whose injury will be permanent in its effect, and the insurance doctors know it.  In such a case, there is always the desire on the part of the insurance company to give that type of injured workman a lump sum as quickly as possible so as to take his name off their books. It is only natural that a workman who is hard-pressed, and who has nothing to depend on except the 50/- a week workmen's compensation, and who has a wife and children depending on him, is anxious to get a lump sum as quickly as possible.  I submit that workmen's compensation should be dealt with under the auspices of the State.  I have expressed that view before and I still strongly adhere to it.</P>
      <P>I am surprised that the Minister is not agreeable to increase the amount paid to an injured workman who has not any dependent children.  The insurance paid to cover workmen's compensation is charged against the industry concerned.  The Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Social Welfare said a moment ago that workmen's compensation is not a paying proposition for the insurance companies. Despite that, I read recently in the Cork newspapers that insurance companies were offering a 20 per cent. reduction in respect of payments under the Workmen's Compensation Acts. How does the Parliamentary Secretary explain that action by the insurance companies unless, in fact, it is a paying proposition?</P>
    </Speaker>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Hickey</NameTxt>
      <P>I am preaching against the evil under which an injured workman, his wife and children, are used by certain interests for profit motives. As I said in this House last year, we all know that insurance companies are almost as powerful as any financial institution in this country, whether it be foreign or Irish.  Unfortunately, most of them are foreign, so far as this <Col N="749" /> country is concerned.  I hope we will not approach this Bill with that mentality.</P>
      <P>I will avoid repetition because Deputy Norton has covered many of the points which I had in mind.  I was disappointed by Deputy Briscoe's attitude to this Bill.  Last December, when the Labour Party introduced a Bill of this nature, Deputy Briscoe said that the amount of 90/- per week, which we mentioned in our Bill, was not sufficient.  I hope that, without holding up this Bill, we will get agreement that the amount payable to an injured workman, his wife and dependents should be increased from the present sum of 50/- per week.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LiamCunningham" hpid="Mr. Cunningham Mr. Cunningham">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cunningham</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome this piece of amending legislation.  We should bear in mind that it is amending legislation and that, to judge by the contributions of the Deputies who have spoken so far in this debate, a good deal of emendation is necessary in regard to workmen's compensation.</P>
      <P>I cannot offer any helpful suggestions as to how the whole system should be reorganised, but the Bill contains two features which I certainly welcome.  One is the increase in the weekly compensation for a married man.  It is a very welcome and very desirable change in the existing law that a married man, in addition to the ordinary benefit, will now be entitled to a standard weekly benefit of 12/- in respect of his wife and 7/6 in respect of each of two children. It is something which will improve the lot of the injured workman and his family.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The second welcome change in this legislation is that the injured workman is more or less protected from himself. I have known cases where an injured workman accepted a sum or sums of money, shortly after sustaining injury, and who, on later investigation, in respect of permanent injury, found that he was all tied up and was unable legally to take full advantage of the benefits to which he would be ordinarily entitled, if he had consulted some legal mind on the matter.  The change now contained in Section 6 is, <Col N="750" /> for that reason, necessary and desirable because it does entitle the workman who has accepted some payment to get his full rights within a year afterwards by having recourse to the courts.</P>
    <P>There is one danger in relation to the benefit which the married man and his family will receive.  It has already been mentioned here.  It is a serious danger which should be guarded against, and, if it should transpire that such a situation should arise, some drastic measure should be taken.  I refer to the danger that insurance companies will increase the premiums to be paid by the employer in respect of a married worker.  The primary danger arising out of that is that a firm or employer of any kind will be tempted to employ single men and women because the insurance premium may be smaller in their case.  Where a large number of employees are concerned, over a year, it is a consideration which any employer will be tempted to take cognisance of and it may then militate against the employment of a married worker or workers.</P>
    <P>I do agree that there are many desirable improvements which could be made and which must, at some later date, be made, and I think that the suggestion offered by Deputy Cowan that a parliamentary Committee should be set up to study this whole matter, to take evidence and so on, or any other method by which the question could be reviewed, is a good suggestion. It would enable us here to be sure that a perfect Bill, or a Bill as nearly perfect as possible, could be drafted and passed.  This subject is one which not very many of us understand perfectly.  It is a matter which is tied up with legal people, doctors and so on, and we are not familiar with all the snags that exist and the methods by which these snags may be overcome.  That is why some committee which would be in a position to call in people competent to give expert advice should be set up.</P>
    <P>One very useful amendment which could be inserted on Committee Stage is an amendment by which a single workman who has a dependent relative or relatives would be catered for <Col N="751" /> and entitled to the rate of benefit which is available to the married person. It may well happen that a young worker will have to support his widowed mother, and I think his claim to a benefit of 12/- a week on her behalf is just as great as that of a married man in respect of his wife. Again, both parents may be dead, and where there is a family of very young children, children of school-going and infant age, I think the elder brother who is a working person should be entitled to the benefits which apply to a married man in respect of his children.  It is something to which everyone will agree, and it is necessary in cases&mdash;I can assure the Minister that there are many of them&mdash; where a son or daughter who is working undertakes the expenditure connected with the maintenance of children of school-going age.</P>
    <P>I am very anxious that at an early date a reorganisation of the whole scheme of workman's compensation should take place, because one must remember that, in present-day circumstances, the risks of injury in industry, whether of temporary or permanent nature, are greater than ever before. Industry to-day is such, due to the use of machinery and so on, that greater risks of injury exist and there are more accidents than were the case some years ago.  The same applies even to agriculture.  In agriculture to-day, the agricultural worker runs greater risks than previously.  He is asked nowadays to drive tractors and to operate other machinery like reapers and binders the working of which involves very grave risks.  For that reason I think this should receive consideration in the future.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J.A. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>I have very few remarks to make upon this Bill which is merely a piece of patchwork amending legislation.  There are certain fundamental matters arising in connection with any consideration of workmen's compensation which ought to be given the most careful and urgent consideration. I wonder if there is any section of the Department of Social Welfare or of the Department of Justice <Col N="752" /> doing anything to keep in contact with and to keep under constant review the administration of the Workmen's Compensation Act and the problems that arise under it?</P>
      <P>Deputies in the course of their remarks this afternoon criticised the action of insurance companies and for greater measure other Deputies threw in lawyers and doctors.  Of course, all that only arises from complete ignorance of the way in which the administration of the Workmen's Compensation Acts is carried on.  I think I am entitled to say that so far as the Circuit Court judges and the county registrars, who have a very important function to fulfil in connection with the administration of the Workmen's Compensation Acts, are concerned, workmen are getting the most sympathetic consideration in connection with their claims under the Acts.  I know there should be at least memoranda from some of these Circuit Court judges in the hands of the Minister pointing out the problems that have arisen and suggesting solutions.  I know nothing has been done about them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This Bill is only a stop-gap.  So far as it purports to give certain much needed increases we all agree with it. I personally disagree fundamentally with the provision in this Bill differentiating between the single and the married person.  The single man is a potential married man.  The single woman is the potential mother of a family.  Very often they are engaged in their occupations for the purpose of putting aside portion of their earnings with a view to building a home for themselves.  Why should that very much needed activity of very great social value be put an end to because a single man or a single woman has the misfortune to meet with an accident? Again, a single man may have a dependent father or mother or a a dependent sister.  Why is the single person's dependents not dealt with in this case?  There is no justification for the differentiation which I think possibly emanates from the Civil Service attitude towards the difference between married people and single people in connection with Civil Service <Col N="753" /> remuneration.  I think that is the origin of the matter.  It is indefensible in principle and may cause grievous injustice in practice.</P>
    <P>Deputy Hickey put his finger upon one very serious aspect of workmen's compensation which we have met with in the course of our experience.  That is, when a workman meets with an accident and gets some lump sum and when his incapacity is deemed to be terminated, he finds it almost impossible to get fresh employment.  We have all had the experience of trying to get employers to re-employ workmen who have met with a serious injury, say, the loss of a few fingers. They get a lump sum in settlement of their case from an insurance company or an employer.  They then find that they are merely a drug on the labour market because once they go back for employment they are regarded as an added risk and no employer or insurance company will take them.  That is a very serious matter.</P>
    <P>Recently there was a case where a workman took proceedings originally and finally took them in tort to go before a judge and jury.  He got a certain amount by way of compensation but then found that having lost a few fingers he was no longer employable. That is a matter that is of very great importance.</P>
    <P>Suggestions have been made from all sides of the House with regard to the desirability of putting the administration of workmen's compensation under a State department.  I am open to conviction on that, but at the moment I am not convinced.  By and large, injustices are done in connection with workmen and their compensation. Deputies spoke about the insurance companies trying to get rid of their liability and write the liability off their books.  That is a fact.  That frequently occurs but it very frequently inures to the benefit of the workman.  If you had an astute solicitor or counsel looking after a case and an insurance company wanted to get rid of the thing that is his chance to put on the squeeze.  I want to be convinced that the paternal eye of a State Department is going to improve matters at all, a civil servant who has regard not to the workman or even the taxpayer but the <Col N="754" /> Comptroller and Auditor-General.  I should think that where you have a sympathetic Circuit Court judge and an experienced and sympathetic county registrar dealing with workmen's claims on a human basis and on humanitarian principles you have at least the basis of a very good safeguard for workmen's rights.</P>
    <P>I do not know whether it would be possible to consider a scheme of compulsory insurance in connection with workmen's compensation somewhat on the lines of the compulsory insurance with regard to mechanically propelled vehicles under the Road Traffic Act with a very drastic provision that it would not be possible for insurance companies to take advantage of technicalities in the proposal form to rid themselves of liability to their insured to pay compensation to an injured workman.  There might be an interim measure to provide compulsory insurance pending an examination of the entire problem as to what is the best method of dealing with it.</P>
    <P>I think the time has also come for genuine consideration to be given to the question as to whether or not the entire doctrine from which workmen's compensation sprang should not be done away with.  I think the doctrine of common employment was invented by one of the old Victorian judges who thought it was a scandalous thing that his under-servant should have an action for damages against him because his butler was guilty of negligence in the course of his employment. I think that is what gave rise to the workmen's compensation code. That has been done away with in England, and it is in the course of being done away with by myself and my colleagues in the Bar Council and by the solicitors' profession.</P>
    <P>Deputy Alfred Byrne could not understand why the widow of an unfortunate man who was killed in an accident when a horse ran away should only get some small sum while another workman got several thousand pounds from a jury.  Again, that arises from the doctrine of common employment. Let those who now talk about and like to throw mud at the legal profession remember that it is judge-made <Col N="755" /> law that got round that particular piece of injustice.  It is just a matter of law that got round that little piece of injustice and created the duties, apart from the statute, which are now resting on employers to provide a safe system of working for their employees, to provide that they shall give them a safe place in which to work, and to provide that they have protection in other directions, in the way of machinery and plant and a safe system organised, with competent employees, competent fellow-workmen and safe machinery and plant.</P>
    <P>The provision of Section 6 arises because of a clause in the original Workmen's Compensation Act which I think has been kept in all Workmen's Compensations Acts since, which purported to protect the employer from double causes of action.  I am not sure of this, but I think the Minister should have another look at that Section 6 to see if it does what he wants it to do. I express no opinion on it.  The position has been that the mere acceptance of workmen's compensation was said to be evidence of, or in fact, to conclude the case against a workman, that he had exercised his option to take workmen's compensation and not to go against his employer for his common law cause of action.  That plan was eaten into also by the decisions of judges and juries on the evidence that was put before them to show that in exercising the option the workman or woman had not been in possession of his or her faculties, or other matters of that kind.  In those ways it was got around, but there is no reference in this Section 6 to the section of the Act from which this difficulty emerges.  I have not got the Act before me, but speaking from recollection I think there is nothing to connect Section 6 up with it on the subject of protection against double remedies.  I am not too sure if it does precisely what the Minister wants it to do.</P>
    <P>I think Deputy Cunningham did refer to the fact that there are a lot of problems that have been arising under the Workmen's Compensation Act and its administration that require to be dealt with.  This Bill is <Col N="756" /> only a method of putting those problems on the long finger.  When this is done we may sit down for a year or more, or perhaps until somebody brings in a private Bill and then the Government will bring in another one to meet it.</P>
    <P>There are people interested in this who have been dealing with it in a humanitarian and just way.  Circuit Court judges and county registrars are really responsible for the administration of this Act.  Lawyers, whether solicitors or barristers, make very little money out of workmen's compensation but they have done a considerable amount in the way of settling claims, adjusting demands and seeing that the workmen have not suffered injustices.</P>
    <P>I think that something does require to be done in the way at least of compulsory insurance in the matter of workmen's compensation and in the way of preventing insurance companies from making small technical points on the filling up of proposal forms, in order to enable them to repudiate liability to an employer.  It is not so much a question of indemnity to employers who pay the premiums and who may find themselves done out of a just claim by technical points raised against them, but it is the possibility of the workman being very seriously injured and having nobody to resort to for compensation.  The employer thinks he is fully and adequately insured and has done what he conceives to be his duty when he has got a comprehensive insurance and pays his premiums, but when an accident happens, he then finds the insurance company repudiates his claim and he goes insolvent and is not able to pay it.  That is what may happen.  In fact it has happened, and all because a particular type of insurance company may take advantage of technical slips of no consequence in filling up proposal forms.  Reputable insurance companies do not as a rule take advantage of these small points but the fact that they are capable of ruining employers and preventing workmen from getting compensation is something that deserves close attention and an urgent solution in this legislation.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasAnthonyKyne" hpid="Mr. Kyne Mr. Kyne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kyne</NameTxt>
      <P>In common with the <Col N="757" /> majority of Deputies, I welcome this Bill for what it is, a limited improvement on the code covering workmen who are injured in the course of their employment.</P>
      <P>Labour Party views on a number of simple points have been met and where they have not been met we hope to put down amendments that will cover the points we believe should be included.  We recognise this for what it is, an interim measure which is intended to bring about certain improvements pending the introduction of a comprehensive scheme.  Our amendments will be so framed as not to offend against the principle of such a Bill but they are amendments which we consider absolutely necessary if this Bill is to serve even as it is obviously intended to serve, as a stop-gap until such time as something better can be done.  I would feel that the Minister has, to say the least of it, not been over generous with his increases.  The figures of 12/- for a dependent wife, and 7/- for each of two children up to two are an improvement and that is about all that can be said of them.  When you take the present-day value of money as compared with even the earlier pre-war values, the 30/- that the ordinary married man got then even without any provision for a wife or children, would easily be worth much more than £3 now.  It is true that the maximum amount of 76/- can now be secured but when you consider that practically 50 per cent. of the people who will be injured will be deprived of any insurance benefits, it cannot be said that it is putting too big a burden on the insurance companies and on the employers who will pay the increased premiums that will be necessary. Surely, 50 per cent. of the people claiming workmen's compensation will be either single men or women.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I agree with all the other Deputies who made the point that these people would have dependents in the same manner as married people.  They could have a dependent mother, a dependent sister or brother, and I would ask the Minister in common with some of his own Deputies, to re-examine that matter and see if an extension could <Col N="758" /> not be given to people who are proved to have dependents.  Unless that is done, we know what usually happens. If a single man receives 50/- compensation and has a dependent brother or sister at the present time, he will be forced to get his dependent brother, sister or mother to make application for home assistance.  It will probably be granted and come back then on the shoulders of the ratepayers of this country.  I do not think it is the ratepayers who should subsidise industry in that manner.  I think industry should be made to carry its casualties along with the profits for the employer, and the greatest casualty of all is injured workmen.  Prior to this, the laws were made mainly by the employers, and I think it is time the ordinary workman got an opportunity of having laws framed which would give him some part of the justice that is coming to him.  These old Workmen's Compensation Acts which we recognised at the time they came into force as being the beginning of recognition of the workers are certainly outdated now.  The complete machinery of workmen's compensation is certainly outdated where a workman is limited to three-quarters of what he earned up to a certain figure.  It is a most unusual thing to say that at a period when a man is injured and when he requires more sustenance than he did before, when he cannot take part in the other activities which he normally carried on outside his work to help his family, it is then that he must make do with three-quarters of what he had before, or less than a certain figure.</P>
    <P>That does not seem to give justice to the injured workman.  It does not give any inducement to workers to feel that they are safeguarded in their employment and that they are at liberty to give of their best, irrespective of the risk involved.  It may well be argued that you have cases where people, who are not entitled to it, claim insurance. Of course that is a question for both the medical people and for the Circuit Court judges.  I do not think it should be held against the workman who has made a genuine claim and who has suffered an injury that there are <Col N="759" /> malingerers.  If these malingerers are there, they should be weeded out and it should not be used as an argument against genuine cases.  Compensation should not be reduced because of the fact that such people are there.</P>
    <P>The main point with which I want to deal concerns what is, to my mind, an omission of an important section from this Bill.  Under the present law an employer, who is paying an injured workman compensation, has the right, if he so decides, to take the case to court and to get a lump sum settlement before the Circuit Court judge. He very often exercises that right, if he thinks it is in his interest.  I would suggest that the workman should get the very same right.  If the employer has the right to go to the court to have a lump sum figure fixed, when it so pleases him of if he sees an advantage to himself, the worker, I submit, if he sees some advantage to himself in having such an arrangement arrived at, should have the same right as the insurance company.</P>
    <P>As I understand the position the insurance company investigate the case and they fix a certain sum of money as compensation.  It is usually fixed by statute because wages nowadays have gone so high that every worker has the ceiling rate.  The insurance company examine the case and pay compensation at that rate.  At the beginning of the next year, when they are about to reinsure the firm they again examine the case with a view to giving the injured workman a lump sum.  If he does not accept it, they may budget for a new increased premium to cover another year.  Having fixed that, they take no further interest in that case until another year comes round.</P>
    <P>I think the injured workman should have the right in such cases to go before the court and ask for a lump sum settlement if he thinks it is to his advantage.  My reasons for making that suggestion are that sometimes a workman, who has received an injury, realises that he is so incapacitated that he will never again be able to resume his normal employment and that if he is ever again to become a useful unit <Col N="760" /> in society he will have to seek alternative employment.  If he were given a lump sum he would be in a position to receive some training or to set up in a business of some kind that would give him an opportunity to earn some money to provide for himself and his family.  It is of the utmost importance that he should not be kept on three-fourths of his wages or a sum, if he is a single man, of 50/- per week for the rest of his life, knowing very well that should compensation be stopped at any time he will have to take his chance, on receiving some lump sum at the end of ten, or maybe 15 years, of being thrown on the scrap heap.</P>
    <P>Insurance companies realise that workers understand risks of that kind. They realise that workers are anxious to receive a lump sum in order that they may qualify themselves for some other form of like work.  They play on the fears of workers and they offer reduced capital sums, realising that the worker knows that he has no right himself to go before the court himself to seek a lump sum payment.</P>
    <P>It may be said by the Minister or by people who would argue against giving the worker such right, that it is for his own protection he is not given the right to claim a lump sum. I would, however, say that the Circuit Court judges and the trade union officials who normally nowadays advise workers&mdash;most of them are in unions&mdash; or the solicitors employed by trade unions, would take good care that the lump sum which the worker was willing to accept would be adequate for the needs of that worker.  I would ask the Minister to re-examine the position and to bring in a section to the Bill which would give to the worker the same right as the employer enjoys in regard to the fixing of a lump sum to cover the compensation.</P>
    <P>I do not think there is very much more I have to say beyond that we welcome the Bill for what it is&mdash;a step in the right direction.  We hope to amend it by a few simple amendments which will cover the points we have raised.  We should like to impress upon the Minister the urgent need for the implementation of a fully comprehensive workman's compensation code. <Col N="761" /> The need for that must be very clear to everybody.  I think Deputies on both sides of the House have expressed a desire to see such a measure introduced. It cannot of course be done in the short term that is left to the Dáil now, but we hope next year, please God, to see introduced by the present Minister or some other Minister a fully comprehensive measure that will give to workmen the just status denied to them so long.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickODonnell" hpid="Mr. O'Donnell Mr. O'Donnell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donnell</NameTxt>
      <P>I have no hesitation whatsoever in saying that this Bill encourages two unchristian and uncatholic practices, namely, celibacy and birth control.  I can visualise the case of a young workman who receives an injury which permanently incapacitates him, a young man who has no hope whatsoever of receiving any employment in future as a result of the injuries which he has received. The maximum compensation to which that young man becomes entitled to is £2 10s. per week.  No increase whatsoever is provided for him under this Bill.  He knows that if he marries, and that if he has ten children, he will not receive one penny increase in the weekly compensation which he was receiving at the time of his marriage. Where is the encouragement to that young man to marry?  None.  In other words, this Bill encourages that young man to remain single.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Again, take Section 3, sub-section (8) and consider the case of a married man with a family who is permanently injured.  That married man is entitled to received compensation under this Bill for himself, his wife and his children and, in the words of the section, &ldquo;any legitimate or illegitimate child born to him not later than nine months after the accident giving rise to compensation.&rdquo; That man is encouraged by this Bill to have recourse to the unchristian and uncatholic principle of birth control.  By this Bill that man is encouraged to avail of the anti-catholic principle of birth control because no provision is made for any child born nine months after the date of the accident. He knows that if he becomes the father of ten children he will not <Col N="762" /> receive an increase of 1d. under this Bill.  That is outrageous.  The Minister should seriously consider the position and amend the Bill before the Committee Stage.</P>
    <P>I agree with everything Deputy Costello has said in relation to this discrimination between single and married men and single and married women.  No encouragement to marry is given to a young man permanently incapacitated.  There should be no discrimination whatsoever.  Some provision should be made for the future wife of that injured workman and any children which may be born as a result of any marriage into which he may enter.</P>

      <P>That man is carrying a very, very big financial burden.  He cannot improve his position.  There is no encouragement given to him. Another important matter arising under this Bill is in relation to medical expenses.  Many of us have had experience in that particular respect.  An injured workman is attended by a doctor, possibly for a period of ten or 12 months, before his application for compensation is finally decided.  Under the Act the maximum to which the doctor is entitled is £5.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donnell</NameTxt>
      <P>I have never known a medical man press a workman for fees.  Some provision should be made under the Act.  If necessary, there should be compulsory insurance on the employer to insure against injury to his workmen.  In that way no great burden will be thrown on the employer if he is called upon the pay the proper medical fees.</P>
      <P>I cannot understand why there is no provision in this Bill or in any of the Acts that went before it for retrospective increases in respect of workmen's compensation.  I know single men who are to-day in receipt of compensation at the rate of 30/- per week.  These men are permanently incapacitated. Some have dependents.  No provision is made for any increase despite the increase in the cost of living.  The old age pensioner is now receiving as much as these men are in compensation. I think the Minister should consider the position.  I am sure he will agree there should be some retrospection.</P>
      <P>I do not know why this House accepts legislation piecemeal.  Even the ordinary solicitor finds difficulty in interpreting the Workmen's Compensation Acts.  I guarantee that no employer or employee can explain or understand the Acts.  This Bill certainly does not clarify the position.  I appeal to the Minister to consider the codification of the Acts so that both the employer and the employee may have an understanding of their legal position.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesLarkin1943" hpid="Mr. Larkin Mr. Larkin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Larkin</NameTxt>
      <P>There is very little purpose in my attempting to cover many of the points of principle already touched upon in the discussion.  There are, however, one or two general points to which I would draw attention because they have an important bearing on the contents of this present measure.  It has been pointed out that we are dealing here with a temporary <Col N="764" /> measure designed to retrieve a very desperate situation so far as injured workmen are concerned, injured workmen who are at present trying to eke out an existence on a maximum compensation payment of 50/- per week. The Minister has been pressed to recognise the necessity for dealing with the whole code of workmen's compensation in a comprehensive way.</P>
      <P>It is known to the Minister, as it is known to many Deputies, that within 12 months of the passage of the 1934 Act&mdash;indeed, almost before the ink was dry&mdash;Judge Davitt, one of the leading members of the judiciary, submitted a very detailed memorandum pointing out the very grave defects in that Act even at that early stage.  We are now in 1953, 20 years later, and we have not yet tackled the fundamental defects that showed themselves immediately following that comprehensive review of the position at that time.  In the meantime, not only has the problem become more complicated and difficult with the growing accumulation of decisions but, in addition, there has been a big change in the general attitude, the public attitude and the attitude of the Legislature towards this whole question of social welfare and workmen's compensation.</P>
      <P>It is time the Minister met his responsibility in this regard.  While it is not possible at the moment to do more than deal with the position on an interim basis, before this Bill leaves the House the Minister should give a binding undertaking that in the next session an opportunity will be taken of dealing with the whole question of workmen's compensation on a comprehensive basis.  We might then consider the suggestion made by Deputy Cowan of having the matter examined in a preliminary form through a Committee of this House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Listening to the viewpoints expressed in this debate and observing the different methods of approach to the problem it is quite clear that, leaving aside Party affiliations altogether, there are divergent viewpoints as to the best manner in which to tackle this particular problem; that is, whether it be along the lines of the present system with a possible <Col N="765" /> strengthening of it through compulsory insurance or turning over to an alternative system of State insurance.  That is a matter upon which one will not get unanimous opinions even in the trade union and Labour movement, because the interests are so important that those who are closest to the problem are nervous and reluctant to commit themselves definitely to either one or the other approach to the problem since they realise they may be working in the dark and, through lack of knowledge and experience, may merely bring about fresh problems, problems which will not affect them personally, but will affect the persons most in need of their protection and their very careful consideration&mdash;that is the injured workman and his dependents.</P>
    <P>I feel that the House should press the Minister to make it clear, both on his own behalf and on behalf of the Government, that at least before the end of the year we will be given the opportunity of remedying defects which have been apparent for more than 20 years in our workmen's compensation code, defects which immediately became apparent on the passing of the 1934 Act, and to which the attention of successive Governments has been directed by the leading experts of the Bar and the Bench, so far as this code of law is concerned.</P>
    <P>So far as the present Bill is concerned and recognising that it is an interim measure, we welcome it.  It is important to bear in mind&mdash;this is a point that I want to stress&mdash;that we have this Bill now because we had another Bill earlier in this House.  It is unfortunate that the Government and the Minister were only made alive to their responsibilities when a private measure was introduced.  However, let us give this credit to the Minister, that this Bill is now before us.  It is to be hoped that, whatever else we fail to do before the House rises for the summer recess, we will see that this Bill is disposed of so far as this House is concerned.  If we are going to be left with the long-term problem unsolved, by the failure to introduce a complete and comprehensive code, and if the Government and the Minister, whose primary responsibility it is to deal with this matter are again to be as <Col N="766" /> slow in dealing with the bigger problem as they have been in introducing the present Bill, then we shall only have to try and pursue them by utilising the resources that we have in this House by means of a Private Member's Bill.  There is that way of drawing attention to this very grave problem. Possibly, in that event the Government will accept the responsibility of dealing with the matter in a more efficient manner.  This, at least, is one of the fields of legislation in which, by means of a private Bill, members of the House have some freedom of action.  It is one which, in so far as we have got responsibility to injured workmen, we should utilise to the full, if the Government itself does not accept responsibility.</P>
    <P>This Bill has some good features, and naturally we welcome them.  There seems to be some doubt as to the possible effect of some of the new provisions. Discussion has already taken place in respect of the new feature introduced of providing payments for the wife and children of an injured workman.  There have been fears expressed&mdash;leaving aside altogether whether it is a good feature to provide additional payments in this form&mdash;as to whether it may have adverse effects in so far as employment is concerned, as to whether or not there will be inducements or pressure exercised by employers in the way of giving preference to single men as against married men with family responsibilities.  It is almost impossible to say whether that is going to happen or not.</P>
    <P>I understand, in so far as the insurance companies are concerned, that their approach is that they do not propose to make a distinction as regards the assessment of premiums. Very likely what they will do is this: they will fix their new rates of premiums, when this Bill becomes law, not on the single or married man basis but on the higher risk&mdash;on the basis that all employees are all married men, that all have got wives and that all have got about 16 children, and will fix their premiums accordingly.  How, in the course of time, employers will react to the new rates of premiums it is hard to say at the moment.  There <Col N="767" /> is, however, that possibility.  The Minister's attention has already been drawn to it and apparently he is satisfied that it is not very great.</P>
    <P>The Minister, in defending his line of approach to the present rate of weekly payments and his refusal to increase the general rate of 50/- by adding the 12/-, the 7/-, and the 14/-, sought to justify that by appealing to the House to keep the payment under the workmen's compensation in line with the Social Welfare Act.  That is a completely fallacious argument.  At no time has there been a parallel existence either in regard to national health or workmen's compensation payments or has there been any relationship established between them.  The rates of national health benefit have been worked out solely on the basis of the general level of national income.  That is not a factor so far as workmen's compensation is concerned.  Deputy Norton has pointed out that it started with a very simple rule of thumb giving 75 per cent of average earnings.  That was slashed in two by putting the ceiling at either 30/- or 50/-.  Where there was, for example, in 1934, a relationship between the 22/6 national health benefit and the 30/- workmen's compensation, everyone knows that was a purely arbitrary figure.  Previously, it had been 35/- and, because there was an adjustment in the amount in respect of fatal accidents, there was a compromise made in respect of weekly payments.</P>
    <P>I think the Minister is not fair with the House in pleading for understanding and support for his approach or for his method of dealing with this question of weekly payments by arguing that, because the House is committed, through the passing of the Social Welfare Act to payments for a single man or woman, plus adult dependents' payments and plus payments for one or two children, automatically we ought to follow the same approach when dealing with the immediate problem of how to give some little additional assistance to the injured workman who is at present living on 50/- a week.  Frankly, I feel that, until such time as the Minister <Col N="768" /> seeks to deal with workmen's compensation on a comprehensive basis, he is not entitled to submit that argument in defence of his present attitude. As the present Bill is a purely interim measure, we should deal with it on the basis on which we feel this question of workmen's compensation should be approached, that is to provide a certain payment, whether it be big or small, whether it be a lump sum or a percentage payment, to be made available to the injured workman or injured work woman, irrespective of their marital conditions and dependents, and nothing else.  If that is to be the case, then it is a matter to determine to what extent the 50/-should be increased.</P>
    <P>I want again to submit to the Minister that we are in a different field here, so far as finance is concerned. It is entirely different from the field in which we find ourselves when discussing rates of benefit under the Social Welfare Act.  It is different in this respect, that here we are not dealing with public money.  We are not imposing, except in the extremely limited way in which Government Departments themselves are employers, any additional expense on the public purse.  We are dealing, in the first instance, with private individuals who are employers or with companies which are employers and, secondly, with a group of insurance companies whose sole interest, so far as workmen's compensation is concerned, is to discover to what extent it is going to be profitable for them to engage in this business.  Why, therefore, should we concern ourselves in limiting the assistance which the injured workman should receive?  That is the concern of the insurance companies, and they are the last element in this that should be considered.</P>
    <P>In so far as employers are concerned, it may be argued that we should not impose undue charges on them from the point of view that these might affect industry, trade or commerce. They continue to tell us that they are still staggering under a tremendous burden of rates and taxes, and that another straw is going to break their back.  That, of course, is fantastic. <Col N="769" /> The charges for workmen's compensation insurance are not in their total sums very great.  In the case of a business with a wage roll of, say, £10,000 a year, and employing ordinary mixed categories of workers, the total amount of premium paid to cover this particular risk would be a matter of £200 or £300 a year.  That would be covering a staff of 25 to 40 people.  Any reasonable addition that we may decide to make to the 50/- will not put any crippling weight upon any employer in this country.  Anyway, if we accept the principle that a man who meets with an accident in the course of making profits for another man is entitled to be maintained during the course of his incapacity, automatically we have also to accept that the standard of his maintenance must bear some relationship to the ordinary standards of social justice and ethics that we maintain in this country.  If, in 1934, this House was of the opinion and the present Government was of the opinion that a sum of 30/- was a fair and adequate amount for a single man or woman, how can they go back on ensuring that at least the same sum will be made available to the single man or woman in 1953, making due allowance for the changed value of money?  If that is the position, on present day prices the figure then set down by the Fianna Fáil Government and embodied in the 1934 Act would require that in place of 50/- we would substitute a figure of roughly 69/-.  There is no argument required about that.</P>
    <P>The only argument the Minister has is: &ldquo;Do not create difficulties for me because some day in future I propose to introduce a comprehensive measure under which I will deal with the question of industrial injuries on the basis of a State insurance scheme and when that happens I do not want to have the payments being made in respect of injuries getting too much out of line with the payments that are being made in regard to ordinary sickness.&rdquo; The Minister, quite clearly, is an awfully long way off that and, until he comes into this House on that basis and puts forward a comprehensive code based on the State insurance <Col N="770" /> scheme, he cannot have the best of two worlds and he cannot plead for our indulgence in so far as the relationship of rates paid in respect of industrial injuries and ordinary sickness is concerned to meet his problem when we are not dealing with the question of compensation on an insurance basis at all but purely on the rule of thumb basis, that we have provided so much in the past and must now adjust it in the light of changing prices.</P>
    <P>The Minister should not spoil even this interim measure by being too rigid in the figures set down.  Quite clearly, there is an unanswerable argument for an increase on the present figure of 50/- to the single man or woman and if we can give something additional to a married man for a wife or children, even though there may be certain dangers in that, I personally would be prepared to take the risk because even if we increase the 50/- to 60/- or 65/-, if that has to cover not merely the man but his wife and four or five children, we are asking that man to do the impossible.  The money is not sufficient and we should recognise that there is an exceptional burden in the case of the married man with a wife and dependent children.</P>
    <P>I would press the Minister to have regard to the figure of 50/- and to leave aside altogether any question about imposing an undue burden on the employers.  It is not an undue burden and everybody knows it.  We will be told, for instance, that we have to have special regard to the position of farmers.  In the case of a farmer employing, say, two farm labourers, at present his total premium runs somewhere between £5 to £6 a year.  How much extra will be put on if we give something extra on the 50/-?  I am sure no farmer either in this House or outside would object to what at most would amount to a few shillings extra a year.</P>
    <P>The same argument applies in regard to industrial employment.  The rates run from very small figures even up to the more dangerous claims of a relatively small number.  If we are concerned with the position of insurance companies&mdash;I doubt if anybody is prepared to defend them in the House&mdash;it <Col N="771" /> is quite well known that in so far as their management of the funds they collect is concerned, of the total premium income very nearly 50 per cent. is absorbed in management expenses and that, quite clearly, is a position that this House should not be prepared to concern itself about.</P>
    <P>In the course of an earlier debate appeals were made to the Minister to try to remove the 50/- ceiling and leave the position on a straightforward percentage basis of the average wages.  I do not know whether the Minister is prepared to consider that or not, but it is a matter about which we in the Labour Party have very strong views. There is, quite clearly, a complete contradiction. Take, for example, the case of an adult male worker who is earning £7 to £8 a week and whose effective compensation is limited to 50/- because of the operation of the ceiling.  We can go to the other end of the scale and find a single girl, who, because of the operation of the 75 per cent. clause, can in fact get just as much compensation as the adult male worker who may have a large family depending on him and whose wages in the course of work may be three or four times as great as the single girl's. We apply a rigid rule of 50/- and completely cut across the whole principle on which we originally approached the problem.  On Committee Stage we will of necessity have to try to ask the Minister to consider it from that aspect by putting down a suitable amendment.</P>
    <P>There are two other matters I would ask the Minister to consider.  We have not got very much time to deal with this Bill.  We hope to get it through. Possibly, between this and Committee Stage he may give some thought to the points we are making before actual amendments are put before him.  In respect of non-manual workers, the Bill proposes to raise the income limit to £600.  I would appeal to the Minister to give further thought to that matter. Changes have taken place in the rates of salaries for clerical workers during recent years.  Pre-war, clerical workers were very largely unorganised and a great percentage of them worked at <Col N="772" /> rates of wages which were low in themselves and in many cases were not above those of manual workers. Through organisation and through a better appreciation on the part of employers, there have been considerable improvements and ordinary clerical employees who would be regarded merely as senior clerks are now in receipt of salaries that carry them above that £600 limit.  They are, in every sense of the word, ordinary employees, but they are not in a better position to make provision for any accident they may meet with in relation to other workers because the margin of their salaries is not so great.  As I pointed out before to the Minister, to the extent that we are trying to adjust these rates to present-day standards, to-day, so far as our discussions on the Health Bill show, we recognise that a man earning up to £1,000 a year is not in a position, out of that salary, to make provision for many of the illnesses that befall men and women in these days, if the illness is very prolonged.  If that is the case in regard to an ordinary illness which, maybe, a man brings upon himself by his indulgence or his stupidity, how much stronger is the case for consideration where he may meet with an accident which is entirely beyond his control or beyond any measuse that he may take to protect himself and which may involve him in very heavy expense for a prolonged period?</P>
    <P>I frankly think that we should raise that income limit above £600.  Again, I recognise it is a question of keeping two different codes in parallel.  But we have not really got two codes here. We have the social welfare code which, whatever may be its defects, is complete in itself.  So far as the Workmen's Compensation Act is concerned, we have an Act and a collection of legal decisions made over the years in which even lawyers get lost, and which is purely a rule of thumb way of dealing with a very serious problem.  We should not introduce into our Workmen's Compensation Acts codes which are not applicable until the Minister and the Government make up their minds as to whether they are to be applicable.</P>
    <P>The same thing applies in regard to the limit in respect of payments to <Col N="773" /> dependents in the case of fatal accidents. Again, I think that purely as a measure of justice, if we are merely equating the present limit to what the limit was under the 1934 Act, then the £600 should be made £1,200.  As I say, it is a rule of thumb measure.  Why should we not get at it in an exact manner, and why should we try to excuse ourselves by bringing in principles from another system of codes altogether in respect of both the employers and the insurance companies? In the case of the employer, the additional sum put on him will be very small and, in the case of the insurance companies, why should anyone come before the bar of this House and plead for any consideration for them?</P>
    <P>In regard to the medical expenses, I notice that a little while ago the Minister intervened to make some remarks in respect of payments to eight, nine or ten doctors.  Of course, that is an exaggeration.  The Minister knows that it is essential on many occasions, in order properly to defend the interests of an injured worker, to have not only competent but highly experienced medical men.  Very often you have to pay for the reputation of the doctor in order to win a workmen's compensation case.  It is a bit of a peculiarity that the expenses are limited to £5 and that that £5 can only be got through the process of court proceedings.  Only the other day in a large public institution under the control of the Minister in his other Department, I had to ask for the refund of a deduction made from an employee's salary where that employee was taken by ambulance for medical examination in the hospital.  I was coldly told that they did not know whether they could refund it or not, that they might be surcharged because there had been no court proceedings as there was no provision for the payment of any medical expenses outside of the section of the Act providing for the maximum sum of £5.  Luckily enough, many of the officials in carrying on the work under the control of the Minister have got a little understanding of it and a little compassion, as I am quite sure the Minister has. <Col N="774" /> I think that if he looks at the problem, the limit of £5 might at least, as has been suggested to him, be doubled and made £10.  The Minister would not be taking a very big chance and the doctors will not get away with very much.  As things stand, it is very hard on a workman when he meets with an accident and requires medical treatment, because both doctors and hospitals are getting very wise and are looking for payment.  We will have to re-examine this whole question of medical expenses, and at least in the interim measure there should be some increase on that figure of £5, even if it were only to double it for the moment.</P>
    <P>I do not know what the Minister's intention is with regard to the Committee Stage.  As I say, it is most essential that we should get a reasonable opportunity of putting in amendments for the Committee Stage, but we are also most earnestly interested in ensuring that the Bill will go through the House before we rise for the summer recess.  We hope that we will be at one with the Minister in ensuring that, no matter what will be the other pressures on the House.  At the same time the Minister will appreciate that the Bill has got our goodwill. We appreciate the fact that it has been brought in before the House rises.  If we find it necessary to put down some amendments, I hope he will allow us at least a minimum time to do that so that we can even on this simple measure do the best we can in the circumstances for these injured workmen and their dependents.  I hope the Minister will find it possible to give a very definite assurance that before the end of this year anyway we will be given an opportunity of reviewing the whole of the workmen's compensation code.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMacBride" hpid="Mr. MacBride Mr. MacBride">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacBride</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not propose to keep the House long, particularly in view of the extremely able and constructive approach which Deputy Larkin has taken.  He has said practically all the things I would wish to say in regard to the Bill.  In regard to placing an undue burden on the employer, I think we are making a <Col N="775" /> mistake in our approach.  I would have thought that the approach we should make in regard to the question of workmen's compensation was that every decent, self-respecting employer would normally wish to ensure that any employee of his who in the course of his employment sustains an injury should be maintained during his period of incapacity, and maintained as closely as possible in the condition in which he was maintained while he was working.  I would have thought that in a Christian country that should have been our approach&mdash;that any decent employer would wish to ensure that any of his employees were properly looked after and maintained during any period of incapacity resulting from an injury received in the course of their work.  That is the approach we should make to the whole question and not so much the approach of calculating the exact cost or calculating the effect of this on insurance premiums.  I am satisfied that the insurance companies are well able to look after themselves. I have not noticed any insurance company being in any particular financial difficulty over a long period of time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On the question of whether the same yardstick should be applied to workmen's compensation and to, say, sickness benefits under the Social Welfare Acts, I think that sight is possibly lost of the basis on which the payments are made.  Under the Workmen's Compensation Acts the benefits are paid because the employee has sustained injuries during the course of his employment while working for his employer and therefore the rate, I think, should normally be higher and should be related definitely to his wages.  The sickness benefits arise normally from a universal risk as distinct from the risk which arises as a result of employment.  A person can contract sickness by catching cold at the pictures or at a dance or in many other ways, whereas in the case of an injury sustained in the course of employment it is an injury which is incidental to the employment and, generally speaking, the benefit is to compensate a workman who receives an injury that arises in the course of <Col N="776" /> his normal employment.  Therefore, I think there should be a different approach in principle.</P>
    <P>In regard to workmen's compensation generally I would like to urge the Minister to consider approaching the amount of compensation on a completely different basis.  The value of money has depreciated rapidly over a long period of time.  I do not think any of us on either side of the House would suggest that we are approaching a period of stability.  I do not think we have had a period of stability in the course of the century and it would be foolish for us now to think we have reached a position of financial stability.  I do not regard that as possible in the present-day world.  We are now embarking on a new rate of payment that does not in any way catch up on the depreciation that has taken place in the value of money. Could we not, instead of fixing definite amounts, adopt a completely new principle of relating the compensation which is payable at any given time to the value of money at that time, to the cost of living?  It could be done in this way.  You could have the basic minimum wage which would be related and anchored to the cost of living. You could then fix your workmen's compensation payment by relation to that basic minimum wage.  In that way when the cost of living went up the payments which the workmen would be entitled to receive would go up automatically.  If it went down, an unlikely event, the amount of the payments would also go down.  By that method we could ensure that the rate of payment as far as the insured person was concerned would remain approximately the same.</P>
    <P>This is of particular importance in the case of workmen's compensation because, goodness knows, the payments we make are low enough and they are intended to provide the workman with the very barest minimum requirements of life.  Obviously if there is an increase in the cost of living in the next 12 months or two years, we will be in the position of having to introduce either a new Bill or of automatically reducing the value of the compensation which every <Col N="777" /> workman receives.  That is what has been happening since the passing of the 1934 Act.  Every increase in the cost of living has had the effect that it was the workman who was suffering and the insurance companies who were benefiting.</P>
    <P>It seems to me that if we are going to make this Bill effective we must devise some machinery whereby compensation would be related directly to the cost of living.  As I said, that could be done by relating workmen's compensation payments to the basic minimum wage which would be anchored to the cost of living.  Alternatively we could adopt the suggestion made by Deputy Larkin that the rate of compensation should be directly related to the rate of wages of the insured workmen.  I would ask the Minister to consider very seriously a proposal of that kind.</P>
    <P>I am very glad to see the Minister has introduced in Section 6 an amendment to the 1934 Act dealing with the anomaly which has existed whereby a workman who accepted payment under the Workmen's Compensation Acts was automatically deprived of his right of action under the law.  In view of the desire of the House to pass this Bill rapidly I would like to ask the Minister whether he would be good enough to seek the view of the Attorney-General as to whether that section is sufficiently effective.  It is quite possible that the matter has been considered carefully by the Attorney-General. If not, it would be a wise action to take to ensure that we are not again going to have an undue amount of litigation on this issue.  The section looks to me to be sufficiently comprehensive, but it would be well if it were looked into very carefully by the Attorney-General between now and the Committee Stage.</P>
    <P>In dealing with that section I would also appeal to the Minister to alter the period of 12 months provided in paragraph (a), sub-section (6) of Section 6. Possibly the Chair will allow me to deal with it very briefly because of the desire of the House to pass the Bill quickly.  It seems to me unwise to set a different period of limitation.  There is no particular reasons why a workman <Col N="778" /> should have to file his claim within 12 months when any other citizen can file it within six years.  Why not have just one statutory limitation with regard to actions and leave the ordinary rule of six years to obtain in the case of injuries sustained by workmen? In some instances, particularly in the case of industrial diseases, the injury may not become apparent for quite a long period of time.  I agree that this would probably only affect unusual cases but I see no reason for making a distinction.  It would be much simpler to have one period of limitation, namely, six years.  I do not think it would affect the liability of the insurance companies very much.  As far as I am concerned I will do everything I can to expedite the passage of this Bill through the House.  I endorse what other Deputies have said and I do not wish to delay the passage of the Bill by repetition.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Undoubtedly, as some Deputies have said, this Bill is only a stop-gap.  It was brought in as an interim measure because, first of all, I must make up my mind as to the direction in which future legislation should go and secondly, to prepare that legislation will take a comparatively long time; whether it will be months or years is a matter that can be considered. Therefore, I would like Deputies to accept that it is only an interim measure and only deals with certain points that appear to be urgent.</P>
      <P>Another point I would like Deputies to keep in mind is that all these Workmen's Compensation Acts are drafted on the assumption that we are dealing with employees and employers.  Insurance companies do not come into the minds of the draftsmen.  Many points that have been raised could be favourably disposed of if there were either a State scheme or a compulsory insurance scheme.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have neither at the moment; therefore, we cannot deal with some of the points raised as satisfactorily as Deputies would like.  For instance, the first speaker here, Deputy O'Higgins, raised two points, one that we do not propose to include a child who is born more than nine months after the accident and, secondly, that <Col N="779" /> we have a time limit under Section 6 of one year, within which time a man must make up his mind if he is going on the common law.  These are put in because, although we are putting an obligation on the employer of meeting a case on the common law if it is initiated within 12 months, we think that the employer is entitled to some protection and should at least know where he stands as soon as is reasonable. I think that a year is reasonable enough.  As a matter of fact, it was put to me by some of my advisers that a year was too long, that six months should be long enough for any man to make up his mind and, in fact, I consider that it is not unreasonable that a man should be able to know within 12 months whether he was going to go under the common law or not.  As regard to the question of a child the same thing applies there.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMacBride" hpid="Mr. MacBride Mr. MacBride">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacBride</NameTxt>
      <P>Might I interrupt for just one moment?  Supposing that it is an injury which does not become apparent within six months, or maybe within 12 months.  That is a problem.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I know it is a very serious problem.  I admit that, and I am going to say, as I say in replying to several points raised here, that these are matters for the comprehensive Bill that will follow on as soon as possible.  We only took matters that could be dealt with in a simple way and by simple amendments.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Regarding this question raised by Deputy MacBride now and by other speakers previously, that a thing might arise several months after the accident which was not apparent at the time and that might well encourage a person, if you like, to take action, well he should get whatever time is necessary. On the other hand, from the medical point of view I have been trying to get advice and no medical man will give me an opinion that anything is likely to arise after 12 months no matter what the accident may be.  I must say that I cannot think of anything myself that might arise after 12 months.  These things, as Deputies know, of course, would be complications but they are likely to arise at any rate within a <Col N="780" /> couple of months.  However it is a very difficult matter and one which I think should be left for a more comprehensive Bill.  I am only saying that there are many things here in this Bill on the assumption that the accident happens to the employee of a small employer who is not very well able to meet a big action, and at least we should give the small employer some protection so that he will know as soon as possible what his total liabilities are.</P>
    <P>Another matter that was raised by Deputy Kyne can be given the same answer.  He raised the question which does often arise, that the employer has an option of going to court and getting a lump sum fixed but the employee has no such option.  Again, looking at the thing from the point of view of the equity and so on, if the employer goes and gets that settlement the employee gets whatever the court believes is a fair settlement in the way of a lump sum; but if the employee has an option and if it is a small employer that small employer may be in a type of business where he could afford to pay 50/- a week but if he is told that he has to pay a couple of thousand pounds, which he might have to in certain cases, well that finishes him.  He has to go out of business and he is not able to pay.</P>

      <P>No, it is not compulsory. If we had compulsory insurance all these things could be agreed to, or if we had a State insurance they might all be agreed to.  If you want fair treatment between employer and employee then the reasonable thing in my opinion to do would be to withdraw the option from the employer to pay this lump sum.  That might be a fair thing, or Deputies might think what should be done is that either could go to court by agreement.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>That is my experience too.  The only equitable way to settle it in my opinion is to withdraw the option from both, but we may leave all these matters to a more comprehensive Bill.  There might be something that the court will have regard to the employer's circumstances and find that there is nothing against a settlement in those cases, or if it is a large employer he will say: &ldquo;We will go ahead with this case.&rdquo;  But if it was a small employer, he could make the case that he could afford 50/- a week, and the court might say that in such a case it could not order a lump sum. Something of this kind might be done but not, I am afraid, on the simple amendment that is brought in at the moment.</P>
      <P>The case was raised by Deputy Larkin about what the doctor is paid. I do not see any great objection to doing what Deputy Larkin and some other speakers have put to me about doubling the amount for the doctor; but I want to say this, that in present circumstances, or I should say as soon as the Health Bill goes through, every insured person will be entitled to free specialist and hospital treatment and advice, and everything else that they need, and those in the lower income group will be entitled to free medical practitioner service, so I do not think there would be very many cases. Remember, of course, that everybody who is entitled to workmen's compensation must be an insured person, so I do not think there is any great case for legislating for any higher fees for the doctors because as far as I can see it will practically all be free.</P>

      <P>I knew a case myself recently because the man who was insured told me of the case.  He was <Col N="782" /> an ordinary working man who was entitled to free service of every kind and when he got his lump sum he got a fairly stiff bill from the doctor, a doctor connected with the public service. In my opinion he should not have been charged anything and I think it was very unfair that this man should have been charged.</P>

      <P>I know.  I do not suppose he was liable to pay at all, but he got a bill anyway.  I do not know what the position might be, on the other hand, with regard to giving evidence in court.  Whether a doctor is in the public service or not, I suppose it would be unfair to compel a man to give evidence in court without paying him some fee, and that is a matter that should be considered fully.</P>

      <P>Deputy Norton asked why I did not give more information in introducing this Bill.  This is not a comprehensive Bill.  Deputy Larkin, Deputy Cowan, and others, spoke on that.  I was very keen when I took over this job first on having a national scheme, in other words, to come into the social welfare code, from two points of view that I think would strike anybody. First, it would be done more economically.  I quite agree with Deputy Norton that the Social Welfare Department works very much more economically than any outside company could work.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The administrative expenses are very low.  The percentage is very low. In that way, of the amount paid in by way of premium, there should be a bigger proportion for the insured man. <Col N="783" /> If it were a national scheme, I think we would make some attempt to have cases decided as far as possible away from the courts.  That would be another saving.  As against that, in a case like this we always try to find out the experience of other countries. Deputies are aware that the neighbouring country has tried this out.  I do not want to build any cases on the first few years' experience, but all that I can say is that they are not promising.  The point is that, in a nationalised scheme of workmen's compensation, the common law case would have to be left out.  That would mean, let us say, that we would start off by saying: &ldquo;We should be able to work on whatever the premiums of the other country are.&rdquo;  I am not saying that this is true but I suppose that half of their claims is workmen's compensation and half common law. We would say that we should be able to work on half that premium if it were only workmen's compensation. However, I am afraid the experience is that, gradually, the premium for the common law case has gone up until employers in the neighbouring country are now finding that they are paying just as much as they were before but that they are paying only for common law cases.  Therefore, I think we must have a little more experience.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I quite agree also with Deputy Norton that the workmen's compensation code in this country has come down to us from the British code. Conditions in Britain are very different from what they are here.  Britain is an industrial country.  When you take agriculture and industry together, and bearing in mind that we have such a big proportion of agriculture here, the <Col N="784" /> average wage in Britain is higher than the average wage here.  I do not say that the industrial rate is higher but the average wage there, when you include agriculture, is higher than it is here.</P>
      <P>Sometimes we hear talk to the effect that if the benefit a man gets comes near to the wage he earns there is a danger that he may stay out from work longer than a man who is getting a good deal less.  I do not say that that is done dishonestly, but the fellow who is getting a sum which is near his wage will be inclined to wait longer because, as a matter of fact, the other man goes back too soon, even before he is quite fit to go back again.  That is nearer the truth than malingering.  Therefore, from many points of view, the experience in Britain is different from what it is here and, for that reason, we should have our own code rather than one based on the British system and on British experience.  We could not help taking over the scheme from the British, in the beginning, but, as has been mentioned during this debate, the code has continued through the years without receiving very much attention by way of legislation.  I think it requires a thorough investigation at the moment, from a fundamental point of view.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>They should be looked at. A comprehensive measure is necessary. Whether it should be a nationalised scheme or one on the present basis is something to be decided.  I started out with a very strong prejudice, from many points of view, in favour of a nationalised scheme but then I thought to myself that we now have an opportunity of seeing how the scheme is working in a neighbouring country and that it should be possible for us to make up our minds more intelligently after learning what their experience is.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My idea in regard to a nationalised scheme was that we should bring it into the social welfare code&mdash;having a differential, if you like.  I do not want to be thought of as gathering all the <Col N="785" /> ideas I have from the British system but the one man who has written deeply on this matter is Sir William Beveridge.  I read what he wrote, as I thought I was bound to do, in view of the fact that I would be introducing a Social Welfare Act in this Parliament. One statement that struck me as very objective was that what should guide us in all things is need&mdash;need above all.  He said he could not see how the man who is sick and drawing national health insurance needs less than the man who was injured in industry.  He said that therefore&mdash;in theory, at any rate&mdash;both should get the same.  But he said that, as against that, a very important consideration was that the man who met with an injury in industry was accustomed to get more and that that was a sort of custom that it was not very easy to get over.  Therefore, he came out on the side of recommending that they should get a bit more.  Of course, we have been carrying on that here.  There is a gap.  There is some dispute about what that gap should be, but there is a gap.  At the moment, the gap is 26/-for the single man.  That is the position at the moment and before this Bill is passed.  But a man with a wife and two children would at the moment get only the same for workmen's compensation as he would get for ordinary illness.  I was trying to keep this Bill more in line with the social welfare legislation by giving the benefit to the dependents&mdash;the wife and the two children&mdash;and in that way keeping the gap of 26/- whether he was single, married or had one child or two children.  That was my object in putting these payments into the Bill.</P>
    <P>I am attacked from many sides about that.  I am attacked by the Fine Gael Party and told that I am doing an unchristian and uncatholic thing.  That is what Deputy O'Donnell said.  Deputy Costello said he did not agree with the differential between single and married people.  We have it in the social welfare code.  We have the differential between the single and married man and between the single man and the married man with two children: they are all different.  I do not know why Deputy Costello and Deputy O'Donnell <Col N="786" /> should object to that principle in the workmen's compensation code because, presumably, Deputy Costello and Deputy O'Donnell approved of that principle in the social welfare code when Deputy Norton, as Minister for Social Welfare, brought his Bill before the Dáil.  It is not likely that Deputy Costello, who was Taoiseach at that time, disapproved of that principle. Now I am up against a new Catholic principle, namely, that there is a difference between workmen's compensation and national health insurance.  I am becoming so befuddled here with Catholic principles from the Fine Gael Party that I do not know where I stand.  Maybe they will tell me what that principle is in time.</P>
    <P>Deputy O'Donnell went further&mdash;he said I was advocating birth control. Take workmen's compensation at the moment.  If a man is single, he gets 50/- and if he has a wife and two children, he gets 50/-.  I propose to give more for the wife and children.  Surely that is not advocating birth control. Deputy O'Donnell wants me to leave it at the 50/- and surely then I would have more reason to say to him that he was in favour of birth control.  But again there is some Catholic principle behind this that I do not understand and I shall have to get more enlightenment on it before I can deal with it further.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy might be better.  Deputy Norton said that the legal interpretation of the pre-accident earnings is a matter that deserves consideration. I was not aware of that. I know that a question is asked as to what are the pre-accident earnings, and I do not know how that point was interpreted by the courts.  According to Deputy Norton, the courts have interpreted it in various ways.  I accept that from him, because I am sure he has verified it, but again I am afraid that is a matter that will have to be left over for a more comprehensive scheme.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The institution of proceedings was another matter raised by Deputy Norton.  They must be initiated within <Col N="787" /> six months, according to Section 31 of the Act of 1934, but, on the other hand, there are savers&mdash;I think, very effective savers&mdash;in sub-section (2) of that section.  I do not think anybody would be caught out under that unreasonably, because it says that if a person makes a mistake, he will not be held down by the law. It also makes provision in the case of a person who is absent from Saorstát Éireann, as it was called, or fails to institute proceedings for any other reasonable cause, so that I take it that, if a person goes to court and makes a reasonable case for his failure to institute proceedings within the six months, it is all right. However, it is a matter that can be looked into.</P>
    <P>I agree with Deputies who say that this should not be a political question. I think it is a matter of trying to get the best possible scheme which would have the approval of the great majority of the Dáil, and I am, therefore, very impressed by the proposal made by Deputy Cowan, and supported by other Deputies, that we should have some sort of a committee to consider the whole question.  I have not thought over what type of committee it should be.  There are two obvious choices&mdash;a Dáil or an Oireachtas committee or a commission which would have on it more expert people like lawyers, doctors and so on, who deal with these matters.  On the whole, if I were asked to give a decision here and now, I should say that the Dáil committee would be better, because at least we would be likely to get an agreed scheme.</P>
    <P>I am quite prepared to consider it. I naturally have to consult the Government about it, but I think a Dáil committee could consider the question, first, of the fundamental consideration we should give to our social welfare scheme, because we have different problems from those which exist in England, and secondly, the direction we should go&mdash;should we go towards nationalisation or leave it as we have it and, if so, should we have compulsory insurance?  Having decided <Col N="788" /> these matters, we could then make all the necessary amendments of the law which have been raised here to-day. I am rather inclined to consider that proposition very favourably and have the whole thing considered by a Dáil committee, so that we could get what might be an agreed scheme of the Dáil.</P>
    <P>Some Deputies expressed the fear that when we have this scheme of giving more benefit to the married person than to the single person, insurance companies might be inclined to discriminate, either charging higher premiums where married people are employed or trying to get an employer to cut down the number of married people and to take on single people instead.  That is one thing I have got a definite guarantee from the companies they will not do.  I suppose some Deputies know that if an insurance company takes on workmen's compensation insurance, they do not know what type of employee is involved. Their names are never mentioned to them and the return which has to be made is a return of the total wages paid for the year.  It is on that they assess the premium, subject, of course, to the type of employment&mdash; agriculture, bacon curing, or whatever it may be.  The premium depends on the type of employment, but the amount of the premium is based on the aggregate wages paid.  That is the only thing they ask for and it would be a great departure from the present practice if they were to make any inquiry whatever about the employees or whether they were married or single.  In any case, they have given a guarantee and, if it should be departed from, legislation could be passed here to make it right.  In case any Deputy may think that I am thin-skinned about insurance companies, let me say that I am not.  I admit that the companies will try to make a profit and I agree that we should not take that into consideration.</P>
    <P>We are not legislating here for insurance companies because they will take on business, if they think they will make money and will drop it, if they think they will not, so we can leave that out.  We are talking here <Col N="789" /> only about employers, the employers who are not insured and we must give some consideration to the predicament in which such a man may find himself in case he is up against a big claim. With regard to existing cases, it is laid down fairly clearly in the Bill that wherever weekly payments are being made at the moment, on the appointed day, they will be increased to the new rates.  Where a fatal accident has occurred, it is out, of course, and there is no revision, so far as any lump sum payment is concerned.  It is only the weekly payments that would be increased, where appropriate, on the appointed day.</P>
    <P>Deputy O'Donnell raised a point about a man getting 30/- in spite of the Acts.  There is something peculiar about that case, because all the Acts had this same provision by which, where a weekly payment was being made, it was increased by each Act up along.  If the man the Deputy has in mind is still getting 30/-, the only explanation I can see is that it was not a case of total disablement.  Otherwise, there is some mistake being made.</P>
    <P>We could not at this stage consider the point with regard to adult dependents. As a matter of fact, I wanted to have the case of the children more favourably defined, but I could not do so in the time at my disposal and to bring in adult dependents would take too long, so far as this Bill is concerned. We will have to leave it back for another Bill.</P>

It is better to leave it so for the moment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="790" /> Deputy Costello spoke about the doctrine of common employment.  He thought it should be abolished.  That is a matter for a comprehensive scheme and if there was a commission or committee appointed it might have time to consider it.  Deputy Larkin with, I should say, excusable Party propaganda said I was compelled to do this because his Party brought in the Bill first.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>But any Deputy looking at the record of Fianna Fáil in regard to social welfare will not take much notice of that.  In any case, I want to remind Deputy Larkin that when I asked Deputy Norton to withdraw that Bill and said that I would bring it in, he did not do so, but brought it to the Dáil which relieved me of all responsibility, if I liked to adopt that way of doing things.  Deputy Larkin argued that the rates should not be related to social welfare until we should decide to bring in a nationalised scheme.  I am sure Deputy Larkin is not so very innocent.  If we were to depart too much it might be very difficult then to change back to a nationalised scheme. In other words, it would be very difficult to reduce any rate a small bit, even if at the same time you increased other rates by a good margin.  That is why I am particular in keeping the matter in line with social welfare until it is dealt with in a more comprehensive way.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesHickey" hpid="Mr. Hickey Mr. Hickey">

      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Hickey is talking about no public money being involved. Still I suppose this sort of thing would have some influence on the cost of living because none of us believes that if the employer has to pay more he will take it out of his own pocket.  He will put it on to the price of other goods and, therefore, put up the cost of living somewhat.  No matter what you do he will get the better of you. Therefore, we will have to be careful about these rates.  Deputy MacBride asked me about Section 6.  I was assured by the Attorney-General that <Col N="791" /> it is all right.

    <Speaker pid="GeraldBoland" hpid="Minister for Justice (Mr. Boland) Gerald Boland">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice (Mr. Boland)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move that the Bill be read a Second Time.  The objects of the Bill are chiefly four.  Firstly it proposes to restate the jurisdiction of the Circuit and District Courts in civil matters in terms that will be more in keeping <Col N="792" /> with the present day value of money. Secondly, it provides for a rearrangement of Circuit Court circuits and District Court districts which is long overdue and which will permit of a reduction in the number of circuits and districts and eventually, as vacancies occur, in the number of Circuit Judges and District Justices.  Thirdly, it authorises the appointment of an additional High Court judge which has become necessary on account of the congestion of business in the High Court.  And, finally, it authorises the grant to judges and justices of the increased salaries recommended by the Select Committee on Judicial Remuneration and makes certain alterations in the law in relation to judicial pensions. Besides the main provisions, the Bill contains a few miscellaneous provisions about which I shall have something to say in due course.</P>
      <P>I do not think I need say very much about the judges and justices' salaries. The Bill gives effect to the recommendation of the Select Committee that an increase of salary should be given to the judges of the Supreme and High Courts as well as to the circuit judges and district justices and authorities the grant of the specific increases that the committee recommended, namely the sum of £450 a year in the case of the district justices and the circuit judges and the sum of £250 a year in the case of the other judges.  From the point of view of the judiciary the present Bill's provisions with respect to remuneration are a great improvement on the provisions of the previous Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Circuit judges and district justices are to receive increases amounting respectively to £75 a year and £150 a year more than was originally proposed and the judges of the Supreme and High Court who would have got nothing under the previous Bill are now to receive an increase of £250 a year.  It is the view of the Government that the increased salaries now to be granted are so much better than the salaries provided for in the previous Bill and are so liberal in themselves that it would not be fair to the taxpayer to ask the Dáil to authorise payment of the new salaries <Col N="793" /> from an earlier date than the 1st April this year.  It is, therefore, unable to accept the recommendation of the Select Committee with regard to retrospection.</P>
    <P>As regards judicial pensions, it is proposed to change the law in two respects.  As the law stands, a judge is entitled to retire in the full vigour of his physical and mental powers after 15 years' service irrespective of his age.  This is obviously unfair to the taxpayer and the Bill provides that in future no judge shall be entitled to retire on pension until he has reached the age of 65 years unless his retirement has been brought about by ill-health and the same provision is to apply to justices.  This is in accordance with the recommendation of the Select Committee.  The second change proposed is that the qualifying period of service to entitle a justice to full pension should be reduced from 30 years to 20 years.  The committee recommended a reduction to 15 years but the Government has felt unable to accept this part of the committee's recommendation as it is of opinion that the considerations which may be urged in favour of fixing the qualifying period at 15 years in the case of the judges who are normally appointed late in life, do not apply to the case of the district justices.  As a corollary to the reduction in the qualifying period for pension it is being provided that a justice who ceases to hold office because of age or infirmity is to be entitled to a pension after five years' service instead of ten years as at present.  The pension proposals of the Bill will not apply to existing judges at all but they will apply to existing justices, if they so elect.</P>
    <P>Before leaving the question of remuneration and pensions I should mention the question of expenses.  Section 5 of the Bill is to replace Section 77 of the Courts of Justice Act, 1936, which has been found to be defective and difficult of interpretation.  It is not intended to alter the existing practice, a description of which may be found in the Select Committee's report, and the purpose of Section 5 is simply to provide a clear and unequivocal statutory authority for what has always <Col N="794" /> been the practice.  The Government has given careful consideration to the recommendation of the Committee that Section 44 of the Courts of Justice Act, 1936, should be repealed and that the judges of the High Court on circuit should receive an allowance to cover the cost of hotel accommodation instead of being provided with lodgings which are very costly but has decided, in deference to views expressed by the Chief Justice and the President of the High Court on behalf of the judges, not to make any change in the law but to try, by agreement with the judges, to secure a more extensive use of hotels with a consequent saving to the Exchequer.</P>
    <P>I come now to the proposals for a reorganisation of Circuit Court circuits and District Court districts.  The aim of these proposals, as I have already said, is to bring about a more even distribution of the business of the courts which will permit of a reduction in the present number of circuits and districts and, eventually, a corresponding reduction in the number of circuit judges and district justices.</P>
    <P>To deal with the Circuit Court first &mdash;when the courts were established in 1924 the number of circuits was fixed at eight.  In 1936 this number was increased to nine by the grouping together of the Counties of Donegal and Sligo to form a separate additional circuit.  The case for reverting to the original idea of having no more than eight circuits is simply this&mdash;that taken as a whole the volume of business arising, outside of the Dublin and Cork circuits, is insufficient to keep a complement of seven judges reasonably fully employed and that it is plainly extravagant to have seven judges handling a volume of business that six could dispose of, if the business were better distributed.</P>
    <P>An analysis of the number of days upon which each of the seven judges in the circuits in question sat over a five-year period shows that the annual average of sitting days for all seven circuits was 738, which means that each of the judges sat, on the average, on only 105 days in the year.  Of course, the average is a purely artificial figure, as some of the judges sat much more <Col N="795" /> frequently than this.  But the fact remains that the present arrangement of circuits does not provide anything like an even distribution of work as between the different circuits.  Thus, in one circuit the judge has had to sit on 160 days, on the average, over the five-year period while the average number of sitting days in each of five other circuits during the same period fell below 100 days, and in one case it was well below 100 days.  And last year the sittings in four of the provincial circuits fell below 100.</P>
    <P>The intention is to constitute the new circuits with all convenient speed as soon as the Bill is law.  In so doing an effort will be made to suit the convenience of all concerned and there will be as little interference as possible with the existing circuits.  It has been represented by the Bar Council that the interests of the circuit-going Bar who practise in different counties would be affected by the transfer of certain circuit towns which are now in one circuit, to another circuit.  Thus, a barrister who is at present practising in two towns in the same circuit may find that, if one of these towns is transferred to another circuit, the times for the hearing of business in the two towns may clash.  I do not know whether there is any way of completely overcoming this difficulty but, no doubt, the interests of the Bar will receive due consideration from the President of the Circuit Court, in consultation with the circuit judge concerned, when he is fixing the places at which and the dates on which sittings are to be held in a particular circuit.</P>
    <P>In the case of the District Court, there is room for a substantial reduction in the number of districts and a rearrangement of districts is long overdue.  As matters stand, some of the justices have comparatively little to do and the majority of what I may call the country justices are not fully employed.  District Court sittings take place on fixed days and, normally, on these days only, except where the justice considers it necessary or desirable to hold a special court in addition to the normal fixtures.  Thus, by looking at the list of fixtures it is possible, <Col N="796" /> if due allowance is made for the holding of occasional special courts, to get a general idea of the number of days on which the justices have to sit in the several districts.  What the list reveals is that the fixtures do not provide for the holding of sittings, on as many as ten days in the month, in some of the districts and that the average for the country outside Dublin is less than 14 days in the month. Needless to say some of the justices sit more often than this and I am informed that the justice who is assigned to Cork City actually sits every day in the week except Sunday.  Nevertheless, it is plain that there are too many districts in relation to the volume of business, which is spread so thinly over some districts that it does not provide enough work to keep the justices assigned to these districts reasonably fully employed.  A survey of the position that has been made by my Department suggests that it may be found possible to reduce the number of districts by as many as six or seven without imposing an unreasonable burden of work on any individual justice.  It is not proposed to interfere with the Dublin Metropolitan District.</P>
    <P>In the case of both the Circuit Court and the District Court the rearrangement of circuits and districts will necessitate the cancellation of the existing assignments of judges and justices to their present circuits and districts and their reassignment to the smaller number of circuits and districts proposed to be created under the provisions of the Bill.  Inevitably, one of the circuit judges will lose his circuit and at least five of the justices who are at present permanently assigned to particular districts will find themselves without a district.  The intention is that the supernumerary judge and justice will then become liable to be temporarily assigned from time to time to any place in which their services may happen to be required and to be permanently assigned to a particular circuit or district, as the case may be, on the occurrence of a vacancy, and that there will be no further appointments to the bench in either the Circuit Court or the District Court until the number <Col N="797" /> of judges and justices falls below the smaller numbers for which provision is being made in the Bill.  Unfortunately the reassignment of the judges and justices cannot be effected without a certain amount of unavoidable disturbance and the rearrangement of circuits and districts will not be free from complications.  The policy will be to try to effect the proposed reorganisation with as little inconvenience to all concerned as the nature of the case permits and, with this object, to seek the co-operation of the judges and justices themselves in making the best possible arrangements.</P>
    <P>I pass now to the proposal to increase the jurisdiction of the Circuit and the District Courts.  In both cases, the justification for the increase is the same, namely, that money has lost more than half its value since the present financial limits were set by the Courts of Justice Act, 1924.  What is proposed is, therefore, no more than a restoration of the <i>status quo.</i> It was always the intention that the Circuit Court should be able to deal with substantial actions and the Act of 1924 was so framed as to devolve on the court a general jurisdiction in civil cases, both at law and equity, subject only to the financial limits (which it is now proposed to double) and to the express exclusions specified in the Act.  It is clear that a court so constituted was intended to be, for all practical purposes, a miniature High Court, and this is further evidenced by the extensive criminal jurisdiction that was vested in the court and by the fact that, in civil matters, the court was given unlimited jurisdiction on consent.</P>
    <P>So long as the value of money remained at the 1924 level an action involving a claim for £300 could fairly be regarded as a substantial action. This is no longer the case, with the result that litigants are being put to the expense of having to take proceedings in the High Court to settle disputes about things that could formerly have been settled in the Circuit Court merely because these things have altered in their money value. Thus, if one considers the stake alone, <Col N="798" /> there is an unanswerable case for readjusting the existing financial limitations to bring them into line with the present value of money.  But this is not the whole story.  A major item in the cost of litigation in the High Court is the expense of bringing the parties and their witnesses and, on occasion, their solicitors to Dublin and these expenses have increased very considerably in recent years.  As a result, the cost of recovering sums between £300 and £600 is quite out of proportion to the amount at issue.  The cost of litigation must always be a matter of grave concern for the Government and for the legal profession.  For the profession, because the quantity of litigation is inevitably reduced when its cost is too expensive; and for the Government, because it is manifestly contrary to the public interest that people should be prevented from seeking justice for fear of the cost.</P>
    <P>As to the effect of the proposed increase of jurisdiction it would be difficult, if not impossible, to forecast precisely the amount of business at present being transacted in the High Court and the Circuit Court that is likely to be transferred to the Circuit and District Courts respectively, if the provisions of this Bill become law, and I do not think that anything would be gained by my attempting a statistical assessment of the probabilities.  From such statistics as are readily available, it does not appear that the change will greatly affect the volume of business in the Circuit Court but, of course, it is bound to increase the volume of business in the District Court.</P>
    <P>As regards the miscellaneous provisions of the Bill, I must first refer to Section 12.  Under the law as it stands an accused person has an absolute right to have his trial transferred from the Circuit Court to the Central Criminal Court if he is charged with an offence for which the maximum penalty exceeds one year's imprisonment or five years' penal servitude.  It has been represented to me that this right has been and is being abused and that the practice has grown and is becoming more and more frequent of applying for transfers simply to delay the proceedings.  As a result, more than <Col N="799" /> half the time of the Central Criminal Court has been taken up in recent years with transferred cases, most of which could have had a fair trial in the local venue.  Thus, the High Court has been needlessly deprived, for a considerable part of the year, of the services of one of its judges who can ill be spared for the disposal of business that can and should be dealt with in the Circuit Court.  The existence of the abuse to which I refer is best evidenced by the fact that most of the applications for transfers in recent years are applications for transfers from the Circuit Court in Dublin which draws its jurors from the same Jury Book that the jurors for the Central Criminal Court are drawn from.  In such cases it is perfectly obvious that a fair trial is just as likely to be had in one court as in the other save in quite exceptional circumstances. But, as matters stand, the accused is not required to show that there are such special circumstances or indeed to show cause of any kind.  Even in the country, there is much less justification than there used to be for permitting the transfer of trials to the Central Criminal Court, as the Circuit judge is now empowered (since the enactment of Section 19 of the Criminal Justice Act of 1951) to transfer a criminal trial from one place in the circuit to another, if he is of opinion that a fair trial cannot be had in the first mentioned place.  Section 12 of the present Bill provides that, in future, transfers to the Central Criminal Court shall be made only on the order of the High Court and, instead of a transfer to the Central Court, the High Court may order a transfer to another circuit.  The existing statutory provision on the subject, namely Section 54 of the Courts of Justice Act, 1924, is being repealed.</P>
    <P>Section 14 of the Bill deals with the reconstitution of the Superior Courts Rules Committee by providing that the Council of the Incorporated Law Society shall be entitled to two nominated members instead of the president of the society who is at present an ex-officio member.  This is being done at the request of the <Col N="800" /> society.  The section also provides specifically for the power to make rules in regard to election petitions. The rules committee are doubtful if this power exists at present.  Section 19 of the Bill allows for the transfer of a part-heard action in the Circuit Court from one venue to another and validates an existing practice which is considered to be of doubtful legality. Section 28 of the Bill which deals with desertion cases also validates an existing practice which we have been advised has no legal foundation. Finally there is Section 30 which makes it quite clear that there is an appeal to the Circuit Court from an order of the District Court under Section 1 of the Probation of Offenders Act, 1907.</P>
    <P>So much for the main provisions. The immediate cost of granting to the members of the judiciary the higher salaries proposed and of providing an additional High Court judge will be approximately £29,000 a year but the eventual cost, when the number of circuit judges and district justices has been reduced, is likely to be no more than £16,000 a year.  The increased salaries will, of course, result in higher pension charges and there may be some slight increase in judicial travelling and subsistence expenses.</P>
    <P>Before I conclude I should like, on behalf of the Government, to thank the members of the Select Committee of the House who so kindly gave their time to the study of judicial remuneration and produced such a helpful report.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J.A. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister in his opening statement divided this Bill into four parts.  I should like to divide the Bill into two parts because the Bill appears to me to bear on its face all <Col N="801" /> the evidence of being a compromise between the Minister for Justice and the Minister for Finance.  In one part of the Bill, which I shall call the first part, proposals are made for increasing the salaries of the judiciary and their pensions rights to some extent. In the other part, there is provision for decreasing the number of district justices and circuit judges&mdash;obviously a Department of Finance device to decrease the general charge irrespective of the result on litigants and the public in general.  My approach to this Bill is actuated by the division that I have made of the Bill into two parts.  I want to see the first part put into operation as soon as possible.  The other part consists of a number of miscellaneous provisions, some of which, to say the least of it, are of very doubtful value, others of which give rise to legitimate differences of opinion even amongst different members of different Parties and others of which give rise to acute controversy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is plenty of room, for instance, for legitimate difference of opinion on the question of whether it is desirable to increase the Circuit Court jurisdiction and, if so, to what extent.  There are very grave reasons for acute controversy on some of the other topics with which I shall not now deal.  I might mention as an instance the proposal which the Minister dealt with at the close of his speech, namely the abolition of the right of an accused person to have his trial transferred from a judge whom he does not like to a judge in whom he may have more confidence.  I give that as one instance of matters which may give rise to acute controversy.  I give as an instance of a proposal with regard to which there may be differences of opinion the proposal to increase the jurisdiction of the Circuit Court.  I do not know whether that has been given any real consideration at all.  It appears to me that a rule of thumb method was adopted in connection with it.  The old limit of jurisdiction was £300 and the value of money has since been halved as we all know.  I do not know whether any consideration has been given to the type of case falling between the £300 and £600 jurisdiction, even to the extent of taking into consideration the <Col N="802" /> fall in the value of money.  Have the Minister and his Department considered that they are doing away with the right of individual litigants to have adequate consideration by a jury in cases of negligence?  I think I may say here that juries at present, in dealing with matters of damages, have not reached the point where they do give consideration in connection with the amount of damages they award in their verdicts, to the fall in the value of money.  You may have, therefore, cases where some poor person feeling that he is entitled to very much more than £600, may get £599 or even £600 and finds himself damnified in costs.</P>
    <P>The fact is that for all practical purposes the right to a jury has gone in cases of that kind.  Theoretically, the right to a jury exists in the Circuit Court, but it is very rare now to hear a jury being asked for in the Circuit Court because there is no earthly use in having a jury in the Circuit Court by reason of the right of appeal to the High Court judge on circuit.</P>
    <P>I do not want to deal in detail with the other matters contained in the miscellaneous portions of this Bill beyond saying that in my view there are certain portions of the Bill which go very near to trenching upon the independence of the judiciary.  There is urgent necessity for doing justice to the judiciary by passing this Bill, but I want to make one protest.</P>
    <P>The question of judicial salaries has been mixed up here with the question of details.  In the time given to us towards the close of the session we have not an opportunity of giving as full consideration to these matters of detail and procedure involved in the second part of this Bill as we would like to have.  I do not believe this Bill was carved out after consultation with the persons primarily interested.  I believe this Bill was drafted in the Department and then thrown out at the Incorporated Law Society, the Bar Council, perhaps the judges, but no member of the business or industrial community was consulted.  Has any case been made by the industrial or business section of the community that the Circuit Court jurisdiction is not sufficiently high?  I believe this sugisatio <Col N="803" /> gestion emanated merely as a result of the departmental point of view that money has changed in value and that the jurisdiction of the Circuit Court should therefore be doubled.  I believe there is no other reason behind this change.  From my own experience I know that a £600 case in this country is still, notwithstanding the depreciation in the value of money, a very substantial case, very frequently involving difficult consideration of law.</P>
    <P>However hard working Circuit Court judges may be, however competent they may be, the circumstances in which they work are not conducive, with perhaps the exception of the City of Dublin and possibly the City of Cork, to the careful and detailed consideration that may be required in particular cases.  There is a run-over in the Circuit Court and an appeal to the High Court on circuit but the point is that the £600 case notwithstanding the fall in money may be and very frequently is of very considerable importance to the litigants.</P>
    <P>The Minister, having given his reasons&mdash;or lack of reasons&mdash;for increasing jurisdiction by a mere rule of thumb proceeds then to say that there will hardly be any increase in the jurisdiction of the Circuit Court.  It strikes me as a peculiar procedure to double the jurisdiction of the Circuit Court, increase substantially the jurisdiction of the District Court and then proceed to cut away the numbers of the Circuit Court judges and very drastically reduce the number of district justices. Where is the logic and the reason in that?  It appears to be a Finance device to cut down the cost of the Bill and we will very shortly have a Bill asking for power to increase the number of Circuit Court judges or district justices.</P>
    <P>I do not believe this is the proper method of dealing with a Courts of Justice Bill.  This is a Bill that should be, and I think will be, largely considered apart altogether from political considerations.  It is a Bill that can be dealt with in a calm atmosphere if it is approached in a proper way by all <Col N="804" /> sections of this House speaking from their experience and knowledge of what they think is required.  Such a Bill should be approached in its preparation with that knowledge.  It should not be first prepared and then submitted.  Before any such Bill is framed or introduced there should be consultation with the various parties which are in a position to give the Government their views as to the working of the existing machinery under the existing Courts of Justice Acts.  There should be consultation with the judges, with the Bar Council, with the Incorporated Law Society and with business interests and the various county registrars before the Bill is drafted with a view to finding out what the problems are and how best they can be solved instead of the Minister producing a document, standing foursquare on that document and refusing to give way.</P>
    <P>I have strong views on certain sections of this Bill.  It is rather extraordinary that there is nothing in this Bill providing a measure of relief for the congestion that exists in the High Court by increasing the jurisdiction of the Master.  That is one instance that occurs to me.  Apart from that there are certain sections to which I take violent exception.  Certain sections of this Bill trench very closely upon the independence of the judiciary.  So far as my attitude is concerned to the miscellaneous sections of the Bill I duly give notice that if and when it is possible for me and my colleagues to give proper consideration to a Bill of this kind we will do so along the lines I have already adumbrated&mdash;that is, by first examining the problems, seeing the difficulties, consulting the various interests concerned, and then endeavouring, as far as possible, to arrive at an agreed measure. I do not intend to deal with these matters of controversy in detail now, or even to give my own views on them, because I object to and I protest against the provisions in relation to judicial salaries being placed in a miscellaneous Bill of this kind.  I believe that was done deliberately to put my colleagues and myself into a position of some little difficulty.  It is <Col N="805" /> well known that we stand for the independence of the judiciary.  It is equally well known that we are in favour of the increases proposed.  A Bill dealing with salaries should have been introduced as a separate measure and as such, it would have received almost unanimous support.  I know one political Party has objection to it, but we stand on the principle of the independence of the judiciary and we object to a discussion on judicial salaries across the floor of this House.</P>
    <P>It was for that reason we cooperated with the Government in setting up and working upon the joint committee.  We feel very strongly that the principle of the independence of the judiciary should be continued and maintained irrespective of any change in judicial remuneration.  The reason why the remuneration of judges is made a charge on the Central Fund is because it is thought undesirable that there should be an annual discussion on such matters akin to the discussion that takes place on the annual Estimates.  That would be bad for the country.  It would be bad from the point of view of the confidence the people have and ought to have in the judiciary if we were projected here into something approaching an acrimonious discussion on judicial salaries.  I know that it is legitimate perhaps, and perhaps appropriate, to compare the position of judges and the salaries they have with the position of the unemployed and lower paid civil servants.</P>
    <P>But there is a bigger principle at stake.  I approach the consideration of this matter entirely unbiassed and independent.  Most of the members of the present judiciary have been appointed by the present Government. I am glad to say that all of them are my personal friends.  Not merely have I no ambitions and no desires but I rather think I have no opportunity of ever finding myself upon the Bench and I can therefore approach this matter with complete calm and independence and in the knowledge that I am standing upon the rock of principle.  The principle of the independence of the judiciary is one that ought to be in my view the special <Col N="806" /> care of every Deputy irrespective of the Party to which he belongs.</P>
    <P>I deprecate the kind of cross talk that goes on occasionally in this House about lawyers and judges, their salaries and their fees.  That does not matter to lawyers.  We can carry on and we have carried on throughout the centuries. We can carry on, no matter what gibes may be thrown at our profession, or at individual members of our profession, because we cannot be done without.  We will carry on in spite of all the things that may be said, going back even to the time of Chaucer.  We have carried on down the centuries, and the reason why we cannot be done without is because we, the members of the legal profession and the judiciary, are the guardians of the fundamental liberties of the citizens. That is why we cannot be done without.  We are the guardians of their civil rights, of their liberties and of their rights of property.  That is why the independence of the judiciary is such a fundamental one as to be enshrined in the Constitution as one of the fundamental Articles of the Constitution.  It is a principle which was secured down the centuries at much trouble and great misery.  It is a principle that we should stand for and it is a principle that should be maintained by every Deputy because it affects the fundamental rights of the poorest citizen of this State.  I deprecate, therefore, any of these suggestions, any of this talk or any of these gibes Deputies so fluently throw across the floor of the House.</P>

      <P>Do not mind Deputy Corish.  I am speaking for myself. I am dealing with something on which I feel very deeply.  I have no axe to grind.  This is a matter in which the public interest is greatly concerned. I can understand Deputy Corish and the Labour Party on this matter.  The reason why I am speaking as I am is because I want to educate the public into the knowledge that we believe in the independence of the judiciary.  We are not endeavouring to <Col N="807" /> maintain our professional privileges, nor has anything I am saying anything to do with our status as members of our profession.</P>
      <P>Therefore, on this Bill I am protesting against the procedure adopted by the Minister which is somewhat cowardly in introducing matters of detail and of controversy in connection with the question of judicial salaries.  Because he was afraid to face that issue, we are not left with an opportunity to discuss the other matters calmly over a period of months.</P>
      <P>The position as regards some of the judicial hierarchy at present is really very serious.  I have letters, and if I read them to the House, some Deputies would be shocked.  I know that to ordinary people, particularly to farmers who have been accustomed to the sort of thing that we get from certain Deputies about high salaries, even the salaries of district justices appear to be a matter of tremendous moment and that they are very high indeed.  But these people have to keep up their own standards.  They have to maintain the standard which is expected from them by the public.  They have to keep aloof, and, above all, they have to keep themselves free from not merely the actuality of corruption but from the possible breath of corruption.  I am afraid that we may be very close to that unless something is done for the more lowly paid of our judicial hierarchy.  That is why I am speaking strongly on this.  That is why I cannot take any more part in the second part of the Bill with its miscellaneous provisions about some of which I feel very strongly indeed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would, therefore, ask that this Bill should be passed with the minimum of recrimination and with the appreciation that we are not giving to particular individuals belonging to a particular profession, or professions, increased remuneration at a time of great difficulty and trial for various sections of our community.  The members of our judicial hierarchy who are citizens of the State have found the impact of the hard times we have gone through. <Col N="808" /> They have found them very great indeed, equally with the unemployed, equally with those facing unemployment and equally with the middle classes, and very few people pretend to look after the interests of the latter class.  They have felt the impact of these hard and harsh times.</P>
    <P>May I say this, and I suppose it is an unpopular thing to say, that what I am saying now about the independence of the judiciary&mdash;at least one of the reasons for this is the prevention of corruption, of putting them above not merely the actuality of corruption but the possibility of it&mdash;would also apply to the salaries given to the Ministers of this State at present?  They are not getting the salaries they are entitled to get, because they are afraid to come to the House and ask for them and because they know that so many things would be misrepresented if they did.  If we did it, you would have the same thing.</P>
    <P>Therefore, I ask for an approach to the consideration of this problem in a calm and detached way&mdash;that we should look at it from the point of view of the public interest.  The Minister himself has said that it is going to cost a very small amount of money.  Of course, it will be represented as something colossal outside.  There has been a case made for it, and the case is that the principle of the independence of the judiciary must be maintained. It is in the public interest that the judiciary should be of such a kind and character that it will not be merely the sport of people who are looking for a job&mdash;something that would perhaps be regarded as secluded and sheltered for the political careerist.</P>
    <P>I want all these judicial appointments, from the most junior district justice to the chief justice, to be of a kind and character that will attract the best in our legal professions, whether they be barristers or solicitors. I do not want them to be merely the goal and object of the political careerist.  You will not get the best brains and the best experience to be culled from the legal profession for these positions unless they are in such a position as will command the ambition of the best brains in both <Col N="809" /> professions, and will command the confidence of the public in the appointees when they are appointed.  As I say, the Minister has our support for this Bill because of the provisions in it in reference to judicial salaries, but I am protesting against the device of introducing something which is in the nature of a trick.</P>
    <P>Personally, I am in the position that I am unable, in the time at my disposal&mdash;coming at the end of a very long session of Parliament when essential financial business has not even been touched much less completed&mdash;to give this Bill the calm and detached consideration that every section of it would need.  We are prepared to give the Bill to the Minister because of the urgency of the provision about the district justices. The Minister has declined to honour the recommendation of the Select Committee in reference to retrospection. I will say no more than this that, even now, in the interests of justice, I would ask him to honour that recommendation, small as it was.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PeadarCowan" hpid="Captain Cowan Captain Cowan">
      <NameTxt>Captain Cowan</NameTxt>
      <P>I want first to say how important is the speech we have just heard from Deputy Costello in regard to the independence of the judiciary and the rights of the citizen.  It is only right that there should be spoken in this House words that must convey to every citizen of this country that the rights, the liberties and the freedom of the citizen are bound up with the independence of the judiciary and once the judiciary is drawn into the mire and the mud by anybody, grave damage is done to the public interest.  I sincerely hope that this Bill will be approached in the way in which Deputy Costello says it should be approached.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The constitutional government of this country is vested in the Oireachtas but the protection of the rights of the citizen is given to our judiciary.  It is so vital that our judiciary should be independent that I could not imagine any elected representative of the people using language that would have the effect in the minds of the public of lowering the high standard of our judiciary.  It is more important to the poor person in this country that the judiciary should be independent than <Col N="810" /> it is to the wealthy person.  The laws that are made by the Oireachtas are laws that must be administered by the judiciary and the poorest person depends on the judiciary to see that justice is done.  By the salaries we give our judges we want to ensure that we will have on our judicial benches men who will not only be above bribery and corruption but will be above the suspicion of anything in the nature of bribery and corruption.  That is why I feel that the provisions of this Bill in so far as they make for an increase in the salaries of our judiciary ought to be welcomed by everybody who realises the importance of the independence of the judiciary.</P>
    <P>One of the fundamental rights of people is to have an independent judiciary that can act and will act independently and free from any pressure from Government, Parliament or from any body or group of citizens.</P>
    <P>I support the recommendations that were made by the special committee, the decisions that have been taken by the Government, to give increased salaries to the judiciary and I support the appeal of Deputy Costello, even at this late hour, to carry out in full the recommendations of the committee and to grant the increases as from the 1st April, 1952.</P>
    <P>With the other provisions in the Bill I am in substantial agreement but I have been alarmed at one section.  I must admit that I had not taken sufficient notice of it until I heard the Minister speaking here this evening. The full effects of Section 12 escaped my notice until I heard the explanation from the Minister.  I would appeal to the Minister to agree to omit Section 12.  Under our law, an accused person has the right, if he is for trial in the Circuit Criminal Court, to ask for a transfer to the Central Criminal Court.  That is a right that has been exercised on a number of occasions but it has not been unduly exercised.  It has been exercised in areas outside Dublin and to a good extent in Dublin.  The right, where the circumstances permit it, to have his trial heard not only by a jury but by a judge in whom he has confidence, <Col N="811" /> is a very valuable right as far as an accused person is concerned.  That is a right of a citizen and judges have objected to that provision although they had no right of objection; it was the law.  The law said that a person had the right to apply for that transfer.  Judges have objected to its exercise from time to time.  They have delivered themselves of certain addreses from the Bench in regard to it.  Although that right has been exercised more in Dublin than elsewhere, it must be remembered that within the Dublin circuit jurisdiction, approximately one-fifth of the people of Ireland reside and in a circuit such as this, where the circuit judges are working day after day, where they are known to the accused persons and to advocates, it is only right that there should be more of these applications in the Dublin circuit than elsewhere.</P>
    <P>I agree to all the other provisions of the Bill, but there is an invasion of the rights of the citizen in Section 12 to which I strongly object.  I would ask the Minister to agree to reconsider that section and to agree to its elimination.  There would be very serious regret, there would be very serious objection, if the right that an accused person had to have his trial transferred from a judge in whom he had no confidence was taken away, as it is proposed to take it away here.</P>
    <P>A number of matters in regard to the courts have been considered.  The long vacation, which means the closing down of our courts for more than two months in the year, is not in the public interest.  I have seen in the newspapers where the Bar Council, I think, or some body already has decided that there will be a reduction in the long vacation by one week.  From the public point of view, one week's reduction is insufficient and that matter should be considered again.</P>
    <P>The second matter, which is important, is the length of the working day. The judicial day should be longer than it is.  A day which starts at 11 o'clock and finishes at 4 o'clock, with a luncheon interval, is not a day's work.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickHogan" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Patrick (Clare) Hogan">

    <Speaker pid="PeadarCowan" hpid="Captain Cowan Captain Cowan">
      <NameTxt>Captain Cowan</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, the length of the working day and the hour at which the court should stop could, in my view, be put into this Bill.  There are two other matters I should like to mention.  In my view, the Dublin Metropolitan District ought to be extended to include the whole City and County of Dublin.  The Minister, of course, in the Bill has power to do that.  The administration of the city and county is mainly directed from the District Court in Dublin.  All justices who operate in Dublin City and County ought to be within the Dublin district so that the senior justices there could allocate them from time to time as required.  Dublin City is growing.  Rathfarnham, Kilmainham, Howth, Ellenfield and Larkhill are all parts of Dublin City at the moment, and justice should be administered for all these built-up areas by the Dublin District Court justices.  I strongly recommend that to the Minister.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would also recommend to the Minister that the Circuit Court judges in Dublin, other than the President of the Circuit Court, who is in a special position as he is also a judge of the High Court, should receive travelling expenses.  Travelling expenses and allowances are provided in the ordinary way for judges who travel on circuit from time to time.  A judge of the Dublin Circuit Court is not entitled to travelling expenses although he travels in and out to work every day.  A judge in the Dublin Circuit Court does more work in the year than several of his colleagues in the rural areas.  That is understandable. The Dublin Circuit Court is going every day of the week and every week in the judicial year.  Thousands of cases of complexity and of tremendous <Col N="813" /> importance to the citizens are dealt with and a judge in the Dublin Circuit receives just his bare salary. If he travels, as he must do, from his home to his court, he pays his own travelling expenses.  I think it would be agreed that a certain sum of money should be made available to cover all these expenses of a Dublin Circuit judge, and I would recommend that for consideration by the Minister.</P>
    <P>Like Deputy Costello, I want to see this Bill passed into law, but I want to see it passed into law without Section 12, because Section 12 could give rise to a very long discussion. Obviously, Section 12 has nothing to do with the structure of the Bill.  So far as it provides for increased jurisdiction and increased salaries, the Bill is one whole, but Section 12 is not entirely appropriate to the Bill.  For that reason I ask the Minister to agree to defer consideration of that section until such time as we have an opportunity of fully discussing it.</P>
    <P>There is one last point I want to make.  For many years solicitors have represented defendants in the Central Criminal Court.  Recently there has been resurrected some rule or practice which would have the effect of denying solicitors audience in the Central Criminal Court.  I understand that there is no specific rule of law in regard to that.  But to deny a solicitor audience in the Central Criminal Court may deny to a defendant the assistance that he is entitled to if he is charged with an offence.  There are many solicitors who practise as advocates in the courts and in whom defendants would have supreme confidence. I do not mind what rules are made in regard to civil matters but in regard to criminal matters a person ought to be entitled to be represented in the Central Criminal Court by the lawyer of his choice, whether that lawyer is a solicitor or a counsel.  I may put down an amendment to this Bill to make provision for that because I am certain that every Deputy will support that.  There is no reason for any alteration in the practice now.  In fact, our whole tendency should be to eliminate the differences that exist between the solicitors' profession and <Col N="814" /> the barristers' profession.  However, that is perhaps a bigger problem than we can decide on a measure that we are all agreed ought to be passed into law.</P>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Lynch Mr. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>I would say he would have a much better chance than I.  For that reason I hope I can claim I can approach the question of judicial salaries as dispassionately as he did.  I am not going to dwell at any length on the question except to agree with him that it was a pity that some device could not be evolved whereby such questions, if they must become a matter of political controversy, could be fixed elsewhere.  On the other hand it is the duty of the elected representatives of the people to look after the expenditure of the public money and in so far as these are public moneys we can hardly disclaim that responsibility. The important matter, however, has been adequately stated by Deputy Costello and I would only add that it is our duty to see that the citizens, no matter how poor they might be, are sure that the judiciary is independent. It is the right of every one of our citizens to feel and to believe that the judiciary are independent of any outside influence in the course of the discharge of their judicial duties.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is fairly well known, as Deputy Costello lightly touched upon, that all is not well financially with every member of the judiciary in this country. The poorest man&mdash;and surely it is in his interests&mdash;should know in coming even to the smallest District Court in the country, that the justice on the bench is completely independent and uninfluenced by the wealthy merchant who might be suing that poor man for some small debt or other.  In so far as reference will be made to the increases <Col N="815" /> that are being provided in this Bill&mdash;increases that in many cases amount to the entire salary of so many of our citizens&mdash;I hope that the lower salaried classes will not be confused by any attempt to mislead them in that regard.</P>
    <P>It is a pity that Deputy Costello did not pinpoint for us in greater detail the very serious objections he had to so many provisions in the Bill other than the provisions giving the salary increases.  He did, however, refer to some of them and I think I could agree with him whole-heartedly that they are matters for a difference of opinion.  I consider his experience in the practice of the law is superior to mine; nevertheless from the public point of view I do not see why anybody should seriously object to the increase in the jurisdiction that is being provided for in this Bill.</P>
    <P>As the Minister pointed out, the value of £300 which is the limit of the jurisdiction of the Circuit Court fixed under the Act of 1924 is considerably lower, lower by about half to-day. Even if it is a rule of thumb surely it is a good basis on which to fix the jurisdiction of the Circuit Court at the present day.  Deputy Costello alleged that no consideration had been given to the type of cases that would be taken in the Circuit Court for claims of an amount between £300 and £600 in damages.</P>
    <P>Surely with his knowledge of the practice of the law he must know that even at the present time throughout the country there are litigants bringing actions for negligence of one type or another, particularly in what are commonly known as running down cases.  If those people feel that the damages to which they would be entitled are somewhat in excess of £300 they are, for the very reason stated by the Minister&mdash;the cost of bringing witnesses to Dublin&mdash;reluctant to bring their case to the High Court.  For that reason in many cases &mdash;and to my knowledge it has happened&mdash;they forgo their right to damages which they might get in excess of £300 and are satisfied to bring their claims in the Circuit Court <Col N="816" /> when they know the maximum they can get is £300.  There are, of course, provisions whereby the defendant can consent to the plaintiff bringing a claim for a sum in excess of £300, but in general a defendant is not willing to concede that to a plaintiff.</P>
    <P>Deputy Costello had one sound objection, in my opinion, to the increase in jurisdiction; that was the case where a plaintiff suing for a sum of more than £600, let us say, £1,000, and where the amount given to him in damages by the jury is £600 or slightly less, his costs would be on the Circuit Court scale and therefore, in the long run, it might have been better for him to have brought the action in the Circuit Court.  There is possibly a sound objection in that respect, but on balance, I think the increase in jurisdiction will find far more favour than maintaining the jurisdiction at its present level.  I repudiate entirely Deputy Costello's suggestion that cases involving claims of £600 are too important for Circuit Court judges.  I do not want to misrepresent him in the slightest degree, but I think that was the clear implication from what he said.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DanielMorrissey" hpid="Mr. Morrissey Mr. Morrissey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Morrissey</NameTxt>
      <P>He said more than that, of course.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Lynch Mr. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>He qualified it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DanielMorrissey" hpid="Mr. Morrissey Mr. Morrissey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Morrissey</NameTxt>
      <P>Indeed he did, very much.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Lynch Mr. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>He instanced two cases. He said that in Dublin or in Cork there are adequate facilities for consulting references and whatever other amenities a Circuit Court judge might deem necessary; that in those two areas a claim for £600 could be properly heard by the Circuit Court judge, but that in general, throughout the country, the circumstances are such that sufficient consideration might not be given by a circuit judge to a claim involving £600 in damages.  Apart altogether from the value of money there are seldom legal principles applying to claims for £300 that would not apply in a claim for £600.  I do not think there is any force in that contention by Deputy Costello.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Costello objects, of course, <Col N="817" /> to the different miscellaneous provisions, as he calls them, that are contained in the Bill as well as the provision for increased salaries; but I think it is well known that apart from this Bill there are only two other Acts on the Statute Book in which the salaries of the judiciary are provided for&mdash;that is the Act of 1924, the original Courts of Justice Act, and the Act of 1947; and the Act of 1924, as he must know, is bristling with miscellaneous provisions, and the Act of 1947, even though it was primarily designed to increase the salaries of the judiciary on that occasion, still has miscellaneous provisions in that very short measure.</P>
    <P>He objects, too, to the fact that the rights of the public may in some degree be interfered with by the fact that more work might be given to the judges in the re-distribution of Circuit Court areas and District Court districts and that therefore the rights of the citizens might be prejudiced as a result.  I do not think having regard to the figures quoted by the Minister that that is likely to arise even with the increased jurisdiction that is being provided for in this Bill.  I know of cases myself where the number of sitting days in some Circuit Court areas is far less than 100, and allowing for all kinds of holidays and Saturdays and Sundays I think that percentage is at the present time far too low. Therefore I think that with a bit of co-operation from the legal profession and from the judges themselves a good workable re-distribution of areas can be evolved and will make for the smoother working and administration of justice and better and fuller employment of the members of the judiciary.</P>
    <P>There is the point made by Deputy Cowan with regard to Section 12.  I agree with him entirely that all the rights of the citizens and particularly the rights of an accused person under any criminal code should be carefully watched by the members of this House, but the manner in which Deputy Cowan put it I think was not quite in accordance with what this section intends to do.  He mentioned that if an accused did not like the judge of a Circuit Court area where the <Col N="818" /> accused committed an indictable offence he had <i>ipso facto</i> a right to bring his case out of that Circuit Court area to the Central Criminal Court.  I think that the provision for transferring cases was primarily given to the accused person to make sure from the jury point of view that that accused person got justice in his trial. It often happens that a certain crime in a certain area may be committed and it is of such a character that the public generally may be so incensed against that accused person that it could happen that they could not put their feelings from their minds when they were going to try his case and, therefore, the accused should have the right in such circumstances to bring his case before a jury which he knows can have no personal feelings with regard to the offence with which he is charged.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DanielMorrissey" hpid="Mr. Morrissey Mr. Morrissey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Morrissey</NameTxt>
      <P>Has not the State got the right to ask for a transfer of a case for their reasons?</P>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Lynch Mr. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>It is being retained.  I am satisfied that the primary intention of the transfer of trial from one Circuit Court area to another or to the Central Criminal Court is in relief of an accused person, to ensure from the jury point of view that that accused person will get a fair trial.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DanielMorrissey" hpid="Mr. Morrissey Mr. Morrissey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Morrissey</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Lynch Mr. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>Well, I am afraid I cannot agree with Deputy Morrissey on that point.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DanielMorrissey" hpid="Mr. Morrissey Mr. Morrissey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Morrissey</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Lynch Mr. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>A judge is appointed and I think without exception we place our confidence in him first of all as members of this House and as members of the public.  I do not think it can be alleged against our judges that <Col N="819" /> they lose sight of the absolute necessity of being impartial in civil or criminal cases and I think in criminal cases generally they lean more on the accused's side if there is any leaning to be done whatever.</P>
      <P>Deputy Costello referred to another point in connection with the transfer of a trial&mdash;the fact that the Dublin Circuit Court trials are the ones that are most transferred.  If it is a fact that an accused living in Dublin may have some apprehension about how he is going to be treated by the circuit judge before whom he might appear and if he feels he is going to get a better crack of the whip from Judge A, Judge B or Judge C of the High Court then he might apply for a transfer of his case to the Central Criminal Court; but the fact is that that accused cannot know in advance what judge of the High Court is to be assigned to the Central Criminal Court for the session in which his case will be called before the Central Criminal Court.  Therefore again I do not see what force is in that argument put forward by Deputy Costello from the point of view of an accused person transferring to one above another.</P>
      <P>I might add, of course, that Section 12 deprives the State similarly of the absolute right of transferring an action from the Circuit Court to the Central Criminal Court.  Nevertheless, I am not so taken with Section 12 as that I must defend it at length.  I think it could be more tightly drafted for one thing, and secondly, if the Minister advances reasons apart from what I have touched upon for its retention in its present form I would be very interested to hear them.  Like Deputy Costello that is one of the provisions on which I am open to conviction; but by and large I think that this Bill is overdue, particularly in its remuneration provisions and in its provision for the increase of jurisdiction of the Circuit Court from £300 to £600 in ordinary cases for damages.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is one point that I want to mention to the Minister and bring home to him as forcibly as I can.  Over a number of months apart altogether from the agitation for the increased <Col N="820" /> jurisdiction there has been adoed an agitation for the establishment of a High Court in Cork.  I know, and it is not because I am a member of this House, that the members of the legal profession in Dublin used that argument in bringing the need of an extra High Court judge before the Minister.</P>
    <P>They use the argument that, in the first instance, it is desirable that a High Court should be established in Cork.  Now that the Minister has given way to these arguments, I hope he will not lose sight of the fact that a High Court is still needed in Cork apart altogether from the increased jurisdiction which he provides in this Bill.</P>
    <P>I do not want to go into all the arguments in detail that I advanced here when I first raised this matter about two years ago but I should like to mention two of them in particular.  A case for the High Court may be called on a Tuesday or Wednesday of one week or may be postponed to the following week.  A litigant from Cork or from any part of the south is bound to have all his witnesses, professional and otherwise, in attendance on the first day on which his case is likely to be called and, in many instances, he is obliged to bring them back the following week.  That is a reason which I think the Minister cannot afford to ignore in consideration of this matter. The second point which I should like to mention concerns the reluctance of litigants to sue for sums in excess of £300 and, if this Bill is passed, for sums in excess of £600, even when they know their claims are far and away above these amounts.  They are reluctant because they fear incurring extra expenses&mdash;expenses which would probably cripple them in the event of failure of their case, if they brought it before the High Court.  Therefore, if the case made for the establishment of a High Court in Cork was one of the factors responsible for convincing the Minister of the necessity to appoint an extra judge at the High Court, I hope that the Minister, in bringing this Bill before this House, will not lose sight of the fact that the establishment of a High Court in the first instance in Cork is still very badly needed.</P>
    <P>I join in the wishes expressed by <Col N="821" /> the two previous speakers that the matter of judicial salaries, the independence of our judiciary, and all the guarantees that that implies to the rights and freedom of our citizens, will not the bandied about in the course of this discussion.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesEverett" hpid="Mr. Everett Mr. Everett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Everett</NameTxt>
      <P>I oppose this Bill and I have opposed it from its introduction. I am more convinced now than ever I was that I am right in my opposition to this Bill.  I heard the legal representatives from all sides of the House&mdash; and none of them agreeing except on the one thing, namely, to grant the judges an increase of £300 or £400 a year, and some of them much more.</P>
      <P>The argument put up by the advocates of this Bill is one of the weakest which I think I have ever heard made for a Bill in my experience as a member of this House.  In the first place, we are told that if we do not grant a huge increase in salary to the judges we will not secure the best men from the legal point of view.  I think that the Minister and some others of us are old enough to remember a time when the administration of our courts was carried out&mdash;and when we had the confidence of the people&mdash;without any legal knowledge; but we had what was more important&mdash;we had common sense.  We had not to go back to the laws enacted during the reign of Queen Anne to interpret the meaning of something in 1952 or 1953.  I think that we were very successful in those days.</P>
      <P>The whole argument of the advocates of this Bill is that somebody has said something to interfere with the independence of the judiciary.  I hope that any references that I have ever made in this House to the judiciary could not be interpreted as in any way casting the slightest reflection on the occupants of the Bench.  They are a credit to any country and we have every confidence in them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not agree with the last speaker, the Parliamentary Secretary to the Government, in his statement about the poor man who goes before the judge and who is opposed by a wealthy man.  We are told that if we do not agree to give the judges this increase <Col N="822" /> in salary that poor man will not get justice.</P>

Deputy Lynch pointed out what the position of the poor man would be.  He as much as said that the judge would not give the poor man justice simply because he was not granted the increase in salary which is advocated here.  As a representative of the workers of this country, I oppose this measure.</P>

      <P>Deputy Cowan spoke about something which was said by somebody.  I want to assure Deputy Cowan and the House that I have never referred to the judiciary of this country in terms that would bring disrepute upon them. I am quite satisfied that the fact that I oppose the granting of an increase in salary to judges at the present time will not interfere with the independence of the judiciary.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is argued that if we protest against the increase we are undermining the independence of the judiciary. What were the Minister's arguments for the granting of this increase in salary?

      <P>Even though they may fight bitterly with one another in court during the hearing of a case, they will not be enemies outside.  To the plaintiff, his counsel will appear a great man who put up a great case for him simply because he abused his opponent.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have heard about the hard work which the judges do.  They work four <Col N="824" /> and a quarter hours per day.  I think that pays the lawyer, too, because he gets a good fee for appearing; I do not say it affects the solicitors, but I think the higher men get paid each day.  They may not advocate working longer than four and a quarter hours per day.  I think a good many people would be glad to receive their present salary for four and a quarter hours' work per day for two or three days of the week.  We are promised that, if they are given this great increase of salary, they may work an extra half hour.</P>
    <P>If we criticise or object to giving an increase in salary to a man with £4,000 a year, we are told that we are interfering with the judiciary and bringing about a position in which there will be a danger that they will be, as they are in some other countries, liable to corruption. Did anybody ever hear such a silly argument put up in a House supposed to be composed of people with common sense?  Again, I will take the judges's part in this connection and say that I do not believe there is any substance in that argument, that if we gave only half the salary we are giving there would not be the slightest fear of the dreadful things mentioned by the speakers supporting this proposal arising.</P>
    <P>I do not agree with Deputy Cowan in his view that justices in the rural areas do not work as long as those in the city.  As I have said, in the past years, we acted as judges and we had the confidence of the people, although we had no legal knowledge and had not read any of the legal textbooks. We worked on a basis of common sense and we had the support of the people, and that our judgments were good is proved by the fact that, when the courts were re-established, these decisions were not reversed or interfered with in any way.  I do not know anything about Dublin, but the man in the rural area has just as good a case to put up as the city man, because he is inconvenienced in having to go to outlying districts and has not got the amenities available to the man in Dublin.</P>
    <P>I agree with Deputy Cowan with <Col N="825" /> regard to Section 12, and I ask the Minister to consider the position I may be in if I happen to appear before one of these judges.  Would I not like to have the right to say that I did not wish to appear before Deputy Cowan but before some other person?  Surely I should be given that right and surely it should not be taken away, as it is by Section 12.  It may be all right for the Parliamentary Secretary if he goes before him because he has supported the increase and may, therefore, have the confidence of all the judges.  I want to protect myself.  I do not say that I shall ever put myself in the position of appearing before one of them, but why take away that right?  There are some men who, we know, may come before these judges soon and they should have the right, as Deputy Cowan pointed out, to ask to be transferred to another judge or jury.  I have been here since 1922 and I have known many of the men who held office as Attorney General and subsequently were appointed judges. I have confidence in them and if I were unfortunate enough to have to come before them, I believe I would get full justice, even though I opposed this increase.  I know that when the poor man goes before them, even if he is not legally represented they go out of their way to help him and he knows he is getting justice.</P>
    <P>The argument which has been put up here is a bad argument and I believe that the case the Minister made is not made in any whole-hearted way, because he would prefer to be on the side of those who put up a similar case on behalf of the persons for whom we are looking for some benefits at present.  I maintain that you are not being consistent.  You are granting these increases because of an agreement between the two large Parties. We heard during the elections that this was a lawyers' Government and that the Opposition was also composed of lawyers&mdash;that it was all lawyers and legal men who were getting into politics.  I want to say here, that, if anything I said on a previous occasion, has been taken by Deputy Cowan or others as casting any reflection on the judges, I assure them that it was never my intention and I hope that <Col N="826" /> anything I say to-night will not be taken as being in the slightest way a personal reflection upon them.  As I say, I know most of them and I consider them worthy Irishmen for their positions.  I feel that they would not take anything I would say here as being in any way personal.</P>
    <P>I am opposing this proposal on principle. The Government are granting to one section of the community who are not as badly in need as other sections these increases at a time when we are told we are not in a position to implement the recommendations of other bodies in relation to civil servants and others.  I think the thing is wrong and other men who have been refused increases, officials of public boards and others, will feel that we are looking after only one class.  Certainly I can assure you that I will not spare the Government around my constituency in relation to pointing out that they are more concerned about granting judges an increase of salary and trying to make their lives more comfortable than they are with looking after those who are in greater need at present.</P>
    <P>I ask the Government to pause for five minutes and consider the position. We have one large section of the community asking for a slight concession&mdash; instead of having to be nine days unemployed before they receive five days' pay, they should at least be paid from the first day of unemployment.  If there was an attempt to remedy that grievance, the Government would be consistent in this proposal, but the Government are refusing to do something for a weaker section of the community, while, at the same time, helping people who, in my opinion, are well able to bear the increases imposed on them at present.  If they wish to be consistent, let them start with the poor man.  Let them grant them an increase and then, when their demands are satisfied, they can look after the well paid section, the judges.</P>

      <P>Like Deputy Everett, I am an ordinary layman.  May I say to him, when he talks about the constitution and personnel of the Committee and about the Committee being just a Committee of lawyers, that I <Col N="827" /> think I am right in saying that, in so far as this Party was concerned, all its nominees for membership of that Committee were laymen?  I do not think there was a single solicitor or barrister among them.  Deputy Everett also says that he is against this proposal to increase these salaries on principle. As a layman, and as one who has, like Deputy Everett, outside and inside the House, agitated on behalf of all sections of the community that the purchasing power of their incomes, whether wages or salaries, should be brought up to the level of present-day costs, let me say to him that I am supporting this on principle.</P>
      <P>The Parliamentary Secretary criticised Deputy Costello for his criticism of the fact that a great number of miscellaneous sections have been tacked on to this Bill and said that the 1924 Act, which was the first Act, also had a great number of miscellaneous sections tacked on to provisions dealing with salaries to be paid to the different branches of the judiciary.  I think it would be truer to say that the salaries in the 1924 Act were just part of the main Bill.  In any case, the salaries for all branches of the judiciary were fixed by this House in 1924 and I do not think that at that time anybody alleged the salaries for the offices concerned were fixed at too high a level.  As a matter of fact, in relation to salaries paid to the judiciary in any other country they were very small.  I think it is true to say that they have, perhaps, got a lower percentage increase on what I call their basic salaries than any other section of the community.  I am not to be taken as arguing against proper provision being made in so far as we can make it for other sections of the community and in particular, for the most needy section.  We can do that and do justice to the other sections of the community without being unjust to this section even though they be few.</P>

      <P>I am not a legal man. I have a few words to say to the Minister. I know a good deal about the Committee.  I thought I knew the main reasons why it was set up, but I will deal with that point later.  I am inclined to make a bow and to say that whatever about allowing myself to be nominated to any other Committee set up by this House I do not think I shall ever again allow myself to be nominated as a member of a committee which would have anything to do with the judiciary.  I had the honour and the great trouble, some 20 years ago, of being made chairman of a committee that dealt with the judiciary of this country.  With a number of equally foolish colleagues of both Houses I spent 14 months' hard work on what I think was a very valuable report, very little of which, unfortunately, was given legal effect to.  I am certainly not satisfied with the outcome of this Committee.  I do not think that either the Minister, or anybody else, can object to the line which Deputy Everett has taken here.  What we all fear and must fear in a debate of this kind is that the judiciary would be used as a sort of political football on the floor of this House.</P>
      <P>Nobody wants to see that.  I am perfectly satisfied that Deputy Everett and his colleagues are at least as anxious as anybody else in the House for the preservation of the full independence of the judiciary.  As Deputy Cowan very properly said, the people who are, shall I say, more directly represented by the Labour Party in this House, are more concerned with the preservation of that independence than, perhaps, any other section of the community.  I do not question for one moment that it is true that no charge of corruption, weakness or yielding to influence, can be laid against any member of the judiciary in this country.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Morrissey</NameTxt>
      <P>Subsequently it was reduced to £800 in respect of some.  I think I could take £1,000 as the basic figure.  I do not think anybody said it was too low or too high, but if a salary of £1,000 was considered a reasonable salary in 1924, I do not think that anybody can say that £1,750, having regard to the fall in the value of money, improves their position.  As a matter of fact, so far as the purchasing power of their salaries is concerned they are in a worse position to-day than they were in 1924.</P>

      <P>I know.  May I say to Deputy Everett that he knows as do I that that is not a good argument? We know that trade unions very properly insist upon a wage for a particular job at £7 a week, but we also know that there are always people who would be prepared to go into that job at £6 a week if they were allowed to do so.  That does not mean that they would be better workmen or that they would give a better return.  The person with £6 per week might be infinitely more costly than the man receiving £7 a week.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I readily grant that one should not in present circumstances in this country, when the great majority of our people are finding it extremely difficult to say the least of it to make ends meet, lightly increase still further the burdens of the State.  At the same time we would not only be unfair but <Col N="830" /> also unjust if we refused to give the increases that are set out here.  As a member of the Committee may I say that this matter was not decided upon lightly nor was it decided upon overnight? It was discussed very fully and in detail over a long period by the members of the Committee, and it was related to a great many other things. The Committee tried to get some balance so that if there was going to be an increase in salary they would get more output from the judges.  It might be no harm if we could apply that all round.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Morrissey</NameTxt>
      <P>With the greatest possible respect, I think I can say without throwing my chest out, there is no speaker in the House who addressed himself so consistently and so clearly to what is in the Bill as I did myself.  Let me say this.  It is worth more than what it is going to cost the State in additional expenditure, to enable our people to have the feeling if they are going to court to <Col N="831" /> have their rights asserted in law, that the man sitting on the bench is being paid a salary that should enable him to be free and independent of every man and organisation in this country. I want, as I say, that we should be consistent.  I will repeat again what I said in the beginning.  We have argued here and we have claimed here&mdash;and rightly&mdash;that the people of this country should at least have the same purchasing power as they had years ago.  We are not asking for any more for the judges.</P>
      <P>May I say about Section 12 that the Minister has made no case for it?  I do not think he has even tried to make a case; I do not think he can make a case for it.  I am not competent to deal with that in the way it has been dealt with by Deputy Costello, Deputy Cowan and the Parliamentary Secretary, Deputy Lynch, but it does seem to me that this right was established and given there to the ordinary citizens, and that legal right particularly in relation to criminal offences ought not to be taken lightly away and certainly should not be taken away except there is an unanswerable case made for its removal.  The Minister has not made that case.  I would say that the right of the citizen should not be taken away, while a similar right to the State stays. The State has the right to arrange to have a case transferred from one place to another.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>I want to come back to this report. Let me say this.  I understand the Minister's position but I am sorry that the Parliamentary Secretary and Deputy Cowan when they were speaking did not speak more strongly and resent more strongly the Government's refusal to give effect to our recommendation regarding retrospective payment.  The Parliamentary Secretary <Col N="832" /> who is chairman of the Committee and Deputy Cowan and other members of the House here who were members of the Committee know that that was one of the most important matters we discussed and it was a matter upon which a number of our recommendations turned and a number of our decisions were taken.  I do not want to go into it fully.  Perhaps, having regard to the principle at stake in the matter, I should go into it fully, but I do not think there is any purpose to be served by my doing so at this moment.  The Government are doing something which I think is entirely wrong, but it is doubly wrong because the Government is doing it twice They are repeating the wrong.</P>
    <P>It is something, I think, that no Government should do, and it is establishing a very bad precedent, and one which is putting the Government&mdash;and I am not confining myself to the present Government, but any Government that may be there&mdash;in a very weak position in the future in relation to any promise or undertaking they may give.</P>
    <P>I am bound to say that I agree with the Minister that there is room for looking into the circuits and the districts of the district justices as they stand at the moment.  I think you can get more efficient and more economic working in our courts by a proper rearrangement.  I am not satisfied, and the more I consider and think about it the less satisfied I am, that there is a case&mdash;and here I differ from all the other people, I understand&mdash;for an additional judge in the High Court. I know that there is congestion and I know that citizens' cases are delayed for months.  I am not satisfied that that is going to be remedied to any extent worth talking about by the appointment of an additional judge.  I am not so much influenced by talk about working days as I am about the long holidays.  It is all right to say the court rises at four o'clock and that is the end of the day's work.  It does not necessarily mean that it is the end of the judge's work.  He does work which may be as vital from the point of view of citizens after four o'clock as anything he does from the bench in the court.  I am not satisfied that there is any good case to be made for those <Col N="833" /> long and numerous holiday periods over the year.  I see no reason for this long vacation.  I do not know how many other breaks or terms there are in the year, but I do think for all the courts to be up completely for a period of two months or whatever it is&mdash;&mdash;</P>

The expense which is essential to litigation in this country&mdash;and indeed for that matter, in other countries&mdash;is bad enough without having unnecessary expense piled on top of it.  It must mean&mdash;and it is with some trepidation I move in here&mdash; not merely delay and disappointment and expense to litigants but also confusion and additional work and perhaps additional expense even to the legal profession in having cases delayed and not taken, and adjourned and so on.  I am, of course, speaking as an ordinary layman, but perhaps, I have been able to acquire some familiarity with the situation as a result of listening for 14 months to lawyers on one Committee, then on another Committee, and in other places, and by listening to lawyers in this House.</P>

There are legal men in this House&mdash;I suppose there is hardly a Parliament in the world that does not include in its membership some legal men.  I think I am putting it mildly when I say that on the whole any legislative assembly whose membership includes a number of legal men is not impoverished thereby. I know some of them can be the greatest darned nuisance and I know <Col N="834" /> some of them are further removed from practical common sense than the average person but that is no reason why we should plaster all of them with the same brush.</P>

I have seen a great many Parliaments come and go and many lawyers come and go, but I think, on the whole, both branches of the profession can give good service in this House.  I want to say with Deputy Costello that I am rather sorry we did not get two Bills instead of one.  I should like to have seen a short Bill dealing with the salaries, pensions and, if you like, the working conditions of the judiciary and a separate Bill dealing with the other matters which it was thought necessary to introduce by way of amendment to existing legislation.

No matter on what side of the House we may sit or whether we are here for a short or a long period, if Deputies try to do what they believe is right, their constituents will not find fault with them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFlanagan" hpid="Mr. S. Flanagan Mr. S. Flanagan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>May I say at the outset that I often felt it a disadvantage to have to sit here and listen to a long debate, there are so many thoughts that come through one's mind.  One aspect of the discussion which struck me immediately&mdash;Deputy Costello mentioned it&mdash;was the fact that there appears to be a division of opinion between, shall we say, the barristers and the solicitors' section of <Col N="835" /> the House on the question of increased jurisdiction.  I think it is a good thing to be candid about these things.  By increasing the jurisdiction of the District Court, we are automatically by law taking out of the hands of barristers the conduct of certain cases and putting it more or less into the hands of solicitors.  I do not suggest that was the reason why Deputy Costello objected to the increased jurisdiction in the District Court or the Circuit Court, but I do know some barristers have certain misgivings about it.</P>
      <P>I think at the same time that the real principle behind this Bill&mdash;and certainly it should be the aim of everybody to secure it&mdash;is to make litigation cheaper for the ordinary man in the street.  Let us take the period from 1922 to 1940, or any time you like, since the establishment of the State, up to say, the beginning of the war in 1939, and look at the price of a cow, a heifer or a bullock during those years.  You will find that you could argue 90 per cent. of breach of warranty cases during those years in the District Court.  There are precious few animals nowadays however, that will not fetch more than £25 a head and that means that you must bring your case into the Circuit Court.  I am talking from the point of view of the man who might have, say, three cows as his total stock.  The fact is not often adverted to, perhaps not sufficiently frequently adverted to, that the amount involved for a farmer in the loss of an animal is greater according as the price of these animals increase, but if he could recover his loss in the District Court, he would be prepared to take a chance for the sake of the extra money involved in fighting the case.  When, however, he has to reckon with counsel's fees, veterinary surgeon's fees and extra solicitor's fees by having to go to the Circuit Court, he says to himself that the game is not worth the candle and that he had better abandon the action altogether, although he knows, or thinks he knows, that he has a good case.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think that the ordinary facts of economic reality should be taken into consideration by Deputies when they <Col N="836" /> are making laws for the benefit of the public.  Surely it is not unreasonable to take our stand on the principle that litigation should, if possible, be made cheaper for the general public.  Surely that should be the aim of the Dáil in legislation of this kind.  If you accept that principle, you must agree that some increase in jurisdiction is needed in the District Court and in the Circuit Court.  You can see many other different types of cases in which economic reality has forced cases out of the jurisdiction of the District Court and the Circuit Court and thereby put it outside the ability of the ordinary citizen whose means are not very great, to pursue his legal rights.  It does seem wrong that should be so.  It does seem right that we should make every effort to provide a ready means of obtaining justice for everyone.</P>
    <P>There is an old axiom in the lawcourts in England that the courts are open to everyone and that everyone is equal before the law.  I think we should try to make everybody here equal before the law.  I would go even further than the present Bill in relation to increasing the jurisdiction of the District Court.  Generally speaking, I would increasing the jurisdiction of of the District Court to the figure of £100 in contract and in tort.  If we do that we will be merely taking cognisance of modern conditions.</P>
    <P>Another matter to which no reference has been made by any speaker so far and to which, so far as I know, there is no reference in the Bill is the fact that there is no title jurisdiction in the District Court at the moment. There never has been any title jurisdiction there and it has very often happened that a case is brought in the District Court, expenses incurred by both sides, the case possibly threequarters heard when some question crops up as to title&mdash; perhaps a dispute between neighbours in the matter of trespass, fencing or something like that; immediately such a question arises the district justice has to tell the parties to pack up since he has no jurisdiction in the matter.  The litigants have then to go no matter how trivial the question at issue may be, to the Circuit Court and start all over again. <Col N="837" /> Time and money have already been lost in the District Court.</P>
    <P>I would urge on the Minister the insertion of a provision in this Bill giving the District Court jurisdiction in title up to £10.  In doing that I believe he would be making litigation cheaper for the man in the street.  I have discussed the provisions of this Bill and the provisions of the Bill that was withdrawn with colleagues and the general opinion is that the District Court should have jurisdiction up to £100 in landlord and tenant cases.</P>
    <P>It may appear that I am going too far in suggesting that jurisdiction should be increased as radically as that.  I do not think I am going a bit too far.  I think it is impossible to make a case against giving the District Court some jurisdiction in title.  I think it is impossible to resist the claim that litigation should be made cheaper for the man in the street. Taking into account the variations in values at the present time I think there should be jurisdiction in the District Court up to £100 in contract and tort and in landlord and tenant cases.</P>
    <P>In relation to the Circuit Court, I would compensate the Circuit Court for any loss of work consequent upon the increases in the jurisdiction of the District Court that I have suggested and in order to do that I think the limit in the Circuit Court should be raised to £1,000.  Deputy Cowan said that one has to wait years in the High Court at the present time.  That is literally true and there is every case to be made for the appointment of an <Col N="838" /> extra High Court judge.  I think, however, that there is at least as strong a case to be made for taking as much as possible of the work of the High Court and transferring it to the Circuit Court.  That can be achieved by increasing the jurisdiction of the Circuit Court in all matters up to £1,000.</P>
    <P>The figures given by the Minister relative to the hours of work done by Circuit Court judges would suggest that the judges could cope with the extra work that would be thrown on them by the increases in jurisdiction that I have suggested.  I would not like to be taken as saying that I do not think they are working hard enough at the moment.  I do not think that at all.  Many people seem to forget, particularly men like Deputy Everett, the burden of responsibility that rests upon the bench.  However humble the court may be, the occupant of the bench has a grave responsibility towards the people that come before him.  I do not think Deputy Everett can be sincere when he says that the salaries of judges and district justices should not be increased at all at the present time. I cannot comprehend how he could be sincere in that and I think he is pandering to rather low political motives. Nobody gains more by the independence of the judiciary and by its honourable discharge of its grave responsibilities than does the poor man. That point was admirably made by the Parliamentary Secretary to the Government.</P>
