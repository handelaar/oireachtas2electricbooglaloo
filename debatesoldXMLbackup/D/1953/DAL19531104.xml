      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Industry and Commerce whether the Prices Advisory Body provided any opportunity to the Wholesale Bottlers' Association, or any other interested party, to make representations to them in connection with their inquiry into the prices charged in Ireland for mineral water and beer bottles, before approving the present scale of prices.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>The Prices Advisory Body did not invite any association of bottlers, or other users of bottles, to make representations to them in connection with this matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister feel that a procedure which involves only discussing a matter of this kind with a monopolist and with none of the users of the commodity constitutes an adequate inquiry into the prices charged for the commodity in question?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>There are obvious difficulties in discussing with the customers of a concern a proposal to increase the prices of its products and I presume the Prices Advisory Body took that difficulty into account when they carried out the procedure in this case.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister not avail of this occasion to express a view that where the Prices Advisory Body are reviewing a proposal to increase the price of a commodity obtainable from no other source in this country he is of the opinion that they ought at least to hear the views of organised users of the commodity even though they may feel themselves bound to conduct a particular restricted discussion for such purpose&mdash;that they ought at least to hear them?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I could not say that the Prices Advisory Body did not hear the views of the users of bottles.  They did not interview them before making the recommendation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware that, in fact, before any of the four recommendations&mdash;for the price of bottles has been increased no less than four times in the last 12 months&mdash; the Prices Advisory Body did not hear representations from the users?</P>
    </Speaker>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>The prices were not increased four times in 12 months.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>How many times?</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>Once.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>If it is not four times it is three.  In no case, however, was the opinion of any category of users of bottles sought or heard before the recommendation was made and I suggest that it would be useful if the Minister would say that that procedure certainly does not meet the requirements.</P>

In all cases the preparation of annual accounts and their presentation to Dáil Éireann are required by statute.  So far as it is available the information requested by the Deputy in regard to State financing, profits or losses and return to the Exchequer is given in these accounts.  The first accounts of An Bord Iascaigh Mhara, which was established in April, 1952, will be presented shortly.  The Great Northern Railway Board which has a capital liability of £2,250,000 to the Minister for Industry and Commerce in respect of the compensation paid by him on the transfer of the assets of the Great Northern Railway Company, was established as recently as the 1st September, 1953.</P>

      <P>A practice has grown up that if you ask for particulars of this kind you are referred to the accounts. We could all go to the Librarian of Oireachtas Éireann and he would tell us that.  The Minister has a staff which at least, in a secondary sense, is designed to help Oireachtas members to get the information they want.  An experienced civil servant can collate that kind of information in an hour and it might take a Deputy, no matter how experienced, with the assistance of the Librarian, two days to get it.

I do not think we should take up the time of valuable civil servants in repeating work that has already been done and better set out than could ever be a <Col N="1279" /> mere synopsis given in a parliamentary question.

      <P>The amount of dollars spent on the purchase of prunes and seedless raisins from the U.S.A. was 977,000 during the year 1952 and 625,000 during the first nine months of 1953.</P>
      <P>As regards the second part of the Deputy's question, I would remind him that the Minister for Finance is concerned with the allocation of exchange facilities for external payments.  The initiative in seeking exchange facilities for imports rests with the trade and facilities have been provided to the full extent sought for imports of dried fruit from Greece, Turkey and other Middle Eastern countries.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When dollar exchange is provided. it is to meet requirements of particular types or qualities not available from the Middle East or available only at higher prices than the U.S. products. A compulsory diversion of this trade to non-dollar sources would be to the disadvantage of the Irish consumer. <Col N="1282" /> The gain even from the foreign exchange standpoint is not apparent in present circumstances seeing that sterling area deficits with the European Payments Union, which includes countries like Greece and Turkey, involve settlement in gold, in whole or in part.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Finance if he is aware that the Valuation Office has increased the valuation of houses of religious orders supported from the charity of the people, and also parish halls in rural areas; and, if so, whether he will take steps, if necessary by the introduction of proposals for legislation, to prevent such increases.</P>

    <P>
      <Col N="1283" /> I am informed by the Commissioner of Valuation that under the Valuation Acts the valuation of any building must be revised, regardless of liability for rates or otherwise, if a request for revision is received from the secretary or clerk to the local authority concerned. Houses of religious orders and parish halls, in common with all other buildings, are, therefore, in accordance with the Acts, subject to valuation and, on revision, to increases or decreases in valuation, as the case may be.  Under Section 2 of the Valuation (Ireland) Amendment Act, 1854, the Commissioner of Valuation distinguishes as exempt from rating all property occupied for charitable purposes, public purposes, or the purposes of science, literature and the Fine Arts.  It is settled law that the houses of religious orders and parish halls are not entitled to be distinguished as exempt from rating on the ground of either charitable or public user.</P>

      <P>In view of the fact that the Minister realises, from the information that is at his disposal and at the disposal of the Commissioner of Valuation, that very serious inconvenience has been caused to certain religious orders as a result of the very great increase in valuations, which means an increase in the price of electricity and an increase in the rates and that those institutions are kept up by the charity of the people, does he not consider that, if there is to be legislation covering such cases, it is time such legislation was introduced? Is the Minister further aware of the fact that the members of young farmers' clubs and Muintir na Tíre are erecting parish halls in order that life may be made more attractive in the rural areas for the people so as to encourage them to remain in Ireland?</P>

      <P>In this instance, the Land Commission served notice of withdrawal; the owner objected and the Judicial Commissioner disallowed his objection. The proceedings are, accordingly, discontinued.</P>
      <P>The same section of the Act provides that in such a case the Land Commission shall not acquire the lands with-out the owner's consent within a period of seven years.</P>

      <P>The total strength of the Garda Síochána in the Dublin Metropolitan Division on the 30th April, 1948, was 1,648.  Due to the stoppage of recruiting, the strength fell steadily, and on the 31st March, 1953, had reached a figure of 1,425, the lowest strength since 1937.  Following the reopening of recruiting, 176 newly-trained Guards were allocated to Dublin in April, 1953.  The following are the figures asked for by the Deputy:&mdash;</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Justice if he will amend the regulations in respect of Garda recruiting so that suitable applicants who are native Irish speakers and come from homes in which the language is traditionally used may be eligible to be recruited if not more than one inch below the present height requirements.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not propose to <Col N="1297" /> amend the Garda Síochána (Appointment) Regulations to comply with the Deputy's request.  The minimum height for recruits as prescribed by the regulations is 5 ft. 9 in.  To accept candidates of lower stature would impair the general efficiency of the Force.</P>

      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>I think the small policeman would not be seen in a crowd, first of all, and I am also aware that in the Gaeltacht there are plenty of big people well over 5 ft. in height.  The Deputy will agree that, although there are good goods in small parcels, a big policeman is more useful than a small one.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RichardJamesMulcahy" hpid="General Mulcahy General Mulcahy">
      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister not consider that it is time to review the position with regard both to the Gaeltacht and to the Garda?  Is he not aware that in some of the Irish-speaking districts that are wasting away, where the population is reducing, there are still large families of character and ability that are carrying on the language traditionally spoken back through the ages and that there are young people there of 5 ft. 8 in, and 5 ft. 8½ in. who are now being driven to emigrate simply because the Garda will not be open to them in a way that would be very reasonable?  I would appeal to the Minister and his colleagues to review that situation.  It is rather heart-breaking to see in a family in an Irish-speaking district a young fellow of 5 ft. 8½ in. who is condemned to emigrate simply because it would &ldquo;impair the efficiency of the Garda&rdquo; if he entered when ½ in. less than the standard.  I would ask the Minister how many members of the Garda at the present time are less than 5 ft. 9 in.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>I could not answer that. Under the regulations up to the last time Gardaí were recruited, every one of the applicants under 5 ft. 10 in. was rejected.  This time it is 5 ft. <Col N="1298" /> 9 in.  I think 5 ft. 9 in. ought to be the lowest for a Garda.  I am quite certain that in the Gaeltacht areas there are plenty of people well over 5 ft. 9 in.  Everyone who wishes to be a Guard could hardly expect to be a Guard, but anyone knows that in the Gaeltacht generally they are big people and that there is no scarcity of big men.</P>

      <P>I agree that any fine is a hardship whether it be £20, £10 or £5.  Having regard to the fact that in one of the first four or five questions in the application form, it is deliberately put to the applicant that he should use native material, where available, and the applicant gives such an undertaking, it should be brought home to him when he departs from the assurance he has given in the form that he has failed in his undertaking and personally I do not regard a fine of £10 as excessive.</P>

Where it is clearly shown that the applicant departs from the written undertaking he gave, I do not think that in a grant of £250, £225 or £175 a penalty of £10 is in any way excessive for a departure from that undertaking.</P>

      <P>May I ask the Minister if he was aware that the appointee is a secondary teacher, a young man and unmarried?  He may at present, as he did up to recently, act as joint secretary of the local Fianna Fáil Cumann. Other men, responsible citizens with large and dependent families, possessing all the qualifications, were not considered.  On what particular ground did the appointment take place?  Was it because the appointee was a secondary teacher in full-time employment, that he was an unmarried man, or that he was joint secretary of the local Fianna Fáil Cumann?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>It would take some time to answer that question in full; but in regard to post offices, because of the size of Abbeyfeale very special considerations enter into the appointment. Abbeyfeale, along with eight or ten other towns, comes very near the limit for a Civil Service post office, and for that reason every care was exercised in making the appointment.</P>

      <NameTxt>Brendán Mac Fheórais</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs whether, in view of the dissatisfaction that frequently arises over the appointment of sub-postmasters where vacancies occur, he will consider as a measure of public policy the purchase or erection of premises suitable for sub-post offices and have the appointment to posts as sub-postmasters the responsibility of the Civil Service Commission.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>In relation to the rather large number of appointments of sub-postmasters made each year, the number of cases in which there is any evidence of dissatisfaction is small. For instance, in the three years ended 31st October last there were 302 appointments of sub-postmasters, divided almost equally between new appointments and transfers, but over the same period only nine cases were the subject of parliamentary questions. This is, no doubt, due to the painstaking work of the officers and the selection committee in assessing the claims of applicants.  Where there is dissatisfaction, it is usually confined to unsuccessful applicants.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1311" /> I have not received personally a single complaint from the public about the service given by the person appointed, while the number of complaints dealt with by district post-masters or officers of the Department is negligible.  Sub-postmasters, of whom there are over 2,000, give an efficient and economical service and I see no advantage but, rather, considerable disadvantage and enormous expense, in replacing them by a Civil Service class housed in Government-owned premises.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanCorish" hpid="Brendán Mac Fheórais Brendán Mac Fheórais">
      <NameTxt>Brendán Mac Fheórais</NameTxt>
      <P>Surely the Minister is not serious when he submits that in only nine cases in the past three years has dissatisfaction been expressed about the appointment of sub-postmasters and sub-post-mistresses. Would he not consider the suggestion which is made in the question, having regard to the way in which local authorities get premises for use as dispensaries&mdash;they rent them or build them?  If the Minister does not adopt the method that I have put forward in all seriousness and sincerity, he should try to devise some other method of making these appointments because the country believe&mdash;&mdash;</P>

That may have been the case before the Minister's time and before the previous Minister's time.  Perhaps it has always been done.  That system will obtain unless a new method is devised.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>As regards the other parts of the question, I am informed by the Dairy Disposal Company, Limited, that the closing by the company of Glenbeigh cream-separating station in August, <Col N="1314" /> 1953, was a purely temporary expedient designed to facilitate the experiment which the company was conducting in the neighbouring areas of Cromane and Caragh Lake where the need for the provision of creamery facilities was at that time being tested by means of a lorry service.  It was intended to replace the lorry for a short time by a travelling creamery operated by the manager of Glenbeigh cream-separating station, but the company subsequently reopened the Glenbeigh premises and secured another manager for the travelling creamery.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>As regards the prices payable by the Ministry of Food for Irish pork and bacon under the current agreement, I would refer the Deputy to my reply to a question on the subject by Deputy Lehane on 5th June, 1952.  The schedule of prices at present receivable by Irish exporters from the Pigs and Bacon Commission for exports of pork carcases to the Ministry of Food was published on 17th September last, and a revised price schedule, which comes into operation on 9th November, was <Col N="1315" /> published on 30th October.

    <Speaker pid="MichaelHilliard" hpid="Mr. Hilliard Mr. Hilliard">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hilliard</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="GeraldBartley" hpid="Mr. Bartley Mr. Bartley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bartley</NameTxt>
      <P>With your permission, a Cheann Comhairle, I propose to take Questions Nos. 72, 73 and 74 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>From 1950 to early this year, the home production of clay drainage pipes was insufficient to meet requirements <Col N="1316" /> for the purposes of the land reclamation scheme.  Consequently, it was necessary to import pipes.  They were imported from the Netherlands and Germany.  Small quantities were also brought in from the Six Counties.</P>
    <P>Supplies of these imported clay drainage pipes are not held in large quantities throughout the country.  At present there are approximately only 250,000 imported pipes held by my Department in store in different parts of the country at a total cost and present value of about £6,000.</P>
    <P>Imports of clay drainage pipes are regulated with due regard to the interests of home manufacturers.  Since 1950 more than 20,000,000 pipes have been imported, of which, as already stated, only 250,000 remain in dumps. In the last six months the only case of pipes imported by my Department was one in June, 1953.</P>
    <P>I am aware that one of the manufacturers claims to have 1,000,000 pipes on hands.  This is, in itself, no evidence that home production would have been capable of meeting demand during the years from 1950 or indeed is yet capable of meeting it.  The quantity represents only about ten weeks' production.</P>
    <P>The question of future imports of clay drainage pipes will depend solely on the position of supply and demand. The matter will be carefully kept under review at all times.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="JohnMcQuillan" hpid="Mr. McQuillan Mr. McQuillan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McQuillan</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Parliamentary Secretary aware that the owner of these famous salmon and eel fishing rights in Galway has been negotiating for the past month in London with a company for the sale of these rights? If that is allowed to happen, does the Parliamentary Secretary not think it worthy of consideration that an enhanced price will have to be paid to the new owners if the present owner succeeds in selling?  Under the circumstances, would he not make it clear to would-be purchasers that the State intends to acquire these fishing rights for the use of the people of the country and that it would be a foolish proceeding on the part of any private individual or company, in London or elsewhere, to purchase these rights at the moment, thus giving the present owner a chance to get rid of them at a first-class price?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeraldBartley" hpid="Mr. Bartley Mr. Bartley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bartley</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy is aware that the policy in relation to this matter is enshrined in the 1939 Fisheries Act and, therefore, knowledge of it should be available to most people who would be wealthy enough to contemplate a purchase of this large scale.  I have indicated to interested persons who have approached me what the policy in the matter is and that the policy will be implemented as soon as it conveniently can be.  I think I have indicated already that it is necessary to enact certain modifications and that when these have been enacted Government policy in the matter will then be implemented.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Esmonde</NameTxt>
      <P>When I moved to report progress last night I was dealing with C.I.E. and the statement of the Minister that C.I.E. proposed to raise some £10,500,000 for the purpose of capital expenditure.  The Minister did not indicate very clearly in his statement opening this debate where exactly the £10,500,000 was coming from.  Is it possibly considered that this money is to be put into C.I.E. as a part of capital investment?  Are we going to have some of the money which was subscribed in the recent loan used, as it is supposed to be used for the purpose of capital investment, for the purpose of rehabilitation of C.I.E.?  I certainly do not feel myself that there would be justification for using that sum that way.  I would like the Minister when he is replying to this debate to give us some indication as to where it is proposed to get that money from.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>He stated also that the purpose of getting this money was to rehabilitate C.I.E. and that by replacements and capital expenditure it was hoped to cut the annual loss.  I do not know.  That <Col N="1320" /> may be so.  I am sure I hope, and so do all other Deputies, that it will be so, but there does not seem to be any real indication on the part of C.I.E. that they have altered their scheme of organisation or that they have any really new suggestions to put forward other than cutting fuel costs.  I still note, anyway, in my part of the country, that the buses and the trains are running in opposition to each other, and so long as they are doing that I do not see how they are going to stop losing money.</P>
    <P>I said last year, when we were discussing this, that I thought it would be more in the interests of the whole economy of the C.I.E. if they would run buses where trains do not ply; in other words, if they would feed the trains by buses from outlying districts. We have to accept the fact that the railways have to be kept in existence. In a time of national emergency, even though times are changing, we cannot do without the railways.  They are still essential to the economy of any country. I do not think they can be expected to survive as long as they are put into opposition with the buses.  It does not make common sense to me.  If the people of this country are going to be asked to give £10,500,000 to C.I.E., they ought to be given a guarantee anyway that C.I.E. is going to be reorganised in its own house before it comes to look for the money.</P>
    <P>I understand that the bus services in Dublin are just the one part of this organisation that really pays a fairly substantial dividend.  It seems to me quite unnecessary that the citizens of Dublin&mdash;and not only the citizens of Dublin but those who come up from the country&mdash;should have to stand in queues at the rush hours waiting for buses.  Why cannot they run more buses?  After all, it is the one thing that is giving them a remunerative return.  As far as I can see, the timetable provides an extra one or two buses in the rush periods, and there is nothing like sufficient to meet the requirements of the citizens of Dublin. They are entitled to a better bus service, and it would be in the interest of C.I.E. to give them that.  The Minister, who as Minister for Industry and <Col N="1321" /> Commerce is the authority responsible in this House for the administration of C.I.E., such as it is, should put that up to them.</P>
    <P>Regarding An Bord Fáilte, we on this side of the House did not agree to have the two organisations to run the tourist trade.  It is not necessary and it has not proved a very satisfactory arrangement&mdash;one organisation for the purpose of administering the tourist traffic here, and another organisation for the purpose of dealing with the advertising and the external relations of the tourist trade here.  The board itself has probably done fairly good work and its scheme of grading hotels is satisfactory.  A great many more people are coming to rely on the board's hotel grading than heretofore &mdash;people coming into this country.  I would suggest to the Minister that he would put it up to the board that as well as producing a booklet which enables tourists here to find where they are to stay and to work out the hotels, they should also produce a combined booklet in which they would have small carefully drawn maps of different parts of the country, so that the tourists might have to hand in one individual booklet a guide which would give them the hotels and also a look at the country where they are going to.  It would also be a good idea if it were drawn up on a mileage scheme.  People touring, even ourselves who live here in Ireland, if we are going to a certain hotel or district would find it convenient if there was a map on which we could see where we are turning up and know the mileage of what we have to cover from one place to another. The board are pretty well up to date in their grading of hotels and I find them satisfactory myself in my own constituency.</P>
    <P>With regard to An Tóstal, I do not think that An Tóstal was a success last year.  Of course any festival, such as An Tóstal is, is probably not a success in the first year.  Rome was not built in a day.  Everything takes a certain amount of time, but at the same time I do not see how it could be a success at the time of the year at which it was brought about.  I take it that the idea of An Tóstal was to endeavour to extend <Col N="1322" /> the tourist season, but surely if it was intended to do that the time for An Tóstal was either at the beginning or at the end of the tourist season. Everybody knows that the tourist season in this country does not begin, in any strength anyway, until in or about the latter part of May or the beginning of June.  The strong part of the tourist season here ends in the latter part of August and the beginning of September.  One would think that ordinary intelligence would convey to those who are associated with it that that is the time to establish An Tóstal if they want to extend the season here.  I have spoken to hoteliers in my constituency and to hoteliers in other parts of the country as well.  They have been unanimous in their opinion that the period in which An Tóstal is held is the wrong period.  I think the results last year do not justify the holding of the festival at that period of the year.  That is the opinion, also, of the various hoteliers with whom I have spoken. Furthermore, a lot of them have told me that they have not been consulted in the matter, one way or the other. I do not know whether or not it is too late now to change the date of the festival for next year.  Having listened to the greater part of this debate and having read the speeches, I think that it is practically the unanimous opinion in this House that An Tóstal is held at the wrong time.  I do not know whether or not the Minister has some specific reason for holding it at that time of the year and, if he has, perhaps he would inform the House of it when he is replying to this debate.</P>
    <P>I come now to the question of trade with countries behind the Iron Curtain. Some years ago we bought 5,000 tons of barley from behind the Iron Curtain.  It was shipped into this country and sold to the Irish people. What they paid for it was far in excess of what native Irish barley was sold for.  That transaction seems to have been the beginning of trade in recent years with countries behind the Iron Curtain.  I fail to see why we should deal with these countries if we can buy the same goods in countries in any other part of the world.  Every law <Col N="1323" /> that obtains and every attitude of those who govern behind the Iron Curtain is inimical to the feelings and sentiments of every Deputy of this House, whether he sits on the Government Benches or on the Opposition Benches.  Our trade is not extensive with the countries behind the Iron Curtain, although I understand that we are importing fairly considerable quantities of cheap jewellery and things of that nature from Czechoslovakia. I asked a parliamentary question here some time ago in regard to this matter and I was informed that we have a fair amount of trade with the Iron Curtain countries.  What do they buy from us in return?</P>

      <P>What can they offer us in return?  Nothing.  Our nation is a Christian nation and we have a very old Christian tradition here.  What is the sense in our buying from these countries?  The Minister has been travelling around the world a good deal lately.  Doubtless, he will have found everywhere, as I found, evidence of the significance of our tradition. We are an old and loyal Christian nation.  We have always been that and, by the grace of God, we always will be.  Such of our trade as we have with Iron Curtain countries is, in my opinion, entirely and absolutely wrong. These are my personal sentiments. They may not be held by everybody else here, but I hold them to the last degree.  I believe that we should not send one farthing of Irish money behind the Iron Curtain.  It is a known fact that any trade that is done with those countries does not benefit the ordinary man or woman there.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In those countries the men and women are not free.  They are held in slavery and bondage.  The profits do not go to the ordinary citizen in those countries because the ordinary citizen there does not get even a decent standard of living or a decent wage. Any money which is made by people in Iron Curtain countries is handed over to the Government.  These profits are taken by a grasping, avaricious <Col N="1324" /> Government for the purpose of laying the money on one side to build up the greatest autocracy that we have ever known to enslave the world.  There is something wrong when the Irish nation, with its Christian tradition, fosters and aids and abets trade with those countries.  I say this as a private Deputy.  One of the greatest outrages ever perpetrated on this historic nation was when, quite recently, a Russian ship flaunting the red flag bearing the hammer and the sickle-the greatest problem of imperialistic autocracy and unchristianity since the days of the crusades&mdash;sailed up the Liffey in all its vaunted glory to deliver timber to this country.  I believe it is possible that the present Government did not know that the ship was coming into port here but I should like to say this to them: Let it be the last time, so long as Ireland is a free nation, that a Russian ship bearing that flag comes, with the consent of the Irish people, to take £85,000 worth of money out of this country.  Let it be the last time that that happens.  Let it be the last time that a Russian ship flying the red flag with the hammer and sickle on it will have an opportunity of entering a port in this Christian country with its age-old tradition of Christianity.  Let it be the last time that a ship flying that flag will have an opportunity of sailing into the port of the capital city of Ireland so long as we are a free nation.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Hickey</NameTxt>
      <P>I had expected to hear a different statement by the Minister from the one which he made to this House when introducing this Estimate. I thought it would be much more vigorous because the circumstances and the times are demanding a different and vigorous approach to our economic problems.  In the first place, I consider that too much economic power is concentrated in the hands of too few people in this country to-day.  That economic power in the hands of a few people can influence Government policy and can also determine our standard of living and our employment. I must say that I would expect that this Minister for Industry and Commerce <Col N="1325" /> would take everybody into his confidence and tell us the actual position of this country to-day.  I claim that that position is not very satisfactory. We have a very large number of unemployed and we have the further problem that combines which are operating outside this country, and which have their head offices outside this country, are now coming in and establishing sub-offices over here.  Recently I had occasion to make inquiries about the operations of certain companies. When I started to look for the information in Government Buildings I discovered that these companies are not registered here at all.  When I made inquiries in regard to another company which, to my knowledge, is financially dug in fairly well in this country, I was told that I could not be given the information which I sought because the company was a private firm whose head office was outside this country. For these reasons I expected that the Minister would have taken this House into his confidence and told us what he intends to do in the future instead of trying to carry on with the operation of a system that has kept us where we are.</P>
      <P>It is rather extraordinary that, after 30 years of native government, our population is static.  There has been no increase in our population.  I am satisfied that that is mainly due to the fact that we are trying to operate a system under which we are not masters in our own house.  It would be very interesting to every Irish person to learn who really owns this country at the moment. In that respect, I can do no better than refer to a report which was written by Stacy May and which was prepared by Ibec Technical Services Corporation under contract with the Government of Ireland.  The report was completed in June, 1952.  It is very interesting to read what other people think of the conditions prevailing in this country.  For some time past, we on the Labour Benches have been asking the Government questions about our shipping.  We are anxious that this country shall have a shipping fleet of its own to carry goods in and out of the country.  What do we find?  This is what the report states:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1326" />&ldquo;Among the many paradoxes that may be found in Ireland is the circumstance that it is progressing best in the field where it carries the greatest handicaps, and least in the one in which it has, seemingly, the greatest natural advantages.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I am sure nobody will dispute that fact.</P>
    <P>It goes on to state:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;At least 60 per cent. of incoming and outgoing cargoes in Ireland's international trade is carried in British ships and something approaching half of all the insurance business transacted in Ireland appears to be in the hands of British companies.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I look upon the insurance companies which operate outside this country as being nearly as powerful to-day as the banking system.  I find that, during the past eight years, insurance companies which operate outside this country collected in premiums £49,141,077 up to 1951.  If we could get the returns for 1952, I am sure we would find that they were at least as high as, if not a good deal higher than, the figure for 1951 and, in 1951, a sum of £8,432,000 was collected, which means that in nine years they collected £57,000,000 in premiums from this country.  That does not include premiums in respect of marine, aviation and other classes of business.  Does the Minister not agree that the time is ripe for dealing with that situation?</P>
    <P>Let us come now to the question of shipping.  I took the trouble recently of finding out what we are paying in respect of freight in and out of the country and I find that, in the period 1947-50, we imported £557,468,052 worth of goods and exported £221,786,606&mdash;a total of £779,254,658. The basis of the freight on that value of cargo is reckoned at 6 per cent., which would mean that in three or four years, freight represented £46.8 million. Irish Shipping, Limited, earned £6.4 million, so that we paid foreign steamship owners an annual sum of over £10,000,000.  Look at the number of ships we could have purchased for that money.</P>
    <P>I looked up Lloyds' List recently and found some most interesting information <Col N="1327" /> in it.  In the issue of 31st last month, it stated that 41,357 tons of shipping were handed over to German ship owners, consisting of nine cargo ships, two tankers and four motor coastal vessels.  They have under construction as well 73 cargo ships of 232,200 tons, four tankers of 9,100 tons, and nine motor vessels of 2,600 tons. I was informed by a Cork man who was recently in Germany that over 88 per cent. of their docks, cranes and other harbour equipment had been shattered during the war.  Yet here we are, a country which should have a really strong merchant fleet, with about 47,000 tons of shipping.  What do we find in Switzerland, where there is not a port within 100 miles?  They have 230,000 net tonnage of shipping. I read in the <i>Swedish News</i> last May that the net income from the Swedish foreign shipping was £66,000,000.  Is it not time for us to think seriously of setting about getting a number of ships in a big way?  I understand that we will not get the six or seven ships we have ordered until 1956 or 1957.  The Germans are buying up second-hand ships at £43 a ton, and until such time as we deal seriously with the matter of having ships of our own, we will never make the progress we are anxious to make.</P>
    <P>I listened to Deputy Vivion de Valera last night making a great plea for the people engaged in industry. He taunted the Labour Party with standing for what he called nebulous uncontrolled socialism and indiscriminate nationalisation.  I suggest that that is not a fair comment on the speech delivered by Deputy Larkin, because Deputy Larkin, any more than any member of the Labour Party, does not stand for nebulous uncontrolled socialism and indiscriminate nationalisation. We do believe in having our basic industries under public control because it is in the interests of the community that it should be so.</P>
    <P>Deputy de Valera made the case that nationalisation was a failure and he quoted the position of C.I.E., but I submit that C.I.E. was put in the position in which it was when we took it over by private enterprise.  We had <Col N="1328" /> to take our share in the taking over of the Great Northern Railway because private enterprise failed.  He quoted the Sugar Company and the E.S.B. as successful undertakings because they were run very much on the lines of private enterprise, but I suggest that it is scarcely fair to make that comparison. While the E.S.B. is doing a good job&mdash;and we give it every support &mdash;we feel that it would be working much more in the interests of the community if it were more under public control.  We had to pay £1,700,000 last year and £1,125,000 the year before in interest on money borrowed and that is an unfair tax on the users of electricity.</P>
    <P>The Deputy talked about the payment of income-tax but the ordinary worker is paying income-tax in the same way as the people whom Deputy de Valera spoke about as being important factors in the payment of income-tax.  He said that over-all profits had not been excessive in the sense in which they were represented as excessive and added that he had a list of profits from 1938 to 1948.  I took the trouble to look up the figures for profits and for surtax payers from 1938 and I found that in 1938 the number of persons chargeable to surtax was 2,550, whose incomes totalled £10,558,872, an increase of 180 persons over the previous year.  In 1944-45 the number was 3,689, an increase of 1,139; that is, in seven years we created 1,139 new rich.  In 1949-50 the number of persons chargeable to surtax was 6,138, whose incomes totalled £20,250,249, an increase of 3,638 over 1938.</P>
    <P>The Deputy also spoke about the people engaged in industry not receiving extraordinary or excessive profits. Let us see what the position is with regard to taxable profits.  In 1946-47, taxable profits amounted to £15,000,000. In 1948 they were £18,000,000, in 1949 £22,000,000, in 1950, £21,000,000, in 1951 £24,000,000 and in 1952 £27,000,000, an increase, on the average, of £2,365,476 profit per year over the five years.</P>
    <P>In 1947, the Government, now again in office, abolished the excess profits tax.  We did not find any reduction in <Col N="1329" /> the cost of living as a result of making a present of £3,000,000 odd to the investors.  What do we find?  In 1947 the net tax payable on excess profits was £5,488,749, while in 1952 the net tax payable was only £2,729,732, on taxable profits of £27,360,091.  I think that is sufficient evidence to indicate to Deputy de Valera that there is no reason to feel uncomfortable that the industrialists are not pulling a good deal out of the people's pockets in excessive profits.</P>
    <P>He went on to talk about the restrictive practices of trade unions.  I do not think that if Deputy Dillon, who referred to this question, were here now he would disagree with me in the statement that the economic system which we have been trying to operate all our lives is essentially one of strife and contention.  It is easy to criticise workers for actions which they take when they see their means of livelihood being taken from them.  I am not responsible for the conduct of bakers, but Deputy Dillon spoke in general terms about the restrictive practices of trade unions.  Neither I nor those associated with me object to the introduction of modern methods in industry. Personally I believe that the weight should be put on the back of iron rather than on the backs of human beings, but we have to bear in mind that the workers engaged in industry to-day have not the status to which they are entitled.  They have no share in the wealth of the nation which they are helping to create.  They are here to-day and to-morrow they may be told that they are no longer wanted.  The result is that they are without means; the only thing they possess is their labour.  The only property they have at their disposal is the clothes they stand in.</P>
    <P>I think it would be well if Deputy Dillon and every other Deputy would bear in mind that there are very few working-class people who have sufficient of the things they need for the fuller life.  There are very few householders amongst them who have sufficient furniture, linen, pots and pans, not to mention modern appliances which can reduce drudgery in the household. Yet Deputies stand up and talk about <Col N="1330" /> the shortcomings of workers.  These people are expected to possess all the virtues, even under low wages and bad conditions, to maintain their selfrespect and independence.  When we talk about public welfare, private enterprise and public ownership we believe that the day has arrived when the working people engaged in these industries should be integrated in the industries and given the status they deserve.  I feel very strongly the need for that because the workers in these industries are not getting the status to which they are entitled.</P>
    <P>We hear a lot of talk about private enterprise and the virtues of private enterprise.  I want to put this point before Deputy Dillon, who said that he did not mind what profits people made so long as they were serving the country.  Who will deny that there are a good many socially-minded people who are satisfied that the system that we are trying to operate at present is in need of a change?  Who will deny that it is private enterprise and capitalism that have given us slums and hovels and that from the public purse comes the money to provide hospitals and sanatoria for the victims of this system?  Private enterprise controls our food supply and it is from the public rates the money comes to pay inspectors to save us from being poisoned.  Industries operated under the present system pay small wages and prevent people from having the security to which they are entitled.</P>
    <P>We hear all this talk about the virtues of private enterprise and all this criticism directed against us because we want the basic industries of the country under public control.  We do not advocate any extreme measures for running this country but we do believe that our basic industries such as transport, the Sugar Company, the E.S.B., gas works and the flour industry are industries which the community are entitled to own.  The real test of the value of any industry is the service it gives to the nation and if companies under public control are not being operated in an efficient manner it is the duty of the Government and the people to see that they are.  When we talk about maintaining the system at <Col N="1331" /> present operating in this country I am afraid we are living in the past and are oblivious of the changes that are taking place around us every day.  I am very disappointed at the fact that the Minister does not seem now to have the views he expressed not so many years ago about how this country should be run.  I expected him to come out and tell us what he was going to do to bring about an improvement rather than keep on trying to operate a system that is not delivering the goods to the people.</P>
    <P>I should also like to ask the Minister whether anything has been done in regard to a change in company law.  I understand a committee was set up some years ago to deal with company law.  I think if anything more than another is needed immediately, it is this change in company law.  I am satisfied that very great exploitation is taking place in this country because of the existing company law which is more or less based on the Act of 1908. I was looking for some information recently about some companies that were exploiting the people in that particular industry.  I could get no information whatever.  I was told that it was a private company, and of course you will not get any information from anybody else if it is a private company. Therefore I say to the Minister that if anything is needed immediately it is a changing of company law, because there are people exploiting this country that should be dealt with immediately.  I hope the Minister will not have any fear as to where the Labour Party stands as regards supporting legislation of that kind or dealing with anything which will develop the resources of the country.</P>
    <P>I am also satisfied that you are not taking into your confidence the people who want to see resources of the country properly developed and exploited. There are vested interests in this country who are in it merely for what they can get out of it.  There are people in semi-State and semi-State controlled organisations who do not deserve to be where they are in the affairs of this country.  I give them every credit as far as they are playing <Col N="1332" /> their part in these vital and basic industries, but we should be very careful that people will not be selected because of their big bank balances rather than their interest in seeing the country developed.  Having an appreciation of what the Minister has done and what he is anxious to do, I appeal to him to get down to these problems and take into his confidence the people that count in the country.</P>
    <P>For years I have had a terrible feeling about our shipping.  I am inclined to think that no serious effort is being made to develop our shipping.  When we remember that we have only 47,000 tons of shipping after all these years we should be ashamed of ourselves. With the millions of money that we have handed out for the last 20 years, or even the last five or six years, we could have a good many ships of our own.  At the moment there are ships for sale which the Germans are buying up at £43 per ton.  There is no reason why, if we had people sufficiently interested in developing our shipping, we should not have purchased a number of ships in that way.</P>
    <P>That brings me to the question of the airport for Cork.  I happened to be present on the day the airport was opened and the Minister's Department was represented there.  Every praise was given to the field and its surroundings. I understand it has a red sandstone foundation and that the drainage is good.  I hope that the Minister will give us the airport at Farmer's Cross.</P>
    <P>I hope that the Minister has a good idea of what I have in mind, because things are not as good as anybody who is interested in the country would wish them to be.  The unemployment position is not good and, even with all the innovations and the scientific and modern methods in industry, I have still little hope that our unemployed will be absorbed owing to the way things are at the moment.  The Minister will have to take much more drastic measures to bring about the necessary changes which the situation at present demands.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJCrotty" hpid="Mr. Crotty Mr. Crotty">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Crotty</NameTxt>
      <P>I listened very attentively to the Minister's opening statement the other day and I was very <Col N="1333" /> disappointed, as I am sure a lot of people down the country were disappointed, that we heard practically nothing in relation to the decentralisation of industry.  Everybody down the country is anxious that these districts would get a fair share of the industries which are being established but, as far as we can gather from the Minister's statement, the only places he has an eye for at present are west of the Shannon, the undeveloped areas.  We do not begrudge the undeveloped areas the industries which may be established over there, but we do feel that the small cities and towns of this country deserve some consideration at the hands of the Government and the Minister.</P>
      <P>The larger cities, such as Dublin, Cork, Limerick and Waterford, are able to look after themselves, because they have the advantage of having large ports.  The Government should step out and help the smaller towns. Naturally, industrialists, when starting an industry, will go to the larger places where there is more of a population and where, if they have to import raw materials, it will be easy for them to import them.  The only people who can hold the balance between the large cities and the smaller cities and towns are the Government.  They should have what I might call a country bias towards industry, because practically the whole wealth of the country is centred in Dublin, with the result that the population of the country is streaming up to Dublin.  Whatever part of the population is crossing the water to England the greater number of those who are left are coming to Dublin.  I, therefore, ask the Minister to look into this matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would remind the Minister that people down the country are not slow about looking for industries.  In the small city which I come from we have been rapping at the door of the Minister's Department for several years past with very little result.  Since the establishment of the State, 30 years ago, the population of my city has decreased rather than increased.  It is a sad state of affairs that the population of the principal inland city has <Col N="1334" /> decreased or remained static all the time.  The census has shown that there is no real change and that people are leaving the area every year.  That should be a warning light to the Government or any Government which comes into power.</P>
    <P>The chamber of commerce have been holding meetings month after month and sent deputations to the Department and also the Industrial Development Authority.  I have no faith in that body.  I do not believe it is any use whatever as regards developing industry in this country.  With other businessmen, I was on one deputation to that authority and the only time they would receive us was on a Saturday morning when businessmen down the country are trying to earn an honest shilling.  We would have been much better off if we had stayed at home.  The position in Kilkenny is such that the divisional Labour Party had to see if they could, in combination with other organisations in the city and county, do anything with regard to bringing the Government's attention to the necessity for establishing an industry in Kilkenny.</P>
    <P>I attended a meeting last Sunday of all the organisations in the county that have the interests of the country and the county at heart, which was called for the purpose of drawing the attention of the Government and the promoters of industry to the smaller towns.  The small towns in the country are in a worse state even than Kilkenny itself.  Within the last 30 years, since the establishment of the State, two industries have been started in Kilkenny, one a reasonably big one and the other a small one.  That is the extent of the industrialisation we have enjoyed.  That is a sorry state of affairs if we want to progress and if we do not want to have just four or five big cities and the rest bush country.</P>
    <P>It is not a question of shortage of capital.  If any reasonable proposal were put up, the people of my city would provide sufficient capital at least to start any normal industry.  The factories which are in Kilkenny are turning out first-quality articles.  The result is that they are working at full time and have been working full time for a <Col N="1335" /> good while past.  Every Kilkennyman, including myself, is glad to see that. That is the position in regard to practically every industry with the exception of the building industry, which would be working better had it got more encouragement on the change of Government.</P>
    <P>In spite of our factories working full time and in spite of the agricultural industry being reasonably well off, there is a great depression in business.  It is very hard to reconcile that.  I thought the Minister for Industry and Commerce was very lax when, in the course of his opening speech, he made no reference to the one matter which affects business very much and that is the cost of living. He did not devote even five minutes to discussing the cost of living from the time he commenced his opening speech until he finished it.  Although people are working full time and the farmers are doing reasonably well, the cost of living is very high.  There is not enough money floating around to give normal business employment.</P>
    <P>In fact, licensed premises at the present time are going for the asking. It never happened in my memory that a licensed premises put up for auction did not attract a bid.  Two shops in the principal streets in Kilkenny have closed down during the past 12 months. That would not be serious if these shops were opened again.  The fact, however, is that these shops were closed down and the people left them. That shows the depression in business. The closing down of the shops is due to the high cost of living.  The people have not got the money to spend.  I am surprised that the Minister did not hold out some hope of some reduction in the cost of living.  His attitude seemed to me: &ldquo;Let us leave the cost of living alone.  I suppose the other side will not touch on it either.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>At the present time people are finding it very hard to carry on and that includes not only people in full employment but pensioners and those unemployed. Those latter people must be in a terrible predicament at the present time.  I think the Minister, in <Col N="1336" /> his reply to the debate this evening, should deal with the efforts the Government intend to make to reduce the cost of living and so give people an opportunity of being able to enjoy a shade higher standard of living and increase business in general in the country.</P>
    <P>I was very pleased to hear the Minister refer to the exports of anthracite coal.  That affects a very large industry in my county which is able to put anthracite coal on the market and export it to foreign countries.  It is able to keep our men in full-time employment.  On Sunday last I heard from one of the men engaged in this business that our mines at Castlecomer were working full time.  I was told that the Government are all out for Bord na Móna and power stations driven on turf.  In this area we have the raw material for a power station in the heart of Kilkenny but yet we have not heard one word about starting a power station there.  Even if our mines at Castlecomer are working at full pressure at the present moment, there are mines five or ten miles away that are not working full time and there are hundreds of tons of coal at the pit head which cannot be disposed of. The company produce a low quality coal called duff which is sent to Carlow where it is used very economically in the Carlow sugar factory.  If we in Kilkenny had an anthracite power station&mdash;we are in the heart of the coalfields; there is no doubt about that&mdash;it would help to give much-needed employment.</P>

      <P>If the people showed a demand for it, there would be increased production.  As I have said, just outside the Castlecomer Collieries there is another colliery with 100 tons <Col N="1337" /> of coal at the pit head.  That cannot be disposed of.  People in that colliery may not be as up to date in their methods of handling the coal as they are in the other colliery but you cannot expect a company to invest a huge amount of capital in the beginning.</P>
      <P>We heard of the Avoca mineral survey. We have always heard that where there is coal there is also iron. I am sure iron would be of great benefit to this country.  Of course, a survey for iron is a matter which no normal or ordinary people could finance.  The Government would have to undertake that.  They should carry out a mineral survey in that particular area of Kilkenny to which I have referred. They have done so in other places.  If there was iron in that particular area of Kilkenny it would be of great advantage to the nation.  The Minister said that we are importing anthracite, but I think there is no necessity to import it.  If the Minister is thinking about establishing any other power station, I suggest he should establish one on the borders of Kilkenny and Laois.  If he started a power station there, it would give much-needed employment as there is a very big population in that area.</P>
      <P>The last matter I want to refer to is rural electrification.  I think that the rural electrification scheme is doing wonderful work at the present time.  Only a couple of weeks ago I was present at the opening of a rural electrification scheme with a network of about 40 square miles.  That was a very big undertaking.  I congratulate the officials of the E.S.B. who are in charge of the rural electrification scheme on their wonderful work and on the manner in which they are spreading the use of electricity throughout the country in such a short time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I brought several cases to the notice of the officials in charge of the rural electrification scheme.  In this connection I must say that I have always got a very courteous reception.  If they could help me out they did so.  I had one case of a young man who had a farm on one side of a road, but because he happened to be on that particular side of the road he could not get the <Col N="1338" /> electricity.  This man deserved special consideration.  He takes conacre, grows beet and employs eight men constantly all the year round.  He has a wife and a reasonably big family.  In addition, he has about 160 to 170 acres under tillage, of which about 20 to 25 acres are beet.  You might say that he conducts a small industry, and if any facility were to be given in regard to rural electrification, I think that man deserves such.  According to the rules and regulations, however, he would have to pay extra.  He was prepared to do so if he got the benefit of the rural electrification charges, but he did not get that.  I think that is a very hard case, and I would ask the Minister to investigate it.  I would further suggest that the men who deal with rural electrification should not be too strict in regard to regulations.  I would ask the Minister to extend the regulations so as to bring in people in the category I have just mentioned.</P>

      <P>A number of Deputies, when speaking on this Estimate, seem to have been up in the clouds, particularly the East Cork Deputies.  But they appeared to have been asleep until the Government made the announcement that they had decided to have an airport in Cork.  There was a meeting in East Cork at which it was decided to do everything possible to get an airport for East Cork.  They were to use all the propaganda possible, and they were to get all their T.D.s to work as hard as possible for it, but the one thing they were not prepared to do was to put up any money for the project.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is, as Deputy Hickey has mentioned, an airfield in Cork.  There has been an offer made to the Minister by the owners of it to provide all the facilities necessary on the condition that they are permitted to run the service. The Department and Aer Lingus have put this on the long finger and nothing has been done so far.  I think that it is more or less a waste of time for the Deputies from East Cork, for Deputy Hickey or for myself to be asking the Minister to put the airport in any particular location, because from my information neither the Minister nor Aer Lingus, nor Aer Linte, nor the bosses of Aer Lingus, who are <Col N="1339" /> B.E.A., will have any say as to where the airport will be put.  If we are to have a military airport in Cork it will be put there at the dictation of the Americans.  The farther down East Cork they put it the better, because then it will be nearer to Youghal bridge, and the first bomb that comes will probably hit Youghal bridge and end a lot of the troubles associated with it.</P>
    <P>We know that Mr. Talbot, the Secretary of the United States Forces, is travelling around Europe at the present time.  He is in Spain at the moment dictating to the Spaniards as to where their airport will be put.  I think it is a great misfortune for us that the functions of this Parliament would appear to be taken over by the American Congress.  We cannot decide where we will have our airport. We cannot decide matters relating to agriculture, and we cannot decide what teaching our doctors are to get in our universities, because we have transferred from this Parliament to the American Congress the power to make rules and regulations for the people of this country.</P>
    <P>But, in spite of what the Americans may dictate, and in spite of the fact that they may establish a large military aerodrome in East Cork, we hope that there is still room for a small civil airport at Cork.  If Deputy V. de Valera was sincere when he was advocating private enterprise, he should use his influence with the Government to allow that private company in Cork to develop its airport and to run services from Cork.  We know that Aer Lingus has a monopoly.  We know that it has a tremendous number of staff for each plane it owns, and while Aer Lingus cannot possibly run an economic service it will not allow anybody to compete with it who could run an economic service.</P>
    <P>I want to put it to the Minister that, irrespective of what the Yanks may dictate, at the moment we want near Cork a small civil airport.  We do not want a great deal of money spent on it.  The people promoting the enterprise will put up the required amount of money and it will serve a very useful <Col N="1340" /> purpose.  As the Minister is aware airports, as such, will probably be outdated within a few years when the helicopter is developed to a greater degree than at present.  If the Minister decides to fall in with, or if he has to fall in with, dictation from an outside country as regards the location of this military airport, I think that this House should say that this country should not be charged for any work that is done here at the dictation of an outside body.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lehane</NameTxt>
      <P>The point is that the Government have decided to establish an airport in Cork, the location of which has not yet been decided on because of various factors that are influencing the Government.  I suggest that I have mentioned the main factor.</P>
      <P>Deputy Dillon yesterday referred to the racket that is going on following the ban on the export of hides.  There can be no doubt but that there is a definite tax being put on the cattle of this country to bolster up the tanning industry.  We see that the people who got an embargo put on the export of hides to prevent the ordinary person in this country from exporting hides, are getting the hides themselves and are exporting them.  The manufacturers of leather in this country are buying the hides at an artificially depressed price and are selling that leather in competition with leather that is produced from hides for which an economic price had been paid.  I think that the Minister should put a stop to the racket that is going on.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On the general question of tariffs, I suppose there is no possibility of getting any Government in this country to go easy on tariffs because of the fact that tariffs are very useful to any Government. Governments can stand up and be very patriotic and say that, in doing so, they are protecting industry, whereas, in fact, the principal purpose of these tariffs is to enable them to get a good deal of hidden taxation from the people on the assumption that they are protecting something.  A number of the tariffs that have been imposed <Col N="1341" /> are absolutely ridiculous.  There is a tariff, for example, on razor blades, the manufacture of which is giving employment to just a handful of people.  The fact, however, is that there are more people employed in smuggling razor blades across the Border than there are in their manufacture here.</P>
    <P>The Minister wants cheap food and he wants the cost of living reduced, but he is not going to get cheap food and he is not going to reduce the cost of living if he increases the price of the raw materials to agriculture.  Recently, there was a heavy tax put on a roll of wire.  There is a tax on superphosphates while, as we know, the land of the country is being starved for phosphates.  There is a tax on practically every raw material that is required in agriculture, so that the Minister expects the farmers of this country to buy their raw materials at a much higher price than their competitors across the Border have to pay for them, and at the same time to sell their produce at a cheaper price.  If the Minister goes ahead with his daft policy of putting outrageous tariffs on the essential requirements of the principal industry in this country, he is going to cause trouble for himself and trouble for the people in the towns.</P>
    <P>There is another matter that I should like to mention.  Recently, the Minister imposed a heavy duty on fishermen's oilskins.  These are not manufactured in this country.  There is a substitute, a plastic material, which is quite useless for fishermen.  At the moment, the smuggling in oilskins has been given a great fillip by the heavy duty which the Minister has put on these very necessary articles of clothing for fishermen. I agree with the Minister that the plastic overalls are quite useful for people such as road workers, corporation workers, and people like them, but they are not suitable for fishermen going out to fish in rough seas.  I would ask the Minister to look into that matter again and satisfy himself in regard to it.  I actually gave the Minister a sample of what was available in this country in the way of oilskin suits.  Anybody looking at them would see that the substitute was quite useless to the fishermen.  It cracks, it <Col N="1342" /> breaks, it is badly cut and it leaks at the seams.</P>
    <P>The Minister, when speaking at the Fianna Fáil Ard Fheis, took the delegates into his confidence and said he intended to introduce a Bill dealing with road transport.  I do not think the Minister has confided to the House what form that legislation is going to take, but I would appeal to him to have due regard to the rights and the usefulness of the private lorry owner. The private lorry owner is one very great asset in a country area.  He can do work and he can do things that cannot be done satisfactorily by a large nationalised State body.  In addition to that, it gives an opportunity to people in the country, where there is no room for them on the land, to do a little private business on their own and to live in the country and on the countryside.  The private lorry owner is a big economic asset, and I would ask the Minister when drafting this Bill regarding road transport to have due regard to his economic usefulness to the country and also to the social benefit of having a number of small employers resident and scattered throughout the country.</P>
    <P>The Minister in introducing what we may call the depressed areas Bill has drawn a line along the map and you must be along the seaboard to be in a depressed area.  In my constituency I would say there are two towns that are the most depressed, not alone in Ireland but in Europe; one is Kinsale and the other is Passage West.  Anyone going into them would get a fit of depression.  If there are any depressed areas in this country, Kinsale and Passage West would take a very high place amongst them.  If anything could be done to relieve the situation in these areas it should be done and, if necessary, having regard to the appalling conditions in these towns, the Minister should extend the definition of the present area in the Bill and include Kinsale and Passage West and any other area in the State that might be in an equally bad position.</P>
    <P>Deputy McQuillan referred yesterday to the lack of exports of whiskey. That is one industry for which we have the raw materials at home.  It <Col N="1343" /> is an industry for which we have the craftsmen available to manufacture it and it should be developed.  What I cannot understand in connection with the distilling industry is this.  The pot distillers, I think, circulated every Deputy in this House&mdash;I know I was circulated by the pot distillers in my own constituency&mdash;complaining that because of high taxation they could not sell their product.  The distilleries in my area not alone have little for export but they cannot supply the ordinary publican or the ordinary hotelier who requires their product.  I agree with Deputy McQuillan that there is something wrong on the part of the distillers and they have a great piece of impertinence in circulating members of this House telling them they cannot sell their product when a number of publichouse owners and a number of hoteliers will tell you they cannot obtain their products even though they have applied repeatedly for them.</P>

      <P>As I represent a tourist county, I would like to say a few words on tourism.  I think that An Tóstal this year was a success, and if it did nothing else it proved to places outside the specifically tourist areas that the tourist industry is very important from the country's point of view, and that the Department is going all out to make it a national business.  It also brought to light a lot of hidden organisational talent and entertainment talent that probably was not in evidence before.  It proved that we are not dependent for our entertainment on outside sources completely, that we can entertain ourselves and the various organisations can go around to different towns and different counties and show what they can do. <Col N="1344" /> I am certain that when An Tóstal gets into its stride after a few years it will be the great success we all hope it will be.</P>
      <P>With regard to tourist literature, I would like to congratulate Fógra Fáilte on their bulletin, &ldquo;Ireland of the Welcomes&rdquo;.  This is an excellent publication and could be distributed with advantage in any country.  It is well produced and printed on good paper; there are plenty of illustrations and drawings and not too much reading matter.  That is a good idea, because nowadays people have not got the time to wade through long articles; they do like to see pictures and illustrations and get a quick idea of what the country is like.  Afterwards they are quite willing to read about it.  You must attract them first. People are used to films and television now, and they are used to having things brought before them in a pictorial fashion.</P>
      <P>While I am on the subject of literature for tourists, let me say that the maps of the country and of the country roads could be improved a lot.  The maps the tourists get now are very much out of date.  We have spent a great deal of money in recent years on improving county and main roads and some of the tourist maps do not show these roads although they have been there for years and years.  I presume the old blocks are still in existence and that somebody does not want to spend the money on making new blocks.  It is a great pity that these new tourist roads are not advertised more for the sake of the tourist, because when he gets down to a county and sees that according to the map all the roads are very bad, he is not inclined to travel further around the countryside.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We must realise that the British tourist, at any rate, is a methodical person.  I would say that most of them would plan their summer holidays at Christmas.  If they are thinking of going outside their own country they will get all the literature of the different countries during the Christmas holidays and try to make up their minds where they intend to go. By the end of the Christmas holidays <Col N="1345" /> they have decided where they intend to go and practically the train they will catch and have done everything but buy the ticket.  Therefore, we should get all the publicity material we want very early in the year&mdash;before Christmas, if possible.</P>
    <P>I would like to congratulate the Department on the new office in London.  The older office was in a very good centre but the new one is even better.  The Minister should try to do something for the Killarney office, now that the London one is so good.  There is only one room available for tourists to come in and discuss their problems. It needs painting and chairs and it needs to be made attractive.  I would ask the Minister to see that it is made as attractive as possible.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Everett</NameTxt>
      <P>This discussion during the past few days has ranged over various subjects, some of them very important; but I notice that the Minister and the Government supporters were very silent on two most important matters that concern the people at present.  I admit that the Minister is not very shy or bashful when it comes to painting a rosy picture over various things accomplished by himself or his Government.  I was surprised at his silence when he omitted from his speech&mdash;as also did his supporters, though we had a two-hour lecture on extreme socialism, that no member of the House had advocated&mdash;everything about the real problem facing the people of Ireland and facing the Government, that is, the condition of the 60,000 unwanted people who are now unemployed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is not a question of where they will go on their holidays; it is a question only of which country will take them.  It seems that Ireland does not require them any more.  We have no work for them and no further use for them.  What is the cause?  The Minister was one who recognised that these things would happen over the Budgets of 1952 and 1953, when through the removal of subsidies from the essential foodstuffs even the men who were in constant employment had to purchase less.  They had not sufficient money, <Col N="1346" /> even out of their constant wages, to buy the food normally procured for their houses.  We should measure the problem of unemployment and the hardship and misery in the country and try to remove it and eliminate it. We should be more concerned with that than with reconciling our balances in our books.  Which is more important &mdash;providing employment and stability for our people or obeying the money lords who dictate policy at present? I believe these are the two important subjects that affect the country, yet we are quite indifferent to the whole serious position.  It is all very well to talk about greater productivity, but what is the incentive, even for the workers who are in employment?  You must give an incentive.  Are they going to have greater production and then greater unemployment?  Does it mean they will get a higher wage or a part share in the profits they are going to make?</P>
    <P>These problems will have to be faced by some committee or by the Government and the representatives of all Parties, those engaged in trade, those investing capital and the workers concerned. They will have to decide and regulate workers' wages, profits and shares and try to get greater productivity in the various industries, if we are to get out of the position we are in.  I consider, coming from a rural area, that even during the emergency we were not faced with as serious a problem as we are faced with now.</P>
    <P>It is all very well to talk about erecting houses.  At the present time it is the old schemes initiated in 1946, 1947 and 1948 that are being completed. In the cities there is good employment and good rates of wages, but the rural areas are not in that position.  The public bodies find that it costs over £1,100 to build a labourer's cottage. The man in the rural area with £4 per week cannot pay an economic rent. With the high rate of interest, as a result of Government policy, there is a slowing-down on the erection of houses.  Dublin is in a different position from the rural areas&mdash;it has factories and good wages and a large number of workers are prepared to pay an economic rent.  In towns with a <Col N="1347" /> population of 4,000 or 5,000 where you have not constant employment in factories, the men who are in condemned houses and who need better accommodation cannot pay an economic rent of 15/- or £1 per week.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Everett</NameTxt>
      <P>I thought it was the Minister's policy to consider all the questions we are faced with in creating employment.  Admittedly, the Minister for Local Government has a lot to do with housing, but the Minister for Industry and Commerce must be aware that a large number of skilled men are now unemployed in Dublin, while we have a demand from another section of the community for the erection of houses.  However, I do not want to dwell upon it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister is anxious for an export drive.  I want to be fair to him, and I would ask him to take special notice of the position of Wicklow Harbour.  We had a controversy in the local paper with members of the harbour board that the Minister must be aware of.  Even the harbour board, and even the engineer before that, as far back as April, did not agree to the scheme sanctioned by the committee in the Department of Industry and Commerce.  The reason was that there was a factory there giving a large amount of employment and there were always two berths, previous to the demolition of the quay wall, for boats of 1,000 tons.  The scheme sent down by the Minister would deprive the harbour board of the berth they had prior to the demolition of the wall. You had boats off the quay coming out into the river, but no berth for a boat of 300 or 400 tons.  With the factory there, two boats would often come in at the one time and there was only one berth, so there was a moorage claim&mdash;and many a time the factory gave the Minister the returns&mdash;over unnecessary delay in the discharging of the boat, which was due to the fact that the other boat had not discharged in time.  The harbour commissioners <Col N="1348" /> appealed to the Minister's Department as far back as last April to give them the No. 2 scheme submitted by the engineers of the Board of Works. Three schemes were submitted.  If that No. 2 scheme is sanctioned by the Minister, it will meet a problem that the union has asked the Minister to meet, in providing berths beside the factory where boats of 1,500 or 2,000 tons can come in.  The factory is willing to bring in material to grind in the slack period and send out again to South America for dollars.  The Minister is giving wealthier harbours twice the amount he has offered to Wicklow. Wealthier harbours have been offered £60,000 and £70,000, with £7,000 from the rates.  I do not see why Wicklow should not be treated in the same way. I cannot understand why Wicklow should be asked for £35,000 for the same amount of money that others are getting with £7,000 from the rates.  The members of the Wicklow Harbour Board are supporters of the Minister's own Party.  I do not say that politics enter into this matter.  They are only laymen acting on the advice available to them.  If a second berth were provided more employment would be given in the factory.  I appeal to the Minister to consider that point because the present scheme is useless from the point of view of the harbour board and the factory.</P>
    <P>I appeal to the Government to give more attention to the problems I have raised than has been given to them in the past 12 months.  Unemployment is rife all over the country.  All our young men are leaving to find work elsewhere.  I think we should restore the subsidies on essential foodstuffs to give the unemployed some chance of living on the meagre sum that is allotted to them at the present time. The country is badly in need of some restoration of confidence.  Unfortunate people have no employment through no fault of their own.  I hope a change for the better will take place very soon.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RichardJamesMulcahy" hpid="General Mulcahy General Mulcahy">
      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>I would ask the Minister to report a little more fully on the position with regard to the Slievardagh coalfield.  During the year there was an announcement that the <Col N="1349" /> Minister had sold the Ballingarry mine as a going concern, and the Slievardagh coalfield, as a whole.  A considerable amount of anxiety exists at the moment among local people who are dependent on the activity of those mines for a livelihood.  Something like 200 families are dependent on the coal-fields being maintained and developed in a satisfactory way.  Considerable anxiety exists at the moment and there are some factors in the situation that we find it difficult to understand.</P>
      <P>The Minister has at all times been anxious to get a buyer for the Slievardagh coalfield.  Before the Fianna Fáil Government left office in 1947 they had advertised for someone to lease that coalfield from them but I do not think any offer was forthcoming at that particular time.  During the years 1948, 1949, 1950 and 1951 a certain amount of development took place, supported by State grants, and not until 1952 did it appear that a quite satisfactory and substantial development of the working of the mine there could be secured.</P>
      <P>The Minister was not very long back in office when the itch to sell the coalfield developed again.  I am not quarrelling with the desire on the part of any Minister for Industry and Commerce to get someone to lease the Slievardagh, or any other coalfield, but I feel a certain amount of responsibility rests on him to explain to the House that what is being done is being done satisfactorily and equitably and that it is not simply a case of the Minister washing his hands of the coalfield and its resources by getting someone to pay something just at the moment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Now in 1945, 1946 and 1947 the coal production in the Ballynonty and Lickfinn areas, which were the only areas worked, ran 17,153, 14,362 and 14,764. At the end of that period the Minister was apparently making up his mind, in consultation with Mianraí Teoranta, that the Ballynonty and Lickfinn areas were worked out.  Work was not actually stopped in that area and one of the things that requires explanation and sympathetic consideration at the moment arises in connection with the case of Mr. Michael Ivers, a miner of the traditional type in the Slievardagh <Col N="1350" /> area, who entered with the consent and approval of Mianraí Teoranta on the Ballynonty mines at the time that body left them and, borrowing, buying and renting some of the rails from Mianraí Teoranta, continued development of the Ballynonty mine where they left off, removed thousands of tons of débris, released thousands of tons of water and satisfactorily opened a mine that had been discarded by the mining authorities, and maintained there throughout the period a substantial amount of employment and is employing at the present moment from 30 to 39 men continually, apart from carters and others who are working in connection with the mine.  My information is that the number of persons employed by Mr. Ivers, between adults and children, is about 200.</P>
    <P>One of the elements in the position in the general coalfield area is the fact that this man has been working the Ballynonty mine from the time Mianraí Teoranta gave up operations there; that he has been developing it, and the position is that a mine that was left there to be worked no further has been so developed that it offers very promising possibilities.</P>
    <P>The Minister last year authorised Mianraí Teoranta to enter into an arrangement to sell the mine.  The following is a quotation from the report of the directors:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;During the year Ballingarry Colliery was advertised for sale as a going concern, together with a lease of the Slievardagh coalfield.  Negotiations resulted in an ecceptable offer of £50,000, plus royalties, being received.  An agreement to sell was signed on the 24th January, 1953, whereby the prospective purchaser was given control of the colliery as from the 2nd February, 1953, on payment of £25,000 deposit, the balance to be secured by an insurance bond and to be paid by four equal annual instalments, with interest.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The Minister for External Affairs, perhaps speaking for the Minister for Finance, has been referring us to-day to balance sheets that are deposited in the Library as mines of information.  I have been looking at the balance sheets for Mianraí Teoranta for a few <Col N="1351" /> years, including the balance sheet of 31st March, 1953.  I do not know whether the sale has been legally effected or not but I understand that it has not been legally completed yet. In view of the position with regard to the sale and the position of Mr. Ivers in relation to Mianraí Teoranta and the working of the Ballynonty mine, there are some things that I should like to point out.  After 1947 the Ballynonty mine, except in so far as it was worked by Mr. Ivers, was practically given up and a new mine was opened in the copper area.  The inter-Party Government decided that development to the extent of about £50,000 would be carried out in that area.  While difficulties were met, increased equipment was provided and greater facilities made available for the men, we find that by 1950 the total amount of coal produced was 11,910 tons.  The balance sheet for that period shows a profit for the Ballingarry mine of £4,105.  In the year 1951 the total production was 14,856 tons, the production in the first six months being good, the production in the second six months being rather disappointing and there was a loss of £6,732.</P>
    <P>In 1952 production was 20,939 tons, but the balance sheet for the 31st March, 1953, shows that the Ballingarry production losses for ten months to the 1st February, 1953, were £11,303.  I feel that that loss of £11,303 as outlined in the balance sheet would require a certain amount of explanation in view of the increase to 20,939 tons production that year and the fact that the output of 500 tons a week had been reached by October, 1952, and that from October, 1952, to the end of the year production had been greater.  The implication in the balance sheet of 31st March, 1953, that there has been a substantial loss in the Ballingarry area on the working of the year 1952, requires a certain amount of explanation.</P>
    <P>On the question of the sale, the balance sheet of 31st March, 1953, shows that the land, buildings, plant and machinery in the Ballingarry area were valued as carried over from last year at £25,612 and additions made, no doubt by way of plant and machinery, <Col N="1352" /> during the year were £19,920, giving a total of £45,533, off which certain depreciation was allowed, making a total of £43,644.  Of that £43,644, £19,920 was new plant and machinery added during the 1952 year and £11,594 was new plant and machinery added the year before.  So that, allowing for depreciation, the £43,644 shown in the balance sheet as land, buildings, plant and machinery on the 31st March, 1953, included nearly £32,000 of plant and machinery that was two years old or less.  That is in addition to motor vehicles and furniture and fittings to the extent of £1,886.</P>
    <P>I should like to ask the Minister how the sale price of £50,000 was arrived at or, in accepting the offer of £50,000, how it related to the value of the coalfield plus the value of the plant and machinery and the furniture and fittings that were there.  The Minister is aware, and the reports for the last three years show, that a very considerable amount of additional plant and amenities had been added during the year 1950-51.  There was washing and grading machinery, coal-cutting machinery, diesel oil generating plant, so that, in the first place, the cutting of the coal would be better done, the washing and grading would be better and they would be independent of any breakdown of electric light.</P>
    <P>It seems difficult to understand why the Minister should have rushed so much to get the place sold.  Immediately he got in, in November, 1951, the Minister proceeded to offer the north-east part of the coalfield with an approximate 2,500 acres and the estimate was that there were four million tons of coal possibilities there. He offered that for sale but there was no answer to it.  The report into the national mineral resources made about 1920 or 1921 suggested that the total coal deposits in that coalfield were about 40 million tons.</P>
    <P>Further, what I want to get is how the Minister is satisfied to accept £50,000 in the way in which it has been accepted as the value of the coalfield and the working mines that are there at the moment, and what it is intended to include in the agreement <Col N="1353" /> in the way of royalties or what has been included in that way.  Again I want to ask with regard to the position of Mr. Michael Ivers there, who from the time that the Ballynonty and Loughfin fields were working and work was ceased by Mianraí Teoranta went in there and, as I say, not only cleared a lot of débris and a lot of water that had been left there or accumulated after the previous working, but who developed the mine, and developed it in a way in which it is satisfactorily working at the present day.  I understand that Mianraí Teoranta had prepared or were preparing a lease for him for the Ballynonty mine in the same way as the Minister, no doubt, intended to prepare a lease for the north-eastern part of the mine when he advertised it in November, 1952, but that the proposals to make that lease were cut across by the over-all leasing of the coalfield to the present lessee. I understand that an arrangement was intended to be come to with Mr. Ivers to give him either a sub-lease or some kind of a lease in relation to the place he was working.</P>
    <P>I understand that he was left there for a number of months to carry on uninterrupted, and he has now been served with notice to abandon the mine that he has been working there. It means a very considerable injustice to a man taking over what was left as a derelict mine, and in co-operation with and the approval of Mianraí Teoranta working it and developing it. There is an injustice to him in his pecuniary point of view, and there is a disturbance very much to the people who have been given employment by him all those years since 1948, and there is a general air of fear among those who are dependent on the product of the coalfield, that the Government has just in a handy kind of way washed its hands of the situation there.</P>

      <P>At any rate, I think it is hardly a reasonable approach.  I can understand the Minister, say, holding his tongue here on the coalfield position or saying that he was not clear whether he could usefully discuss the merits of that matter here as it was Mianraí Teoranta who had been dealing with it.  But we are concerned with the conservation and the proper use of our national resources; we are concerned also with the well-being of the people who have for a large part of their lives been dependent on the working of the mines in this area and the production of coal there.  The people have voted in Parliament a certain substantial amount of money during the past few years to see that there is a systematic and proper approach to the development of these mines.</P>
      <P>We can hardly be regardless of the fact that, the normal Mianraí Teoranta machinery having failed to progress in Ballynonty and Loughfin beyond a particular point, with the native instinct and native persistence there a traditionally Ballingarry mining leader took up where Mianraí Teoranta left off, and with their blessing and with a certain amount of assistance from them, developed the mines and produced a substantial amount of coal in the meantime.</P>

      <P>At any rate, from my point of view, it is only part of an overriding business.  There is a feeling <Col N="1355" /> there, and it is enhanced by the way in which it would appear that Mr. Ivers is being treated, that somebody is taking the line that the Minister is getting rid of something he had been anxious to get rid of all along, that he may say there is nothing in it but expense, trouble and difficulties of one kind or another to be hemmed and hawed about over the next few years until it is seen whether the development of this mine can be completely satisfactory.  Therefore, the Minister should try to get rid of trouble at the moment and get somebody who is going to go in and scoop off the surplus coal and then when there is nothing more to be got out of it in an economic way is going to leave the mine there and let the Government go back to the beginning all over again.  Further, the property, apart altogether from any wealth of mineral resources, is seen to be a substantial property.  Twenty-five thousand pounds have been received for it, and an arrangement is contemplated that another £25,000 will be taken over four years.  The allegation in the balance sheet that there was £11,000 of a loss in the last working year there I find it very hard to understand.</P>

      <P>At any rate, it does require some explanation, with production going up in October, 1950, and maintained at the higher point, and with sales being completely recovered, because the last report says, with regard to improvements that have taken place there: &ldquo;Work on the erection of a modern coal-washing and grading plant proceeded during the year and was completed in December. The fuel from the washery was enthusiastically received by the trade and sales had commenced to revive towards the end of the year.  Assembly and housing of the machinery and equipment was carried out with local labour under the supervision of the company's technical staff.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>It was after that that, according to the report: &ldquo;Acting on instructions from the Minister, an advertisement was inserted in September offering Ballingarry Colliery for sale as a going concern, together with a lease of the Slievardagh coalfield.  Geological, statistical and financial details were sent to a number of individuals and concerns who showed an interest in the sale, but only one offer was received. Towards the end of December the Minister authorised the company to negotiate a sale on the basis of this offer.  Negotiations were proceeding at the end of the year.&rdquo;  I understand that the agreement has not actually been concluded as some legal matters require to be settled.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I understand that the ejectment of Mr. Michael Ivers from the Ballynonty coalfield seems to be part of that.  Anybody closely associated with the history of that field would know that there are equities to be decided as far as Mr. Ivers is concerned.  I think we are entitled to some account from the Minister as to how the sale could be considered a worthwhile sale from his <Col N="1357" /> point of view and what terms in the agreement guarantee that the coalfield will not just be stripped in a surface kind of way without any attempt being made to develop it properly.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickCogan" hpid="Mr. Cogan Mr. Cogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cogan</NameTxt>
      <P>I would not have intervened at all in this debate were it not for the fact that Deputy Dr. Esmonde requested the Minister to withdraw or divert the money which was set aside to be expended on the development of the Avoca mines.  I think that that request is in accordance with the request which was made by a local chairman of a Fine Gael organisation when the previous Government were in office.  There are valuable deposits in Avoca and the request of Deputy Dr. Esmonde is altogether unjustifiable. The mines have been developed over a considerable number of years.  Money has been expended on their development and it is only right that the work should be pushed forward and completed. Everybody in the area and, I suppose, everybody throughout Ireland will welcome the day when these mines start to yield a valuable return.  The sooner we begin to have an output from these mines, the better.  The general expectation is that the work will be pushed forward with all expedition with a view to bringing the matter to a successful conclusion.  It has cost a considerable amount of money already and it is only right that the work should be completed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the course of his speech, Deputy Everett said that a considerable amount of time has been wasted during this debate in a discussion on extreme socialism versus private enterprise. Deputy Everett was inclined to think that there is no need whatever for such strong expressions of opposition to extreme socialism as he considers that there is no likelihood of such a thing showing its face in this State.  Yet, only a few short years ago, Deputy Everett was scaring the lives out of all of us by telling us that the Labour Party was dominated not by extreme socialists but by communists. In the course of a very able address, Deputy Major de Valera dealt with this matter.  I think he made it clear that, no matter what Government is in power, private enterprise <Col N="1358" /> should be assisted to the maximum and that, where private enterprise cannot perform the work which requires to be done, State enterprise should step in and fill the need.</P>
    <P>Very valuable work in the way of industrial development has been done in this country by private enterprise over the past 20 years.  That work was done by individual citizens, businessmen and other persons who had very little or no experience of the manufacturing business and who, in many instances, made a success of it.  It is no reflection whatever on these men that they made a success of their work.  It has been suggested by a leading spokesman of the Opposition Party that any man who makes a success of the manufacturing business or of industrial production in this country, or who makes some profit out of it, is a criminal who ought to be hounded down and driven out of business.  That has been the theme of practically every speech delivered in this House by Deputy Dillon over the past 20 years.  Yesterday, Deputy Dillon described Irish manufacturers as a gang of chancers and a group of parasites.  He used a number of other adjectives which I will not repeat now.</P>
    <P>Since it is necessary and desirable to promote industrial development, it is right that those who engage in it as a class should not be defamed, held up to ridicule and condemned before the eyes of the people.  Like agriculture. industry depends for its advancement and success on the energy, ambition and enthusiasm of the young men who are willing to enter it.  If young men are to be encouraged to enter into the manufacturing industry, and to devote their best energies to it, then they ought not to be told in advance that they are entering a criminal occupation or that they are joining a criminal class.  It is the duty of the members of this House to make it clear to the people generally that to engage in the manufacture of goods for the use of our people is a noble and an honourable occupation and that it is not one that should be held up to the ridicule and condemnation of public men.  It is all right to say, as some people complacently say, that there are good and <Col N="1359" /> bad industrialists.  There is a certain amount of good and bad in every profession and in every occupation. Because there may be some inefficient or worthless member in the medical profession, one does not condemn the entire medical profession.  Because there may be some inefficient or worthless farmer in the country one does not condemn the entire farming community. That should be the attitude in regard to industry also.</P>
    <P>I must say, in passing, that the attitude of the Minister for Industry and Commerce in regard to Industry is in striking contrast to that of Deputy Dillon.  The Minister assumes that everybody who enters the manufacturing business is a responsible and respectable citizen until he is proved to be otherwise.  Deputy Dillon's attitude is that every man who undertakes the manufacture of goods in this country is a criminal until, after long years, he has proved himself innocent. That illustrates the different attitudes adopted by the Minister for Industry and Commerce and Deputy Dillon in regard to this important matter.</P>

Apparently Deputy Dillon and Deputy Flanagan are now running neck and neck for the leadership of that Party. Which will succeed will depend on the quality of the neck.</P>
      <P>Deputy Flanagan, if we may change the subject, made a violent attack upon the importation of timber from Russia and constituted himself the noble spokesman of Christianity in this respect.  When Deputy Flanagan shows a little more respect for the great Christian virtues of truth, charity and justice, he will be qualified&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickCogan" hpid="Mr. Cogan Mr. Cogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cogan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am referring to a statement by Deputy Flanagan and suggesting that, when he qualifies in that way, he will be qualified to speak on behalf of Christianity.  Deputy Flanagan, however, did not refer&mdash;neither did Deputy Giles, who spoke about the blood-soaked timber imported from Russia&mdash;to the blood-soaked coal which was imported from beyond the Iron Curtain during the period of office of the inter-Party Government.  It is right that we should all condemn the injustices and atrocities committed by a tyrannical régime, and it is right that we should consider ways and means of making a national protest, although perhaps not on this Estimate. It is, however, a matter for responsible Ministers and Deputies to consider it from all angles, with a view to deciding on what is the best form of protest that should be made.  Retaliation of the type suggested by Deputy Flanagan is not always very effective and particularly when it is of such a minor nature and when it would have so little effect, as we know, on the general policy of these Governments.</P>
      <P>Deputy Flanagan was simply trying to make capital against the Government and his speech was in rather striking contrast with that of Deputy Cosgrave, who referred to the matter briefly and admitted that his Government had also imported goods from beyond the Iron Curtain.  That, I think, was meeting the matter in a fair and reasonable way.  He suggested that we should endeavour to avoid trading with these countries and I think, on general principles, that we should avoid trading not only with these countries but with all States which do not provide us with a market for our goods.  In developing our export trade, we should be mainly concerned to buy from those who buy from us and, as this is a matter in which private enterprise is engaged to a considerable extent, it is not always possible for a Government to intervene fully and effectively.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have no doubt that the firms which imported the timber from Russia are firms of repute who did so in good faith.  Some of them may be as closely identified with the Fine Gael Party as with the Government, and perhaps <Col N="1361" /> even more so, but they were, I think, acting in good faith.  The approach of Deputy Cosgrave to the matter is much more reasonable than that of his would-be leader, Deputy Flanagan, in his suggestion that we should try to avoid, or to discourage so far as we can, trading with these countries.  I go further and say that we should try to avoid and to discourage imports from any country which does not freely accept our exports and pay a fair price for them.</P>
    <P>I mentioned that, in addition to the extensive work that can be and is being done by private enterprise in the industrial field, we have also to develop these public or State-owned companies which are contributing very largely to the economic security of the State.  There is no doubt that Bord na Móna, in the production of machine-won turf, has made a remarkable contribution to the well-being of our people and the provision of employment for our people.  It is well known in this connection that, during the régime of the inter-Party Government, Deputy Flanagan conducted a rather vicious campaign to remove the managing director and other prominent people in Bord na Móna who were doing their best to promote this branch of Irish industry and it is to the credit of the inter-Party Government that they resisted that campaign.</P>
    <P>It is essential for the preservation of national development of this kind undertaken by public companies that no political interference or victimisation shall take place with regard to the people who are managing these State-owned industries.  So long as they are doing their duty well and efficiently, they deserve the support of all Parties, regardless of what Government happens to be in power or what Government was responsible for appointing them.</P>
    <P>Again, in regard to the Irish Sugar Company, we find that, through the energy and vigour of its directors, a remarkable expansion of that industry has been carried through.  The industry is now on a very sound footing.  The directors of the company have met the farmers in a reasonable way, agreeing to base the price they pay to the <Col N="1362" /> farmer on his cost of production, without any question, hesitation, dispute or quibble about it.  In that way, they have established a certain measure of security for those who supply them with their raw materials and have put the industry on a sound foundation, because no industry can be sound, unless its raw materials are secured.</P>
    <P>In addition&mdash;and credit for this is due to the managing director&mdash;there have been developments of an industrial nature which are of far-reaching consequence.  We have, for example, the fact that the managing director of the Irish Sugar Company undertook to investigate the possibility of providing a machine capable of lifting and crowning beet under Irish climatic conditions, and, after considerable experiment, has succeeded in producing a machine which is, I think, superior to anything produced in any part of the world.</P>
    <P>That is an achievement in the industrial field of which we should be proud. We have been told over the years by the Deputy Dillons, the Deputy Flanagans and such people that the Irish people have not the industrial brains or the inventive genius possessed by other nations, and that they are unable to concentrate on the perfection of engineering work.  Yet we have seen&mdash;and this is only one of the many examples that can be produced&mdash;that a machine has been produced by the Irish Sugar Company which, as I say, is superior to anything else that has been produced elsewhere.  There is a possibility that other countries will be looking for this machine and that it may be possible to export it, but whether we do or not it is certainly a very valuable asset to the agricultural industry.  I think it is time that we shed our inferiority complex in regard to manufacture and in regard to engineering and inventive genius.  It is time that we recognised that there are people like Major-General Costello who, if given a chance, are capable of producing goods that are in demand and that are essential.</P>
    <P>I mention that because I think it is one of the good features of public enterprise <Col N="1363" /> in this country.  I do not think anyone could quarrel with the statement made by Deputy Larkin in this respect when he said that where private enterprise is not capable of doing certain work that requires to be done, it is desirable to turn back on public enterprise, not to supplant private enterprise but to supplement it.  Here we have industries such as Bord na Móna and the Irish Sugar Company, which are supplying needs that could not be supplied by private enterprise, and at the same time they are venturing forth into a field of invention and the production of machinery that has not yet been explored. I think it is true also to say of Bord na Móna that they have produced machines of a design superior to those of other countries.  The fact that we have these large public companies in a position to undertake this work is a national advantage.  I think it is one of the things upon which we can congratulate ourselves as having made some progress.</P>
    <P>It is all right for people like Deputy Everett to talk about the number of people who are unemployed but the only way to fight unemployment and to overcome it is to stimulate the development of industry in every one of its branches, beginning with the fundamental industry of agriculture and going right down through all the industries which are capable of being developed.  Industries which supply basic materials such as fuel are of supreme importance.  I think it is true to say that Bord na Móna provides a fuel in the form of machine-won turf that does compare favourably, in quality and in price, with imported fuel for general purposes.  That is the answer to those who for years have been denouncing public expenditure on bog and turf development.  That is a complete answer and a complete vindication of the enthusiasm, the courage and the foresight of those who undertook this work in the thick of very great criticism and opposition.</P>
    <P>I have no intention of entering into the dispute with regard to the airfield at Cork because that would be far outside my province, except as a farmer <Col N="1364" /> to support the demand of Deputy Corry that it should be provided at Farmers' Cross.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cogan</NameTxt>
      <P>I had better keep out of it then because I understand from Deputy Lehane that they are now engaged in a cold war with the United States and when the Corkmen and the Yanks cross swords it is better for us to stand back and await developments.</P>
      <P>There is one other matter to which I would like to refer which is concerned with my own constituency.  After the matter had been under consideration for a considerable time, the Government has made available in the present year a substantial grant for the development of Wicklow Harbour.  I know that the harbour commissioners in Wicklow are not quite satisfied with the existing scheme but I am confident that the matter will be adjusted.  I understand that the engineering section of the Minister's Department are investigating the request that has been made for an extension of the scheme so as to make it completely satisfactory from all points of view.  I think it is desirable that when work of this nature is undertaken it should be completed in such a way as would make the harbour satisfactory from the point of view of the unloading of all types of vessels.  I think the existing scheme does not make adequate provision for the unloading of two vessels at a time and it is only right that the matter should be re-examined as speedily as possible and a decision arrived at.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I hope the decision of the Minister's Department will be to meet the request of the harbour commissioners and to extend the scheme to the distance required.  I hope the work will be undertaken as soon as possible; it is certainly long overdue.  I think every Deputy for Wicklow, and local representatives as well, have been on deputations to the Minister's Department and other Departments in regard to this harbour and also in regard to Arklow Harbour for quite a number of years.  I am glad that work is also being undertaken in Arklow.  There is <Col N="1365" /> need for an extension of the existing scheme and I hope that also will be undertaken.</P>
    <P>I understand the matter is being examined, and I trust that the work will be completed in a manner satisfactory to those who have to use the harbours. Both Wicklow and Arklow Harbours have always been problems inasmuch as they have never been fully developed, and they are subject to extreme silting up from the tides.  If the work is completed in a satisfactory way now I think the Government can look forward to a long period during which they will not be troubled with requests for the improvement of these two important harbours.</P>
    <P>The Minister, and also, of course, C.I.E., should be congratulated upon the change-over to a considerable extent to diesel traction on our railways. It is a step in the right direction.  If it were carried still further, I wonder would it enable branch lines, some of which are running uneconomically, and some of which have been closed, to be reopened or continued economically? Nobody wants C.I.E. or any other public company to run services which are uneconomic.  With dieselisation, it may be possible that the branch lines which serve considerable areas of the country can become economic.</P>
    <P>I hope, however, that serious consideration will be given to the claim that has frequently been made by Deputies that there ought to be a reconsideration of the whole policy with regard to the transport of goods in this country.  Here, again, private enterprise would probably fill the need, in many areas at any rate, more satisfactorily than can be done by a public company.  We all know that C.I.E. are giving a fairly good service, and in some cases delivering goods at a comparatively cheap rate.  But it would be interesting to know whether the road transport service is paying its way or not.  I have a strong belief, and I think most people who have experience in regard to the operation of this branch of C.I.E. have a strong belief, that it is not profitable and could not be profitable in its work.</P>
    <P>It is a matter which requires close <Col N="1366" /> investigation.  It may not be necessary to take the complete drastic step which was taken in Great Britain of denationalising or handing back to private enterprise the entire road fleet.  But I think that, at any rate, a considerable amount of transport which is being carried on the roads by C.I.E. could very profitably be transferred to private enterprise.</P>
    <P>I want to say something about the Industrial Development Authority which was set up some years ago.  I never could be sure as to what they were intended to do.  It is very easy to set up some kind of a body like that and tell them to go ahead and develop industries.  But, when it comes down actually to developing them, it is very hard to see much progress being made. I remember having to pick up the hat of one of the members of that authority, and I found written inside that it was made in London.  I wonder are men who wear hats which are made in London so wildly enthusiastic about Irish industry that they are going to overcome all the difficulties, and there are difficulties, operating against the development of Irish industry.  While the members and staff of the Industrial Development Authority may endeavour to carry out their objectives to the best of their ability, I have a feeling that they cannot make very much progress.  I think it would be far better, if we are to have such an authority at all, to give them a certain amount of money and tell them to go ahead and produce something.  It is very easy to sit down at a desk and advise and encourage ordinary people to establish industries and produce goods, but it would be much more effective if this authority were something like Bord na Móna or the Irish Sugar Company and were given a certain amount of capital and certain productive work to do.  For example, they could be told to undertake some line of production which is not being undertaken at the present time and get on with that work and produce goods, rather than merely to give advice and encouragement to individual industrialists. It is about time that something in that line should be done.</P>
    <P>It might be very desirable to have, <Col N="1367" /> in addition to existing companies, one body which would do a little bit of investigation and experimentation just like the Irish Sugar Company and produce some type of machinery.  They might produce, for example, a cheaper motor-car than Fords, if that were possible, and put it on the market, because I think that in an agricultural country it would be a good thing even for the small farmers and the agricultural workers to have some mode of conveyance which would bring them into line with the standard of living of our people in the towns and cities. Some people might think that overidealistic, but only a few years ago people were laughing at the idea of having a water supply and electric light in rural dwelling-houses.  These things have come to pass, and it is only right that they should come to pass.</P>
    <P>In the last few years the pace of development in rural electrification has been intensive, and we can look forward to a time in the very near future when there will be hardly an area throughout the length and breadth of the State which will not enjoy the amenity of electrification.  I have sympathy with the case put up by Deputy Crotty of one man who had been left out of the existing scheme.  That, of course, should not happen, but it is probable that he may be allocated to another area which will be developed later.  However the matter is dealt with, no citizen living in a rural area should be left without this amenity which is being provided for his neighbours.</P>
    <P>I think that, generally speaking, while we can ignore the ranting of the extremists who have always been against industrial development in this country, we can compliment the Minister on the progress that is being made.  The industrialist is not the enemy of the Irish farmer; he is his younger brother, if you like.  I do not think that anybody would put industry on an equal footing with agriculture, but at least they are doing complementary work.  One is providing the essential food for our people and the essential <Col N="1368" /> agricultural exports, and the other is providing the essential manufactured materials which our people require and also goods which can be exported.</P>
    <P>In that connection, I should like to say a word about the tourist industry, which is an important one.  It has made considerable progress.  There is always a certain amount of criticism of those who are called upon to administer a compulsory scheme of inspection.  It is always a difficult task, I suppose, to undertake the inspection of a business carried on by individuals for their own benefit and which is absolutely owned by the individual citizens concerned.  But in regard to the tourist industry, the Tourist Board has the duty and the right to inspect hotels and see that they are up to standard.  Most hoteliers accept that as being desirable not only in the interests of the individual hoteliers but in the general interests of the tourist industry.</P>
    <P>It is not only essential that the person who carries out that work should be efficient but it is also essential that he or she should be diplomatic and endeavour not by any threats or coercion but by persuasion and encouragement to get people to improve the hotel facilities which they give.  It is always a delicate matter but a person of tact and experience can carry it out efficiently without giving offence.</P>
    <P>I think there were in the early days complaints regarding the grading of hotels&mdash;complaints that the grading was on a somewhat unfair basis generally but I do not think that those complaints are as general to-day. The work of the board is appreciated and with a little more tact and diplomacy on the part of the inspectors who visit the hotels, I think the work can be advanced to the satisfaction of both the Tourist Board and the hoteliers.</P>

      <P>Emigration, unemployment and the very high cost of living are the big problems about which we are worrying in Dublin city, unemployment especially.  I was rather surprised when the Minister, on the 28th October, 1953, introducing his Estimate, said:&mdash;</P>

    <P>
      <Col N="1369" />&ldquo;Then I proceeded to say that there had been a general improvement in the conditions as compared with last year, that the temporary trade recession which was experienced internationally in 1952 because of the liquidation of stocks which had been accumulated on the outbreak of the Korean was had ended...&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I do not know why the Minister was so optimistic as to say that conditions had improved because unemployment figures so far as Dublin city is concerned continue to increase.  Emigration is a thing that we all look forward to with dread.  What is going to happen if the tide of emigration is not stopped?</P>
    <P>One has only to go down to the ports and to Westland Row railway station every week to see some of the finest young men and women leave the country in their hundreds.  They all get on the boats for England.  In a few cases whole families are leaving for Canada.</P>

I was in Deputy Briscoe's constituency yesterday and met a group of young men who asked me what was going to be done for them.  They wanted to know if they would have to go down to the boats, emigrate and never be seen again. Unfortunately, that applies particularly to the building trade.</P>
      <P>Building trade workers are going away as fast as they can.  They are getting offers of jobs.  I do not blame them.  I say they have a right to select places to go to where they will get a living if we cannot give them a living at home.  It is a sad sight to see these fine young country boys who should be producing food for export and making money emigrate.  We were told in this House that we have a market for our agricultural produce.

It is most regrettable that they are going away in such numbers but it is still more regrettable that so many of our fine young girls have to leave this country to get a living in another.

I have not the benefit of the experience of the officials that the Minister has behind him to suggest things for these people.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The fact remains that men are unemployed and are seeking work. Their wives are complaining of the high cost of living and say that it prevents them from giving sufficient nourishment to their families.  I often wonder if the Government have dropped the idea altogether of prices control.  The high cost of foodstuffs in Dublin is appalling.  I am just wondering whether Deputy Dr. Browne and Deputy Dr. ffrench-O'Carroll would now suggest what I heard them suggest here once before.  I remember these two eminent gentlemen saying that the withdrawal of the subsidies on bread had raised the price of the loaf from 6d. to 9d.  They did not agree with it, and from the tone of their speeches I was led to believe that these medical gentlemen also objected to the high <Col N="1372" /> prices that are being charged for foodstuffs in the city.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. A. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;to have private conversations with them.  My belief is that the depression we have had set in following the publication of the Central Bank Report in 1951.  The banks then withdrew credit.  They did not allow small builders or industrialists to get the credit they required on fair terms.  That caused unemployment, and I think we are all agreed on that.  I remember that in July, 1951, the Minister for Finance, Deputy MacEntee, said that there was too much money being spent both on current expenditure and on capital development, and in the following month, in speech after speech, the statement was made that we were living beyond our means.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickHogan" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Patrick (Clare) Hogan">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>Surely that is the responsibility of the Minister for Finance and not of the Minister for Industry and Commerce.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. A. Byrne Mr. A. Byrne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. A. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not quoting the Minister for Finance, but I did hear him use the words that there was too much money being spent both on current expenditure and on capital development. I say that from that date the rot set in, and people, as it were, tightened their belts, including business people and shopkeepers.  The shopkeepers started to let assistants go.  They were waiting for the new trade to come along.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister was optimistic in his opening statement on this Estimate when he said that the temporary trade recession, which was experienced internationally in 1952 because of the liquidation of stocks which had been accumulated on the outbreak of the Korean war, was ended.  I wonder <Col N="1373" /> when it ended, and when the unemployed are going to reap the benefits. As I say, shop assistants, storesmen and others were let go at that time. The Dublin Corporation started works of an emergency kind.  There is no use in saying to people, such as I refer to, that we can give them a couple of months' employment on work of that type.  I say that because shop assistants are loking forward to getting back to a decent job with employers who can pay them a decent wage at the business to which they served their time, whether it be grocery, tailoring or drapery.  They want to get work at their own trade.</P>
    <P>I have already drawn attention to the fact that the withdrawal of the subsidies on flour has left the working-class people in this city in the position that they now have to pay 9d. for a loaf which formerly was 6d.  I am hopeful that the Minister will be able to do something to enable the loaf to be sold again at 6d., or at a more reasonable price than it is at the moment.  We have this continuous unemployment amongst married men as well as amongst boys and girls.  It is regrettable that married men should have to emigrate.  It means the breaking up of the home.  Their lodging expenses are heavy at the other side, and at the same time they have to try and send home half their wages.  Most of them are struggling hard to see that their families are kept in a fair way.</P>
    <P>I believe that it was the curtailment of credit by the banks which was largely responsible for disrupting business to such an extent.  In industry and in business houses staffs were reduced. I suggest that we should try and get bigger export markets so that we will be able to give employment to more food producers at home.  These men should be given a decent living. They should be put in a position to enable them to get married and settle down.  A development in exports of agricultural produce is something that all of us desire.  An expansion of industrial exports would also enable more of our industrial workers to get employment in this city.</P>
    <P>The Minister has responsibility for C.I.E.  I was in Dún Laoghaire some <Col N="1374" /> months ago to welcome some passengers home.  While I was very proud of the changes that have taken place at the landing stage there, I was horrified at the condition of the carriages provided for the transport of our visitors to Dublin.  Some of the carriages seemed to me to be 80, 90 or 100 years old.  I was glad to see that traffic is increasing, and I hope that, so far as tourists are concerned, it will continue to increase.  It is a way of bringing more money to the city and should help in the revival of business, following the depression which started, as I said, when the report of the Central Bank was published in 1951.  My principal reason for standing up was to draw the attention of the Government to the continuous unemployment we have in the City of Dublin.</P>

If they have six children or eight children they still draw only 38/-so far as unemployment benefit is concerned.  Six months ago, I asked the Minister for Social Welfare to increase the benefits for them.</P>

      <P>So many speakers have taken part in the discussion on this Estimate that it is quite obvious that we all realise its great importance and particularly its bearing on the everyday activities of the Department of Industry and Commerce in connection with employment and unemployment. <Col N="1376" /> Perhaps even Deputy Briscoe will realise that.  Whatever we may have to say here it is essential that we should make our approach from the one angle and that is the angle which will be of ultimate benefit to the people.  Any remarks I may have to make on this Estimate are to the best of my ability connected with some of these problems that are facing us.  I hope to draw attention, also, to the necessity of endeavouring to remedy, through the activities of the Minister and his Department, certain unsatisfactory aspects of the present situation.</P>
      <P>Deputy Briscoe was undoubtedly an able exponent in the House last night. He drew special attention to the importance of industrialisation.  Perhaps I may have taken him up wrongly but listening to him from the Gallery&mdash; where perhaps we may get a better view of all beneath us&mdash;I got the impression that Deputy Briscoe tried to believe himself that none of the Opposition in this House are in favour of industrial activity in Ireland.  Let him disabuse himself of this silly notion should he be inclined to believe in it.  I will go further and through you, Sir, direct the Minister's attention to the fact that the views expressed by Deputy Briscoe and Deputy Major de Valera are such that if their suggestions were agreed and put into operation, our unemployment problems would be dangling before us for years to come should the present Government still be in office&mdash;to which I am not saying &ldquo;Yes&rdquo; or &ldquo;No&rdquo; at the present time.</P>
      <P>Last night Deputy Briscoe referred to the right of the individual in connection with a 10 per cent. profit plus new bonus shares.  While we are all in favour of industrialisation, according to my notes from the Census of Industrial Production, for the month of October, 1951, out of a total of 202,000 or 203,000 employed in all industrial concerns, one-fifth of them earned less than £2 per week.  Is it correct that over half of the total so employed in industry earned on the average less than £5 per week?  Is it correct to say that a total of roughly 79,100 persons, two-fifths of those employed in industry, are earning less than £4 per week?</P>

      <P>Now, Lord Mayor, we can discuss angles below in Cork, too.  The present Minister for Posts and Telegraphs has expressed views with which we all agree, as to the depreciation of the £.  We have members in this House who say they are pleased with our industrial activities and that an industrialist is entitled to 10 per cent. plus his bonus shares; while at the same time apparently these members are satisfied that so many people employed in industry have been earning such an insufficient wage when we take into consideration the relative value of money at the present time.</P>
      <P>Take, again, Deputy Briscoe's ideal in regard to industry in Ireland.  We have employed here a total of 12,200 girls under the age of 18 in industry. Are Deputy Briscoe and Deputy Major de Valera, the advocates of private enterprise, satisfied that only one out of every eight girls earns over £2 10s. per week?  Are they satisfied that only one out of every 50 girls around the age of 18 years earns over £3 per week?  We all realise industry is essential here.</P>

      <P>Deputy Briscoe is not dealing with Deputy Byrne.  Deputy Briscoe will have to take his medicine, if he wishes to wait for it.  If Deputy Briscoe wants to advocate complete independence to the individual to indulge in a system here of private enterprise in industry, and if he so wishes to inform the present Minister <Col N="1378" /> of that, he may be sure that where we are concerned we are not going to stand for that.  At all times we have made it quite clear that private enterprise in itself can do good for this country, that private enterprise in itself will get from us the co-operation essential, provided that the fair game is going to be played.</P>
      <P>Deputy de Valera last night went into the realms of a very high discussion of socialism versus private enterprise, ably backed by his colleague, who is here in the benches now.  But I would say to both of them, as I would say to Deputy Cogan, who has just concluded, that I have no intention of following either a vindictive or a vicious line of talk.  However, it is childish for Deputy Cogan to come out openly with the idea&mdash;or for Deputy Vivion de Valera to throw it out at another angle&mdash;that the danger of socialism is the danger of communism.</P>
      <P>We believe&mdash;and it is well known to those who may wish to twist it otherwise&mdash;that the difference in our creed is Christian socialism, and we say to everyone in this country that, if they are genuine in their desire to see industry prosper here, it can only prosper provided all sections are going to gain by it.  If that happens, we have true Christian philosophy coupled with Christian socialism in industry.</P>
      <P>There has been much talk of exports of various industrial products.  Exports in themselves, of course, are of great importance to any State.  We realise that our main exports always have been, and probably will be in the future, connected with another Department of State which I have no intention of discussing now.  I believe that the policy on exports, which may have originated in other countries, in itself has not been ultimately of great benefit to the people of that country. Are we prepared to export industrial products from this country at a subsidised rate?  Are we doing it at present, for instance?  And if any commodities from this country are being exported but are being subsidised in order to meet the international market, who is paying that? Are we satisfied to continue that policy?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1379" /> Apparently the present Government, with the power of Deputy Briscoe, were satisfied not only to go to the mere limit agreed for the subsidisation of essential foodstuffs in our country but they now tell us: &ldquo;Export, and we will offer as much subsidy as is necessary in order to capture a world market.&rdquo;  While we are a small country here and while we have our own problems, it is much more important for us to put our own house in order first.  If we can put on the market for home consumption industrial products that it will be within the reach of the working people to buy, then we are doing something of much greater importance than by trying to fly our kite so high as to be found amongst the nations of the earth showing our products in some place, while at the same time we are denying the advantage to our own people of being able to buy at a fair competitive price here in our own country.</P>
    <P>The question of interest on capital was discussed last night.  Perhaps, of course, we should leave it to some members alone to discuss this very intricate problem&mdash;some of us knowing so very little about it.  Even so, it must be admitted that, as shown by records, industrial production per manpower, per earner, has increased within the last few years compared to 1939.  I wonder if the ideals of some Deputies are the ideals of the Minister&mdash;they seem to fit in with the case for the worker increasing his output.  We know that is essential to the State, but the more he increases the more is allowed in shares, even if they are supposed to be 1½d. in the £.  Take, for instance, transportable goods, for which Deputy Briscoe may look up his figures, based on the year 1951.  If we take the net output of transportable goods and break them up between salaries, earnings, overheads, depreciation and profits, what do we find?  Nothing less than salaries, 2/5 in the £; earnings roughly 8/4 in the £; depreciation with overheads, about 3/- in the £; leaving to the poor person that we are told is getting the 1½d. in the £, approximately 6/3 in the £.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>If Deputy Briscoe was sincere, he could go down and study his figures, instead of acting the little leprechaun here.  He would do far better than trying to hide this from the ordinary people.  Deputy Briscoe may show some proof and may like to draw the Minister's attention to it; he may prefer to quote some publication that conveniently shows ultimate profits of 1½d. in the £.  These figures, however, can be arranged so conveniently that salaries and wages are combined.  How often is it done?  Will Deputy Briscoe&mdash;coupled with the Minister, of course&mdash;deny the fact that in some of these industries, by conveniently coupling salaries and earnings we are getting a false figure?</P>
      <P>I heard on one occasion from the lips of an industrialist in this country that he had his own son employed, giving him what he termed pin-money&mdash;but the pin-money amounted to £500 a year.  He also gave him, to keep him on the road, as he said, with his pin-money a motor-car.  Conveniently enough, the accounts of the firm, admitted by the industrialist, showed the figure of 1½d. in the £ profit, but before those figures were made up the pin-money had been taken into consideration, and the motor-car.  It may hurt Deputy Briscoe, but the truth is that we want industry to progress, but in order that it may progress properly we must have a system whereby fair profits are allowed and certainly nothing more than that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are just a few other points upon which I wish to touch very briefly.  The Minister is aware of the increases which took place some time ago in connection with motor and lorry insurance.  After negotiations there was a reduction in the premiums payable upon these insurance policies. Now a number of people are involved in this.  I admit it does not affect everyone in the country.  I put down a question in connection with this matter on one occasion.  I received identical answers from both the Minister for Industry and Commerce and a colleague of his in another Department. <Col N="1381" /> Strange as it may seem, that colleague of the Minister's introduced a system which has the effect of reducing the horse-power of motor-cars; yet, the Minister for Industry and Commerce was apparently quite satisfied when the insurance companies refused to make a reduction in premiums although the horse-power was reduced. I presume the Minister's answer at the time was the answer of the companies: they did not increase the premiums where the horse-power was increased. We all know that the percentage of cases in which the horse-power was increased was negligible.  I believe the Minister now realises that the rake-off the insurance companies have at the expense of lorry owners and motorists generally is both unfair and unjust.  It is only right that the attention of these people should be drawn to this matter with a view to having the position rectified.</P>
    <P>I think all meetings of the Prices Advisory Council should be held in public.  In that way, the people could satisfy themselves as to whether increases or decreases are justified. Until such time as these meetings are held in public, the people will not be satisfied.</P>
    <P>Deputy Cogan raised one matter, but I am afraid he was suffering from an attack of air sickness at the time. Being a new recruit, I am wondering if the Minister tipped him off.  The Minister tipped Deputy Corry off in telling him not to put any bets on Midleton.  Deputy Cogan said this evening that he was delighted to hoe in with Deputy Corry in the claim for Farmers' Cross.  We have heard a good deal about Farmers' Cross and Midleton.  Are there any claims for Passage West?  Is it possible the Minister may slip a fast one over on Deputy Corry, Deputy Cogan and Deputy Lehane and establish an air base at Passage West?  I know tremendous activity has gone on in that area; reports have been sent to the Minister demonstrating the importance of that locality as an air base.  I think the best thing the Minister can do now is to establish an air base in Passage West.  That should help Deputy Cogan <Col N="1382" /> out in his mistake and Deputy Corry in relation to his bets.</P>
    <P>There is no doubt that the conversion of the railways to the diesel system is a tremendous boon.  The life of certain branch lines may at the moment be hanging in the balance.  Has the Minister any information as to what the intentions are in relation to these branch lines?  Conversion to the diesel system on these lines would be a tremendous benefit, and the sooner that is done the better it will be. Deputy de Valera referred to his abhorrence of socialisation or nationalisation. He pointed to C.I.E. as an example.  We all know that that system was not nationalised until the individuals running it found themselves stuck in the mud and, for that reason, I do not believe we can take C.I.E. as an example of failure where State enterprise is concerned.</P>
    <P>From an examination of the balance sheets, while losses are significant on the railways, a profit is shown on the running of the buses.  I do not think the policy of C.I.E. has been fair to those using the bus services.  The rates charged per mile in the country areas are prohibitive as compared with the rates charged in Dublin.  I think the company is taking an unfair advantage of those who are compelled to use the buses, particularly the workers living 18 or 20 miles outside Cork City.  They are being fleeced.  If the present policy continues, the people now using the buses will cease to use them and losses will be even heavier next year.</P>
    <P>Many Deputies referred to the importance of rural electrification.  I certainly appreciate the immense benefits which have resulted from rural electrification.</P>
    <P>We all know the problem of unemployment and the difficulties it can create in every area.  It is strange that for some time past a system has been creeping in of not replacing men who are employed locally to check meters and to help people who have minor trouble with electric fittings.  For instance, in Crosshaven there was a man employed for many years as an account collector.  He was a help to many people.  He could supply them <Col N="1383" /> with an electric light switch and, if necessary, install it.  When he retired, the E.S.B. refused to replace him.  The position now is that the nearest man available to do this work is nine miles away.  My information is that that is happening in every case where such E.S.B. employees retire.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. Lemass) Seán F. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. Lemass)</NameTxt>
      <P>During the course of the debate, we had a large number of speeches and, may I say, a variety of types of speeches.  Some Deputies thought that this was a suitable occasion to make observations, profound or otherwise, upon wide questions of general policy.  Others, more sensibly I think, decided to confine their remarks to specific questions of immediate national or local importance.  We had the usual few speeches inspired solely by political motives, of no great importance except perhaps to those who made them, and a couple of typically irresponsible productions from Deputies who always amuse the Dáil upon occasions like this.</P>
      <P>Deputy Cosgrave, who opened for the Opposition, made a point which many others repeated during the course of the debate.  He said that the increased employment which has resulted from the development of manufacturing industries in this country has done little more than compensate for the decrease in employment over the same period on the land. I think that is a very misleading picture of what has happened here during the past 20 years or so.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When I became Minister for Industry and Commerce first, the number of persons registered as unemployed at <Col N="1384" /> the labour exchanges was in or around 20,000, although at that time this country was affected, as other countries were, by the greatest economic siump in the world's history.  Everybody knew that the number of registered unemployed was a very false reflection of the economic situation in the country and that any plan for dealing with unemployment through the expansion of industry had necessarily to provide for a much larger number than the total then registered at the employment exchanges.  We took steps, shortly after we came into office, to make the unemployment register more realistic and within a very short time the number on it increased to something like 125,000, which was probably not a very complete picture but certainly a far more accurate picture of the unemployment situation than existed previously.</P>
    <P>We knew that part of the problem of the country was to provide alternative employment for farmers' sons and others who were returned at the census as being engaged in agriculture but who were in fact unemployed or underemployed upon the land.  It was a tremendous advantage to this country to have these people taken out of these unremunerated occupations in which they were described as being engaged and put into permanent and much better-paid employment in manufacturing industry.</P>
    <P>The probability is that if the new jobs for 120 odd thousand had not been created in this country by the development of that industry, that additional number would have emigrated over the period.</P>
    <P>I will admit that that in itself is not a complete answer to the point which Deputies were trying to make.  If they are just condemning the whole idea of industrial development as useless, as merely meaning a switching of employment from one activity to another, then they are completely wrong. If they mean that the all-over economic advance of the country has not been sufficient to give us a normal population increase, then I would agree with them.  In fact the whole aim of economic policy is now and must continue to be to get such an expansion <Col N="1385" /> in employment-giving activities, both in agriculture and manufacturing industry, that emigration will be checked and the normal growth in population which our marriage and birth rate statistics would lead us to expect will appear.</P>
    <P>The development of industry did a great deal more as, I think, Deputy Cosgrave admitted.  It gave this country a much stronger and better balanced economy, a much better foundation upon which to build our future progress.  It is the realisation of the fact that the foundations of future progress have been well and truly laid that enables us to face the future with confidence that we can get still better results in the years ahead.</P>
    <P>Deputy Larkin drew, from the same statistics as Deputy Cosgrave quoted, the conclusion that private enterprise would not do the job which this nation requires to have done.  I am not sure that the statistics justify that conclusion&mdash;in fact I am certain that they do not.  Whatever has been done or can be done in the future was not possible and will not be possible without private enterprise.  The aim and the policy of the present Government at any rate, is to endeavour to create in the country the conditions in which private enterprise can operate successfully. We recognise that private enterprise responds to the profit motive, that it cannot work without the profit motive, and that it will not work vigorously enough unless its right to profits is recognised, unless, in fact, we get a new situation in the Dáil in which the successful firm which makes profits is generally congratulated instead of being abused and condemned.  It would be a far more serious situation for this country if the manufacturing firms in it were making losses instead of profits.  I agree that in our special circumstances, with a limited home market protected by tariffs, we have to ensure that that situation is not improperly exploited to the public detriment, particularly where the number of firms engaged in any particular line is small.</P>
    <P>How to handle that problem has been a matter that we have considered on a number of occasions.  Before the <Col N="1386" /> war we passed various enactments giving us power to investigate prices and to make Orders regulating the prices charged by protected industries. I came to the conclusion that that system of control was ineffective or at any rate incomplete in so far as it operated only to supervise and limit profits and often the biggest profits were made by the firms which charged the lowest prices and firms which charged the highest prices were making only losses.</P>
    <P>Subsequent to the war I thought of tackling that problem in a new way. The Industrial Prices and Efficiency Bill introduced in 1947 represented the ideas that I entertained then.  It proved to be, when it was brought to the House, unexpectedly controversial. I had thought that that Bill with some modification would have secured general acceptance.  It was supported by the Labour Party.  It was very strongly opposed by the Fine Gael Party, and although it secured a Second Reading it had not become law before the change of Government took place in 1948.  It was not proceeded with by the new Government.</P>
    <P>I have already told the Dáil that we have got to face that problem again next year.  At present we exercise control over prices under the authority of the Supplies and Services Act, a temporary Act which the Government has decided will be renewed now for a further period of 15 months and then expire permanently.  I have been charged by the Government with the duty of producing to the Dáil proposals for permanent legislation for the control of prices in normal circumstances before the end of 1954, and the same issues will arise when those proposals, whatever they may be, are submitted to the Dáil.  Are we going to deal with prices solely in relation to profits, or are we going to tackle the more fundamental issue of costs which are far more important in determining the level of prices than are profits?</P>
    <P>I will not disagree with Deputy Larkin in his assertion that there are many industrial projects which in our circumstances cannot be entrusted to private enterprise, because private enterprise will not either produce the <Col N="1387" /> financial resources to make them possible or organise itself on a sufficiently comprehensive scale for that purpose.  In fact, I hope to have proposals of a very definite kind for some large-scale industrial developments of that character before the Dáil in the near future.  I would have preferred from many points of view if those projects could have been initiated by private enterprise, but in our conditions that is not likely to be possible, and the fact that they will have to operate on a more or less monopolistic basis justifies the intervention of the State in these undertakings, because the State would have to exercise, in any event, a considerable measure of control over them.</P>
    <P>Even in relation to the extent that we are relying on private enterprise in the development of industry, Deputy Larkin said that we were not doing our work efficiently, that the Department of Industry and Commerce is not properly organised and that the Department is not giving sufficient assistance to private firms sponsoring new industrial proposals.  I personally can find no justification for Deputy Larkin's criticisms.  He said that firms are often faced with unreasonable requests to produce statistics relating to imports and markets when they are proposing to manufacture some new line of goods.  That is not correct.  It is true that people often come to the Department of Industry and Commerce with industrial proposals which are half baked, which they have not thought out fully, which they cannot relate either to market needs or possibilities.  The work of the officers of the Department is directed towards getting such people to think out their proposals fully and to examine with great care the possibilities of success, and if they are asked to inquire as to the extent of the market or conduct some other investigation of that kind it is only in their own interest so that they will realise fully what they are up against and what their prospects are.  I have had, as Minister for Industry and Commerce, an extraordinary number of tributes to the officers of the Department, <Col N="1388" /> particularly the officers of the industrial section of the Department &mdash;tributes to the value of the work they have done in helping persons proposing to engage in new industries to get their plans into shape and modified where modification was necessary to ensure their success.</P>
    <P>Deputy Larkin gave as an example some industrial project in County Mayo where he said the promoters were faced with unreasonable requests for information of a statistical character. From the records of the Department I may say that I am unable to identify the particular project to which the Deputy referred.</P>
    <P>Deputy McQuillan also complained that the Department was, as he said, tied up in red tape.  His complaint was based upon a particular request made by himself on behalf of a local industrial development committee.  I would like to refer to this in some detail because it raises an issue of some importance, as the Dáil will appreciate. Deputy McQuillan, at the request of some local development association, came to the Department and said that this association wanted to contact some firms in England that might be interested in establishing a textile industry in Roscommon, and they asked the Department of Industry and Commerce to recommend the English firms they should approach.  That is a responsibility which the Department could not take.  He was referred to the list published by the Federation of British Manufacturers and was told that if he could not get a copy elsewhere it would be available to him in the National Library.  He thought that that was unreasonable, but Deputies will appreciate that it is not possible for the Minister for Industry and Commerce or any of his officials to take the responsibility of recommending to a local development committee a particular firm in England about which the Department may have very little information.  If such a firm came either in conjunction with a local development association or independently to submit a proposal we would make all the usual inquiries we could through trade channels as to its financial status and business reputation, but we just could not do that for all <Col N="1389" /> the firms upon the B.F.I. list merely to have information available to local development associations if they should want to contact them.</P>
    <P>It must be admitted also that we cannot provide Irish business people with the same service that is provided by the British Board of Trade.  We have not an organisation as extensive or expansive as that which the British Board of Trade operate.  However, any of the services to which Deputy McQuillan referred are, in fact, provided. We also get queries from abroad as to firms that might be in a position to supply particular classes of goods or requests for information as to the availability of a particular type of goods that are manufactured here. These queries are sent to individual firms or to the appropriate trade association.  From the point of view of firms anxious to engage in export business, so far as the dollar market is concerned, Córas Tráchtála provide quite substantial services.  These services include trade information. That term can be extended to cover a great deal because Córas Tráchtála will, in fact, undertake a special survey of market possibilities in any dollar country where prospects appear to warrant it.  They are providing expert assistance to individual firms in designing products for dollar markets. They are organising technical assistance projects for industrial groups, designed to improve their productive methods to an extent that will make it possible for them to expand into export markets.  They will organise the dispatch of trial consignments to suitable agents in America or Canada with a view to ascertaining sales possibilities there and securing repeat orders. Of course, they now have in operation the export credit guarantee and joint venture insurance schemes that we legislated for some time ago.  They give advice regarding shipping facilities or customs duties that may be in force.</P>
    <P>While it is true that these services are limited at the present time to dollar markets, it is possible that they may be extended to other areas later on although that will not be for a couple of years, at least.  The work <Col N="1390" /> that has to be done in developing export trade in the dollar markets is quite considerable and represents as big a labour as Córas Tráchtála can undertake with its present staff and resources.</P>
    <P>I was asked for my opinion as to the prospects of dollar markets.  I think they are quite considerable.  It is true that market conditions there change more rapidly, perhaps, than in some other countries, but my personal examination of the position convinces me that openings for many classes of Irish goods exist both in Canada and the United States of America large enough to produce, in time, trade of quite substantial dimensions.  It is true that these are enormous markets and that the share of them that we can hope to get will be very small but a very small share of these markets for any of the goods we have to export would be very big business for us. Competition is so keen there that the mere fact that our products are different from those that are available from other sources will, in itself, get them the first entry.  There is also a great deal of goodwill for Irish products there and that, too, will help to that end.  The second or third order will depend entirely on the quality of the goods and their saleability and upon the integrity of the business methods which our firms adopt in relation to their customers or potential customers on the other side of the Atlantic.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DanielMorrissey" hpid="Mr. Morrissey Mr. Morrissey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Morrissey</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="DanielMorrissey" hpid="Mr. Morrissey Mr. Morrissey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Morrissey</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I have said that already.  There is no hope of trying to seek sales there on the basis of shipping surpluses of goods produced for the home market.  Climatic conditions, trade methods and personal tastes are completely different.  Even in such a matter as footwear, the design and shape are entirely different from what we are accustomed to here.</P>
      <P>I have been gratified to hear from a number of firms during the past two or three weeks that they have been receiving orders for their products from Canada and the United States. A very considerable amount of interest has been aroused in the possibilities of these markets, leading to visits by Irish business managers over there to explore for themselves.  It will take some time to build up trade of substantial dimensions but the possibilities are there, I am certain, provided we go after them vigorously enough.</P>
      <P>Deputy Cowan raised a very important issue.  He asked: &ldquo;What assurance have we, if we exert ourselves to develop sales of industrial products in the American markets, that customs duties will not be raised or the terms of trade altered so that our efforts will be defeated?&rdquo;  I do not think we have any assurance.  One of the matters that caused us concern recently was the fact that the question of a revision of the American customs duty upon table glassware and cut-glass products was sent to their Tariff Commission. Up to the present, the outcome of that review by their Tariff Commission of the customs duty upon table glassware is not known.  Exports of Waterford glass were one of the developments of a most satisfactory character which occurred this year, and the fact that that was likely to be affected adversely by some change in the American tariff naturally caused us concern.  There is always the risk that conditions there may change to our detriment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Under an agreement made in 1932, we have the right to preferential rates of duty in the Canadian market.  These rights have persisted ever since and they are of considerable advantage to us.  So far as the American market is concerned, we have no such rights. <Col N="1392" /> Indeed, of all the goods we ship to America at the present time, only three or four types are not subject to a duty of some dimensions.</P>
    <P>I have said that we have to endeavour to develop the American market for our products with conditions as they exist, and that we cannot hope to secure any alteration in these conditions.  Some more powerful nation seeking American trade may have bargaining power with the American Government that would get them an adjustment of tariff rates in their favour.  We have not that bargaining power.  We have to deal with conditions as they are and, even as they are&mdash;assuming that they are not altered to our detriment&mdash;these possibilities are there.</P>
    <P>The whole future of American policy is under review at the present time. A public debate was conducted by the newspapers, through speeches by American political leaders and in various American Government publications as to the wisdom or otherwise of changing the traditional American policy regarding international trade. That whole issue has been referred, through the President of the United States of America, to a commission which has to report next spring.  I do not think there will be any change of any consequence in American conditions pending the report of that commission.  Whether there is likely to be any change after the publication of the report is a matter on which I should not like to express an opinion. It seems fairly clear that American public opinion is coming round to recognising the obligations which arise from the predominant position of the United States in world trade.</P>
    <P>I disagree also with Deputy Cowan in his view that trade possibilities in Germany are limited.  We are at present exporting to Germany products of one kind and another totalling in value a little less than £1,000,000 per year.  It is true that we import from Germany a great deal more, but we import machinery and materials from Germany because we buy there to better advantage than anywhere else. We do not have to strike an absolute balance in our trade with any individual country.  So long as the overall <Col N="1393" /> position is satisfactory, we can exploit the possibilities in individual markets as they arise and without very particular reference to the state of trade with that country, even though the emergence of a balance against us is occasionally to be used as a bargaining factor in the negotiation of trade agreements.</P>
    <P>Last year, as the House will know, we opened an Irish pavilion at the Frankfort Trade Fair.  German practice appears to be to do a great deal of a year's buying at trade fairs, and last year, before the German Government had liberalised a great deal of their trade, they encouraged that practice by giving special import quotas for goods purchased at trade fairs.  That pavilion has been used by Irish exporters since it opened, and a substantial amount of business has resulted.  It is true that many of the products that offer the best prospect in the German market have since been liberalised.  We are not now either restricted by import quotas or assisted by them, and exporters of these goods have to get their customers to buy them in competition with goods from all other countries, but a substantial amount of trade has resulted, and in fact the main problem I see arising in Germany is that we may miss out to some extent by inability to meet all the orders that are forthcoming, particularly for tweeds. The German market for tweeds is quite good, and I have received complaints from some sources that orders were accepted here and not fulfilled.  Of course, that is bad, and could do damage of a permanent kind.</P>
    <P>An interesting trade developed there this year in gypsum board and, in fact, the whole of the industrial quota of the trade fair in August was secured by a firm that manufactures and exports gypsum board.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>There was a great deal of investigation, as the Deputy can probably guess for himself.  It is certainly not intended to exercise any <Col N="1394" /> control over these matters, because I think that would do more harm than good, but we can, by various methods of exhortation, prevent that situation reappearing.  The great thing to note is that in relation to the three markets I have mentioned&mdash;Canada, United States and West Germany&mdash; they are rapidly expanding markets. In each of these countries, the demand for goods is increasing yearly, and consequently there is now a better opportunity of getting our products established on these markets than there would be in the reverse circumstances, where trade was stagnant or declining. That is certainly true of Canada where the population and production have doubled in 20 years and where expansion is still continuing at the same rate.  It is equally true of Germany which has recovered with remarkable speed from the consequences of the war and which is now becoming again one of the strongest countries in Europe economically.</P>
      <P>It is true, however, that what Deputy Cowan said must always be kept in mind, that Britain is still by far the largest market available to us and the market in which we have the most advantageous conditions of trade under the existing trade agreements, but a diversity of markets will contribute to our strength, and it is important that we should seek it, particularly at times like the present when exchange restrictions are still in force, because it gives us an element of security in relation to ability to purchase essential supplies which may at some times be important.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Cowan asked what was our attitude to O.E.E.C., the Organisation for European Economic Co-operation. We are members of that organisation and we aim to support it positively, but perhaps for somewhat different reasons from those which may operate in the case of other countries.  We are excluded from the United Nations, and for various reasons have not been able to play a part in many international organisations to the same extent as other small countries.  Therefore, we have a particular interest in supporting and participating in the activities of these organisations such as O.E.E.C., <Col N="1395" /> into which we can secure admission and which are working for results of which we approve.</P>
    <P>The main work of the O.E.E.C. was the preparation of the agreement for the liberalisation of trade.  So far as we are concerned, we are conforming to the requirements of that liberalising agreement which requires every country to keep free of quota restrictions 75 per cent. of its total imports on private account.  We have not merely conformed to that requirement, but, quite recently, when I proposed to bring into operation a new quota order on woollen yarns and proposed to O.E.E.C. that that act of ours would be brought into line with the requirements of that agreement, that we would take out of the non-liberalised list which we had previously furnished to them, particular items which would still mean that, even with the new quota order in operation, we could claim that 75 per cent. of our total trade was still liberalised, the Council of O.E.E.C. would not agree that, by doing so, we were conforming to the letter and the spirit of our agreement, and consequently we revoked the quota order on woollen yarns and substituted it by an import duty.</P>

      <P>The O.E.E.C agreement does not deal with tariffs; it deals only with quotas.  They have, in the course of their time, produced a number of offshoot organisations, in some of which we are not interested, such as the organisation dealing with inter-European transport problems which do not affect us.  They at one time seemed to be likely to propose an organisation dealing with inter-European civil aviation which did not seem to us to be a good idea.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes.  If we wanted to go further now in withdrawing from liberalisation we would have to do as the British did&mdash;notify the council of the organisation that we were unable to comply with the requirements of the agreement and accept the consequences. There is an escape clause.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, under the terms of the agreement and so far as the liberalised list is concerned.  On the basis of our present trade, we are in the position that 75 per cent. is liberalised and 25 per cent. is not.  If we alter that position, in relation to our present trade pattern, we would not meet our obligation under the agreement.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>No quota in respect to that portion of our trade which is at present liberalised without having to reconsider the position in relation to O.E.E.C.  Remember that Great Britain, which is from many points of view a much stronger country than ours, withdrew from the agreement and has only 50 per cent. or 55 per cent. of its trade liberalised.  It is true that last week the British Minister at the meeting of the Council of O.E.E.C. announced their intention to get back to 75 per cent. liberalisation in the course of the year.  France has also withdrawn from the agreement, and so far as I know does not propose to go back yet to 75 per cent. liberalisation.</P>

      <P>What about tariffs?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>The O.E.E.C. agreement does not affect tariffs at all. Deputy Cowan asked what was the position with regard to G.A.A.T.&mdash; General Agreement on Trade and Tariffs.  We have taken no part in the organisation of G.A.A.T.  That organisation arose from an international convention which was negotiated in 1947 and under which it was proposed to set up an international trade organisation. That flopped.  No country ratified the convention and the organisation never came into existence, but this interim organisation of G.A.A.T. has remained in existence.  We have not participated in its work nor are we members of the organisation.  That has involved no disadvantage as yet as far as we are concerned.</P>
      <P>I was referring to the off-shoot organisation of O.E.E.C.  To the extent that we had an interest in the work of these organisations we took an active part in them.  There is, for instance, the Green Pool proposal.  The European productivity agency to which Deputy Cowan referred is only a project at the present time.  We have indicated that we are prepared to go along with the formation of the agency as proposed, but since then we have heard nothing further about it.  So far as all these organisations are concerned, it is good policy for this country to participate as actively as possible in their work, particularly during the present situation in which our participation in other international organisations is restricted.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Larkin asked why we shall not be able to publish a report of the Industrial Development Authority.  My answer is that the work of that organisation is of a character that does not lend itself to the preparation of an annual report.  I explained that the organisation is now dealing with specific matters that I have referred <Col N="1398" /> to them.  I have asked them to see if they can promote projects for the establishment of industries to make particular commodities, a list of which I gave them.  I do not want even to name that list of commodities because it could produce complications which Deputies will understand.  I have also given them the task of reorganising some projects which were approved of at one time but which got into difficulties. They were dealing with individual tasks of that kind which involve a great deal of discussion with private interests, and the reports they submit to me are of a very confidential kind because they deal with the affairs of private concerns.</P>
    <P>The Industrial Development Authority have also certain other responsibilities. They act as the tariff-reviewing body which we were required by the terms of the 1938 agreement with Great Britain to maintain.  They have also been dealing with trade loan guarantee applications although latterly, for various reasons, I have resorted to the older practice of having two or three committees rather than one committee to deal with these applications.  They have also been entrusted with various investigations of a specific limited kind which I desired them to undertake.</P>
    <P>It will be appreciated that there cannot be an annual report, in the ordinary meaning of the term, upon their work but I should like the House to feel that they are doing an important job at the present time.  It is true that in respect of some of the commodities which I referred to them they had to report that the prospects of getting factories established to make them in this country are very poor or do not exist at all.  In other cases, they appear to be likely to get substantial results for which they will be entitled to credit.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>They deal only with projects for the manufacture of specific commodities which I have put on the list.  Deputy Larkin said that the <Col N="1399" /> Prices Advisory Body is dormant.  That is not entirely correct.  It is true that they have not had a great deal of work to do lately.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>The fact is there has been very little movement in prices for the past six months or so.  Consequently the number of applications for authority to revise prices and the number of investigations which the body has had to undertake have been very substantially reduced.  However, it is obviously undesirable to make any change in that position just at the time when we are considering what permanent organisation we will require to deal with prices.</P>
      <P>Deputy Desmond raised some questions concerning the procedure of the Prices Advisory Body.  So far as I am concerned I have not dictated any procedure to them at all.  The body was in existence when I resumed office as Minister and they are carrying on precisely in the same way now as previously. Certainly they got no directions from me to alter their procedure in any way.</P>
      <P>There is one other matter in regard to general industrial policy to which I wish to refer before proceeding to deal with specific matters.  Deputy Barry, the new Deputy from East Cork, Deputy Crotty and some other Deputies, spoke on this matter of industrial decentralisation in a way which suggested to me that they did not understand very much about it. Deputy Barry spoke of factories being doled out by Fianna Fáil, and of Fermoy being neglected.  That is a completely false conception of what is going on in the Department of Industry and Commerce.  We are not in the position of having a group of factories under the counter which we hand out to deputations which come to us if they make a good case for them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In every case where a new factory has been established in any town it resulted from somebody's initiative, not necessarily local initiative, although local initiative often had a great part in it.  Somebody came with a <Col N="1400" /> proposition, or was induced to put up a proposition, to establish a factory for some purpose and were either themselves attracted by the facilities available in some town or were persuaded to consider those facilities before making a decision as to the location of their enterprise.</P>
    <P>When Deputy Barry suggests that the Fianna Fáil Government let down Fermoy by not putting a factory there before this, I would answer that it is far nearer the truth to say that Fermoy let down the Government by not promoting factories before this. Certainly, if any business group had come to the Department of Industry and Commerce with a proposition for an industrial project in that town which they were prepared to finance in whole or in part, they would be received with open arms and given every reasonable help they could have expected.</P>
    <P>The aim of the Government has been to encourage industrial decentralisation. It has encouraged that by various enactments and by exhortation. We have, I think, on a number of occasions succeeded in persuading people proposing to promote new factories that they would be better off by locating them in a small town rather than in one of the larger cities which they had originally in mind. But the fact of the matter is that the force of commercial advantage is often so great that no argument and no inducement will stop people from locating enterprises in Dublin and Cork, or in the East coast towns. We can, therefore, exercise the maximum pressure upon all people proposing to engage in industry to move West or South or to the Midlands without feeling that we are doing any harm to the East, because the East will get its fair share of any development.</P>
    <P>The suggestion made by Deputy Barry that we should prevent new industries being established in Dublin is impracticable.  There is no point in passing a law giving a Minister power to issue orders that no new factory is to be established in Dublin, or of similar effect, without contemplating the sanctions he will have to apply in <Col N="1401" /> order to get his order obeyed and the degree of control which it would be necessary to exercise over industry in order to carry out a policy of compulsion of that character would be so considerable that no industrial development would result at all.  We have to implement this policy of industrial decentralisation by means of inducements and exhortations and not by methods of compulsion.</P>
    <P>Deputy McQuillan dealt with the question of whiskey exports.  I have spoken on that previously and I expressed certain views as to how increased whiskey sales in dollar markets might be secured.  I must confess that, following some personal inquiries which I made while over there, I am not now as sure that the views I then expressed are sound as I was when I made them, but I have not to come to a final conclusion upon that matter yet.</P>
    <P>As I told Deputy McQuillan, arrangements have been made by Córas Tráchtála with a United States firm of market research consultants to have a market and consumer survey carried out for Irish whiskey in the United States.  That survey entails a detailed examination of the present methods of distributing Irish whiskey, together with an investigation of its acceptability to American consumers and various taste tests which we hope will be of advantage to our whiskey distillers and exporting firms in determining future policy.</P>
    <P>I met the Irish Whiskey Exporters' Association and I told them that the Government would be prepared to go a considerable way in giving practical support to any plans they prepared for the expansion of Irish whiskey sales, particularly to the dollar market.</P>
    <P>I have not yet received the plans from them, but I would be unfair to them just to say that and leave it without further explanation because, subsequent to meeting them, I gave the matter some consideration and thought it would be desirable to entrust Córas Tráchtála with the job of organising this exploration of the possibilities of increasing whiskey sales and they have been in consultation with the distillers <Col N="1402" /> and exporters and others interested and I am awaiting their proposals.</P>
    <P>Deputy Keyes referred to the need for speeding up rural electrification.  I have already informed the House, and I think the House will be glad to know that as from the present month the rate of development in the rural electrification scheme is being increased by 50 per cent and that there will be a further 50 per cent increase in March next so that next year there will be twice the number of people employed on the erection of the rural network and areas will be linked in under the scheme at double the previous rate. That means I understand that the whole rural electrification scheme will be completed in approximately five or six years at the most.</P>
    <P>It was a matter for consideration whether it was better to proceed at the old pace, recognising that it would limit the unemployment problem that might result when the job was done, or double the pace and double the problem and bring it forward in time also.  But I am satisfied that the advantage of rapid expansion of the scheme is such that it is preferable to proceed as quickly as possible with the development of the various areas and to leave to be solved later the problems that may arise.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DanielMorrissey" hpid="Mr. Morrissey Mr. Morrissey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Morrissey</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>The materials position has been eased for a long time.  Perhaps I might make some reference now to the Cork airport.  I have said that the technical surveys required to enable a decision to be made as to its location have been completed and the results are being prepared in a report to the Government upon which the Government will take a decision in the near future.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Corry quoted me as saying that a previous meteorological survey had resulted in a recommendation in favour of a site near Midleton.  That is correct, but it would be entirely wrong for anyone to assume that the only consideration which will determine <Col N="1403" /> the location of the airport is the suitability of local meteorological conditions. Meteorological conditions are only one of the factors that will determine the decision.  In fact, the most important consideration must be its location in relation to the City of Cork. The nearer the airport is to Cork, the better prospect of business at the airport. Indeed, it is also true to say that the meteorological considerations are less important now than they were in 1947, because various navigational aids which have been developed in the meantime permit of safer operations in adverse meteorological conditions than would have been possible then. However, I would dislike to see this question of the site of the airport becoming the subject of local controversy. So far as I am concerned, I do not care where it will be.  Technical and commercial considerations will determine its site.  So long as it is conveniently located to the city and so long as it is capable of safe operation, the main considerations that must arise in my mind will be met.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>The airport will not be in the city.  That is a certainty.  A number of Deputies referred to An Tóstal.  On the old principle that he starts the fight who strikes the second blow, I do not want to reply to their criticisms to the period selected.  It would, I think, completely destroy the whole plan of An Tóstal if it became in any way controversial in a political sense.  So far as I am concerned, I am prepared to leave the question of its timing to the judgment of those who are responsible for its organisation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are certain factors which, I think, Deputies should keep in mind. I referred to them at a recent function of the Irish Tourist Association.  It is not enough to get the hotel-keepers and local tourist bodies together and ask them at what time they would like to get increased off-season business. <Col N="1404" /> It is more important to know at what time we are more likely to get more visitors from abroad, as off-season traffic, and it is necessary to bear in mind that it is a very difficult operation to induce people to come at a time when they would not normally come.</P>
    <P>When we consulted a number of American experts in tourist trade promotion they all said St. Patrick's Day, which was a day known throughout the world to be associated with Ireland. The fact that St. Patrick's Day is in the middle of Lent ruled it out. It did emphasise to my mind, however, the fact that the day and the associations of the day in relation to this matter of increasing off-season traffic was more important than the time of the year or the weather conditions prevailing at the time.  It was decided to organise the first An Tóstal to begin on Easter Sunday and to relate it with Easter because it was thought that Easter was a day which had some historical associations, and because it is a feast day known throughout the world.  No expenditure is necessary to tell people the date of Easter Sunday. Everybody knew Easter Sunday and the date on which it fell, whereas a Sunday or a week-day picked arbitrarily for the beginning of An Tóstal would have to be specially publicised and built up in the minds of those whom we were trying to attract to the country.</P>
    <P>There is also another consideration. One of the things which An Bord Fáilte is trying to do is to get reduced fares from airlines and shipping companies during An Tóstal.  They will not succeed in getting reduced fares from these people except at a period when they are anxious to increase traffic, that is to say, when their accommodation is not normally full.  Anyway, the decision in regard to holding An Tóstal has been taken so far as next year is concerned.  The publicity and organisational work have been related to starting An Tóstal next year at Easter. Fortunately, Easter, 1954, will be a fortnight later than this year.  After that, consideration can be given to the question whether it is then sufficiently well established as a national festival <Col N="1405" /> to enable us to move it round to some other period of the year.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>That is another point I was going to make.  Let us give it a fair chance.  It is far more important for us to extend the tourist industry by lengthening the tourist season than by increasing the facilities available during the normal season.  We can make the existing facilities earn more money and improve employment in the tourist industry.  If Deputies have good criticisms to offer relating to the details of the organisational arrangements, then by all means convey these criticisms to the responsible bodies, Bord Fáilte or the director of An Tóstal.  But until we have got this thing going well, the avoidance of unnecessary public criticism is to be desired.</P>

      <P>I do not know how to deal with Deputy Dillon's observations regarding hides.  Either he knows nothing about the position or else he has given a completely distorted picture to the Dáil.  I think he was trying to show he was a better Minister for Agriculture than his successor.  At <Col N="1406" /> the time I became Minister for Industry and Commerce in June, 1951, Irish tanners were limited in the price they paid to butchers to a maximum of 8d. per lb.  In fact, at that time the butchers were kicking up a fuss.  Their hides were being stored.  A number of tanneries were closed down and others were importing hides.  The carcase meat exporters were complaining that they could not develop their business unless they got the world price for hides, which at that time was very high, 3/6 or 4/- per lb.  An arrangement was made under which the hides arising from the slaughter of beasts for export as carcase meat were to be purchased by the Irish tanners at a price of 2/6 per lb.  Those hides would be marked by some process.</P>
      <P>It was not a very definite arrangement. It was not based on any Government Order or legal enactment.  It was a sort of voluntary understanding that the tanners would buy these hides at 2/6 per lb.  There was no contract entered into by any individual tanner. In fact, the inducement to an individual tanner to avoid buying a hide at 2/6 when other hides were available at 8d. per lb. was very obvious. I thought that the price fixed for hides arising from slaughter for home consumption here was too low.  I raised it to 10d. and it is now 1/-.  If that is the basis of comparison between Deputy Dillon and Deputy Walsh, as Minister for Agriculture, then Deputy Walsh is 50 per cent. better than he is.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Shortly after I resumed office as Minister the price of hides internationally slumped.  The 2/6 per hide which the carcase meat exporters had been promised from the Irish tanners was then much more than the international price.  All during the 1951 season these hides were accumulating upon which the carcase meat exporters had been promised 2/6 and which the tanners were not buying.  When I came to try to settle this situation that was the position.  The carcase meat exporters came to me and said they were owed £500,000 by the tanners in respect of these hides and if they did not get that £500,000 they would be all broke. The tanners said they owed £500,000 <Col N="1407" /> and could not pay it, and that if it was insisted they should pay they would be broke.  I made the only practical arrangement.  The tanners formed themselves into an association called Associated Tanners, Limited. They borrowed £500,000 from the bank, paid off the carcase meat exporters the money they owed them and proceeded to pay the bank by levying on themselves 3d. per hide purchased by them and used in their tanneries.  That process of recovering the amount due to the bank is still in operation, and so long as it is in operation it is clear that we must keep control of the export of hides.</P>
    <P>We now allow the carcase meat exporters to export their hides.  They are exporting their hides to the extent that tanners have to buy them back to supplement their other purchases, at the international price which is now about 1/6 or 1/7 a lb. for top grade hides.  That arrangement will end some time.  It is completely false to suggest that the producer of cattle is affected in the slightest by it.  The price of cattle is not determined by the price of the hide, and if it was then we would have a far greater interest in the warble fly than we now have because the difference in price that a tanner will pay for a warbled hide as against a clear hide is from 6d. to 8d. per lb.  If we could only get a realisation of the loss and damage which the warble fly is doing, then we could at least add, as I pointed out on a recent occasion, £2,000,000 a year to the production of the country.  If the difference of 6d. per lb. in the price of a hide affects the price which the farmer gets for his cattle, then the farmer should take a greater interest in the warble fly and should make some effort to wipe him out as other countries have done, and as we could do.  This is an arrangement which does not affect farmers at all but rather tanners and carcase meat exporters.</P>

      <P>It is true that it may affect consumers to some extent because, of course, the over-all return <Col N="1408" /> which the butcher receives for a beast is affected by the price paid for the hide.  In any event, that is the situation which I inherited, and I am trying to clean it up, and it will be cleaned up in a short time.  When the debt to the banks has been cleared off we will then be free to consider what conditions should operate in connection with the export of hides in the future.</P>
      <P>May I say a few words about Russian timber imports.  I do not want to suggest that Deputies who have waxed eloquent in their speeches here to-day and yesterday about the buying of timber from Russia are insincere in their protestations, but it is to be commented upon that their protestations are somewhat belated, because we have been importing timber from Russia and other supplies from behind the Iron Curtain countries for years past.  Our imports from Iron Curtain countries reached the peak in 1950, when we imported goods to the value of £3,000,000, and these goods covered not merely timber but certain quarried products, oil seeds, fats, certain cereals and feeding stuffs, fertilisers, iron and steel manufactures, electrical goods and machinery and various other goods and services from Bulgaria, China, Hungary, Poland, Rumania, Russia and Yugoslavia.  It is quite obvious that either the Deputies who are protesting now did not know that, or else the fact that there has been a change of Government may have made them view this matter from a different angle.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>So far as timber imports are concerned, we do not regulate the import of timber.  I think it would be very undesirable that we should bring into force all the controls that would be necessary if we were going to regulate the imports of timber in order to exclude the possibility of timber coming from Iron Curtain countries. It would mean that every single consignment of timber would have to be checked, because, of course, what the Minister for Finance pointed out in reply to a recent Parliamentary question is perfectly accurate&mdash;that we cannot control effectively trade with those countries when no other country is doing it.  So far as we are <Col N="1409" /> concerned, we are operating export controls designed to prevent certain materials reaching Iron Curtain countries, materials listed in what is known as the Battle Act of the United States Congress, and that is all any country is doing.  If Russian goods such as timber can be freely imported into Britain, then, of course, they can be reconsigned from Britain here and no control that we operate will be effective unless it is of international application.</P>

      <P>So far as I am concerned, I have an objection to the introduction of these ideological factors into trade.  If we want to exercise our powers to control imports in order to exclude goods from a particular country, let us do it in accordance with some consistent principle.  Personally, I see no reason why we should go further in that respect than the United States is going, and so far as these commodities that have been imported in the past or that may be imported are concerned, there is no restriction on their import from Russia into the United States at the present time, Senator MacCarthy notwithstanding. It is asking too much of this country, small as it is, to take on the whole of this fight if other countries do not consider it practicable to do so.  In any case, it is quite clear that any controls that we could operate would be ineffective unless they were of international application.  For myself, I would object to the duty being put upon my Department of restricting the imports of these goods, which are normally freely allowed into the country, because of their origin.  It would mean that we would have to set up a whole organisation for supervising and checking trade arrangements, which would be intolerable.  If Deputies want to <Col N="1410" /> discourage the importation of these goods from these sources, then I suggest they should address their exhortations to the firms which bring them in.</P>

      <P>Reference has been made to the position regarding clay field-drainage pipes, and some Deputies asked for information in regard to it. One firm was reported in the newspapers as having a stock of 1,000,000 such pipes at the present time.  I do not know that the figure is very accurate, but it has to be recognised that this is a period of the year in <Col N="1411" /> which activities normally fall off and are not resumed again until March. The firms that enter into this business are expected to remain in production and accumulate the stocks that will be required next year.  So far as we can estimate, the annual requirements of these pipes are, approximately, 12,000,000, and the home production of them is in the region of from 8,000,000 to 9,000,000.  It is difficult to go on that last figure because there is a tendency amongst the firms that produce them to exaggerate their productive capacity, or at least to assume that the highest output they achieve in any one week can be achieved in every week, and that their annual productive capacity is 52 times the highest output which they had ever achieved, though that has never proved to be so in practice.</P>
      <P>From the figures I have given it will be seen that there is still a deficiency in productive capacity in relation to actual requirements.  Certain firms in the business can no doubt expand their capacity and that gap will be made good.  We have been proceeding upon that assumption, at any rate, and at the present time no licences for the importation of pipes are being issued. None was in fact issued since June last.  Some quantities of pipes may still come in under the authority of licences that were issued before June. The Department of Agriculture has not imported any pipes since June.</P>
      <P>Some Deputy asked in a supplementary question to the Minister for Agriculture to-day what quantity of pipes was imported in June.  The quantity was 125,000 and that is insignificant; it is less than a fortnight's production of the firm that claims to have these large numbers in stock, so that that importation cannot have affected the position in any way.  The policy of the Department is to restrict imports to whatever proportion is necessary to meet all requirements, supplementing the production of the home firms.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DanielMorrissey" hpid="Mr. Morrissey Mr. Morrissey">

      <P>Does the Minister not agree that it calls for a little more than that when a statement is issued <Col N="1412" /> over the name of what is supposed to be a reputable firm in this country that we are importing clay pipes at a time when they have approximately 1,000,000 of them available for delivery?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>The statement is not correct.  First of all, I know that when the representatives of that company were with the Department the stock of pipes they claimed to have was considerably less than 1,000,000; secondly, no pipes are now being imported at all. No import licence has been issued in respect of pipes since June last and any pipes that may come in now are residues of quantities that were licensed before June last and that position will not now persist.  It is perfectly true that the demand for pipes is now going to fall off.  In the months of December, January and February a minimum amount of work is done but the demand will undoubtedly revive in March and it is exceedingly doubtful if the total production of the Irish firms will then be sufficient to meet the whole of our requirements.</P>
      <P>Deputy Larkin inquired about the Dublin graving dock.  I would like to give him some information on that because I am personally very interested and keeping in touch with it. The House knows it was as far back as 1946 that the Government decided to make a grant of £500,000 to the Dublin Port and Docks Board to build a new graving dock at Dublin, that is, a new dry dock in which vessels could be brought for overhaul and repair. For some reason, of which I am not quite clear, the contract for the work of constructing the dock was not placed until 1951 and, in fact, the contractors only commenced operations in July, 1951.  I mentioned that the project was approved and the grant announced five years previously, in April of 1946.</P>

      <P>I think there was rather considerable difficulty in preparing plans and perhaps not enough enterprise in getting ahead with the work.  It was originally estimated that <Col N="1413" /> some 250 persons would be employed upon the work, but that figure has never been reached; the highest number on the scheme has not been much more than 50 at any time.</P>

      <P>There was a recent conference between the Port and Docks Board and the contractors at which, I understand, a substantial measure of agreement was reached. Work is likely to proceed more expeditiously in future although the date for the completion of the dock is now given to me as August, 1955; that is to say, the work which I had comtemplated originally might have been finished by 1950 or 1951 will not be completed until then.</P>

      <P>As far as I know there was no Government intervention in the matter at all.  Deputy Larkin also questioned the policy of Irish Shipping, Ltd. in the matter of support of Irish shipyards.  I think his observations were rather unfair to Irish Shipping, Ltd.  In so far as the overhaul and repair of their ships are concerned Irish Shipping, Ltd. actually established a shipyard of their own, the Cork Dockyard which, as the House knows is owned by Irish Shipping, Ltd. itself.  A high proportion of their annual overhaul and repair work is done in the Cork Dockyard and it is in the interests of Irish Shipping, Ltd. that they should support their own yard.  They have had to support it financially on a number of occasions since its establishment and they have certainly supported it in the volume of business they have given it.  It is true that vessels upon foreign charter have to have their overhauls and repairs done elsewhere and that a vessel that is damaged on a voyage has to be repaired in a foreign port. Consequently, not all the repair work of Irish Shipping, Ltd. can be done in Irish shipyards.  I notice from the figures for the year 1953 the total expenditure of Irish Shipping, Ltd. <Col N="1414" /> upon repairs was practically £81,000, of which Cork Dockyards got £31,000 and the Liffey Dockyards got somewhat over £9,000; other Irish yards got about £2,000 and £38,000 was given abroad, which represented the annual dry docking and servicing of ships that were on foreign charter at the time and in some cases emergency repairs or else repairs requiring facilities which were not available in Ireland.</P>
      <P>Irish Shipping, Ltd., have an order for a collier of 1,400 tons dead weight with the Liffey Dockyard.  That vessel is due for delivery in January, 1955. There has been, of course, difficulty experienced by the Irish dockyards in getting deliveries of steel.  At the present time Irish dockyards are considerably handicapped in competition with British shipyards by the fact that steel to British dockyards is subsidised and British dockyards have, therefore, that tremendous advantage over the Irish dockyards in having their steel cheaper.  The <i>Isolde,</i> which was built for Irish Lights, was in a different category.  The British Government agreed to supply the steel for the construction of that boat at the British domestic price, but they are not prepared to do that for the building of ships for Irish Shipping, Ltd.  However, the Deputy and the House may be assured that it is the policy of Irish Shipping, Ltd., as it is certainly the policy of the Government, to give all practicable business to Irish dockyards. The Liffey Dockyard is the only one capable of building a ship of any size.  The Liffey Dockyard can build a ship up to 3,000 or 4,000 tons.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Dillon spoke about the export of bottles, and I would like to give him some information in that connection. I do not know what the facts are precisely, because there is one private firm involved in this business and I have not regarded it as open to <Col N="1415" /> me to inquire in detail into their operations.  I am satisfied on this score, that the price charged for bottles here is related to the cost of producing those bottles and contains no unreasonable profit to the company or no element of subsidy for bottles exported by the company.  I want to make that clear, because if there were any suggestion that the products of this company going abroad were being subsidised in any way&mdash;as Deputy Dillon did, in fact, suggest&mdash;then the British authorities have rights under the trade agreement to impose restrictions on the import of these goods into Great Britain.  It must be made abundantly clear that the British authorities would not be justified in acting against those exports on that ground, because there is no element of subsidy whatever in the export price and the home prices are related entirely to the cost of producing the company's bottles for the home market.  These prices have been investigated more than once by the Prices Advisory Body and my statement is based on their report.</P>
    <P>What the company say is that in order to keep down prices here they have to get a volume of output larger than the home market makes possible. Therefore, they must go after exports and if they do not succeed in getting export business then the cost of production will go up.  They are making these efforts to develop their export trade.  We hope they will succeed in that.  It is important to us that they should succeed in that, not merely to the 800 to 1,000 men employed in the industry, but to the country as a whole, because the future development of the industry and the price of its products on the home market will depend on the success of the effort.</P>
    <P>I want to protest against this House being used to make statements about a concern of that kind which are untrue and for which there is not the slightest foundation in fact.  Deputy Dillon said here that the Irish Glass Bottle Company sold beer bottles to a Dutch firm at 23/9, which firm brings the bottles to Antwerp, fills them there with Dutch beer and ships them back into Ireland, claiming exemption from <Col N="1416" /> import duty on the ground that they are Irish glass bottles, and undersells the Irish beer bottled here.  There is not a word of truth in that.  I checked it with the management of the company.  They told me they sold no bottles to any Dutch firm, they do not produce the type of bottle that is used by Dutch brewers.  They sold no such bottles to anybody who could in any way be connected with the Dutch brewery firm.  In fact, they have not been exporting beer bottles at all.  The only consignment of beer bottles they have exported was sold through the agency of a Dublin firm, which paid the home price for them.  The statement was completely without foundation and could have been made by Deputy Dillon only upon the basis of information supplied to him which he did not trouble to check and which he could have checked quite easily at the cost of a couple of pence by a telephone call to the company's office, as I did.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>It is true, of course, that firms sell for export at a lower price than they can secure in the home market.  It would be grand if there were international agreement to cut out the practice, but I do not think we are likely to get it.  It is not unreasonable to put this proposition in front of an industrial firm which is producing goods for the home market, to tell them that if they expand their export beyond home market requirements they can afford to sell these goods a bit cheaper, that the marginal cost of production would enable them to be sold profitably at a lower price than the main output of the firm.  It is in that way that firms in other countries are able to build up an export business.  It is in that way that we would be able to do it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I remember on one occasion going to the Irish flour millers and asking to have explained to me how it was <Col N="1417" /> that English flour-milling firms could quote flour in Dublin at a lower price, even though they got the wheat at the same price, and the Irish flour millers claimed that their mills were just as efficient.  Their answer was: &ldquo;We will sell flour in England at the same price as they are quoting here, because with the lower cost of increased production it can be sold cheaper and just as the English mills quote a lower price for flour in Ireland so the Irish millers can quote a lower price in England.&rdquo;</P>

      <P>Many Deputies referred to food subsidies and to the decisions taken last year affecting food subsidies. They spoke, however, as if food subsidies had been abolished altogether.  In fact, as I pointed out earlier when introducing this Estimate, the subsidy on flour and bread this year is practically £6,000,000, and that will not be enough. It is quite obvious that we shall have to introduce a Supplementary Estimate to make increased provision for the flour and bread subsidy before the end of the current financial year, firstly, because of the higher price now payable for native wheat; secondly, because of the higher costs of collecting that wheat due to the new methods of harvesting that are coming into operation; thirdly, because of the higher proportion of native wheat&mdash;as Deputies are aware, there has been a very considerable increase in acreage this year&mdash;and, fourthly, because of the higher price now payable for imported wheat.  We have not bought much imported wheat under the new agreement, and it may be that the price will come down at some stage but, proceeding on the assumption that we will have to pay the maximum price under the agreement, as well as the increased price for native wheat, it is quite clear that the cost of the flour and bread subsidy will be higher this year than we originally anticipated.</P>

      <P>What those machines have done is brought in the grain harvest far more rapidly to the mills than was the case previously.  Consequently, the really acute storage problem that exists has had the result of increasing the cost of handling the wheat very considerably and has given to the industry, and to some extent to the Government, the problem of considering how storage facilities can be increased before the next harvest comes, because the indications are that we shall have still further increases in the wheat acreage next year.</P>
      <P>Deputy Kyne said the Labour Party would not join any Government which did not agree to make up the cost of the food subsidies as they existed when the inter-Party Government left office in one form or another&mdash;in the form of increased subsidies, in the form of increased children's allowances or in the form of increased social welfare payments.

      <P>I think I have covered all the main points raised.  A number of Deputies referred to special local problems and I would prefer to deal with them privately rather than in public.  Deputy Everett and Deputy Cogan did, however, raise the question of Wicklow harbour and, because that has received some publicity, I should perhaps make some reference to it.  I have a limited amount of money at my disposal to make available for harbour development grants.  The amount is set out in the Book of Estimates.  I must ensure that that money is spent to the best advantage and, in determining how to spend it, I must take into account the trade prospects in individual harbours just as much as the local and natural desire to see particular harbours extended or the employment involved in such extension provided.  In the case of Wicklow, a proposal for the improvement of the harbour came from the local harbour authority and, after some considerable delay in the preparation of plans&mdash; these plans always take a considerable time&mdash;and a great deal of calculation as to the requirements of the port, having regard to other transport facilities available to it and the degree of industrial development in the locality, a decision was made that certain harbour works would be sufficient to meet current needs and, on the basis of that decision, a grant of approximately £35,000 against a local contribution of £7,000 was agreed upon.  That decision was communicated to the local harbour authority.  If they had accepted that decision, work would have started immediately because all the plans had been made and all the calculations had been completed; but the local harbour authority&mdash;possibly they saw that Wexford was getting a much bigger grant&mdash;decided they should not do worse than Wexford and they came back looking for a much more extensive scheme of works. I have not turned that down.  They may get a larger grant but I do want them to realise that the preparation of the larger plan and the details of that plan by the Board of Works engineers will take just as long as the preparation of the original <Col N="1422" /> plan, and they cannot expect a speedy decision.  I cannot give a decision at all until the Board of Works having carried out the necessary surveys, tell me what it will cost.  I only come in in determining how that cost can be met out of the funds available to me for the improvement of harbours.  These funds have to supplement the funds of a number of harbour authorities in the carrying out of necessary works.</P>
      <P>We have spent a great deal of money on harbour improvement works since the end of the war.  Before the war the Government had no responsibility whatever for providing money for harbour works.  When Galway Harbour Authority first decided to improve the harbour there they had to raise the necessary amount, supplemental to their own revenues, from the local authorities in the area serving the harbour.  It is only since the war that the idea of a Government grant was conceived but, now that it is recognised, the Government is expected to supplement harbour revenues and finance works of that kind and, of course, harbour authorities are looking for more and more money.  Only a limited amount can be made available and that must be spent on works which are not designed merely to create monuments but works that can be effectively utilised by shipping companies and industrialists in the areas serving the harbour.  I do not want Deputy Cogan or Deputy Everett, or the other Wicklow Deputies, to think, however, that a decision has been taken against the proposal of the Wicklow Harbour Board for an increased grant.  They may get it.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>I am personally interested in trying to revive the trade of the smaller harbours.  I think it would be a good thing for the country if we could do that, particularly from the point of view of the development of our own <Col N="1423" /> coastal shipping service; but it may not be an easy task and we may incur expenditure which will never be remunerative.  It is, however, worth attempting provided we do not lose our heads and start erecting big port installations which can never be used because I am afraid the policy of importing direct from countries of origin is operating and the whole trend of trade is to bring supplies to this country now in bigger and bigger ships.  That confines the movement of goods to the major ports and takes trade away from the smaller ports formerly served by small ships bringing in goods trans-shipped from English ports.  From the national point of view the change is for the better, but the repercussions on local harbours are considerable, and we can only offset that by developing coastal shipping services of our own.  Some progress has been made in that direction and no doubt that will continue.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I intended to refer to it.  I apologise to the Deputy for omitting it.  So far as the claims of Mr. Ivers to a sub-lease is concerned, I do not want to make any comment. That is a matter which may become the subject of legal determination.  It would be wrong, therefore, for me to refer to it in any detail.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Mianraí Teoranta has been operating at Slievardagh coalfield for some years.  It got that responsibility in 1942 or 1943 when the original Slievardagh Coal-mine Company was amalgamated with Mianraí Teoranta.  The workings there, of course, were started as a wartime measure to supplement our production of coal and the company was in fact instructed so to plan its activity as to get the maximum output of coal without regard to long-term development plant.  It never made a profit and, in fact, time and again I had to come back to the Dáil to get losses wiped off.  In 1947, by the legislation of that year, all the losses <Col N="1424" /> incurred during the war period were wiped out and the company was set up with a capital sum which was then considered adequate to enable it to develop the coal-mine properly and get on to a profit earning basis.  It did not.  Deputy Morrissey, as Minister for Industry and Commerce, had to come back here in 1949 to ask the Dáil to amend the legislation and make more money available for the company.  He expressed the hope that, with the additional funds, it would get to the profit earning stage.  It did not and last year I had to come to the Dáil to explain that the amount that could be provided under the Act was exhausted and pointed out that it required more money urgently to keep its staffs in employment and its productive activities going.  I got that money voted on a Supplementary Estimate, promising to regularise the position by an amendment of the legislation later.</P>
    <P>By that time the Government had taken the decision to instruct the company to offer the coal-mine for sale. Apart from the fact that the coal-mine was, as far as we knew, losing money and likely to continue losing money, there was, and is, objection to a State company operating in a field in which private companies are also operating.  As the Deputy knows, anthracite coal is being mined by a number of private companies operating here and it is unfair to them that a State company should be operating in competition with them, with apparently the right to call upon unlimited funds from the Government, as the three successive additions to the capital of the company would suggest.</P>
    <P>At first no offers were made for the concern.  Subsequently, an offer was received, after the advertisements were repeated, from the person who now owns it.  Mianraí Teoranta recommended that the offer should be accepted.  They said it was a good offer, that no better offer was likely to be forthcoming and that they had satisfied themselves as to the intentions of the purchaser to carry on and develop the property.  I was naturally concerned about the point to which Deputy Mulcahy referred, that we <Col N="1425" /> were not likely to find ourselves again in the position that, in order to prevent unemployment developing, or for some other reason, we would have to go in and save the undertaking again. From the point of view of the development of the coal-mine, the sale has been more than justified.  I think the new owner is now developing the property far more energetically and in a far better way than the State company was doing.  The Deputy, no doubt, will have seen from Press reports that he was the first to open up the possibilities of exports for Irish anthracite and generally is doing a very good job there.  I am quite satisfied that from the point of view of the development of the resources of the area the sale was a good one.</P>
    <P>From the point of view of Mianraí Teoranta, it gets them £50,000 in cash against what was for them a liability. My recollection is that Mianraí Teoranta claimed that they could break even on working costs at an output of 500 tons a week.  They only got 500 tons a week over a very limited period last year.  They never succeeded in maintaining it for any protracted period and did not seem likely to maintain it.</P>
    <P>In any event, I, personally, was getting rather tired of the process of having Mianraí Teoranta coming to me looking for more money for this enterprise on the promise that they would make profits the next year.  That had been going on too long and I did not want to see it continued.  I think we were quite right in getting the State out of this business of coal-mining.  It should not be in it when private enterprise is also in it.  We were lucky in disposing of this property, at what Mianraí Teoranta regard as a fair price, to a company which is putting a considerable amount of additional money and a very considerable amount of enterprise into the development of the deposit.</P>
    <P>The particular point in which the Deputy is interested is a special one.  For a number of years there have been in that area people working outcrops of coal without a right to the coal, and it has been a problem for Mianraí Teoranta at various times.  Mianraí Teoranta did <Col N="1426" /> in fact sell the lease of the property to the new owner clear of commitments and, therefore, the only question that arises is whether a man who was working on the property without a lease had an undertaking or a promise from Mianraí Teoranta which gives him a right of action against Mianraí Teoranta now.  There is no doubt that the new owner has got a clear lease but it is possible that there may be some claim against Mianraí Teoranta by the individual concerned.  If that claim cannot be settled by agreement &mdash;and it does not look as if it can be&mdash; then it can only be settled in the normal way by court proceedings.</P>

The Minister mentioned certain people who, without what we call formal legal permits, are taking coal in that area. In addition to Mr. Ivers, who is actually working the mine and developing it, there are people known as the basset workers.

      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>Mianraí Teoranta, yes, and, according to the balance sheet published by Mianraí Teoranta on the 31st March, 1953, the assets, apart altogether from the mineral resources, apart altogether from the coal in the ground, are something like £45,382.  That is, in so far as the balance sheet can be understood, the amount that has been transferred as realisable assets in land, plant, machinery and equipment of one kind or another.  That is the amount that has been transferred to what the balance sheet calls the &ldquo;realisation of sale&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>Now can the Minister justify in any kind of general way the principle of the sale of assets of that particular kind plus the mineral resources of the coalfield for the sum of £50,000 arranged in that particular way?  Can he say the terms of the royalties that are being included in the lease, and can he also in relation to the product of the Ballingarry mine&mdash;that is the copper one that has been referred to here in this balance sheet, the only one that has been worked recently by Mianraí Teoranta&mdash;give us any idea as to why a report issued on the operations for the year 1952 should show a loss of £11,303 when it was a year in which the greatest amount of coal was produced and it was a time in which the 500 tons a week and the greater than 500 tons a week for the rest of the period had been reached, when in the two years before that, with a substantially similar amount of production, the balance sheet recorded that the Ballingarry mine had a production output of 4,102 tons?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>So far as tonnage is concerned that is not any real indication of the nature and character of the production.  A very high proportion of slack would bring down the average realisable price very considerably; <Col N="1428" /> but when the Deputy asks me why I sanctioned a lease of that mine the only answer I can give him is that one of the reasons why I urged that the property should be offered for sale was that I felt that a private owner managing that mine for his own profit would be able to make a far better job of it than this State organisation. It was not the type of enterprise that a State organisation should be engaged in.</P>
      <P>As regards the question of whether the price offered was reasonable, the price offered was £50,000 cash plus a royalty, a royalty I understand of 9d. per ton for up to 150,000 tons and diminishing then with the quantity produced.  So far as I am concerned at any time we would have leased the mineral rights in the area for a royalty of that kind to anybody who was prepared to develop them&mdash;in fact we have leased mineral rights for much lower royalties than that, in places where they were not likely to be worth as much.  The payment of cash equivalent to the balance sheet estimation of the valuation of assets, plus a royalty continuing on any coal produced, represents to me a fair return, a fair price for the property, but it does not get us back anything like what we lost.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>Let us not exaggerate its dimensions.  This was one of the smallest.  It was not a very large one.  It may become that now.  I may tell you that I would have hesitated very much to sanction the sale by Mianraí Teoranta if I thought that the effect was likely to be a discontinuance of operations there.  It was because I was satisfied that it meant not merely continuation of operations but an extension of them under perhaps more energetic direction that I sanctioned the sale.</P>

      <P>As far as local anxiety is concerned, away back in 1947, when I introduced the Bill that year, I said that we were setting up this company again and wiping out its losses and giving it a certain amount of money, and if they could not be a paying concern, <Col N="1430" /> and could not be made to pay, that meant that the coalfield was going to close down.  I asked the Dáil to pass legislation and to vote money on that understanding in 1947.  Subsequently, when it became clear that more money would have to be provided, I urged the policy of offering the property for sale to private owners.  When the company had advertised it again and again and they had got some offers which were not very attractive, and then they got what they considered an attractive offer, they recommended its acceptance, and I agreed.  I think the alternative to selling it was to face the possibility of the concern closing down, because the Dáil would refuse to vote more money for its operation, or else continuing demands for more money from the Dáil, and we are in a far better position now.</P>

      <P>When the debate on this Bill was adjourned on Thursday last, I was pointing out to the House the advantages which it is designed to bring.  We have had prolonged debate <Col N="1434" /> on this measure up to the present time.</P>
      <P>We have had opposition to the Bill from the Fianna Fáil Party, although it is a progressive measure, designed particularly to reform legislation, the Valuation Act of 1852, which is now 101 years old.  That Act was designed to achieve certain purposes and it has a detrimental effect on progress where various sections of the community are involved.  We have opposition to it from the Fianna Fáil Party because it was introduced by three Deputies of the Fine Gael Party, Deputies Sweetman, Morrissey and O'Higgins.</P>
      <P>The reforms proposed in it are long overdue, but the Fianna Fáil Party will probably use their strength in the House, even though they are weak in the country, to prevent the Bill becoming law, although there are many sections of the community awaiting the benefits which the Bill proposes to give. The tenants of dwelling-houses, the staffs of factories, the workers in shops, proprietors of business premises and farmers who wish to construct farm buildings&mdash;all these different interests will get advantage from this Bill, but we have heard from the Fianna Fáil Deputies that they intend to steamroll the Bill.  They have said that they intend to bring in a comprehensive measure, but I would ask when we can expect that comprehensive measure and when the people for whom the reforms in this Bill are designed will get the advantage of it.  Will we get in that comprehensive Bill, promised during the Galway by-election, the benefits this Bill is designed to give?  If not, we ought to be told by Fianna Fáil speakers at this stage.  I challenge them to examine this Bill and to point out the aspects of it which they propose to delete or the sections to which they are opposed.</P>

      <P>I hope that before the debate concludes we will hear from the Fianna Fáil Deputies, not an expression of pious sympathy with the owners of property obliged to pay increased rates on valuations that are stepped up, but reasons why they propose to steamroll the Bill.  It does not deserve that treatment.  It deserves a better approach from the Fianna Fáil Party.  The Taoiseach has already recognised the advantages which it will bring and, though it was put on the books last June by the Fine Gael Party, we had the Taoiseach in August going <Col N="1436" /> down to Galway during the by-election and saying that he proposed at a future date to implement legislation of this nature.</P>
      <P>We have a situation at present in which a person who decides to preserve his property by carrying out certain repairs, renovations and alterations finds that, when these are carried out, his valuation is increased.  If he did not carry out this work, the premises would probably fall into disrepair. The consequence is that the owner of that property, whether a dwelling-house, a farm building, a shop or a factory, is penalised because he tries to keep it in good repair, instead of allowing it to fall into disrepair and to collapse.  That is the very great weakness in the Valuation Act of 1852.</P>
      <P>I am satisfied that this legislation is urgently needed and I hope the Fianna Fáil Party will change their mind and accept the Bill for what it is worth. If they think they can do better, let them add to the advantages the Bill proposes to confer.  In saying that they intended to oppose the Bill, Fianna Fáil Deputies made a very good case for it, because they could not contribute to the debate without pointing out the many difficulties under which owners of property are labouring at present.</P>
      <P>For that reason, I feel that this Bill should be unanimously accepted.  I am sure that the various sections and classes which it proposes to benefit will await very anxiously the reform of the Act of 1852 which is causing such great hardship at present.  It is a tax on enterprise and it retards progress. People who are progressive, who wish to improve their businesses and to give greater employment, are prevented from doing so by the threat that if they do alter, renovate and improve premises&mdash;without carrying out certain additions and only improving&mdash;they are liable to this increased tax.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With rates rising annually as they are, and with the prospect that they will be increased very substantially now under the Health Bill which is on the Statute Book, those people will be discouraged from trying to preserve their property and carrying out these <Col N="1437" /> alterations and repairs.  I wish to conclude by congratulating Deputies Sweetman, Morrissey and O'Higgins on introducing this private members' Bill, and I hope it will be accepted unanimously.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickCogan" hpid="Mr. Cogan Mr. Cogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cogan</NameTxt>
      <P>The introduction of this Bill dealing with valuations marks a very striking change in the attitude of the Fine Gael Party as compared with their attitude last March when I introduced a motion dealing with this whole question.  Last March I submitted to the House that it was desirable to have a thorough investigation of the whole system of valuations with a view to remedying the anomalies and injustices that undoubtedly exist under the present system.  Not only did the Fine Gael Party offer every type of obstruction and opposition to that motion, but Deputy Sweetman came into the House and arrogantly ordered one of the Front Bench members of Fine Gael to refrain from supporting the motion.  The Deputy in question, Deputy Dockrell, had sufficient &ldquo;gumption&rdquo; to ignore this very impertinent order, and he spoke, and spoke very well, in favour of the motion proposed by me.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>What was the proposal I put before the House last March?  Simply that the present system of valuation, as originated 100 years ago under the Valuation Act of 1852, contained many absurdities and injustices and for that reason deserved most careful investigation with a view to having it amended.  The Fine Gael Party refused to accept that motion and put up every form of opposition to it.  Now they come forward hurriedly with a Bill which, in effect, perpetuates most of the absurdities and injustices that I complained about.  For a long time Deputies on all sides of the House have been making the complaint that where a ratepayer improves his property, he incurs the liability of having his valuation revised and increased&mdash;in other words, he incurs a penalty, for doing work of improvement. Under the Health Acts, various regulations were made which compelled property owners to improve their property.  Having carried out <Col N="1438" /> these improvements, they found that their valuations were revised and increased.</P>
    <P>The situation which will ensue if this Bill comes into effect is that those who have suffered increases in their valuations for the past three or four years since the termination of the war by reason of improving their property, will have these increased valuations stabilised.  Those who have managed to escape the vigilance of the Commissioners of Valuation or rather the officers of the local authority, will be confirmed in the immunity which they have secured.  In other words, we shall have the valuation increased on business premises at one side of a street where the owner was progressive and improved that property&mdash;it will be perhaps doubled or trebled as it has been in some cases&mdash;whilst the valuation of the property of a man who is competing with him in business will not be increased.  By this Bill, these two valuations will be permanently confirmed.  I think that that is not reasonable, progressive or reformative legislation.  It is a haphazard proposal hurriedly conceived in the immature minds of some of the younger members of the Fine Gael Party.</P>
    <P>Deputies on all sides of the House have been complaining about the penalty that is imposed upon ratepayers who improve their property&mdash; the penalty of increased valuations and increased rates.  If one reads this Bill, one will find that the striking feature of it is that it only provides for an increase in rates when an improvement is carried out.  The man who does not improve his property is to be exempt from any increase in the rateable valuation of that property under this Bill while the man who improves it will, after a short period of years, face a very substantial increase.  In other words, this Bill seeks to give relief to the man who does not carry out any improvement after the passing of the Bill and imposes a penalty on the man who does carry out such improvement. That is a striking contradiction of the policy which has been advocated by Deputies on all sides of the House.</P>
    <P>I think that the Deputies who have brought forward this Bill would have <Col N="1439" /> been well advised if they had accepted the terms of the motion which I brought forward last March and if they had gone into this matter with a little bit more care and diligence and examined it in all its aspects.  Valuation is a very complex question.  It is a matter which cannot be dealt with in a haphazard way.  As a matter of fact, anything pertaining to the levying and collection of taxation bristles with difficulties.  I realised and acknowledged that fact when I was introducing the motion last March.</P>
    <P>It is not one of the things that you can rush into rapidly without undue consideration.  There are a great many anomalies and injustices in the existing system.  For example, there is in this Bill no relief given in regard to the improvement of dwelling-houses.</P>
    <P>I think we would be well advised to re-examine this whole matter and find out if there is some more equitable basis upon which valuations can be made and on which the contributions to the local administration could be fixed.  I believe that if you want to establish justice as between one ratepayer and another you must, if you are logical, revise all valuations on exactly the same basis.  In fact you must revalue all property and base that revaluation on something that is fair and equitable.</P>
    <P>We all know, of course, that there is a general feeling of uneasiness in regard to revaluation on the ground that it would result in a general increase in all valuations.  That, I think, is the objection to it and I suppose there is reasonable ground for it. As we know, valuations are fixed upon the earning capacity of property to a great extent, or are supposed to be fixed at any rate.  They are based on the letting value which is supposed to represent the earning capacity of the property.  We all know that it is very hard to say that that basis is altogether fair or accurate, but at least if the valuations were all carried out at the same time that would have the effect of being somewhat fairer than when they are carried out piecemeal, when you have property valued perhaps in 1860 or 1870 or 1880, when the value, <Col N="1440" /> of course, was very different from what it is now, valued again in 1952.</P>
    <P>Because of the complexity of this problem this House would be very foolish to rush into a piecemeal type of legislation such as this is.  We would be foolish to confirm the high valuations that have been fixed in recent years upon certain business premises while leaving, perhaps, rival traders in the same street or district at a much lower valuation.  It would be unfair to provide, as in this Bill, that the only people who could have their valuations increased are those who improve their property.  If this Bill were enacted in some ways it would become a gold mine, so to speak, for the legal profession.  The various sections are so loosely drawn that it would lead to endless litigation. It is hard to know whether the definition of business premises can be clearly ascertained.  If a solicitor's office or a barrister's consulting rooms are business premises, then I think there would be need for some extension of these premises if this Bill were to become law, because, as I see it, it will lead to a great deal of litigation and court proceedings to define exactly what business premises are.  It does seem very wrong to withhold the very limited benefits provided in this Bill from a man who has improved or enlarged his dwelling-house.</P>
    <P>I think the House would be well advised to await the legislation promised by the Government.  I hope that in introducing this legislation they will have every aspect of this problem very carefully considered and that, while removing some anomalies and injustices, they will not create perhaps even greater injustices and anomalies.  Therefore, I think the House should reject this Bill.  I have no doubt that a better Bill will be forthcoming with the backing of the Government, the problem having been carefully examined in all its aspects by those qualified to examine it.</P>
    <P>I have never been favourable to the system under which valuations are fixed.  I should like to see the whole matter thoroughly examined and the legislation carefully sifted with a view <Col N="1441" /> to having it improved.  It is true that it is not contemplated that there shall be any revisions of valuations as far as agricultural land is concerned.  But even there the manner in which the valuations were fixed 100 years ago created a good deal of injustice. People who had been growing wheat extensively at that time found that the valuation on their land was fixed at a very much higher level than on those who were engaged in stock raising or some other type of agricultural activity.  These injustices are very apparent to anyone who travels the country.  In certain districts you will find that the land valuations are very much higher than in other districts.  But I think that farmers as a body would, very rightly, have a strong objection to any interference with the valuation system as it applies to land.  They would have a strong objection to any revision.</P>
    <P>If there is a revision in regard to buildings, it should be carefully planned and carried out on an equitable basis.  Over the last few years, because of the extensive building programme which has been carried out, the demolition of old buildings and the provision of new dwelling-houses both by private enterprise and local authorities, there are a great many people living in dwelling-houses which are assessed on a very high valuation as compared with older buildings which were valued prior to the last war or to the 1914 war.  This is a matter which requires careful consideration and I should like to see if there were a general revaluation of buildings an upper limit fixed so that the total valuation of the entire State, if you like, would not be increased.</P>
    <P>In fact, there would be an ironing out of inequalities and injustices, but in a general increase that could not be done.  If legislation could be framed to carry out such an operation, I think it would meet the wishes of everyone. There are people who say it does not really matter very much whether valuations are increased or not, and that an increase in valuation of buildings will automatically effect a reduction in rates in the £ and that if the valuation of all dwellings is doubled in a county, <Col N="1442" /> city or town the rates in the £ in that county, city or town will be automatically halved.</P>
    <P>There is a certain amount of truth in that, but I think the psychological effect of the halving of the rates in the town would have a general tendency to drive up the rates to 25/- or 30/- in the £ as they are at present.  In addition to that, of course, increased valuations affect not only the rates but also electricity charges, income-tax and licensing duties in licensed premises and so on.  There would be a very considerable increase on the burden of the ratepayers even if all valuations were increased.  Because of the complexity of this question and of the many difficulties and anomalies that exist, I think we should not enact a Bill which in its vital clauses confirms and stabilises practically all those anomalies and injustices.  We have variations as between one ratepayer and another of, perhaps, £40 or £50 in the valuation of premises which are equal in their capacity, floor space and, perhaps, in the facilities which they provide for business.  I think it would be wrong to perpetuate for all time that situation by passing such a Bill as this.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DenisAllen" hpid="Mr. Allen Mr. Allen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Allen</NameTxt>
      <P>This Bill has been introduced as a Valuation Bill by some Deputies in the Opposition.  It is noticeable that two of the sponsors of this Bill are legal gentlemen, one of whom has a knowledge of valuation. They ask the House to accept this as a Valuation Bill because they are serving the best interests of this country by bringing it in.  I assume that in framing a Bill members of the Opposition would, like members on this side of the House, do so in a responsible manner.  We have not heard from the Opposition whether or not they accept the fundamental principle on which rateable valuations are based in this country.  We should have liked to have heard Deputy Sweetman, as a member of a local authority, state whether or not he accepted the present principle on which the rateable valuation of property is based.  I think that is fundamental to any Valuation Bill that sets out to effect the rateable <Col N="1443" /> valuation of property, whether land or buildings.  If Deputy Sweetman and the other Opposition Deputies accept that principle, they must also accept that if the value, letting or otherwise, of property deteriorates the owner of that property is entitled to have a revaluation and have the property assessed on a lower value.  If the property improves it has a higher letting value.  If the principle of valuation which has operated for the past 100 years is accepted in future and is to be the basis of valuation, then Section 2 of the Bill should not be put into effect.</P>
      <P>According to Section 2 of the Bill, the present valuation which was put on 100 years ago must be the valuation for all time.  The value of property, irrespective of its use, may have doubled in the past 20 or 25 years.  It may never have been revalued for the past 100 years and its present-day letting value may be ten times greater. What Deputy Sweetman says in effect to the ratepayers of Kildare is that, irrespective of the income A may have from a premises in the best town in Kildare, the valuation of that premises to-day, which is the valuation put on it in 1852 or 1853, must remain the valuation for all time on that premises.</P>
      <P>In effect, he tells the ratepayers of the County Kildare: &ldquo;We do not care two hoots about you but A must be allowed at your expense to get away with it and not pay his fair rates for the premises he occupies.&rdquo;  That is what Deputy Sweetman set out to do as a member of a local authority who are deeply concerned and must always be deeply concerned with the rateable valuation whether in a county, town or city.  He asks the House seriously to accept this Bill.  Section 2 of the Bill undermines the whole principle of rateable valuation as applied to lands and buildings for the past 100 years and that is what Deputy Sweetman asks us to accept in all seriousness.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Davin accepted, as did Deputy Norton, the principle of the Bill.  He wanted an assurance from the sponsors of the Bill that if the cottiers, the people who occupy labourers' cottages, purchased a cottage and added a room to it they would <Col N="1444" /> not come under Section 3 of the Bill and that there could be no increase in their valuation.  He had doubts in his mind.  Deputy Davin is no greenhorn in the matter of legislation passing through this House.  He knows quite well that what Deputy Sweetman is asking him to accept is that if an agricultural labourer improves his house he would pay the increased valuation on that house but that the valuation of a trader, who has increased the value of his business in probably the best part of a town in the last 20 or 30 years and is on the same valuation as existed 100 years ago, must remain. The workers about whom Deputy Davin is so concerned must pay the increased valuation if they add a room to their cottages but the people who occupy the best portion of the town must not be asked to pay anything unless they add to or improve their houses in the future.  Do those two gentlemen ask that they pay no rates for those improvements for seven years?</P>
    <P>I think that is stretching the thing a bit too far.  It surprised me that the Labour Party should have swallowed this Bill, hook, line and sinker.  They have accepted the principle of it, and all they want is an assurance from Deputy Sweetman and the sponsors of the Bill that it will not affect cottiers. Deputy Davin and Deputy Norton know well, of course, that it will affect cottiers, and that it will not affect businessmen with premises in the best centres of our towns in all the provinces, because their valuations, according to Section 2 of the Bill, must remain as they are at the moment and dare not be altered at any time in the future.  That, in effect, is what this Bill asks.</P>
    <P>The members of local authorities are deeply concerned to see that all property within their areas are carrying up-to-date valuations.  The member of a local authority who refuses to accept that principle should no longer continue to be a member because he is not accepting the law as it is to-day. We oftentimes see members of local authorities criticising the valuation department of the Commissioners of Valuation when some premises in their <Col N="1445" /> areas are revalued.  We know, of course, that people whose valuations have been increased very often go to those members with their grievances and abuse them because of the fact that their valuations have been increased. Some of these members of local authorities cannot take that abuse.  I want to say that, in my opinion, they should not be members of local authorities at all if they are not prepared to accept their full responsibilities as such.</P>
    <P>During the 3½ years that the members of the Opposition were the Government of this country there were increases in valuations and rightly so. I imagine that this Bill arises out of the annoyance and abuse that many of them got during that period, due to the operation of the Valuation Acts. We all know well that many of the original valuations bear no relation whatever to present-day letting values. Deputy Sweetman knows that well, and the discussion on this Bill has shown that there is a need to bring valuations up to present-day letting values.  An increase in valuation should not take place, I believe, until there has been a complete revaluation of a whole county or town.  The Minister for Finance and the Minister for Local Government are deeply concerned to see that that is done and that there is a true value operating in respect of all property.</P>
    <P>A good deal of the friction that arises at present is due to the fact that you have the valuation of premises increased here and there without a whole town say, being revalued at the same time.  I think that a revaluation for a whole town would be the fairest way of getting valuations brought up to date.  If there has been anything wrong since this State was set up, I believe, it was due to this that successive Governments did not provide the machinery for the Valuation Office to enable it to keep the valuations of all property up to date&mdash;that adequate staff and valuers were not available to enable valuations to be kept up to the present day actual value of property in the country.  I think it is an accurate statement to make that 70 or 80 per cent. of the houses, buildings, shops, <Col N="1446" /> offices and warehouses that we have in the country at the present time are carrying the valuations that were put on them originally, away back in 1852 and 1853.  I believe that the key to all valuations is the present day letting value of all property, and, as I have said, valuations to-day bear no relation whatever to present day letting values.</P>
    <P>I believe that, if the Dáil were foolish enough to pass this Bill, it would be found to be unworkable and would create absolute chaos in the country.  You would have most unfair things happening under it.  I am more than surprised that Deputies who like to be regarded as responsible Deputies should seek to pass into law legislation that would put a burden on all other sections of the community in the interests of a small minority.  It would probably put that burden on the less well-off sections of the community.</P>
    <P>That is what is being attempted in Section 3.  In Section 2, the promoters of the Bill are trying to prevent property, that has a greater value now than it had when originally valued, carrying its true share of the rates levied in the various local authority areas.  That is what I see set out in the Bill.  I wonder did the promoters of this Bill ever stop to think of what the consequences of Section 2 of it would be if it became part of the permanent legislation of this country? I am sure there are hundreds and thousands of pieces of property&mdash; houses, offices and shops&mdash;which were improved in the period between the two world wars, and they were never sent forward for revaluation.</P>

      <P>From what we hear, there is a good part of Dublin undervalued and we have reason to believe that that is true.  I do not know whether the Deputy is aware of that or not.  Under Section 3 of the Bill, the proposal in it is that any enlargement or improvement of premises will rank to be free of extra rates for the next seven years.  Supposing I own a <Col N="1447" /> shop down the country and I make an addition to it; that addition will be revalued but the new valuation will not come into operation in respect of that portion for seven years.  According to Section 2 of this Bill, the original portion of that building could not be increased in valuation at all. The people who will improve their premises will be free of all extra rates and extra valuation for seven years, which, I think, is most unjust.  There is some justification for giving relief to people who are prepared to spend money in improving their premises, etc., and giving extra employment.</P>
      <P>A principle has been enshrined here in legislation all down the years that where a man built a new dwelling-house he got relief in rates to the extent of two-thirds of the valuation for seven years.  In future, the Government proposes introducing a Bill which will bring the same principle into operation in respect of any other type of building, but I think it would be most unfair to give total relief from rates.  It is most unfair, also, that the existing portion of the building should not rank for revaluation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In regard to the erection, enlargement or improvement of outhouses on farms, Deputy Sweetman knows well that the Valuation Act of 1852 provides that where outhouses are erected or improved they rank for relief of rates for a period of years.  The sponsors of this Bill should have taken their time and considered its ramifications. One of them at least&mdash;there may be others&mdash;as a member of the local authority should be concerned not to do anything that would adversely affect that local authority or affect the local rate of their county or town.  It is most injurious to local authorities that their valuations should be affected in that way, and to stabilise all valuations at their present level is an outrageous suggestion.  It cuts straight across the fundamental principle of rateable value.  We are setting out to abandon in all respects the system which has been in operation for the past 100 years or more.  Deputy Sweetman, or some of the other Deputies promoting or supporting this Bill, will <Col N="1448" /> go on to suggest that a more equitable way of raising taxation is a poll tax. That is the next suggestion that must be put into operation, a poll tax on the people of the country, a tax per head, irrespective of their means.  That would appear to be the intention and I am sure it is just the thin edge of the wedge in that direction.  It would be very unjust because it has always been accepted down the years that people paid rates according to the value of the property they occupied. They pay income-tax on the same basis, according to the income they have, whether it is large or small, and every kind of taxation should operate on the same principle.  However, in Section 2 of this Bill, it is sought to prevent that system from operating any longer.</P>
    <P>I have always believed we should have up-to-date valuation and it should be revised every 20 or 25 years especially according to changes in money values.  All improvements that have been brought in during that time or any changes in money value that have occurred over the years should be brought up to date.  It would be far better for the whole system of local government and the system of valuation of property in this country because an up-to-date value on property is all important from other directions besides its levying value for local authorities. If there is a low valuation on a farm of a couple of hundred acres, right away the public will say it is of little value.  The system is a recognised yardstick by which the value of property, houses, shops, offices, land, and so on, are measured and it is generally accepted as its full value. That is why the true rateable value of house property and so on, should be brought up to date.  I hope the Dáil will reject this Bill in no uncertain manner because I believe it will injure the best interests of the country.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JosephBlowick" hpid="Mr. Blowick Mr. Blowick">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blowick</NameTxt>
      <P>At the outset let me say that this Bill does not meet the situation at all.  It does not go as far as I would like to see a Bill of this nature going.  It certainly does not go as far as the motions which the Clann na Talmhan Party put down on two previous occasions in this House to try to ease the present unjust burden of taxation placed on the ratepayers, both urban and rural, land owners and house owners.  Even though the Bill does not go far enough, it is certainly a step in the right direction and it is a big improvement on the &ldquo;just sit still and do nothing&rdquo; policy that Deputy Allen seems to be supporting on the other side of the House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I intend to speak particularly on the general principle of this Bill and on certain regrettable omissions from it. It must be admitted by everybody that the whole system of rating both of land and buildings&mdash;and when I say buildings I am including the country areas, the cities and towns&mdash;is far from being just.  When going into the question of valuation of land we know that in evidence given 90 years ago before the select committee who examined this whole question, some of the valuers admitted on oath that most of the valuations of land were done from the seat of a side-car and you had valuers at half a mile distance who never stood on the land that was being valued.  We were always saying that nothing was being done by successive British Governments but nothing has been done by our own Governments since that time.  Evidence was also given under oath before that select committee that the valuers, or evaluators as they were called at the time, actually took bribes of money from people who wanted their valuations increased.  It seems there was some question that membership of a Grand Jury depended on the poor law valuation of the land you owned and it was an advantage to have a poor law valuation of more than £200 on land. That is there for anybody to read in the evidence given, not by one witness but by at least three, before the select committee.  It is proof enough about the valuation at that time.  I do not say all the valuers were wrong&mdash;the majority under Griffith's Valuation <Col N="1450" /> were honest, decent men who did the job as well as they could&mdash;but some people escaped and there were valuers who admitted on oath that they valued land which they only saw half a mile away from the steps of a side-car.  It occurred in Clare, in my own county of Mayo and in several other counties. That in itself is proof that something should be done about the valuation of this country.</P>
    <P>I had some shocking experiences during the time I was Minister for Lands.  I found the valuation was completely lopsided.  Some areas were valued out of all proportion to the quality or area of the land, or its crop bearing capacity or its stock bearing capacity.  I will not dwell further on land, as this Bill does not include it, but I hope to have something to say in the future on this particular matter.</P>
    <P>There is another important aspect which I would like to deal with briefly &mdash;the question of farm buildings on agricultural holdings.  I might repeat what I said here in 1946 and on later occasions, that it is unjust and wrong to rate farm buildings when they are used in connection with the work of the farm by a man who makes his living solely from agriculture.  A tax on out-offices is something like that of walking into a factory and putting a tax on the machinery turning out finished industrial goods.  A farmer does not build out-offices in order to roam through them or just to look at them, or to beautify the farmyard.  He builds them because they are necessary. Those who know anything about this know that at least in Connacht and on the western seaboard from Donegal to Kerry there are not 20 holdings which have sufficient out-offices&mdash;all through fear of the valuation reviser increasing the rates on the farm.  After a lot of research some years ago, I quoted here on this very question that the loss to crops alone, because the farmsteads have not sufficient out-office accommodation, must be close on £7,000,000 a year and the loss to agricultural tools, implements and machines must reach £1,500,000 to £2,000,000 a year, because the average farmer is afraid to put up sufficient out-offices to house the machines and crops.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1451" /> No matter what Government is in power, every Deputy is clamouring for more production and asking the farmers to produce more.  I believe that in a few years we could increase production appreciably by cutting out the loss and waste because the average farmer does not house his crops properly.  All that can be done if we take the valuation off farm buildings completely.  Then we would soon see the crops saved that at present must go down.  Deputies from rural areas, even if they have not land themselves, must have seen threshing operations carried out and then the machines pulled in and after a wet night starting again in the morning.  They must have noticed the damage done to all the grain that comes from the upper portion of the stock where the butts of the sheaves are wet, no matter how well thatched in the ordinary way. That means six cwt. to seven cwt., perhaps half a ton, of wheat lost because it is not properly housed in a shed, and that has to be laid aside for stock.  That occurred during the emergency when it lessened considerably the amount of millable wheat which went into the mills.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JosephBlowick" hpid="Mr. Blowick Mr. Blowick">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blowick</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not discussing agriculture, but the fact that the building of out-offices on the farmsteads has been prohibited or frowned upon by the Government because of the valuation regulations.  Furthermore, in England that is not the case; in France that is not the case; in in Italy and Germany, and at least in Holland it is not the case.  I do not know of other countries, but in those <Col N="1452" /> I mention farm buildings can be built <i>ad lib.</i> by the farmer without any danger of penalty.</P>
      <P>Might I say, for the information of some Deputies not familiar with the subject, that this legacy was handed down to us, of increasing valuation on farm buildings and on houses, as a relic of the days when the landlord penalised the tenant for improving his land or buildings, by increasing the rent, even though it did not cost the landlord one penny, but perhaps the sweated labour of the tenant himself. One must realise that this is a legacy from those days, and if for no other reason it is high time to scrap it.</P>
      <P>I have been speaking about the agricultural side of the whole question of rating and I would like to deal now with cases brought to my notice in towns about valuation on buildings. Let me quote one case.  A certain hotel owner somewhere in the province of Connacht did nothing more than take the slates off a leaking roof on portion of his hotel, he did not increase the cubic content of that particular area by one cubic inch, he put new timber on and then put back the slates; even the inside was not plastered.  Yet his valuation was increased by £50 in one stroke.  That is positively unjust.  I am sure the officials who have to administer that particular statute must know in their hearts that they are doing a grave injustice.  Apart from those blistered by such regulations, these officials must think we are a pretty sleepy crowd up here, whose job it is to change legislation when we find it is faulty or unjust, not to have tackled this problem long ago.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>While I would like to see this Bill embracing a lot more than it does, it is a step in the right direction and it is more than significant that the first promise we got from the Government side of the House that anything would be done about valuation was shortly after this Bill was introduced.  Clann na Talmhan is supporting this Bill, though it does not go as far as we would like it to go.  The attitude of some of the Fianna Fáil Deputies shows that they want to cling on to the old system, just 100 years old.  It <Col N="1453" /> is a stick-in-the-mud policy clinging to something that, on the sworn testimony of so many valuers, has been absolutely rotten from the foundation up.  I have listened to Deputy Allen, who wants to cling on to a system that he knows in his heart must be unjust.  The present system of fixing the valuation on new houses and of revising the valuation on new buildings is completely unjust.  While this Bill does not go the whole hog, at least it is a step in the right direction.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Finance did not give the House any idea of the scope of the Bill he proposes to introduce, if that Bill ever reaches this House; I have my doubts on that point.  I have painful memories of a Bill that was introduced in 1938 and it was stillborn. I recommend this measure to the House despite all that has been said against it by Deputies on the Government Benches.  I hope that even now it will have a more favourable reception than some Bills have had in the past.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFlanagan" hpid="Mr. S. Flanagan Mr. S. Flanagan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>I have considerable sympathy with any Bill introduced for the purpose of focusing attention on the existent anomalies in the valuation system.  In fairness to Deputy Allen I should, perhaps, say in passing that he did not suggest we should do nothing.  He said it was not right that premises valued in 1852 should 100 years later carry the same valuation.</P>
      <P>This is a very complex problem.  It is very large in its dimensions.  I think the people who have promoted this Bill would be the first to agree that this measure does not attempt to solve the problem as a whole.  The fundamental difficulty, as far as the man in the street is concerned, is that in practice he can have no recourse to the courts after the valuation officer has revalued his premises.  Deputy Allen, I think, can hardly be serious when he suggests that the letting value of premises should be the guide to the rateable valuation.  I know that is the guide in law but I find it very hard to believe that Deputy Allen accepts that premise.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is hardly a house in even the most remote parts of this country that <Col N="1454" /> would not be worth £20 per annum for letting purposes.  Is it suggested we should continue in operation a system under which the valuation authorities are entitled to assess a rate of £20 per annum on that house?  I am talking now from the point of view of the man in the street who carries out some improvement to his premises to the tune of £10 or £15 and then finds that that improvement involves a revaluation of his whole premises.  The injustice from his point of view lies in the fact that his neighbour down the street, over the bridge or across the townland who has never bothered his head about improving his premises continues to get away with the valuation imposed 100 years ago while his valuation is doubled or trebled overnight. When that happens, he rushes down to Deputy Sweetman or myself with 10/6 in his hand&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">

      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>In the country we have to knock off 6d. for luck.  We tell him that nothing can be done about it.  We tell him that he may mount an appeal to the court but the court will say that under the laws in operation at the moment the valuation authorities have been very lenient. These premises, if let, might fetch £50 per annum and, in that case, the court will tell him he has no grievance.</P>
      <P>I do not agree that this Bill meets the situation.  Indeed, I do not think it was intended to meet the situation. For once in our lives, we should get together here.  This matter should not be used as a political football.  The services rendered are yearly becoming greater and more expensive.  The demands made on local authorities are growing every year.  The average rate at the present time is over 30/- in the £.  In some cases, it is almost 40/- in the £.  That means that the nominal valuation is already antediluvian.  We seem to overlook that fact.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Surely we ought to get together and try to hammer out a system under which the burden will be fairly and equitably distributed.  If we do that, we will do a good day's work.  If this matter is made a political platform, <Col N="1455" /> nothing will ever be done.  The matter is too dangerous in itself and we are dealing with things which are too vital to so many people.  One of the reasons why nothing has ever been done so far is because it is dynamite, but if we could get a fund of goodwill from both sides of the House something far-reaching might be done.</P>
    <P>I have considerable sympathy with Deputy Blowick's point of view.  I think he made a good point when he said that excessive valuations on farm buildings are a damper on agricultural production.  In my constituency there is fairly good land valued at £1 per acre.  Almost equally good land less than 20 miles away is valued at 7/- per acre.  This is a very important matter from the point of view of landholders. When they apply to the Land Commision for an increase in their holdings the first thing they are told is that their valuation is so much.  It may be £10 on ten acres of land.  If they are asked if their land is an economic holding they will certainly be told it is not.</P>
    <P>There are many factors involved in valuation.  One's electricity is measured on valuation, and that is another reason why one may be afraid to put up decent out-offices, because there is the danger that not merely the out-offices but the entire premises will be revalued.  Income-tax is based on the valuation of the property.</P>
    <P>I have tried to discuss this problem dispassionately and from the point of view of the man in the street and not that of a lawyer or a Deputy.  The problems I have outlined are those that the man in the street will present to you day after day.  It is very difficult to find an answer to them.  It is very difficult to explain to people who confront you with a rate demand note for £12 to £14 in respect of premises for which they paid £3 or £4 in rates the previous year that there is nothing that can be done about it.  The increase in the valuation was due entirely to the fact that they carried out some improvement to the property.  It is very difficult to explain, particularly when there has not been any comparable improvement in the services rendered for the rates.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1456" /> I appeal, therefore, to all sections of the House not to put the question of valuation on a political basis.  The problem is grave and complex.  The rates which will be demanded in future will be greater than those demanded at present.  The tendency is towards increased interference, if you like, increased services, if you like, by local and central authorities.  We should try to ensure that the people who are asked to pay for these services will pay on a fair basis, according to the value of the property, but not according to the letting value of the property.</P>
    <P>Machinery should be devised whereby the court would have real power over the valuation authorities.  We are all human.  Everybody's difficulties cannot be solved overnight.  No matter what may be done, many people will be dissatisfied with the results. The best we can do is to approach the problem in a fair-minded way.  We should give the courts real power over the decisions of the Valuation Office. Then we should try to see that the individual will have protection of the courts.</P>
    <P>Perhaps somebody may say that I am advocating something which will have the effect of creating more business for my profession.  Perhaps I am. For once in a lifetime we might try not to be small-minded.  If we are big-minded enough about the problem we can tackle and solve it.  While I do not think that this Bill meets the case, it has focussed attention on a very important problem.  For that reason we should be grateful to those who introduced it.</P>

      <P>The sponsors of this Bill are to be congratulated.  A very reasonable discussion has taken place on the Bill.  I earnestly appeal to my colleagues to allow this Bill to go through and, if they desire to introduce another measure at a later stage, they can do so.  If this Bill goes through, there will be a certain amount of consequential employment of people who are anxiously awaiting employment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are certain business premises in Dublin doing a certain type of trade which in the normal way will not increase.  If the owners of the <Col N="1457" /> premises enlarge the shop front the valuation will be increased by 50 per cent.  Is there anybody in the House who stands for that?</P>
    <P>People who want to improve their premises ought to be allowed to do so without an increase in rates in respect of the improvements for a period of, say, seven years.  It would be laudable to encourage people to speculate and to improve their premises. I guarantee that if a proposal is made to have a general increase in valuation or if a Bill is introduced to review valuations all over the country, in nine out of ten cases revalued, the valuation will be increased.  That will mean further taxation on people who are struggling to carry on business.  I have never known a valuation to be reduced.</P>
    <P>If the owner of a licensed premises improves the wash-house or adds toilet accommodation, the Valuation Commissioners immediately increase his valuation by 25, 33 or 50 per cent. The licence fee is based on the valuation. An increase in valuation, therefore, means an increase all round. Many business people refrain from carrying out improvements because of the danger of revaluation.</P>
    <P>Some five or six years ago, someone had the happy idea of bringing in a Valuation Bill.  It got a First Reading. There was such an outcry of indignation about it that the Government at the time dropped it like a hot potato.</P>
    <P>Another grievance, especially in the City of Dublin, arises from the fact that the Valuation Commissioners can go into premises, without notifying the owner, for the purpose of revaluation. In one or two cases that came to my notice last year the owners of the premises knew nothing about the revaluation until they got the demand notice from the corporation showing an increase in the rates of 25 to 30 per cent.  These people got a great shock. Notice of intention to inspect premises for the purpose of revaluation should be given to the owners so that the owner's solicitors may defend the case and argue against the proposed revaluation.</P>

      <P>Deputy Cosgrave gave notice that he would raise on the motion for the Adjournment the subject matter of Question No. 58 on the Order Paper.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LiamCosgrave" hpid="Mr. Cosgrave Mr. Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to raise the subject matter of this question on the Order Paper for the purpose of impressing upon the Minister the effect of the circular letter E.L.7/52.  This circular letter deals with a number of matters to many of which no objection has been taken, and although it applies to all local authorities the effect of paragraph 57 is confined almost entirely to Dublin Corporation and the corporation of the borough of Dún Laoghaire.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The position is that at the end of two years from the date of issue of the circular, which was in June of last year, temporary engineers who have completed a two years' period with the corporation are liable to have their services terminated.  Normally local authorities have few persons in such positions, but as applied to Dublin Corporation the position is entirely different.  As I understand it there are 84 engineers employed by the corporation. Thirty seven are permanent and 47 are temporary.  Of the 47 temporary engineers 21 must leave the employment of the corporation on the 23rd June, 1954, and a further ten before the end of next year.  These men are all engaged on what are described as major schemes&mdash;schemes dealing with housing construction and development, drainage and sewerage and water supply schemes.  In the past when they applied for those temporary positions they did so on the basis that given satisfactory service in the particular position to which they were appointed, they could eventually look forward to a permanent position either with that local authority or some other similar position under other local authorities after appointment by the Local Appointments Commission.  As the position stands a great number of temporary appointments are subsequently filled by permanent appointments <Col N="1459" /> through the Local Appointments Commission.  The temporary engineers in the main deal with the major schemes to which I have referred.  Some of these schemes are long term schemes dealing with the housing programme and so forth, and the position is that quite a number of these temporary engineers are married people with families and they are now obliged to decide whether they will seek alternative positions elsewhere or await, if the Minister so decides, an amendment of the particular article referred to, or alternatively wait on until next June or later in the case of some of them and seek other positions elsewhere. The circumstances in which this circular was issued which I have referred to earlier dealt with a number of matters, but the position which affects these engineers is that they realise that because of one particular case or probably certain individual cases there is a feeling that they may, if allowed to continue in a temporary position, ultimately have a claim to permanent appointment irrespective of any application being made by any of them to the Local Appointments Commission.</P>
    <P>I think that if the Minister examines carefully the representations that have been made to him and if he inquires from the city manager or from the engineering department in the Dublin Corporation, and also, I think, in Dún Laoghaire&mdash;but there are not so many affected there&mdash;he will be informed of the circumstances in which these men were appointed, the conditions under which they accepted the particular appointment, recognising that although the positions notified were temporary that in the past whenever they were appointed to similar positions, provided they gave satisfactory and efficient service, they could look forward to permanent positions either with the particular local authority, in this case the Dublin Corporation, or accept an appointment from the Local Appointments Commissioners to other local authorities.</P>
    <P>I note from the Minister's reply that he has transmitted the representations received from Cumann na nInnealtóirí <Col N="1460" /> and from the engineers concerned to the city manager and that he awaits his observations.  My purpose in raising this matter to-night is to impress upon the Minister the urgency of the problem from the point of view of the persons concerned.  I think it is true to say that they have given satisfactory service and that they are engaged on schemes which will provide work for engineers, for craftsmen, for skilled and unskilled personnel for a great number of years, and that if they are dismissed or if their services are terminated next June or before the end of the year it will mean waste and overlapping and delay in implementing those schemes.  In the normal course, provided their work was satisfactory and the service rendered up to the requirements of the superior officers, those schemes they are engaged upon would continue under their direction. As this circular stands at the moment, if their services are terminated next year new staff will have to be brought in.  It may be that an entirely new staff would not be required immediately because of the fact that 21 of them will fulfil the two-year period on the 23rd June and a further ten before the end of next year, but it is inevitable that in a big change-over of this sort there will be delay, a certain amount of waste, and a general upheaval in the arrangements which these various schemes contemplate, without taking into account at all the personal considerations of the persons involved.  I would, therefore, urge on the Minister that he should amend the particular paragraph of this circular letter and that he should do so without delay in order to allay the anxieties of the engineers who have given and are giving efficient service to the Dublin Corporation.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickSmith" hpid="Minister for Local Government (Mr. Smith) Patrick Smith">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Local Government (Mr. Smith)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not sure or clear as to what case the Deputy has been making &mdash;whether he has been urging me to withdraw the article referred to as far as it extends to engineers or whether it has been for the amendment of the regulation.  The principal question at issue as far as I am concerned is, was there need for such a regulation at all?  I would like to assure the Deputy <Col N="1461" /> that the issue of this particular regulation was not a matter that was decided hastily, and it was included in the general circular because it was felt over a period of years that some such regulation was necessary.  I think the Deputy himself has made an excellent case against the employment by the Dublin Corporation, or any such body, of a staff of engineers numbering roughly, as he stated, 80&mdash;30 of whom were permanent and 47 of whom were temporary.  The Deputy himself has made the case that much of the work on which these men were engaged was not of a temporary nature and, therefore, there was no reason why the number of temporaries should be so weighted.  I understand that the corporation have recently submitted proposals to my Department for the appointment of, I think, 23 permanents. Of this number, we have been able to indicate our approval to the appointment of 14.  The others will be examined later, and our decision will be conveyed to the corporation without undue delay.  As the Deputy has stated, 21 engineers will be affected somewhere around the month of June. I realise, and I think the Deputies too, that this regulation will undoubtedly affect a place like Dublin City in a much more substantial way than it would a local body.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have been in consultation with Cumann na nInnealtóirí.  The officers of that organisation have had interviews with officials of my Department. I think we have conveyed to them that this regulation was not made as a result of any desire on our part to bring hardship on any individual or on any home.  I think that the cumann itself appreciated and approved of what this regulation aimed at.  I take it that that organisation is speaking largely for the individuals who will be affected.  It is not a matter of their being opposed in any way in principle to the regulation in question.  In fact, they approved rather than disapproved but they felt that the impact of this regulation will, perhaps, have some &mdash;as they put it&mdash;serious effects on certain individuals.  I want to assure the Deputy that I think, from the experience we have had, that there is a need for having a regulation which will <Col N="1462" /> cover local bodies everywhere&mdash;and not the Dublin Corporation alone&mdash;so that, in the employment of temporary engineers or other technical officers, some time limit will be placed on such appointments.  When this regulation comes into force, I admit that, to some extent, it will have the effect that the Deputy has described in the case of Dublin and, maybe, of Dún Laoghaire. I do not know whether places such as Cork City or Waterford or Limerick would be affected to the same extent.</P>
    <P>These 21 engineers will not be affected until June next.  The 14 vacancies will be advertised and filled by open competition, say, before the months of March or April.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickSmith" hpid="Mr. Smith Mr. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Byrne, by his interjection, has shown the need for a regulation such as this.  We have in this country a system of competition in the filling of these posts but it is a common practice in local bodies that if an officer who is appointed in a temporary capacity is there for any space of time a campaign is immediately launched to make his appointment permanent.  That kills the whole effect of the competitive basis that has prevailed here for many years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>At the moment, I do not see how you can amend this regulation to meet any certain set of circumstances that could arise out of its enforcement as far as the body which the Deputy has in mind is concerned.  If you amend it, if you extend it, the problem will still have to be dealt with.  If you amend it in so far as Dublin Corporation is concerned, then you will have to amend it in so far as the whole country is concerned.  I do not think that the difference between two years, two and a half years or three years will meet the type of case that the Deputy and the organisation which speaks for these individuals have in mind.  Anyhow, we have invited the cumann to make whatever suggestions they may think fit, for the alleviation of any hardships that might result from this regulation.  We see the need for it.  If we had not seen the need for it, it would not have been inserted in <Col N="1463" /> the general circular.  We know that its implementation at this particular point may have some results such as have been described by the Deputy.  If my Department can do anything to meet that situation, if it arises, at the same time preserving what is aimed at in the circular and in the regulation, then it will be found that we will be entirely co-operative.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>I think we will have ample time.  No matter how slowly they move, we should have ample time to discuss with the organisation any outstanding problems that will be there after they have made their <Col N="1464" /> recommendations regarding the filling of these vacancies.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>The other point is that the circular dealing with other local authorities is quite acceptable but that, in view of the very large number of temporary personnel in Dublin, its full effects here were probably not appreciated.</P>
