      <P>asked the Minister for Finance if he will state (1) what is the gross prospective value of the Marshall Aid Loan Counterpart Fund on the same basis of valuation as that employed in assessing gross liability for the loan in reply to question No. 10 of 5th November, and (2) whether any deficiency in the assets available to the fund for the repayment of the principal of the loan will transpire; and, if so, how much.</P>

      <P>Comprehensive information regarding the position, present and prospective, of the American Loan Counterpart Fund was supplied in answer to the Deputy's questions of 28th October and 5th November.</P>
      <P>I might, perhaps, remind him that the real value of the American Loan was the dollar goods and services for which it paid and which for the most part have long since been consumed&mdash; for instance, the wheat, flour, maize and sorghums on which, in the absence of adequate home production of cereals, virtually half of our Marshall Aid was spent.  The Loan Counterpart Fund derived basically from the purchasing power obtained by the State from the importers and consumers of the dollar goods and services provided out of the loan.  As the Deputy will remember, there were, in consequence, substantial additions to the sterling holdings of the banking system during the years 1949 and 1950, when lodgments to the Counterpart Fund exceeded withdrawals for public purposes.</P>

      <P>As has already been explained to the Deputy in reply to his recent questions, the funds transferred from the American Loan Counterpart Fund to the Exchequer for the purpose of discharging payments of interest on the Marshall Aid Loan consist <Col N="1844" /> almost entirely of payments already made from the Exchequer to the Loan Counterpart Fund by way of interest on Ways and Means Advances from the fund to the Exchequer.  The interest on these advances is a statutory charge on the current revenue available to the Exchequer from taxation and other sources.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Finance if he will state whether dollars are available from dollar resources of the sterling pool to meet our requirements of dollar currency; and if, at any future date, such currency accommodation is not available, whether there is any provision in the Marshall Aid Loan Agreement to provide for that contingency.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Aiken</NameTxt>
      <P>Dollars may be purchased for sterling to meet payments on the American loan.  As regards the second part of the question, there is no specific provision in the loan agreements to cover the contingency mentioned by the Deputy.  The only provision for relief&mdash;and it depends on the agreement of the other party to the loan&mdash;is that contained in paragraph 4 of the agreement of the 28th October, 1948, and paragraph 4 of the agreement of the 30th June, 1950, made by the then Minister for Finance with the Export-Import Bank of Washington as agents of the Government of the United States.  The agreements in question were presented to both Houses of the Oireachtas and are published by the Stationery Office.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Finance if he is aware that only married men with four or more children are at present eligible for relief work in Dublin; whether such regulation is due to the limited amount of money available for financing such relief work; and, if so, whether, in view of the acute unemployed situation in Dublin, the Government will make available to Dublin Corporation sufficient special employment grants to enable it to put many more unemployed persons to work, and thus make possible a relaxation of the regulation, particularly in the period before Christmas.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickBeegan" hpid="Mr. Beegan Mr. Beegan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Beegan</NameTxt>
      <P>Prior to the operation of the Social Welfare Act, 1952, the regulations governing the recruitment of unskilled workers for employment schemes provided that the employing authorities had a free selection of suitable labour from men in receipt of unemployment assistance.  In submitting lists of men for work, employment offices, however, gave preference to the most necessitous persons, as measured by their unemployment assistance rates.  The present arrangements provide that employment offices, when submitting lists of workmen, give preference to men with the greatest number of dependents, subject to the proviso that a person who already had <Col N="1847" /> a spell of employment on employment schemes within the previous 12 months would not be submitted for employment as long as other suitable unemployment assistance recipients were available on the register.  I am advised that, since the 1st April last, it has been possible within the above-mentioned regulations to submit in Dublin for employment a number of persons having fewer dependents than are referred to in the Deputy's question. As regards the last part of the question, I would refer the Deputy to my statements on the Estimates discussions on Vote 10 on the 22nd and 27th October, and the reply to his question of yesterday's date on the subject of grants for employment schemes in Dublin.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Justice if he is aware that on the night of 1st June last a search was made by members of the Garda Síochána, led by a superintendent, on a house in Ballyshannon and that an attempt to search another house in the same town was also made; and, if so, whether he will state (1) the circumstances under which the search and attempted search were made; (2) whether the officers in question acted under search warrants, and, if so, by whom the search warrants were authorised, and (3) whether the officers in question received any information on the matter from the Six Counties police force.</P>

      <P>On the night of 1st June a house in Ballyshannon was searched by the Garda Síochána, under the authority of a search order lawfully issued by a superintendent of the Garda Síochána. It is not correct to say that an attempt was made to search another house in the same town on the same occasion. Members of the Garda Síochána did call at another house but left on being told that the owner was not in.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is not the practice to disclose the <Col N="1852" /> source or sources of information which is obtained by the Garda Síochána. Furthermore, I do not consider that it would be in the public interest or fair to the person or persons concerned, to indicate publicly the nature of the suspected offence which gave rise to the search.</P>
    <Speaker pid="OliverJFlanagan" hpid="Mr. O. Flanagan Mr. O. Flanagan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>May I ask if it is a fact that in this case the chief constable of the R.U.C. in Enniskillen phoned the superintendent in Ballyshannon and asked that a search be carried out of this house for the purpose of confiscating tricolours?  When has it become an offence to have a tricolour in a house in the Twenty-Six Counties?  That happened and I will pass the proof over to the Minister if he wants to see it.  It is a disgrace and that practice will have to be stopped.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Justice if he will state whether special instructions directing members of the Garda Síochána to warn children alleged to have committed offences instead of bringing them before District Justices have been issued recently; and, if so, if he will state what those instructions are and whether they were issued with his authority.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>The Commissioner, Garda Síochána, has issued instructions that children under 14 years of age are not to be prosecuted by the police for minor offences in any case until the district officer has considered the circumstances of the case, and that if the district officer is satisfied (a) that the offence can be regarded as a childish lapse, (b) that the child is <Col N="1853" /> not of a criminal disposition, (c) that his parents can be relied on to discipline him, (d) that the injured party does not desire to see the child prosecuted, and (e) that no person over 14 years of age is involved in the offence and is being prosecuted for it, the district officer may direct that the case be disposed of by a warning given to the child in the presence of his parents.</P>

      <P>There are matters in regard to this which could not be disposed of by way of supplementary question.  One is the right of a Garda officer to issue a warning, which is a judicial act, to persons alleged to have committed an offence.

    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>On the Second Stage of this Bill yesterday I made 11 concrete proposals of the character so earnestly solicited by the Tánaiste when he was moving the Second Reading.  I have carefully perused the Tánaiste's observations at the concluding stages of the Second Reading, and I cannot find that he expressed himself as ready to adopt any of the 11 proposals I made to him.</P>
      <P>The Supplies and Services Act as originally enacted was designed to enable the several Ministers of the Government, by Executive Order, to evoke from our resources the maximum supply and to marshal our resources in the most effective method to secure the maximum service from the funds of which we dispose.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the course of the Second Stage debate the Minister appeared to be anxious to hear concrete proposals, and said he would be anxious to hear them. When a Deputy makes 11 concrete proposals that the Tánaiste asks for the least he may reasonably expect is that the Tánaiste will undertake to consider them or, if he has considered <Col N="1867" /> them in advance, extend the courtesy to that Deputy of informing him in the House of what his and the Government's reactions are to the proposals submitted.</P>
    <P>I think the proposals I submitted were of considerable importance and I would especially ask the Tánaiste, now that the Bill is in its last stage before this House, at least to deal with two matters to which I referred.  One is the geological and aerial survey which I think could be used very materially to elicit increased supply from our resources and the other is the proposal concerning enterprising farmers who propose to build farm buildings or equip their farms with up-to-date equipment for the greater evocation of supplies from the land belonging to them.  I would ask the Tánaiste to deal with my proposal that money advanced to them for this purpose should be advanced interest-free, at least for a period of ten years, so that those who are prepared to put their backs into the job of evoking increased supplies will be facilitated thereby.  I would leave over that if it does not suit the Tánaiste's convenience but the other nine proposals I made could, I think, advantageously be dealt with now or at least the Tánaiste might with reasonable courtesy answer now before the Bill passes its final stage in view of the fact that we are accommodating him in giving him this Bill in, I think, two days when it was his habit as leading in opposition to continue a debate for six weeks before he could see his way to making this piece of legislation available to the Government of which I was a member.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>During the discussion on the Second Stage of this Bill yesterday I called the attention of the Tánaiste to the situation which had arisen in a new industry, the dead meat trade.  I called attention to the fact that there were approximately 40 meat-packing plants erected in the country and that my information was that not a single one of them was <Col N="1868" /> operating as to 25 per cent. of its capacity and in fact a number of them had entirely closed down with consequent serious loss of good employment for the workers who had previously secured employment in those factories.  I quite realise, and I said so yesterday, that this is not a matter that can be adequately discussed across the floor of the House, but I do think that this new industry of meat packing and the export of carcase meat represents a valuable new industry for this country.  A considerable sum of money has been invested in the 40 meat-packing plants throughout the country.  I would like to have from the Tánaiste an indication, first, as to whether the Government is aware of the difficulties which have arisen, so far as these meat-packing plants are concerned; and, secondly, that some steps will be taken immediately to get these plants back into production and the workers back into employment because a very serious situation exists at the moment.  Unless there are some governmental advice, assistance and action, I am afraid we are going to be left with 40 unoccupied meat-packing plants in the country.  I do not want that to happen.  It would be a national tragedy if those plants were put out of operation in circumstances within our control.  I, therefore, ask the Tánaiste if he is in a position to say anything to the Dáil that would at least give the House an assurance that some steps would be taken to deal with the matter without delay.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GeraldBoland" hpid="Minister for Justice (Mr. Boland) Gerald Boland">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice (Mr. Boland)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move that the Bill be now read a Second Time.  This is a Bill for two specific purposes.  The first is the granting of a licence for the Central Bus Station in Áras Mhic Dhiarmada; the second is the preservation of licences attached to premises which are demolished by local authorities in connection with housing schemes, the widening of streets and so on.</P>
      <P>The first part of the Bill&mdash;up to and including Section 5&mdash;relates to Áras Mhic Dhiarmada.  It provides that a licence for the bus station there may be given by the Revenue Commissioners to C.I.E. on production of a certificate from the Minister for Industry and Commerce.  The purpose of the certificate is to enable the Minister to prescribe the portion of the bus station to be licensed; the Minister will also be empowered to grant, from time to time as circumstances may require, an amended certificate allowing the extension or transfer of the licence to another portion of the premises.</P>
      <P>I do not think it is necessary for me to say much about the desirability of a licence for the Central Bus Station: large numbers of people may be waiting there before the arrival or departure of buses, and it is evident that the amenity of a licence is necessary, just as it is at a major railway station or at an airport.  The licence will be in the name of C.I.E.  The law relating to hours of closing and so on will apply to the premises.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The object of the second part of the Bill is to solve a problem which has for some time hindered local authorities in their housing and town planning schemes and is causing difficulties in Limerick City at present.  Under the existing law, a perfectly sound public-house may have to be demolished by a local authority in the course of their housing or town planning operations and when that is done the licence lapses and cannot be renewed.  This is undesirable in two respects.  Firstly, the publican is permanently put out of business and, as some of those affected <Col N="1871" /> have pointed out, a lump sum in compensation, however fairly assessed, may often be inadequate recompense for the loss suffered by a person who, perhaps late in life, after spending years in the trade and acquiring a specialised knowledge of it, may have to start another type of business in which he has no experience.  Secondly, the law is unfair to local authorities who have to pay heavy compensation for licences which have a certain monopoly value and which, because of a defect or omission in the law, are lost when the premises are demolished.  If a public-house is burned down or otherwise accidentally destroyed, there is provision in law for the granting of a new licence.  There is no reason in equity why a licence should have to lapse simply because the premises have to be demolished to comply with the development plans of a local authority. The Bill, therefore, provides that in such a case the licence may be attached to new premises on a site acquired by the local authority.  If the new premises are on the same site as the old premises, or as near to it as in the opinion of the court makes no difference to other publicans in the neighbourhood, objections from other publicans will not be admitted.</P>
    <P>A case in point would be where the public-house would be moved back a few yards to allow for the widening of a street.  Where, however, there is a change in the location of the site and the change could adversely affect other publicans, a special right of objection, more favourable to the other publicans than that given under existing law, is given in the Bill.  The normal ground of objection is the number of previously licensed houses in the neighbourhood or, in other words, the adequacy of existing facilities: thus if there is only one public-house in the neighbourhood and it can cater for only 80 per cent. of the trade in the area, the ordinary ground of objection would almost certainly be overruled even though the new public-house, perhaps a more modern structure with better fittings, might take a great deal of the trade from the existing one.  The Bill is designed to prevent that happening <Col N="1872" /> in the case of licences granted under its provisions.  The test it provides is whether the licensing of the new premises would be &ldquo;unreasonably detrimental&rdquo; to the business carried on in other public-houses.  Thus, even though existing facilities may not be fully adequate, the licence may be refused if the new premises would take an appreciable amount of trade from other public-houses in the neighbourhood. This provision is, therefore, heavily weighted in favour of existing publicans, but I consider that it is better to have it that way than to run the risk of unfairly interfering with existing equities.</P>
    <P>The Bill provides that the court may authorise the granting of the new licence only to the holder of a certificate from the local authority declaring that the old premises have been or are to be demolished by them or on their direction and that the site of the new premises has been acquired by them as a site for licensed premises in substitution for the old premises.  It provides that the person with the greatest interest in the old licence&mdash;in the ordinary case that person would be the person who holds or held that licence&mdash;must get first option, but if he does not want the certificate it may be given to somebody else.  If it were in fact being given to somebody else, it would, of course, normally be given to the highest bidder for the lease of the approved site or premises.</P>
    <P>The Bill has provisions on the same lines as the provisions relating to hotels in the Tourist Traffic Act, 1952, namely, that application may be made to the court, on the basis of plans, for a declaration that premises constructed in accordance with the plans will be licensed.  This is a practical necessity in the type of case in question.  The prospective licensee may make this application on the basis of plans, or the local authority may do so.  The main reason the right of application is being given to the local authority is that the arrangement between the local authority and the publican whose premises are to be knocked down may be that the local authority will build a new public-house for him, in <Col N="1873" /> accordance with their plans for the area, instead of paying monetary compensation for the destruction of the premises&mdash;such an arrangement would often be to the advantage of both parties.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JackBelton" hpid="Mr. Belton Mr. Belton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Belton</NameTxt>
      <P>I personally oppose this Bill on several grounds.  In the first place, I cannot see in the Bill where there is any guarantee that the licence proposed to be granted to the C.I.E. bus terminal in Store Street will be restricted to ordinary trading.  Several years ago, the Minister gave this House a guarantee, when a similiar licence was granted to Dublin Airport, that the licence would be used only for passengers using the airport to travel to and from the country.  At the present time, however, we can see advertisements in every daily newspaper for the holding of wedding and other receptions in Dublin Airport, to the detriment of trade in hotels and other licensed premises in and around the city.  I may say that several hotels outside the Dublin area are feeling the effect of this competition.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I might also draw the attention of the Minister to the fact that when proposals were brought forward to erect the bus terminal in Store Street a number of years back, and when construction commenced, certain business people in the neighbourhood of Store Street were sufficiently progressive to go to their bank managers and look for extra accommodation to enable them to improve their premises. One case which I have in mind is that of a publican in the neighbourhood who improved his premises.  The valuation authorities then saw fit to increase his poor law valuation to the extent of £140.  That increase of £140 in valuation was, I presume, made on his premises on the recommendation of a valuation officer or of the rate collector for the area.  If the Minister will take the trouble to examine the records in the Valuation Office, I am sure he will see that this extra £140 valuation was put on the premises principally because of the anticipated extra business in the Store Street area as a result of the <Col N="1874" /> completion of the bus terminal.  The owner of these premises has to pay on this extra £140 but when the valuation officer or the rate collector recommending that increase in valuation submitted their report, did they take into account the fact that the C.I.E. authorities would be applying for a licence to sell drink in competition with the licensed houses in that area?</P>
    <P>I might also draw the Minister's attention to the fact that there is a block of five houses in the Store Street area.  I understand that that block includes another licensed house where no additions, no structural improvements have taken place over a great number of years.  Yet, the valuation on these five premises has been considerably increased.</P>
    <P>We might ask why these valuations on these premises in a back street area like Store Street or the end of Amiens Street have been increased&mdash;an area where there is no passing trade.  It is obvious that these valuations were increased simply because Store Street but terminal was being erected in the area.  In this block of buildings there is a licensed premises that will have to compete with the licensed premises which it is proposed to have in the bus terminal.</P>
    <P>I have mentioned just two licensed premises which will mostly be affected by the granting of this licence.  However, as the Minister knows well, there are eight or nine licensed premises within 100 yards of the bus terminal. These premises will be seriously affected because each and every one of them have had their valuations increased. The amount they will have to pay in rates will be considerably greater than what they were paying before the bus terminal was ever thought of.  It is obvious to anybody that, if this licence is granted in respect of the bus terminal, the passengers who will use the transport services operating to and from that terminal will not bother to go outside the premises itself to partake of any refreshments or anything else that might be required.</P>
    <P>I might add that the business people <Col N="1875" /> in the Talbot Street area were looking forward to a great boom in their business when the bus terminal at Store Street would be completed.  They never visualised that a full licence would be granted there.  Neither did they visualise that the ratepayers of the city and the taxpayers of the country would be providing a shopping centre in the bus terminal in opposition to businesses in that area.</P>
    <P>I think the Minister would be well advised to confine the licence in respect of the bus terminal to a restaurant licence only, with certain restrictions on the authorities in Store Street that it would be solely for the use of passengers who are using buses to and from the city.  If this licence were to be used on such a scale as is in operation at Dublin Airport at the moment, I think the Minister and the Government would be overstepping themselves considerably.  They are taking taxpayers' money to compete against the taxpayers.  May I say, in conclusion, on that section of the Bill&mdash; although I suppose it is no concern of the Minister's&mdash;that, to my mind, the rents in the shopping centre are fantastic?</P>
    <P>The next section of the Bill is a section which in my view seriously affects all those people who own licensed premises throughout the country and particularly those people who own licensed premises adjacent to an area developed by a local authority housing scheme.  I personally object to any local authority having the right to grant a new licence to new premises and that is really what the Bill means.  It also takes away from the citizens, or any section of citizens, the right to object to the granting of any licence.  It takes that right away from the Pioneer Association and from any church organisation or religious body.</P>
    <P>This section also gives permission to a local authority to change the location of a premises and I should like to draw the attention of the House to the effect that could have.  There is a public house, Mooney's, in Harry Street, and, if for some reason or other, it should be demolished, the corporation can <Col N="1876" /> give that licence around the corner in Grafton Street without objection from anybody.  The authority for making what appears to be that small change but what in actual fact would be a terrific change, is the local city or county manager.  I think that is placing too great a power in the hands of any local authority.</P>
    <P>Before the 1902 Act, the granting of licences for public-houses was in the hands of the local justices of the peace. Some people think that was a method of demoralising the people of this country, but it is certainly the reason why there are licensed premises all over the country, in huckster's shops and so forth.  Licences were granted wholesale and the securing of a licence depended on the favour of the local justice of the peace.  The 1902 Act was brought in to prevent that and the number of new licences was restricted. No new licence could be granted without the extinguishing of an old licence. I agree that in this Bill there are no new licences to be granted with the extinguishing of an old licence.</P>
    <P>The Minister said that a publican gets compensation when a local authority acquires his premises, and I agree.  He added that there has been a great deal of dissatisfaction with the amount of compensation given, and again I agree, but qualified arbitrators decide the amount of compensation to be given.  Are we going to question their findings, to question the amount of compensation which they decide should be given?  In this Bill, however, no consideration will be given to the amount of compensation which some people might argue the publican would be entitled to, the publican who will suffer because the new premises can be put too near his old established business.</P>
    <P>This is a retrograde step on the part of the Minister.  The Bill has been brought in because of certain arguments which can be made with regard to licensed property in the City of Limerick.  If the Minister thinks that question deserves consideration and should be dealt with at Government level, the Bill should be confined to the problem existing in Limerick, without being applied to the whole country. <Col N="1877" /> The licensed trade is the biggest tax gatherer for the Government and, as such, deserves a little more consideration than it is getting under this section.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJKeyes" hpid="Mr. Keyes Mr. Keyes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keyes</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome this measure, and I congratulate the Minister on having brought it in so speedily.  The first portion of the Bill is so obviously necessary that it calls for little comment. One could scarcely visualise a transport terminal of the magnitude of Store Street without facilities for refreshments.  I do not share the fears of Deputy Belton that the operation of a licensed premises in Store Street will affect detrimentally the licensed premises in the vicinity.  I think it will have the reverse effect.  I never heard of the licensees at Kingsbridge, Westland Row or any other terminus complaining that the operation of a licence in the railway premises nearby has militated against their business. On the contrary, I think it has acted as a kind of magnet to attract business to the area, and whatever business is carried on in the premises at Store Street is going to help willy-nilly the people in Store Street.</P>
      <P>I do not think that any case could be made for the suggestion to limit the use of the licensed premises to those in possession of tickets.  That is not operated in the modern age, and we ought not to be retrograde.  One does not require to have a ticket to use the refreshment rooms at Kingsbridge and Westland Row.  If one's friends are seeing one off on the train, they can pay 2d. for a platform ticket, and I do not see why we should feel any trepidation with regard to the people seeing friends off at Store Street being able to enjoy a drink, a parting &ldquo;deoc an dorais&rdquo; as their friends leave.  On the way back, they are bound to have another in the local.</P>

      <P>They can have a couple. While the need for the first portion of the Bill is fairly obvious, the other portion of it, while it may not be so apparent, is a very urgent matter, in the eyes of some Deputies at least.  The <Col N="1878" /> city I come from, Limerick, has been in the forefront of the agitation to get this alteration in the licensing legislation, and we have made the case&mdash; Deputies of every political view&mdash;time and again to the Minister for it.  That action was inspired, instigated and concurred in by the licensed trade. The licensed trade were definitely responsible for that agitation, by Limerick Deputies particularly, to have this old anomaly, this anachronism in the licensing law, rectified.  Where a local authority found it necessary to demolish a particular area and transfer the occupiers of the houses to another area, there were owners of licensed premises whose premises and their ownership of them went back in some cases 100 years and more.</P>
      <P>They were being ruthlessly banished from the place where they had been born and made their living, and while they had been offered some compensation, I suggest to Deputy Belton that no amount of money or compensation would adequately make up to these people for the loss of a business in which they had been carried on by their families for many generations. They merely wanted the right to continue in their own business.  Surely no representative of the licensed trade would say that it is an unreasonable thing to ask that a person who has committed no crime, who has conducted his business correctly all through those years and who is now being removed from his premises by the action of the local authority should at least get the right to bring his licence with him to a new premises.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Belton has given one definition of the 1902 Act under which he said licences were granted to hole and corner premises.  I could give another definition of that Act which would differ somewhat from the Deputy's definition but if we take the law as it exists, we find that outside the boundaries of the boroughs of Dublin, Cork, Waterford and Limerick a man can transfer his licence from one point to another without question.  But in these four boroughs, the licence was not capable of being transferred.  The licence could not be taken from one <Col N="1879" /> premises to another nor from one side of the street to the other.  Apart from the particular cases now in question, I have known the case of a man who took down his premises, rebuilt them and did a decent job on them.  He wanted to transfer his licence across the road to another premises whilst the original premises were being rebuilt but he would not be allowed to do so.</P>
    <P>If the premises stood 200 yards further on on the other side of the borough boundary, it would have been quite open to him to transfer the licence across the road as he wished. Eventually he had to buy another premises a quarter mile away on the other side of the boundary and transfer his licence there while the rebuilding of his original premises was in progress. When these premises were finished, he sold the premises he had bought and went back into the original premises again.  Now we are getting the same thing in a more aggravated form, because it is necessary to demolish certain premises in Limerick.  The local authority are doing a decent job in their efforts to provide better housing for the people.  The town planners come along and plan in a certain way, new areas are laid out and people are transferred into them.  But the licensee of a premises which has been demolished in the execution of these plans comes along to his new premises minus a licence.  That appears to be a glaring anomaly which we now seek to have remedied.</P>
    <P>The Minister himself had some doubts about accepting our recommendations because he was afraid of opposition from the licensed trade but the licensed trade in Limerick were wholeheartedly behind the Deputies when they approached the Minister to make representations in regard to this matter.  Notwithstanding that, we now have Deputy Belton who appears to have been briefed by the licensed trade objecting to the provisions in the Bill which would give the licences of demolished premises the right to transfer their licence to their new premises. I am working on a licensed trade brief as well and I say that the licensed <Col N="1880" /> trade approved of our recommendations to the Minister and that representatives of that trade came up here with us into the Minister's sanctum. Every publicity was given to that deputation and flashlight photographs were even taken.  They repudiated their action subsequently and said they had nothing to do with it.</P>
    <P>I was approached by a representative of the licensed trade in this House who professed to see some cause for fear as to the consequence to the licensed trade if this measure were passed, inasmuch as he seemed to think that new licences might be granted indiscriminately.  I see no grounds for these fears.  Section 6, paragraph A, reads as follows:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;A local authority may, if they think fit, issue to any person a certificate declaring that</P>
    <P>(a)  after the passing of this Act particular licensed premises have been or are to be demolished by or by direction of the authority in exercise of any of their functions and,</P>
    <P>(b)  a particular site acquired by them is approved by them as a site for licensed premises, in substitution for the former premises.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>That section specifically refers to the fact that the local authority are clearing up the site and that the local authority can issue a certificate to a person displaced in the course of the clearing-up operations, that another particular site is suitable for licensed premises in substitution for premises demolished.  Fears have been expressed by members of the licensed trade that public-houses may be opened by persons other than those displaced, but I suggest that adequate safeguards are provided in the section which I have read.</P>
    <P>Deputy Belton also referred to the fact that no compensation was to be paid to a publican whose territory, as he stated, was going to be invaded by the new licencee.  That, I suggest, is a groundless fear, because the action of the local authority in giving a certificate to enable a person to get a new licence is circumscribed, inasmuch as these certificates will apply only to <Col N="1881" /> newly built areas.  There are no publicans in existence in the areas to which these people are being transferred. What the position in Dublin is I cannot exactly say, but I think we hear too much of Dublin in connection with the licensed trade.  The people of Limerick, I know, will be very grateful to the Minister for what is being done.  A few other places will be affected as the housing operations are being extended, but I suggest that bare justice only is being done by this measure and whatever little flutter it may cause to the people in charge of the Licensed Trade Association in Dublin, I think they have no cause for complaint.  This measure should be welcomed in its entirety, and I welcome it very heartily.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PeadarCowan" hpid="Captain Cowan Captain Cowan">
      <NameTxt>Captain Cowan</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to say that I welcome this measure, substantially for the reasons advanced by Deputy Keyes.  If we provide, as we have provided, a bus station in Dublin that has cost a very considerable sum of money and if that bus station is to provide facilities and amenities for the travelling public, it is obvious that these facilities and amenities must include the provision of intoxicating liquor for such persons visiting the station as require it.  I feel that a case has been invented, or attempted to be invented here, in regard to the Bill for some reason that is not genuine.  It would be an extraordinary thing if in the 20th century, when we have such facilities as we have at Store Street, they did not include facilities for a member of the public who is travelling or who is visiting the premises for one reason or another, to take a drink.  Buses may arrive at a time in the morning or they may arrive or leave at a time in the evening, when the ordinary public-houses are not open.  It certainly would be an extraordinary thing if a traveller wanting refrestments were to be compelled to leave the comfort of the Store Street building and go across, perhaps in wet weather, to one of the licensed premises nearby.  I am satisfied with Deputy Keyes that instead of injuring licensed traders or business people generally in that area, the bringing of tens of thousands of additional people into the area is going <Col N="1882" /> to improve trade in licensed premises and in other businesses in that area. I think the wise business people in that area realise that and that they are delighted that the provision of the bus station there has resulted in the bringing in of such a tremendous number of people into that area with the additional business that that will undoubtedly mean for them.</P>
      <P>There is no question, in my view, of any publican in that area losing business.  Whether there is a bar in the Store Street premises or not, I believe that their business will improve immensely and that very few would be anxious to leave that good business area at the present time.</P>
      <P>I feel that to adopt the line which has been adopted by Deputy Belton, which is obviously the line that has been taken up by the Dublin licensed vintners, would really make a laugh of ourselves in regard to the simple matter of providing facilities for a drink in a bus station like Store Street.  The objection to the provision of these facilities seems to me to be ridiculous.  I have read the licensed vintners' criticism of the Bill and I should like to say to the licensed vintners in Dublin who are interested in this matter that they are being led very badly and very unwisely in regard to this matter.</P>
      <P>I have read the part of their state ment where they object to two matters being included in one Bill, the matter of the Store Street licence and the matter of the licences that will bring, as Deputy Keyes says, a measure of justice to those people in Limerick and to other people similarly affected throughout the country.  I think it was an impertinence on the part of the licensed trade to suggest that this House is not competent to decide what is to be in a Bill or not; a gross impertinence to suggest that these two matters should not be dealt with in one Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Then they come along and suggest to bank managers and directors that they should look at the overdrafts of their own members in the Store Street area.  That is what was published in to-day's <i>Irish Independent.</i>  If I know anything about bank managers, when <Col N="1883" /> there is even the slightest whimper of anything they certainly will look into it.  That suggestion comes badly from the officers of the licensed trade.</P>
    <P>I take the opportunity of saying that in my view the licensed traders are being badly and unwisely led and that they should reconsider this matter. They are placing themselves in a false position by following somebody, who is availing of the opportunity of this Bill to whip up a national campaign against the Government.  How ridiculous that position is appears from what has happened in connection with this Bill this afternoon.  Deputy Belton had to explain to the House that he was adopting his line personally, that he was not committing, or could not commit his own Party to the line which he took.  Nevertheless, we have a national campaign being whipped up in opposition to this Bill. I know many members of the licensed trade, and I find them all very sensible people.  I beg leave to suggest to them that they should look over the declaration that has been handed out to the Press by their own organisation in regard to this Bill, and they will see how foolish it is.</P>
    <P>We have on many occasions mentioned in this House, and I certainly have mentioned it on any occasion I got the opportunity, that as far as publicans and as far as the licensing laws are concerned there are matters that require amendment or adjustment or revision.  Unfortunately, this Bill is very strictly limited, and I do not think that any opportunity will be available under it to provide any revision or improvement of the facilities that publicans are justly entitled to. But the Minister stated on a previous occasion that the question of the licensing laws was under consideration and that a Bill to remove anomalies and to revise them will be brought before this House some time in the future.  When that Bill comes before this House, I think the members engaged in the licensed trade will have general support from this House in the removal of those things to which they take proper objection.</P>
    <P>I do not think that they are improving <Col N="1884" /> their position one bit or strengthening it by adopting the ridiculous line they are adopting in regard to this Bill by objecting to progress, by objecting to people who have to travel perhaps very early in the morning or who come in by bus at 12 o'clock at night when the public-houses are not open, getting reasonable facilities to have a drink.  When an organisation adopts such a foolish line, I think they do themselves an injustice and I think that the members of this organisation, particularly the executive members, should consider whether they are being led badly or unwisely or along the wrong road. They might consider why they are being led in this way.</P>

      <P>The organisation's objections have been mentioned by Deputy Belton and the purpose of them is set out in to-day's <i>Irish Independent</i> and <i>Irish Press.</i>  There is a second part of this Bill which deals with the people in Limerick and areas in other parts of the country where the local authority finds it necessary to remove a licensed premises.  The Minister has adopted a very sane and sensible course in dealing with these.  In Limerick, where they have met this problem as Deputy Keyes said, the licensed trade there, the local authority and the citizens generally felt that something should be done as a simple matter of justice for the people affected. Obviously, in the extension of slum clearance through the country problems such as the Limerick problem will arise here and there now and again.  It is wise that these people should know that they will not have to apply for a new licence in the ordinary way, with the objections that could be put forward to the granting of a new licence.</P>

      <P>Therefore, I say that the machinery provided in this Bill is reasonable machinery provided by a reasonable Minister to deal in a reasonable way with the situation that has developed.  It is grossly unfair that the organisation to which these four or five publicans in Limerick belong should object to a simplified machinery for giving these people licences.  It looks to me to be a very strange action to take against one's own members and fellow traders.  I do not think for one moment that that attitude on the part of the Licensed Grocers' and Vintners' Association will be approved by very many of their members throughout the country.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DanielMcMenamin" hpid="Mr. McMenamin Mr. McMenamin">

      <NameTxt>Captain Cowan</NameTxt>
      <P>It is a matter of opinion.  I am only saying that I do not think it will be approved by the members of the Licensed Grocers' and Vintners' Association in Limerick.  I am certain it will not be approved by many of the licensed grocers and vintners in Dublin who, if their <Col N="1886" /> premises were to be removed because of a corporation slum clearance scheme, would be glad to be provided with a licence in a new area of the city.</P>
      <P>This Bill, as it seems to me, is a simple Bill to provide, in the first place, for the necessities of our bus station of which everybody in the country is so proud and, in the second place, to provide a measure of justice for certain people affected in Limerick and likely to be affected elsewhere.  I think it should have the unanimous support of the House.</P>

      <P>Were it not for what occurred in this House on a previous occasion with regard to the granting of a licence of this kind, I would not take part in the discussion at all. I have no interest of any kind in the matter except from a public point of view.</P>
      <P>I bitterly resented what took place with regard to Collinstown.  We had a definite undertaking given by the Minister in this House.  I think I intervened at that particular juncture with regard to what accommodation was going to be provided in connection with the supply of refreshments.  The Minister specifically gave an undertaking to the House that the amenity provided in the licence that would be granted would be for the travelling public.  Later on I will come to what is going on.</P>
      <P>Surely one is right to take grave exception when a statement of that kind is made by the Minister in charge of the Bill when afterwards it is openly violated and no steps taken to enforce the undertaking that is given.  That is just not good enough, and I am not going to accept it.  I now protest against it.  This Bill affords us an opportunity of raising what occurred. I am not a flying man.  My legs carry me to most of the places I want to go, but it is open and notorious, of course, that this thing is becoming a regular &ldquo;do&rdquo; place at Collinstown.  I use that term in its widest sense.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Let us look at the promise that was given to the House and the nation.  The travelling public were to be provided with refreshments.  That was a right and proper thing.  I do not think there <Col N="1887" /> was anybody in this House who took any exception to it, and I do not think anybody could.  I do not drink, but that does not make me such a pussyfoot that I am going to deny another person a natural right to use his free will. This place was provided by the money of the public and is now being used to compete against these people who, as taxpayers and citizens, put up the money.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McMenamin</NameTxt>
      <P>No.  The only regret I have now in regard to that Bill is that we did not state specifically in it that nobody would be provided with intoxicating drink at Collinstown other than the people who actually travel.  In other words, put down in the Bill the undertaking which the Minister gave to the House when he got the power that was given in the Bill.  The statement was worthless. The question is was it <i>mala fide</i>?  One can have one's opinion about that. Was the Minister deceived in it?  If he was originally deceived, why did he not take action to justify to the House the undertaking he gave when he got the Bill?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We come to a much bigger problem in this connection.  I am only looking at the matter broadly.  Again, I am in no conflict with the Minister about providing amenities for the travelling public.  In the face of what occurred before, we will have to take steps to try to safeguard the position.  Let us visualise the spectacle.  The entire country will be carried to this centre. Let us keep in mind what we are doing and thus prevent some people, including clergymen of all denominations, criticising us afterwards in regard to the &ldquo;hobo&rdquo; we created at Store Street.  The entire country will be carried to Store Street and assembled there.  They will go down <Col N="1888" /> town to do business during the day. As Deputy Keyes said, there will be an occasional &ldquo;deoch an dorais&rdquo; during the day.  These people will go to Store Street in the evening to catch the last bus going to Cork, Waterford, Kilkenny, Carlow, Athlone, Galway, Mullingar and everywhere else.</P>

      <P>&mdash;&mdash;and I know as much about human nature as Deputy Cowan.  We are doing this thing with our eyes open.  There is going to be a huge café attached to this station. As the Bill now stands, if a man or a woman goes in for a meal they are entitled to have a drink with the meal. Will drink be carried from the bar to the restaurant and have men drunk or threequarter drunk?  Does the Minister intend to do that or is he going to license only a particular part of the building that will be structurally separated from the café and the restaurant?  Will that be done?  Imagine the spectacle when people from the country who have spent the day in town arrive at the station in the evening <Col N="1889" /> substantially under the influence of drink.  They may go to the café where there are decent sober people who want to have a cup of tea in peace and decency.  You will have half-intoxicated people going in there.</P>

      <P>Under this Bill, a licence is going to be given for the sale of intoxicating drink there.  There will also be on sale there coffee, tea, luncheons, sweets, confectionery and ice-cream.  What about all the little shops in Talbot Street that sell ice-cream and confectionery and that run tea-rooms?  They are paying taxes for the construction and maintenance of this building and, under this Bill, their livelihood is being taken away from them.  Has Deputy Cowan talked about that to his constituents?  They are not my constituents, but they are my fellow-citizens and I, as a public representative, am interested in their well-being.  I am interested to see that their livelihood is not taken away from them.</P>

They have tea-rooms, and they sell confectionery, cigarettes and a lot of other little things.  They are half huckster shops trying to eke out a living for themselves.  All the things which they sell are going to be sold under licence in this building and by an organisation that has a monopoly.  We should remember that millions of pounds of the taxpayers' money have gone into the erection of this building.</P>
    </Speaker>

      <Col N="1890" /> This organisation was not able to complete the building of it without getting more money from the taxes taken out of the earnings of these poor people living in Talbot Street and down around Amiens Street.</P>

It is my duty to protect the interests of these poor people as far as I can, and to see that their livelihood is not taken away from them.  They will not know that until the Bill is passed, and then it will be too late. What does Deputy Cowan think about that?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PeadarCowan" hpid="Captain Cowan Captain Cowan">

    <Speaker pid="DanielMcMenamin" hpid="Mr. McMenamin Mr. McMenamin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McMenamin</NameTxt>
      <P>Take the position of men who, within the last five or six years, bought public-houses and other premises in that area&mdash;that is, since the erection of this building was first mooted.  They paid exorbitant prices for their premises, owing to the fact that the erection of this building was mooted.  They thought it would bring enormous trade to the district.  They now find themselves saddled with heavy responsibilities and with overdrafts in the banks, while at the same time we are, by statute, going to create a competitor against them, and with the money which they had to put up for the erection of this building. These people will have to contribute in the future, as they have in the past, to meet the losses of this institution.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am sorry that there have been losses, but that is the fact and we have to face it.  What we are doing is, we are providing by statute a competitor against those people.  I am endeavouring to put the public point of view on this.  I have no interest at all in it. <Col N="1891" /> I represent nobody in Dublin, not even myself.  I do not even have the trouble of voting at elections in Dublin.</P>
    <P>I am then down in my own constituency, and politically, locally or nationally I have no effect at all in the City of Dublin.  But this is a public matter that has been instigated by an organisation that has a monopoly.  It has a monopoly of the transport of the country which it enforces rigidly.  A man, for example, cannot carry a bag of apples for a neighbour.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DanielMcMenamin" hpid="Mr. McMenamin Mr. McMenamin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McMenamin</NameTxt>
      <P>It certainly does. This organisation is going to be granted a licence by this House.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McMenamin</NameTxt>
      <P>Apples are also going to be sold in Store Street.  I would ask the Minister to look at this thing in a broad way and see that the portion of the building which is to be licensed for the sale of intoxicating drink will be structurally separated from the coffee rooms or restaurant. I have not been inside the building, but I am anxious to ensure that the travelling public who go there and want to get drink will be served in a place that will be structurally separated from the portion of the building frequented by the general public.  I do not want to have the general public annoyed by drunken or half-drunken people.  They should be able to get their coffee in peace.  I am not opposed to the provision of reasonable amenities for people who want to get a drink, but I can see the problem that may arise from the conduct of this place.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PeadarCowan" hpid="Captain Cowan Captain Cowan">
      <NameTxt>Captain Cowan</NameTxt>
      <P>There is a bigger problem than that.  You should have buses for sober people and buses for people who take a few drinks.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DanielMcMenamin" hpid="Mr. McMenamin Mr. McMenamin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McMenamin</NameTxt>
      <P>We are already providing, out of our earnings, the ammunition which keeps the buses running.  I would ask the Minister to <Col N="1892" /> look into this again as distinct from what is provided in the Bill.  In my opinion, this Bill is too broad.  I am prepared, and I suppose the House is prepared, to give the Minister a reasonable measure for the provision of amenities for the travelling public.</P>
      <P>I do not want what occurred in the case of Collinstown to happen again. I do not want to see the Minister committed to the making of a statement here, and then the moment it is made to have the whole place flooded by the people to whom authority is given.  I think this House should not be treated in that way and that it should not allow itself to be treated in that way. If it does, then anything is too good for it.</P>
      <P>These people will go to the Minister and, across a table in his room in Government Buildings, will say: &ldquo;Oh, that will be all right; we will not do that at all.&rdquo;  The Minister will say: &ldquo;All right, we will let it go that way.&rdquo; But the moment they get the power they will immediately snap their fingers at the undertaking which they had given the Minister and at the confidence which the Minister had put in them, and will completely ignore it.</P>
      <P>For these reasons I think the House should insist that a provision is put in this Bill to ensure that the terms of it will be rigidly enforced, and that this place will not be flooded by a company that gets a monopoly from this House under, I will not say, deliberately false pretences, but still false pretences.  I think it is a cruel thing for anybody to come to this House and seek special powers which are only given as a limited privilege and then, the moment they get them from the Minister, take advantage of that privilege. They do that the moment the Bill is enacted and the Minister is made a cod of.  I do not want to see any Minister of this State made a cod of by anybody, at home or abroad.  That treads on my corns immediately.  I am asking the Minister to protect himself.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As I have said, I have no interest in this thing at all.  We are dealing here with people who have already been given a monopoly which they are rigidly enforcing.  I have no particular objection to their getting powers but, <Col N="1893" /> when we are dealing with them, let us see that we take steps to protect the people against whom they are entering into competition.  They allow no competition themselves.  Is it not our duty as public representatives to see that they do not crush out poor people who are eking out an existence in that area, and who have to pay tax to maintain this monopoly?  Surely, that is a fair thing to ask.</P>
    <P>In asking that, we are not doing an injustice to anybody.  It is our duty to see that justice is done between all sections of the community, and particularly the poor and the weak&mdash;the constituents of Deputy Cowan.  I abhor that advantage should be taken in this House to give statutory effect to the destruction of the livelihood of these poor people.  I repeat I am the last person in the world who would object to reasonable amenities for the travelling public.  They must have these facilities and they will get them somewhere.  Therefore, the House is not acting illogically in providing amenities for the travelling public but it should be the travelling public. These licensed premises should not be allowed to be turned into a brawl shop with everybody congregating in it. The management and control of these premises would be a very onerous task and it would take a very efficient person to cope with the conditions under which he would work.  No matter how efficient he would be he would have great difficulty in conducting it in an orderly way.  I am picturing myself as the manager of this place with hundreds of people half-intoxicated rushing into this place.  We must remember that the very livelihood of the poor manager is dependent on this; if anything happens while some of these people are on the premises it may result in his losing his position.  Anybody who knows anything about this matter will realise that in practice we are going to create a problem and that perhaps we will have to come back some day and undo some of the things it is purported to do under this Bill.</P>

      <P>Yes, with a connecting door.  There are Deputies here who have frequently travelled into both of them, but who never saw there a drunken man or anybody under the influence of drink.  It might be different in Donegal; we southern people have a bit of sense in that line.  He will also see, if he travels by rail, a bar on every train the whole way down for fear they would become dry on the road.  The Pullman is there also for the supply of tea or any refreshments required.  I have never seen in my travels any of these hard-drinking men who have been described by Deputy McMenamin.  Apparently Deputy McMenamin is one of those who have an inferiority complex.  I notice all his speech has been devoted to the travelling public.  He has the same idea as both Front Benches seem to have, that the country boy is not to be trusted unless he comes to Dublin for a drink.  I expected when I saw another Intoxicating Liquor Bill being brought into this House that it would contain provision for clearing out of the way an Act which is against the Constitution of the State.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Corry</NameTxt>
      <P>I am suggesting to the Minister that this Bill should contain something to remove a blot on the Constitution which guarantees equal rights for all citizens.  We have in our licensing laws an Act which allows a Dublin jackeen to go out of one door on a Sunday, walk in the next door sit down there for three or four hours, walk out for another hour and come back again.  That is the law for one section of the community in this country.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Corry</NameTxt>
      <P>I am suggesting the Bill before the House should be enlarged and that the first step in regard to legislation dealing with intoxicating liquor should be to remedy the wrong that has been done.  Deputy McMenamin seems to have the same view as the Minister, that the country boy cannot be trusted.  His whole speech was an attack on the country people <Col N="1896" /> who would go in and have several rounds of drink.</P>

      <P>Before he passes this legislation, the Minister should enlarge it and give the ordinary countryman an opportunity to get a drink on Sunday without having to go three miles for it.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Corry</NameTxt>
      <P>My argument is that it should not contain provisions to give further facilities in this city while no improvement is made in the outrageous condition of affairs throughout the country.  I have seen Deputies on both sides of the House carry out the same injustice before.

      <P>I have read over the Bill very carefully.  It does not appear to give us any details of the nature or extent of the proposed licence for the sale of intoxicating drink at the bus station.

      <NameTxt>Mr. O. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>We should also be given an idea of the proposed opening and closing times at Store Street.  Is this to be a 24-hour licence, continuous during the round of the clock?  When the Minister presents the House with a Bill of this kind asking us to give him power and authority to issue a certificate on which the Revenue Commissioners shall grant a licence for the sale of drink at a bus station, more details of the licence should be specified in the Bill.  In the course of his remarks introducing the Bill, the Minister failed to satisfy a number of Deputies as to the extent of trading under the proposed licence.</P>
      <P>First and foremost, I want to object very vigorously and very strongly to this.  We have heard much of Store Street and we have been listening to it on the lips of members of this House over a long number of years, and we have now reached the stage when Store Street is to be turned into a licensed premises.  It was originally intended to be a bus station.  We now find that it is the offices of the Department of Social Welfare, the offices of the Minister, the bathroom of the Minister; and we see now that it is also to be a licensed premises.</P>
      <P>Further, according to my reading of the Bill, the sale of drink can be in any part of Store Street.  What guarantee have we that, in accordance with the Bill, in the offices of the Minister for Social Welfare we will not have the sale of intoxicating drink?</P>

      <P>Section 4 says that the Minister, if he thinks it proper that the licence should be extended or transferred to another part of the omnibus station or to cease to apply to any part of the station, may issue to the board a certificate approving of the alteration.  That Section 4, according to my limited intelligence, means that if the Minister for Justice so desires he can authorise the sale of drink in the offices of the Minister for Social Welfare.</P>

The ordinary publican's premises includes his out-offices&mdash;and they are valued in accordance with that idea.

Section 2 says that the Minister, if he thinks it proper that an on-licence should be granted to the board in respect of any particular part of the omnibus station, may issue to the board a certificate approving of the grant of the licence. It further states in sub-section (2) that the Revenue Commissioners shall grant the licence on presentation of the certificate to them.

      <P>Licensed premises adjacent to Store Street will be seriously affected as a result of this measure.  Travellers who would normally seek refreshment in adjacent bars will now have a bar available to them on the premises in Store Street, to the detriment of local trade. Deputies who represent that constituency know that the valuations have been increased in that area and owners of licensed premises have now to pay more for their licences for drink and tobacco, with higher rates and higher electricity charges.  This Bill will cause serious damage to them because it will affect the livelihood of business people in the area.</P>
      <P>I object to the manner in which the Bill gives power to the Revenue Commissioners to issue a licence on presentation of a certificate from the Minister.  The Circuit Court should have some say in this matter.  Assuming there are objections to the granting of this licence, under what sections of this Bill can an objection be raised? To whom can the objectors make their objection?  Assuming there are complaints that the premises are not properly conducted and that they are frequented by rowdies until 3 o'clock, 4 o'clock and 5 o'clock in the morning &mdash;if there is a 24-hour licence&mdash;someone should be in a position to object to that and machinery should be available for the hearing of such objections. I think the Circuit Court is the proper authority before which to make objections and the decision of that Court should be upheld.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is wrong for the Minister to come in here with special legislation for the purpose of granting facilities to a new political concern in which the Government has a very major interest.  The next thing we will have is the Minister coming in with a Bill to make the reconstructed <Col N="1901" /> premises in Dublin Castle a licensed premises.  After that we will have a Bill to license the National Stud, followed by a Bill setting out different regulations for licensing An Tóstal.  A line must be drawn somewhere. Ample facilities are already available in this area.  If this licence is granted I hope the facilities available will be confined to travellers.</P>
    <P>Will this licence have to be renewed each year or will the one licence be granted in <i>sxcula sxculorum?</i>  We are not told under any section of this Bill whether the licence will expire at the end of 12 months.  A concern of this kind should not have more facilities available to it than the ordinary citizen has available to him.  Business houses in the area will be very seriously affected.  Not only that, but we are told now that in another part of this premises confectionery, sweets, apples and oranges, etc., will also be on sale.  That, too, will affect local business premises.  In a sense, I am not one bit sorry for the majority of the traders in that district, because they thought they would never see this Government back quick enough in order that Store Street would be available as a bus station and, for that reason, they helped this Government financially.</P>

      <P>I believe there was an undertaking given to certain publicans that there would be no licence provided for Store Street, and because of that undertaking certain financial suppórt was forthcoming from that district for the present Government.  We know the Government have secured office by giving undertakings such as this and we know that they have failed to honour their undertakings.  Once more, they are failing to honour the undertaking given to the traders in that area.  A definite undertaking was given by the Minister's Party that there would be no licensed premises or shops in this particular structure.  The Government has now changed its mind to the detriment of the business people in that area.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1902" /> With regard to premises demolished by local authorities I hope the county manager will consult with the respective local authorities in that matter. In Section 6 it is stated that:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;A local authority may, if they think fit, issue to any person a certificate...&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I think it should be specifically stated in the Bill that it is the local authority that should deal with this matter and not the county manager.  In most cases the county manager acts as the local authority.  He has got the most extraordinary powers and these powers are coming into conflict daily with the general public and the elected local authority.  In a case of this kind I think the elected representatives of the particular local authority should have some say with regard to the issue of the certificate.  In the case of the granting of a cinema licence it is the elected representatives who advise the county manager and the county engineer in relation to the granting of such licence.</P>
    <P>The Cinematograph Acts provide that the local authority should have the renewal of licences in the case of cinemas.  In respect of the issue of certificates by the local authority, as provided in Section 6 of this Bill, the elected representatives should have some say.  Although the certificate may be issued by the county manager it should be on the recommendation of the elected representatives.</P>
    <P>As Deputy Keyes has pointed out, a number of injustices exist and certain sections of this Bill attempt to remedy them.  The Minister was right in introducing legislation to remove genuine grievances such as exist in Limerick and other districts.</P>
    <P>I would urge upon the Minister the importance of having the opinion of the local authority, by which I mean the elected representatives, apart from the personal opinion of the county manager.  In most cases the county manager is advised by his engineering staff or by the medical officer.  There is complete disregard for the common-sense and sound opinion of the elected representatives who have intimate knowledge of local conditions.  The <Col N="1903" /> request that it should be specified in the Bill that it is the elected representatives and not the county manager who should issue this certificate is, in my opinion, very reasonable.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJDavern" hpid="Mr. Davern Mr. Davern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Davern</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Flanagan need have no fears about all the rooms in Store Street being licensed.  One of the first matters in respect of which the Revenue Commissioners must be satisfied is the specific rooms proposed to be licensed.  These rooms and only these rooms can be used for the purpose of supplying and consuming intoxicating liquor.</P>
      <P>The Deputy seems to be worried because the Revenue Commissioners have the granting of this particular licence.  It is the Revenue Commissioners who grant every licence.  A judge or district justice cannot grant a licence.  They can issue a certificate which is sent to the Revenue Commissioners who grant the necessary licence.</P>
      <P>I am one of the people in this country who feel that we have enough licensed premises.  In this particular instance I think a special case can be made but I sincerely hope that we have come to the last of the special cases.  In the British days, in 1902, they seemed to think there were sufficient facilities for the consumption of drink in this country.  I cannot discover any great reason for further extension of licensed houses. The owners of existing licensed premises are able to meet the needs of the community.</P>
      <P>I would like the Minister, if at all possible, to confine the consumption of intoxicating liquor at Store Street to the travelling public.  There are many other people housed in Store Street. It would not be right that the licensed portion of Store Street should be open to the people who work there.  The Minister should consider that matter seriously.  Just as the licence granted to C.I.E. in respect of other places is confined to the consumption of drink on the premises by the travelling public, the Minister should give an assurance to the House that that will be the case at Store Street.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1904" /> The House has been told about the dangers that may accrue from the fact that local authorities are given powers under Section 6 of this Bill. We are told that corruption may creep in in the matter of deciding that a particular premises should be demolished and a substitute house erected in a more populous area.  If there could be even a remote danger of any personal or political spite or, on the other hand, favouritism in this matter the Minister should undertake microscopic examination of this Bill with the officials of his Department and his best legal advisers to make certain that this Bill will not in any way make it possible for members of a local authority, county managers or anybody else, either through favouritism or spite, to enhance the business of any person or persons.</P>
    <P>It would be a very bad thing if members of a local authority were the deciding factor in this case.  It is much better that it should be the county manager, who would not be so intimately associated with the licensed traders concerned.  Everybody knows that in small towns&mdash;in the City of Dublin it may not apply to such an extent&mdash;there is an element of friendliness or favouritism on one side and, on the other side, petty spite.  I ask the Minister, therefore, to ensure that members of a local authority will not have any say, whatsoever, in a decision as to where a new building should be situated, and, above and beyond all, to ensure that this Bill will not open the gate to further applications for new licences.  We feel that we have enough.  The travelling public are fully entitled to have a drink in Store Street but I feel the Minister will ensure that Store Street will not become just an ordinary licence.  The licensed traders in the area need have no fears because what they lose on the roundabouts they certainly will make up on the swings.  Again I appeal to the Minister to make certain that this Bill is not in any way going to open the door to any person desiring to have a new licence in the future.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnCarew" hpid="Mr. Carew Mr. Carew">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Carew</NameTxt>
      <P>Speaking for Limerick City, I am very glad that my colleague, <Col N="1905" /> Deputy Keyes, has already given his views on this Bill and I also want to say that I welcome it.  I would further say that we in Limerick Corporation are grateful to the Minister for introducing this Bill as it affects the local authority.  For a number of years past it has been a very vexed question for us in Limerick.  As is generally known, the housing programme in Limerick has been pushed much faster, I think, than in any other part of the country.  For that reason certain areas of the city had to be demolished and acquired by the public authority.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It has from time to time been a very serious and troublesome matter for us in the council when we are confronted with the situation where people had established businesses, inherited in a number of cases, and the first question asked us was, were we going to take away their livelihood.  We had to come here to the Minister from Limerick Corporation, and we came to him at that time with a request that he would introduce legislation so as to permit a local authority to transfer licences that came in the way of housing development.  He has very kindly and generously met our demands in that respect.  I wish to thank him for it, because we have at the present time a housing scheme in Limerick in which there are three public-houses and while all the other houses around the area have been abolished the plans of that housing scheme have been more or less held up until this legislation comes along.  I am very glad to see that on all sides of this House there is a feeling that it is necessary to have legislation that will be needed from time to time.  The present Minister and other Ministers had requests from local authorities of a similar nature to what we had in Limerick and the Minister had no power whatever to meet them. The result is that in Limerick City for the next few years we will be confronted with a number of cases of this kind. I take it that it is not the intention that under this Bill there will be any new licences granted.  It means the transfer of existing licences to houses <Col N="1906" /> built on the particular site by the local authority.  If that Bill was not brought in and if certain business houses had to be demolished and the people concerned had to accept compensation offered it would just mean depriving them of their livelihood and the compensation was not at all adequate. As far as the people in Limerick are concerned they are accepting the transfer of the licences under this Bill. I wish to say that we members of the corporation in Limerick were pressed by the licensed trade in Limerick for this Bill at the start but for some reason or other they did not favour it later on.  Perhaps they have good reasons, and reasons have been given here this evening as regards Store Street.  I would be in sympathy with the licensed trade, and I am sure the Minister is too, that Store Street should not interfere with existing licences.</P>
    <P>We must not at all encourage the State or any public authority to deprive people of their private means of living, and in so far as Store Street would interfere with the licensed trade in the area I would like the Minister to consider that aspect of the situation seriously because he can do so, I am sure, by restricting the hours in which intoxicating liquor can be had, and perhaps in some other way, so as to meet the position of the traders in that area.  Some of those traders, I take it, probably have not been there very long and may have purchased their premises at very high cost, and if the Store Street area should in any way be interfered with then I would ask the Minister as far as possible to try to meet that situation.</P>
    <P>On the whole I take it that this Bill is necessary and that it is going to serve its purpose in the cities and towns, particularly in the cities, and I welcome it for that.  Not to be repeating myself, I do appeal to the Minister in connection with the private interests of publicans who may be affected by the licence granted to Store Street that he will as far as possible meet their case.</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>On that last point, I think that Deputy Cowan made the <Col N="1907" /> case very well.  My personal opinion is that the fact that a new station the size of the bus station, Áras Mhic Dhiarmada, has been erected in the neighbourhood and brought some 700 or 800 civil servants into the area, and that crowds of people will be going on the buses, means, I am perfectly certain, that thousands of people will make purchases in the Store Street and Talbot Street area who formerly made their purchases elsewhere.  I have no doubt whatever about that. Those who have had their valuations increased as a result of the erection of whatever alternations may have been made in anticipation of increased trade will, I think, find that they will not be disappointed.  That particular area will become a very good business area.</P>
      <P>So far as the bar is concerned, there is not going to be all that throng there in Store Street.  There will be plenty of public-houses around, and on their way down some people will say: &ldquo;We will call in here; there will be too many at Store Street, and we will have a drink on the way down.&rdquo;  Others will say when they get to Store Street: &ldquo;There will be too many in the bar, and we will go out and have it on the way to town.&rdquo;  That is all I need say about that.</P>
      <P>I think that if it had not been for some of the lobbying that took place here last evening there would not have been a bit about it.  That is my firm opinion of the position.  I am very glad that Deputy Carew and Deputy Keyes have borne out what my recollection was with regard to the position in Limerick.  My recollection was that when I met the deputation from Limerick I was assured at that time that the licensed trade were in favour, so I was amazed afterwards to find that they were not, and I came to the conclusion that there was pressure brought to bear on them by the organisation in Dublin to oppose the Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This is a simple Bill.  It is not going to restrict business to the travelling public.  There is no question of that. People calling there to see somebody off can have a drink during the same hours as in a public-house.  The bar <Col N="1908" /> will have to be closed at the hour that it is closed in Dublin, but it is not going to be restricted to the travelling public, and it would be practically impossible to do that.  There is no good in passing legislation that we would not be able to enforce, and no attempt is going to be made to confine it to the travelling public.  It will have an ordinary licence.</P>
    <P>I think there is no point in what Deputy Davern said, and I am surprised that he makes the suggestion. So far as I know about those demolition orders, if the local authorities want to go ahead with a housing scheme and they mean to demolish some building, I am not quite certain, but I think that they must get the consent of the Minister for Local Government before they can go ahead.  I think that there is no likelihood of that happening at all.</P>
    <P>The question has been raised about what portion of the building in Store Street will be licensed.  That will have to be submitted by the Minister for Industry and Commerce. He will have to state quite definitely what portion of the premises in Store Street is to be licensed and that will be the only portion that will be licensed.  The idea of saying that it will be extended to other parts of the building is ridiculous.  It is laid down quite clearly in the Bill that it is the portion of Áras Mhic Dhiarmada which comprises the bus station.</P>
    <P>Section 2 of the Bill states that an on-licence may be granted&mdash;that is, a licence to consume drink on the premises during the hours covered by an ordinary licence.</P>
    <P>Deputy Keyes and Deputy Cowan dealt with every point that could have been raised.  I must say that I appreciate the action of Deputy Keyes and Deputy Carew.  It would be rather hard on me if I had to defend that, without the House being made aware that it was at the request of the elected representatives of Limerick City that I decided to bring in this Bill.  I appreciate the action of both of these two Deputies in saying openly in this House that they came to me and asked me to do it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. D.J. O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>When the debate on this Estimate was adjourned yesterday evening, very little remained for me to say on it.  One particular innovation in recent times was distinctly interesting to many thousands of listeners in this country.  I refer to the engagement of some of our first-class actors in Dublin for an historical sketch commemorating the memory of Robert Emmet.  I believe that if we had more items of that nature we would wean many people away from the lighter types of amusement.  They would take a greater interest in drama and educate themselves in the important historical events of our nation's history.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On the subject of music generally, I was somewhat concerned by, I will say, a very slight reference in the Minister's introductory speech.  He said that, as a result of a popularity test, it would appear that American music is particularly popular with listeners in the country.  I would ask the Minister, before accepting the opinion that he may take from any such popularity test, to consider the matter carefully. <Col N="1910" /> You will have a number of fanatical enthusiasts for one kind of music or another.  These people will go to the trouble of filling in the various forms and returning them and making their opinion known.  There are also magazines which cater for that type of person and which publish letters written by them&mdash;letters in which they make known their desire that Radio Éireann would devote practically all its broadcasting time to the type of music which they desire to hear.</P>
    <P>I am sure the House will agree that that would be an extremely regrettable development in our wireless broadcast ing system.  The amount of time devoted in our sponsored programmes to that type of music should be sufficient to satisfy the needs of those people.  We do not feel that they should be left out of consideration but it is an undoubted fact that other facilities are also afforded to them.  This House gave considerable relief in respect of the tax on dancing, and so forth.  Those people have all these facilities for hearing the type of music they like to listen to.</P>
    <P>In my view, we should give more consideration to the old people in their homes, to the people in institutions and to the ordinary worker who may not ever sit down and write a letter to anybody indicating what he or she regards as suitable entertainment.  The radio may mean vastly more to those types of persons than a little part of the pleasure which enthusiasts derive from listening-in to the American type of music.  In that connection, I think we should commend both our orchestras and, in the way of popularity, our light orchestra, which is comparable with any light orchestra in these islands and which makes many people enthusiastic to hear that type of music from our own radio station.  If possible I think even more time should be devoted to broadcasts by that orchestra.</P>
    <P>I endorse the appeal made by Deputy O'Donnell that some type of liaison should be developed between the Department for Post and Telegraphs and the Department of Education to see in what way we can facilitate the <Col N="1911" /> education of our children in the school with the help of the radio.  So far, we have not made any progress in that direction.  Surely it is a matter which is worth considering.  We feel that the radio is an excellent medium for educating children on many aspects of education that may not come within the province of the teacher.  There are many things which we think would be desirable.  Take, for instance, the subject of civics.  It would be easy to arrange that some competent body would broadcast a lecture that would be of interest to the young people in our schools.</P>
    <P>We should not be chary in making use of our broadcasting system in the matter of adult education.  I think we should give our workers&mdash;whether they be industrial workers, workers on the land or people working in shops, and so forth&mdash;something in the way of adult education on our radio.  In the past few years, a wonderful development has taken place in the South of Ireland in the way of lectures.  Many of our industrial and agricultural workers have graduated from these classes and are taking a great interest in education. I think we should make use of our broadcasting system to advance adult education.</P>
    <P>Many of the Deputies who have spoken have referred to television. One or two who spoke said they felt that, technically, much was left to be desired in the field of television and that we should not interest ourselves in it until a higher standard had been reached.  I do not think that that is a very fair viewpoint.  If more progress has to be made in that medium, I think that, as it progresses, we should take a more active interest in it. From time to time, we pay lip-service in respect of the flight from the land, to the need for brightening up life in our countryside and providing the people there with facilities which they have not got and which may attract them away from the rural areas.  If it should become possible in the course of a decade or so to bring to those people the amenities which many of their brothers and sisters are enjoying in <Col N="1912" /> another country, we will brighten the life of our rural folk who have not the facilities for enjoyment which people in our cities and towns have.  It is possible that a very large expenditure would be involved, but at least let us investigate the matter and get some estimate, as it becomes available to us, of what it would cost to give our people some enjoyment in that sphere of entertainment.</P>
    <P>Deputy O'Donnell suggested that this was a matter on which it might be possible for the Governments of the Republic and the Six Counties to cooperate. In recent years, we have found several matters on which we could reach agreement and, quite possibly, this may be still another step towards surmounting the obstacle of the Border.</P>
    <P>It has also been suggested that we make use of foreign services to publicise our anti-Partition propaganda.  A few years ago, it was thought that the only medium left to us in the way of radio propaganda was the short-wave transmitter, but I note from the Minister's speech that he sees very little hope in that regard, due to the already overcrowded condition of the short-wave band.  That is, of course, a fact, and I feel that a very short period on some American network might be far more valuable than considerable expenditure on more extensive short-wave broadcasts which people abroad may never receive.  We want to convert those who have no faith in the ideas we believe in, and information conveyed by short-wave would reach only those who are extremely enthusiastic and already converted.</P>
    <P>I note with interest that the Minister included in his survey a reference to the acquisition and putting into operation of high frequency apparatus in relation to the broadcasts of various sporting events.  It would appear that the apparatus employed in recent years was not such as to make it possible to get a true picture of what transpired at these events and we get a distorted idea of the happenings at them.</P>
    <P>I had the experience of being rather close to the operator at one of these sporting functions, a sport peculiar to <Col N="1913" /> the part of the country I come from, bowling, and I know that it is extremely difficult to convey what happens at such events with the apparatus available up to now.  So many people try to get publicity by gathering around the person giving the broadcast that he is not in a position to convey a true picture of what transpires.  It will be interesting to see if the acquisition of this equipment will make it possible for us to get a better idea of what takes place at such gatherings.</P>
    <P>Finally, I want to take umbrage at the criticisms offered by some Deputies in their desire to further the interests of the type of programme they desire. In putting these criticisms, they were apt to throw brick-bats at some of the less cultured programmes on the radio. We must devote some time to giving satisfaction to the majority of our people.  One programme in particular was derided here last night, the &ldquo;Take the Floor&rdquo; programme, but I must say that I find, from speaking to people around the country, that that hour or so on Sunday is something they look forward to.</P>

      <P>Any rural part will get considerable enjoyment from listening to the vocalists presented in that programme and to the Garda céilí band.  The programme should at least be given a trial for a longer period.  I hesitate to refer to any particular programme because, in discussing this Estimate, we are apt to voice our own personal opinions, whereas it should be the object, as I am sure it is, of the broadcasting authorities to try to supply for all listeners a programme catering for all their tastes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am glad to note that a considerable advance has been made in relation to the broadcasts of the heavier type of music and of light music by our light orchestra.  The introduction of variety of a national character and the extension of the time for broadcasting are also very welcome, but I should like to ask the Minister to condense the news items somewhat and give a little more <Col N="1914" /> priority to matters which are of interest to the nation; to continue the topical talks recently introduced which are bringing to listeners a better appreciation of many news items and their effects on the country.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMcQuillan" hpid="Mr. McQuillan Mr. McQuillan">

      <P>The subject matter of this Estimate is a rather controversial one.  There are as many views on wireless broadcasting and on Radio Éireann as there are Deputies in the House.  Big differences exist inside the various political Parties with regard to the type of programmes that should be presented on the radio, and many Deputies have strong feelings with regard to particular programmes; but it is essential that an Estimate such as this should be discussed, as it is being discussed, to a great extent, in a non-Party atmosphere.  It would be a very bad thing to have a Party lineup in regard to it and I am glad to see that, so far, praise and criticism have come in equal proportions from both sides of the House.  Deputies are pretty well representative of all sections and, as such, they should all be free, irrespective of the Party whips, to express their views on wireless broadcasting and on the conduct and operation of Radio Éireann generally. I feel that there is an all-round improvement in the broadcasts from Radio Éireann, and I hope this improvement will be maintained.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With regard to propaganda on Partition, there has been a good deal of talk in recent years about the great use that could be made of a short-wave radio station to expose the evils of Partition and for general propaganda purposes in that regard.  While I am all for a strong line on the question of Partition, I feel that, when we have one means at our disposal, our present wavelength, we should make more use of it than we do for propaganda in connection with Partition. There is no use in Deputies saying that, if we had a short-wave station going, we could do miracles about exposing the evils of Partition.  The point is that, poor as the available facilities may be, we make very little use of them for this purpose, and any case that has been made for the short-wave station has not been strengthened <Col N="1915" /> by the example set so far in the use of the wavelength we have.</P>
    <P>Deputy O'Donnell last night made what I think is a pretty sound suggestion, that, if we have news on Partition to give to the American public, a good way of putting it across would be to have records of statements and discussions sent to some group in America from whom we could buy time for their broadcasting on the transmission system of some American station.  Even a limited period on one of these transmitters might be of more use, as Deputy O'Donnell stated, than beaming long harangues from a short-wave station.  I am sure there is no use in my labouring the point as no doubt the Minister himself will look into it.</P>
    <P>The next matter I should like to mention is the method by which news is presented.  I would say that if one listens to a news broadcast from Radio Éireann and then listens to a news broadcast from the B.B.C., it is very hard at times to distinguish from which station the news is actually coming.  It is only when one comes to the tail end of the announcements and gets some details of what happened in Cork last week or in Donegal this week, that one can be sure that it is an Irish news broadcast. What I am principally interested in in this connection is the slant given to the news items.  Reuter is generally the source of information for news broadcast from the B.B.C. but the news as broadcast by the B.B.C. has always a slant, in my opinion, that will suit British taste.  If anything goes wrong in some part of the world in which Britain is interested, you may be sure that in the presentation of that news item by the B.B.C. to the British people if the British position is not too healthy, so far as the news is concerned, the best side will be put out.</P>
    <P>I do not see any reason in the world why we, in our broadcast services, should adopt the same kind of presentation&mdash;in other words, accept the slant given by the B.B.C. in its presentation of the news.  There are many countries at the present time with which <Col N="1916" /> many of us here have great sympathy in their aspirations for freedom, and I do not like to hear on our broadcasting services a slant given, as it has been given on many occasions, in favour of what may be described as the aggressor in many cases, the British.  Consequently, I should like if we had a fresher approach.  Let us get a more neutral approach on the question of news items.  There is no need to tamper at all with the news itself.  That would be a terrible thing to do.  There is no need to suppress news, either, but at any rate let it go out in such a way that the public will be able to judge for themselves who is wrong and who is right in whatever particular episode or incident is under review.</P>
    <P>Another sore point arises in connection with the broadcasting of plays from Radio Éireann.  I do not want to say too much on this matter in this House because one has to remember that everything one says here is recorded for all time, and that can have its disadvantages on certain occasions. I, however, want to go on record as saying that the question of censorship in Radio Éireann is of very great concern to the general public.  There are in this country quite a number of people who would impose the heavy hand of censorship on a lot of items, reviews, plays, etc., that are at present coming across from Radio Éireann.  I do hope that the Minister and his Department will not allow themselves to be intimidated by this cranky, touchy, squeamish section of the community. I dislike having to say it, in one way, but I think it should be said that we have quite a number of very squeamish people in this country who would like to pretend to the world that we are different from every other nation.  There are a lot of people in this country who would like to paint the picture that we are just a little island of saints and scholars, but although we may have that record or merited that description in the past, it would be well to remind some of these people, so far as the saints and scholars are concerned, that the saints were not all scholars and the scholars were not all saints.</P>
    <P>I hope the Minister will not allow <Col N="1917" /> himself or his Department to be intimidated and as a result that we shall not have the production merely of insipid plays on the wireless suitable only to the outlook of a bunch of holy Marys.  There are plays at times that may shock people but these plays were written, to my mind&mdash;at any rate some of them were written&mdash;for the purpose of shocking the people into a sense of reality.  We have a lot of people here who lead very sheltered lives and they are horrified if, in listening to the wireless, they hear that there are people in the country who just do not have things as easy as themselves.  Some people are horrified when they hear on the wireless that there are drunkards, or even worse, in Ireland and they protest immediately that plays where drunkenness is exposed, are not suitable for the general public to listen to. I think that drunkenness and things like it are social evils and you cannot deal with social evils unless they are shown up.  One of the best possible ways of showing them up is to have the spotlight of publicity on them, to let people know these things happen.</P>
    <P>One of the purposes for which these plays are written is to bring home to sheltered sections of the community that some unfortunates are not as well off as themselves.  If these sheltered sections see through plays and books that things are not all well with the rest of the community, then they may be shocked into taking action to improve conditions.  If we have these bad conditions in existence, it merely means that there is something wrong in our social system and these plays are a great help in showing up the weaknesses in our social system.  As a result of such plays, public consciousness is awakened and something may be done about it.  That is one of the reasons why the Minister should insist that plays that are thought-provoking, intelligent and awaken public interest, even though at times they may sound rather rude to sheltered people, must be allowed to be broadcast.  If we are going to have a blanket of censorship imposed on us, then it is very easy for a person to turn the knob of the wireless and listen in to the B.B.C.  It is, therefore, waste of time for the critics <Col N="1918" /> I have mentioned to try to put across only one particular type of play.</P>
    <P>With regard to a number of debates that have been broadcast, very seldom have I the opportunity or the time at my disposal to listen to them but I have on occasions listened to discusssions on various subjects.  I do not want to be too critical but I had the feeling sometimes that the discussion was too pat, too slick and too full of old clichés.</P>
    <P>As a matter of fact, all the contributions that I heard were of the most nauseating type from the point of view of backbone and so on.  If people are allowed to talk and discuss matters on the wireless let them come out strongly if they so desire.  I do not know whether the discussions are pre-arranged affairs or not&mdash;I hope they are not&mdash;but if some people have strong views on particular matters I think they should be allowed to express them, no matter whom they may hurt.  Otherwise there is no benefit whatever in having these discussions.</P>
    <P>The idea of these discussions is to get people to think for themselves and to realise that there are other ways of life and other countries outside Ireland.  If we accept the position that only a few people in this country are to be allowed to think and to think for everybody else that will be a bad day for us.  The more matters of a controversial nature are discussed on the wireless the better for the people as a whole.  Some critics in this country must not have a very good opinion of the moral fibre and the intelligence of the Irish people if they insist at all times on protecting them. It would seem as if we cannot trust them outside the door.</P>
    <P>The extraordinary thing about it is that the cream of our population, the boys and girls who leave this country every year, are exposed to all the evils that these so-called critics would prevent them from listening to on the wireless broadcasting system and, instead of facing the conditions in Great Britain and America and other places with their eyes open and being aware of the evils and pitfalls that await them, they go like lambs to the <Col N="1919" /> slaughter.  If we are going to have a high wall erected around the country to shelter the few old decrepits that are left in it, I will not be a party to supporting any such move, whether through Radio Éireann or through censorship of other types.</P>
    <P>I read the Minister's statement and I noticed that he said that the percentage of those who listened in to the cultural and educational programmes is not unsatisfactory.  He thinks there is a tremendous interest in them.  He did not disclose what the percentage is, but said that it is not unsatisfactory. I wonder who decides that it is not unsatisfactory.  Has the Minister the deciding voice as to what is satisfactory or what is not?  That is a very big decision to take and certainly the director of broadcasting and his staff are not entitled to take on themselves the position of judge as to what is or is not a satisfactory position with regard to those who listen in to the cultural and educational programmes and the people who are fond of light music.</P>
    <P>The Minister went on to say that he was convinced that the future of An Tóstal and all Irish festivals depended on being able to offer the outside world an international forum for music and drama.  I have no criticism to offer on that.  I should like to say, however, that we should put first things first.  The Minister and the director of Radio Éireann have a difficult task, in the broadcasting hours at their disposal, to balance what we describe as light entertainment and cultural and educational programmes. It is a matter on which it will be very hard to satisfy the entire listening public.  As a matter of fact, it would be impossible.  If the Minister leans too much in one direction to meet the popular demand for light music and light programmes, then he brings down criticism on himself from those who are interested in symphony concerts. I can see that he is in a very awkward position.</P>
    <P>The reason I draw attention to his remarks about having a forum here for music and drama so as to attract foreigners is that I want to get this <Col N="1920" /> clear.  Supposing people come here from Austria and elsewhere and they attend a symphony concert in Dublin. When they find 50 per cent, of the orchestra is from their own country and they see Johnnie So-and-So from Vienna playing in it, they will say to themselves: &ldquo;This Tóstal affair we understood was to show us Irish-Ireland or Ireland at home: yet we have some of our own pals playing in the orchestra in an Irish programme.&rdquo; The difficulty we are up against is that to a great extent we are trying to copy other nations in everything that is being done to-day.  We are trying to do in a few years what possibly would take generations to bring about.  If we are to get people to take an interest in what I might describe as heavy music surely that will not happen overnight. Surely we are not going to get the adult population, whose main interest is listening to jazz and American music, to change their views.</P>
    <P>Therefore, instead of tackling the problem from the Dublin point of view, I want to get the Minister to consider this.  There is only one way you can get this type of education across and that is by getting at the youth.  If you train them to appreciate good music, then they will not forget it all their lives.  It is much better to postpone the hope of success until the boys and girls between ten and 15 grow up. There is one way of training these boys and girls and that is by having a wireless set in every school in Ireland.  It is not, perhaps, relevant to this Estimate, but it would be interesting to know how many schools in this country have a wireless set.</P>
    <P>I would like to add my voice to that of others in asking the Minister to get into serious discussion with his colleague, the Minister for Education, and to explore the possibility of having installed in every school in rural Ireland a wireless set.  Suitable programmes, both musical and otherwise, could be prepared so that youth at the age when they can absorb good music will be trained to appreciate good music and good programmes.  That would be a more practicable way of making the public music-conscious than talking about symphony concerts in <Col N="1921" /> Dublin that will be broadcast occasionally. As far as the listening public with whom I am familiar are concerned, very few listen to them.</P>
    <P>I do not want to be taken as trying to curtail the enjoyment of those who are anxious to listen to symphony concerts, but I would like a chance to be given to the younger people to get that training which would enable them to appreciate those programmes at a later stage.</P>
    <P>I think the ground has been covered already but I want to mention a matter in connection with television. I think the Minister in his statement said that television was inevitable.  Now that, to my mind, is an extraordinary way of describing what is one of the greatest benefits to mankind in recent years.  I was rather disappointed by the spirit of his approach to television because so far he has shown himself to be a man of vision and one with a certain amount of courage in criticism.  He can correct me if I have quoted him wrongly but I think he said that the coming of television was as inevitable as the coming of the motor-car.  If that is his view and if we start to argue that logically it would follow that, when the first tin lizzy came round the corner in this country, the people should have put off buying that until they could purchase the latest Hudson, the latest Ford Consul or Ford Zephyr.</P>
    <P>Look at the tremendous improvements which have taken place all down the line in the assembly, making and planning of the motor-car but that did not prevent people buying the motor-car when it came out because it was beneficial.  There will be improvements of a technical nature in television but if we take the initial step of preparing an estimate of what it would cost it would not mean that the television plant or installations would have to be scrapped if improvements were to take place.  It would only mean adjustments and changes in the installations.  It is the recorded opinion of experts on television that adjustments and so forth can be made and it would not mean a complete scrapping of the television installations.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1922" /> Are we waiting until the thing is going to be absolutely perfect?  Have we any guarantee that it is going to be perfect?  Every country in the world has television.  Are we waiting in the hope of getting television as cheaply as possible?  Seeing that we have such progressive views in many lines and choose to spend money rather lavishly on other developments, I think we should not hesitate at all to go ahead and explore the possibilities of putting television into operation within a very short space of time.</P>
    <P>I am not at all enamoured of the suggestion of co-operation with the Government of the Six Countries on the question of a television station.  If some of the Deputies who made that suggestion sat back and thought for a moment they would discover that earlier in their speeches they mentioned that one of the advantages of a short-wave radio station was to beam to America and elsewhere the terrible evils of Partition.  It would be thought a comical position to have Radio Éireann broadcasting the evils of Partition on the short-wave station while at the same time you had the two Governments setting up a television station here to broadcast unanimous approval.  I do not think it would be practicable.  It would not work out. I should much prefer that the Minister and the Department would go ahead and explore the possibilities of bringing television to this country as soon as possible.  I will finish by asking the Minister to show the same courage in tackling television as he has shown in tackling other pretty knotty problems in regard to the Department for which he is responsible.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJKeyes" hpid="Mr. Keyes Mr. Keyes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keyes</NameTxt>
      <P>I am prompted to intrude a few remarks by reason of Deputy Desmond's references to the utilisation of the Cork station.  I wish to see the further utilisation of the Cork station because of its availability to local contributors.  It is adjacent and available to a wide area in Munster.  I should like to see an extension of the local talent both instrumental and vocal.  The situation of Cork would suit those people very much because of the low standard of payment given to some of these people <Col N="1923" /> when they come to Dublin for a 15 or 20 minute engagement.  What with their travelling and general expenses there is very little, if anything, left of the fee they get for their services.  For that reason alone I should like to encourage a greater utilisation of the Cork station and I should like to see a wider range of local talent.</P>
      <P>We derived great enjoyment from the local competitions, particularly the singing competitions which have brought to light the latent talent of our country.  They have succeeded in giving us some interesting voices of which the country is justly proud.  I certainly derived great pleasure from listening to the runners-up and the general competitors.  I consider that the standard was very high indeed. There is a great deal of latent talent waiting to be developed and I think our national broadcasting system ought to give it fairly frequent opportunities of being heard over the air.</P>
      <P>Not only would I like to hear the singers but I should like also to have instrumentalists given an opportunity of being heard over the air, players of the flute, the violin and the uilleann pipes.  The latter seem to have disappeared almost completely off the Radio Éireann programmes.  The uilleann pipes are a nice, choice instrument with good historical traditions. Provided that players of the uilleann pipes have sufficient competence to pass a test they ought to be allowed to come on the air more frequently than they have in recent times.</P>
      <P>What I am going to say now is not intended to be a pun but for the love of Mike why not improve the reception from the Cork Station?  No matter how excellent a programme may be the reception from Cork is deplorable, and in some cases it is non-existent.  If the station were put into some kind of a decent state it would save a lot of sulphurous remarks and frustration in the end.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have one very unhappy recollection. On one occasion a Northern football final and a Southern hurling final were simultaneously relayed.  There was a crowd who wanted to hear the hurling <Col N="1924" /> match.  We tuned in, but reception was very bad and we dashed away in a motor-car to another radio-set which was a mile away only to find that the position was the same.  There were 30 or 40 people clamouring around.  One little boy with his ear to the set said: &ldquo;Cork has scored.&rdquo; Immediately afterwards he said: &ldquo;Tipperary has scored.&rdquo;  He was the only boy in that town who heard the relay of the hurling match between Cork and Tipperary. That is no exaggeration.</P>
    <P>The complaint with regard to the Cork station is not recent.  It is of long standing.  I have tuned in from Limerick, Clare and other counties but I have never tuned in from Cork.  I am told it is no better down there than in the surrounding counties.  I would seriously suggest to the Minister that if the station is to continue it ought to be put into a proper state of efficiency.</P>

      <P>I consider that from the point of view of clarity and delivery the reception I get from Radio Éireann is equal to the best that can be got from any other station in the world.  That is not so when one is tuned in to Cork.  The complaint in this respect is general.  There seems to be no serious attempt made to improve it.  I encounter some interference on Dublin and Athlone, but that is because some electrical gadget is operating in the neighbourhood.  When I tune in to Cork the reception is appalling.</P>
      <P>Is it because of some technical defect that the reception from Cork is so poor?  Whatever it is, I would ask the Minister to hold an inquiry into the matter and see what is wrong with the Cork station.  I am surprised that the Cork Deputies did not kick up about it themselves.</P>

I am just wondering whether what is wrong is due to myself or to the Cork Station. I would be glad if the Minister would have the matter inquired into.  It should not be beyond the capacity of the technicians engaged in his Department to correct it.  If they succeed in doing so, it will save a lot of frustration and annoyance at the other end of the line.</P>

      <P>I, like Deputy Keyes, propose to be very brief in what I have to say on the Estimate. I was not able to be here for the Minister's opening statement, but I read it with keen interest in the newspapers this morning.  As far as I am concerned, I want to say that I see nothing at all wrong with Radio Éireann.  I personally feel that it is giving very good value for money.  I should like to offer my little tribute to the Minister on the programmes which are presented. In my opinion they have improved considerably over the last 12 months.</P>
      <P>Some of us in this House are very sensitive at times as regards what comes over Radio Éireann.  It is true to say that it would be impossible to please everyone.  I should like to express my view as to what Radio Éireann is doing for us.  I think it is presenting as good programmes for us as those we get from the many stations which appear on the dial of our radio sets.  I should like to speak on this Estimate as one who takes a keen interest in music.  I speak as a lover of music, as one who has been studying music since I was being taught the piano at the age of six or seven years. Speaking with that experience, I think that the programmes which are given to us by Radio Éireann should, and must, suit the most fastidious tastes amongst us.</P>
      <P>We have the habit in this country of always decrying our own efforts where music is concerned.  I speak as one who knows music fairly well, as one who has spent many years trying to learn it and is still trying.  I want to say to the Minister: &ldquo;You are doing a good job with Radio Éireann at the present time.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1926" /> We hear a lot of criticism from time to time about some of the plays which are put across by Radio Éireann.  I see nothing wrong with them at all. They depict the Irish people as they are here at home.  We are very sensitive sometimes if something comes over which is not palatable to the extra-sensitive, or supersensitive, people amongst us.</P>

      <P>There may be something in it which I would not like.  As one who has been listening-in for many years to Question Time, I would like to say that I think the new Question Time is excellent, and &ldquo;excellent&rdquo; is the word that I select to describe it. I listen with intense interest to every bit of it, and I think it is quite good. What I did object to at Question Time, over the last eight or ten years, was that, when it came to adjudicating between certain people at half-time, the compére practically put the answer into the mouth of the person who was standing in front of the microphone.  I will not say that it was done deliberately.</P>
      <P>What I like about the present compére is that he is quick, sharp and musical, and that is really what we want.  There comes to you from him just what is inside your own brain. Whether it be a two, four or six mark question, the answer should be left to the persons standing in front of the microphone to do the best they can without any prompting.  That is what I like about the present Radio Éireann Question Time&mdash;that there is no prompting from the compére.  I think the programmes are excellent.  I would like to say that I enjoy the new Question Time very much indeed.  We hear some people criticise the programmes which are run under the name of that very popular gentleman called Din Joe.  I think that Din Joe is doing a great job of work.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Gorman</NameTxt>
      <P>He is not from Cork, anyway.  It may be, judging from the criticism we hear, that he is from West Cabra.  He has an excellent accent and <Col N="1927" /> I think that his programme is an excellent one.  After all, those of us who, perhaps, spent part of our holidays in our boyhood days in rural Ireland can well remember the dances on the cement floors in the cottages or in the farm houses.  Those were happy days.  I think that Din Joe is doing a great work in his popular programmes in resuscitating interest in, and bringing back to us, music with which we were familiar in our boyhood days.  I would like to say to the Minister that Radio Éireann is a good station and that it should be able to get anywhere.</P>
      <P>We have heard criticism of people with Oxford accents.  In my opinion, the elocutionary powers of the person who is supposed to have an Oxford accent are much superior to those of various speakers we hear from time to time over the radio from other countries.  I think that the elocution and enunciation of this particular speaker are almost perfect.  They are excellent.  I say that because I think it is only right to pay tribute where tribute is due.</P>
      <P>The only fault I have to find is with the reception.  Last year, when listening to the debate on this Estimate, I heard someone suggest that the reason for that might be the use of an old or obsolete set.

      <P>We get him all right. We find it very hard to get Radio Éireann any time we tune in from 9 p.m. onwards.  The reception from Radio Éireann may be all right for a minute or two.  You are enjoying its programme, and then, suddenly, you are punched by some powerful foreign station on your right or on your left, and you are squeezed out and completely cut out.  The annoying part of it is that from the station which cuts you out you have perfect reception and clarity.  The music on it is magnificent. In the case of Radio Éireann you are left like a Lilliputian, being squeezed in between two giants.</P>

      <Col N="1928" /> Deputy Keyes mentioned complaints that he had received about the Cork station.  I, too, have received complaints from parts of my constituency about that station.  I live in Youghal, which is only 30 miles from Cork. About last Christmas I got new sets into my two houses.  On one of them I cannot get Cork at all.  That seems a pity because Cork is a very musical city, and all Cork people are very musical. What I want to emphasise is that it seems a pity, in the case of a transmitting station situated within 30 miles of your home, that you cannot get the reception which you so much desire.  I should like to quote shortly from a letter which I received from a constituent of mine asking me to raise this matter on this Estimate and to bring it to the notice of the Minister.  The writer says that: &ldquo;It is a matter of considerable public annoyance down in this district each evening after 7 p.m. that Radio Éireann simply does not exist.  It is being completely wiped out by interference from powerful foreign stations.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>That is the point I have made already myself, that the Cork transmission is completely inaudible after 9 p.m.  It is something that I cannot understand.  I think I remember somebody saying some other year on the Estimate that this interference was due to some set behind the Iron Curtain which does not conform to any international law.  I should like to know from the Minister whether there is an international board that allocates a certain point to the various countries. It does seem a pity that Radio Éireann is being crushed out in this way when one is listening to a most enjoyable programme from the station. What I say is happening in my home town of Youghal and in various areas in East Cork.  I might say that there is perfect reception of the 9 o'clock news in the morning and of the 1.30 news.  In fact, there is perfect reception all day up to 9 at night, when the foreign stations seem to converge on us and cut out completely the programmes from Radio Éireann.  That, as I say, seems a pity.  I do not know really whether the Minister can do anything about that.  I was led to believe on previous occasions that he cannot. <Col N="1929" /> If, for instance, pirate stations send out programmes and if they do not conform to the international code of decency, the Minister cannot be blamed for that.</P>
    <P>Radio Éireann caters for all tastes. People who are fond of symphony orchestras are considered.  There is another point in regard to reception in my area.  If a Deputy is sick at home and wants to listen to reports at 10 o'clock, the reception is so bad at this hour that he may be completely cut out.  However, I believe that Radio Éireann is good value for the money.  They are sending out programmes to suit most people and I am glad to be able to admit that.  If the Minister could do something to make Radio Éireann more coherent to the listening public, I feel there would be no further complaints in the matter. Down the country there is a radio in almost every house.  Radio Éireann presents what people in rural Ireland want to listen to.  It is our own station.  We are proud of it, and I think the Minister is doing his best to improve it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnFinan" hpid="Mr. Finan Mr. Finan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Finan</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to join with other Deputies in complimenting the Minister on the improvements effected in Radio Éireann.  Everybody who listens in has recognised that improvement. However, I do not want the Minister to imagine that everything is now perfect and that he can sit back; I am sure the Minister himself would be the first to admit that there is vast room for improvement.</P>
      <P>I recognise the truth of what has been said by other Deputies, that no Minister will ever manage to satisfy all listeners.  That is an utter impossibility and I do not think it would be good if he could.  There are individual tastes which it would be impossible to satisfy on every occasion and I think I am safe in saying that the present board and the Minister are making an honest effort to cater for all tastes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do disagree, however, with the policy in relation to the presentation of drama.  Regardless of what has been said by others, I do not think the Irish race, as it is now at any rate, is being depicted in <Col N="1930" /> the drama put across by Radio Éireann.  It may be true to say that it would depict the Irish race of 100 or 200 years ago but not now.  Our country has advanced remarkably within the last 50 years and while it might not be a reflection on the Irish race to depict them as they did exist 100 years ago, I do not think that we need to perpetuate it.  In our boyhood days we often heard of the resentment of the Irish people at the manner in which Irish people were represented on the British stage.  We all heard about the stage Irishman as depicted in Britain.  Why should we try to do what we condemned the British for doing?</P>
    <P>I have heard plays from Radio Éireann even recently and I am quite sure&mdash;and I have been in every county in Ireland&mdash;they do not depict Irish life, as I know it, in any way, in the public-house, the dance hall, or the home.  They merely reproduce the stage Irishman as he was represented 100 years ago or even later.  The sooner we break away from that type of presentation the better.  I doubt if the authors of those dramas intended them to be interpreted in that way.</P>
    <P>I do not agree with the suggestion that there are Oxford accents on Radio Éireann.  I respect the Irishman who can speak the English language fluently and correctly.  It is a good thing to have on Radio Éireann people who can speak faultless English and that is what Radio Éireann has now.</P>
    <P>My approach to the question of drama is not that of Deputy McQuillan.  Deputy McQuillan thinks we should not hide our faults.  My view is that the plays presented on Radio Eireann are not a correct representation of the people here.  I do not think that some of the language we have heard in these productions reflects any credit on either the dramatist or the actor.  We can produce good Irish plays.  We can produce plays to which a man would not be afraid to let his family listen.  These are the plays we would like to have and it is to be hoped that in future we will not have the type of play which is merely a caricature of the Irish people.</P>
    <P>If there can be no justification for <Col N="1931" /> setting up a short-wave station other than to deal with the Border problem I do not think we should take this step. I do not want to refer to the Border on this Estimate except to say that when the people North and South of the Border understand each other the Border will go and not till then.  You can make a subject detestable and get on people's nerves by constant repetition.  If we were to produce over and over again details in connection with the Border, listeners would very soon turn to some other station.</P>
    <P>I feel we should have more sponsored programmes if it could be arranged. Apart from being a source of revenue they can be very interesting.  Some of the sponsored programmes are very entertaining.  In general I do not think anybody could find fault with the programmes on Radio Eireann.  There is one programme which might reasonably and humanly be expected to cause disagreement and that is the programme dealing with what happens in this House.  No Deputy on any side could, I feel, complain of the presentation of the activities in the Dáil.  Both programmes &ldquo;Today in the Dáil&rdquo; and &ldquo;The Week in Leinster House&rdquo;, are presented in a very impartial way.  I listen to these programmes regularly and I think everybody is perfectly satisfied with them.</P>
    <P>There is no reason why we should detain the Minister or the House on this Estimate.  It is not a contentious matter and what I have said is not by way of criticism.  I am merely making suggestions which may commend themselves to the Minister and to the body responsible for broadcasting in Radio Éireann.</P>
    <Speaker pid="OliverJFlanagan" hpid="Mr. O. Flanagan Mr. O. Flanagan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>Usually the debate on the Estimate for wireless broadcasting is one that passes with every speed.  It is only right that when the Minister presents this annual Estimate we should give it the closest possible examination, since it is an extremely important part of a Government service.  It is true that the number of licensed radio receivers <Col N="1932" /> has increased&mdash;whether it is that the number of listeners has increased or whether more efficient steps have been taken by the Department to collect the wireless licences, is another question.  No matter what praise we may have here for Radio Éireann, very few of our listeners listen to Radio Éireann while Radio Luxembourg is on the air.  They usually listen to Radio Éireann when they have nothing else to listen to.</P>
      <P>Radio Éireann is very far behind the times.  The only improvement in the service is the morning sponsored programmes from 8 to 9.  Most of the time the station is closed down.  I welcome the idea of extending the broadcasting times.  In regard to the lunch-time programme from 1 to 2.30, very many people in certain industries have their lunch-time from 2 to 3 and in many concerns there are relays of lunch.  Therefore, it would be wise to extend the lunch-time programme from 1 to 3.  Again, Radio Éireann is one of the few radio stations that closes down at 11 o'clock.  In country districts people are usually returning home from a chat at the cross-roads or a meeting or from outdoor business and arrive home between 10.30 and 11. If they are interested in Radio Éireann they are in time only for the sports commentary and the National Anthem.</P>
      <P>The station closes at 11 o'clock, except for the item &ldquo;To-day in the Dáil,&rdquo; when the time may be extended for ten or 15 minutes.  I am sure the Minister could arrange&mdash;and I doubt if the director of broadcasting would have any objection&mdash;to keep the station open until midnight.  I could never find what objection there was to doing that.  The B.B.C. and other stations can fill in a programme up to midnight; yet Radio Éireann must close down at 11 o'clock.  It would be wise if steps were taken to enable listeners to avail of the services up to midnight.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Everett very properly referred to the aliens employed by Radio Éireann.  I want to say this much in that connection, for the records of the House, for the records of the Minister and for the future information <Col N="1933" /> of everybody concerned&mdash; that if there is ever a change of Government and if I have any say either to or within that Government the first people who will go will be those foreigners employed in Radio Éireann. I want to dissociate myself entirely and completely from any hand, act or part in the provision of employment by Radio Éireann for those aliens brought in by the Minister and encouraged by the present director of broadcasting. It is against the wishes of the majority of the people who hold licences for radio-sets that these people should be employed in Radio Éireann.  It is disgraceful and improper. No Irish Government should tolerate the employment of aliens in preference to our own.  I would prefer a thousand times over to have no orchestra than to use the talents of those aliens brought in here entirely against the wishes of the Irish people. I want to make it very clear that it is not the wish of this side of the House that these people be employed there. If there is a change of Government they may understand that and may take this as notice to quit, as they will be the first people to be shifted and removed.</P>
    <P>I want to take this opportunity of paying a great tribute to the stand taken by the Labour Party in this respect.  It is only right that all of us who believe in extending fair play to our own, in seeing that Radio Éireann as far as possible is comprised of Irish nationals, should protest against those aliens being brought in here against the wishes of the members of this House and of the majority of the Irish people.  I fail to understand why the Minister has those people.  I fail to understand why, according as vacancies arise, no matter what part of the world they may come from, they will be put in receipt of a good wage, paid as a result of the Vote provided in this House from the taxpayers of this country.  I want to add my voice in expressing dissatisfaction, in expressing alarm and in expressing surprise; and in giving this note of warning, that as soon as there is a change of Government those people will be the first people listed for dismissal within 24 hours.  I have <Col N="1934" /> no apology to make to anyone for that statement.  I stand for their removal, as I think it is wrong to have them employed there.  They are causing grave dissatisfaction, not alone to public-spirited citizens but to every decent Irish taxpayer and ratepayer who has to foot the bill to pay for those aliens.  That is all I have to say on that particular issue, but I hope it will prove sufficient.  If an opportunity presents itself when more can be said on this matter, more will be said and possibly what has to be said will be reinforced with a little action.</P>
    <P>I do not altogether agree with the manner of appointing the director of broadcasting; neither do I agree with his tactics.  I would like the Minister to give the House some information in relation to one particular matter. Has the Minister seen the file of correspondence that passed between Mr. Eric Boden and the director of broadcasting?</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickHogan" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Patrick (Clare) Hogan">

      <NameTxt>Mr. O. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>Furthermore, I would like the Minister in the course of his reply to give us some idea of the communications that passed between Mr. Boden and Mr. Gorham.  From the information at my disposal I think Mr. Gorham excelled himself in reprehensible tactics.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickHogan" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Patrick (Clare) Hogan">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>I have already told the Deputy that he may not criticise the director.  He may criticise the Minister within the Rules of Order and relevancy.  The Minister is the sole <Col N="1935" /> person responsible to this House for what happens in relation to wireless broadcasting.  The director has no method of redress and for that reason it is doubly unfair to bring a personality into the limelight in this fashion.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="OliverJFlanagan" hpid="Mr. O. Flanagan Mr. O. Flanagan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>I challenge the Minister to publish the correspondence that passed between his Department and Mr. Boden when he comes to reply. Will the Minister tell us what notice Mr. Boden had of the ending of his Question Time programme?  Will he tell us what suggestions Mr. Boden put forward to his Department for improving that programme?</P>
      <P>Will he tell us what volume of correspondence was received in his Department from listeners in connection with this programme?  Will he give us the reasons for the hasty decision to suspend all programmes sponsored by Mr. Boden?  If the Minister does not give us that information, then I respectfully suggest that he must have some reason for keeping it from the public.  I understand that the Press phoned the Department and asked for information in relation to the correspondence that passed between the Minister's Department and Mr. Boden and that information was refused.  If the matter is above board and if there are no sinister reasons for the removal of Mr. Eric Boden from Radio Éireann, why the fear of publicity? Why not disclose the correspondence? Why was Mr. Boden put off the air? Who had fault to find with him? Where did the complaints come from? Was it the staff of the Minister's Department that found fault with him? Is it true that Mr. Boden was given instructions by one of the senior officers in charge of broadcasting to carry out the programme as the senior officer wanted it carried out?  I think it is grossly unfair for a man like Mr. Boden to be taken so short by the Radio Éireann authorities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The general public have rather suspicious minds and the fact that there was great haste and deep secrecy surrounding this matter has led people to believe that there were many reasons why this hasty action was taken by Radio Éireann.  On no <Col N="1936" /> occasion has the Minister referred to this matter.  Despite the fact that numbers of people have written to the Department asking for information, no information has ever been forthcoming.</P>
    <P>I do not know if the Minister was associated with Mr. Boden's case, but I think the tactics adopted were unworthy and uncalled for, and I would particularly like to know why Mr. Boden's removal was surrounded with such grave secrecy.  Why, within a very short space of time after the cessation of Mr. Boden's Question Time, was it replaced by Mr. Joe Linnane's Question Time?  Possibly his Question Time programme is a better one.  The people may find it more engaging, but I am left with the feeling that Radio Éireann authorities were in touch with Mr. Linnane before ever Mr. Boden was removed.  Is that a fact?  Are such tactics right?  Are they proper?  The ground was cleared for Mr. Boden was actually employed by Radio Éireann.</P>
    <P>The Minister is responsible for the activities of his Department and, from that point of view, he must shoulder the responsibility for the state of affairs that existed in connection with Mr. Boden's Question Time and his removal from the employment of Radio Éireann.</P>
    <P>I want to refer now to the programmes that are put on by Radio Éireann.  I think it is a disgrace that we should present on our national broadcasting station such a play as <i>The Playboy of the Western World.</i> Reference has already been made here to the programme entitled <i>Take the Floor.</i>  That presentation is a downright disgrace, for it does nothing except make a jeer and a skit of Irish country life.  Decent people refuse to listen to such rubbish.  <i>Take the Floor</i> is designed for no other purpose than to make a jeer and a skit of Irish country life.  As the Minister knows, Irish country life to-day is not as portrayed in that particular programme or in <i>The Playboy of the Western World.</i>  I hope the Minister will take steps to cut out this <i>Take the Floor</i> programme altogether in future.</P>
    <Col N="1937" />
    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy had better ask his colleague, Deputy O'Gorman, about that.</P>

    <Speaker pid="OliverJFlanagan" hpid="Mr. O. Flanagan Mr. O. Flanagan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy O'Gorman cannot take the programme off.  It is the Minister who is responsible.  If Deputy O'Gorman expresses an opinion of appreciation of that programme I am equally entitled to express my opinion of disapprobation. The programme is a disgrace.  It is disgusting, and the majority of the decent people in the country refuse to listen to it.  Radio Éireann has come down to a very low level, indeed.  I am not surprised at the Minister, but I am surprised at certain people who are influential in Government circles toleraating such a presentation as <i>The Playboy of the Western World</i> on Radio Éireann.</P>
      <P>In connection with these sponsored programmes, what money is made on these programmes?  I believe many concerns would like to avail of these for advertising purposes, but I am told the cost is prohibitive.  I have also been told that in certain special circumstances fees are reduced.  What are the qualifications necessary in order to secure reduced fees for a sponsored programme?  I should like to know what machinery the Department have for determining whether a particular concern will have a sponsored programme over Radio Éireann at a cheap rate or must pay the most they can possibly be charged.  There are many concerns who would advertise through the medium of Radio Éireann if the charges were more attractive.  I certainly agree with Deputy Finan that the sponsored programmes are the only programmes that are in any way attractive to the ordinary country listener.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Broadcasting of the news has been vastly improved since the arrangements were made within the past six or eight months whereby news is broadcast under the heading &ldquo;News from the Country&rdquo; or &ldquo;News from the Districts.&rdquo;  The ordinary country listener who tunes into Radio Éireann is not interested in what is happening in China, or Japan or the exchange of prisoners in Panmunjon but he is interested <Col N="1938" /> in what is happening in Mullingar, Cavan, Galway, Dublin. Radio Éireann is inclined to give world news rather than local news.  The listener in the Slieve Bloom Mountains is not interested in the conferences in Panmunjon or trials in Persia.  He is interested in local news and racing results.  The broadcasting authorities should be encouraged to extend their programme of &ldquo;News from the Districts.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The news broadcast in the morning seems to be more detailed and to give more Irish news than the news broadcast at lunch time or night time.  Those well advised to give more local news and to cut out a lot of continental and Far East news, in which listeners are not interested.</P>
    <P>I take this opportunity of paying a tribute to the person responsible for the broadcast of the news in Irish.  The language used is simple.  Those who have not a thorough knowledge of Irish but who have some knowledge of the language can understand it.  I do not know whether it is the announcers or those who prepare the scripts who are responsible, but whoever is responsible deserves a word of appreciation and thanks.</P>
    <P>A Deputy referred to the accents of the various announcers.  It is difficult to satisfy some people.  If the announcers speak with a flat accent, they will be criticised.  If they speak nicely they will be criticised.  It is difficult to know what some people want.  The people want an accent that they can understand.  The quicker the Oxford accent is cut out of broadcast announcements the better.</P>

At the conclusion of the programme one hears the announcement: &ldquo;Now you will have the weather forecast for farmers and fishermen.&rdquo;  How did they link farmers and fishermen? Many fishermen resent being associated with farmers.  Many farmers resent being associated with fishermen.  I should be glad if the Minister could indicate to the House the reason for this association.

      <P>The programme feature, &ldquo;To-day in the Dáil&rdquo;, gives a full, accurate and very fair account of the proceedings in this House.  I have listened very carefully to the programme and I cannot see that it has been linked with politics in any way.  It gives a fair report of Fianna Fáil speeches, Labour speeches and Fine Gael speeches.  I hope the programme will be continued along the same non-political lines as it appears to be travelling.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The feature, &ldquo;The Week in Leinster House&rdquo;, broadcast at 9.30 on Saturday night, for a long time did not smell too good but has become good within the past couple of months.  For a long time &ldquo;The Week in Leinster House&rdquo; was used simply to boost the present Tánaiste, his ability as a speaker, his ability as a Minister, his ability at this, that and the other.  Deputies who have listened to the programme <Col N="1940" /> since will realise that that was the case up to about two months ago.  I do not know what caused the change but for the past two months there has been a change.</P>
    <P>Up to about two or three months ago the Tánaiste's name was mentioned ten times for every time that a Deputy's name was mentioned otherwise.  I know very well that this was done with the object of trying to build up the Tánaiste to replace the Taoiseach, but I do not think that Radio Éireann should be allowed by the Dáil to do that.  It is going to take some building up to do that by any member of the Government and the Minister particularly, because only for the Tánaiste the Minister would not be Minister for Posts and Telegraphs.  Probably that is one of the reasons why every effort was made to boost up the Tánaiste in the broadcast of &ldquo;This Week in the Dáil&rdquo;.</P>

That I think was wrong and disgraceful, and I am glad that it has stopped. I do not know who stopped it, but the fact that it was stopped is very highly appreciated.

I warn the Minister that that type of codology will not last very long.  It has been found out and it is a bad policy and it is only open to very severe criticism, and criticism from supporters of the Government <Col N="1941" /> who dislike the idea of the Taoiseach's boots being filled by the Tánaiste.  I think it is wrong that Radio Éireann should be used for that purpose in the programme, &ldquo;This week in the Dáil&rdquo;.

      <P>I will pass on to the next point.  I do want to say as far as the programme.  &ldquo;To-day in the Dáil&rdquo;, is concerned that it is most impartial and gives a most detailed account without paying any regard whatever to the political affiliations of any Deputy.  I hope and trust that that programme will continue, even to greater length.  The only regret that people have about that programme is that they want it to give a more detailed account of the statements made by Ministers when introducing their estimates or Bills, and also to give a more detailed account of the observations made by Deputies of all Parties in that connection.</P>
      <P>With regard to political broadcasts such as we had before the last general election, I think it is a very good idea.  It is an idea that went down very well in the last two Budgets when we had the leaders of the various Parties expressing their opinions, and on occasions such as that those political broadcasts from the leaders of the various Parties should be undertaken.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not agree entirely with the idea that the scripts of the leaders of the various Parties should have to be submitted for close examination by the broadcasting authorities.  If we are going to have political talks over Radio Éireann and if one Party wants to make a thrust at another that is part of the political activities of that Party. It is wrong if any steps are taken by the director of broadcasting or by anyone <Col N="1942" /> in the Department to insist that the leader of any political Party must submit his script before he makes his appeal over Radio Éireann.</P>
    <P>With regard to television, we do not hear very much from the Government about it.  We do not hear whether they have any plans.  A question was asked in the Dáil by me lately, inquiring if representations had been received from the Six-County Government and asking that a conference be held with a view to both Governments co-operating with regard to the erection of a TV station.  The Minister replied that they had not, or were not. I know that I am not divulging a private conversation when I say that I have been speaking personally to a Minister of the present Six-County Government, who told me that from information he had&mdash;and I have an assurance from the Minister that I could use it in this House and that is why I am using it&mdash;there has been a move made by the Six-County Government asking for the co-operation of the Government of the Republic in making some plans and arrangements in connection with the erection of a television station.  The Minister stated quite recently that a television station was too important to have shared between two Governments.  There may be something in that, but I am sure that we have not reached the stage when, if we had a television station, we cannot have two programmes going from that station at the one time if it is necessary.  An estimate was given that it would cost something like £90,000 for the erection and equipment of a television station, and if the Six-County Government were prepared to contribute generously to that, as we have co-operated with them in the Great Northern Railway and also in the Erne scheme, I think that is a grand spirit and we should co-operate fully with them.</P>
    <P>In the Six-County Government you have as Ministers great and good Irishmen who love their country as much as and with greater love and fervour than some of the Irish Ministers we have sitting in this House. I want to pay that tribute to them. I want to pay tribute to the kindliness and courtesy and deep interest Mr. <Col N="1943" /> McCleery, when he was Minister, displayed in his visit here to Dublin and even when he visited the bogs also. That is a grand spirit.  It is the right spirit, a spirit of close co-operation and stepping together and working in the same manner like a team that will be good for this country and the people on both sides of the Border.</P>
    <P>I am very glad that the Great Northern Railway scheme and the Erne scheme have so successfully been concluded, and I would ask the Minister as far as possible to endeavour to get down to it with the Six-County Government and see what could be done about the erection of a television station.  Suitable sites were being mentioned&mdash;one in County Monaghan and another some place on the Cavan-Fermanagh border.  I hope and trust that if this correspondence is being exchanged between the head offices of his Department the Minister will intervene and as far as possible will encourage co-operation between the Six-County Government and the South of Ireland Government on the question of television.  If anything can be done, as television, I understand, takes time to plan, I would like to know what we are waiting for.  Television certainly is costly, but the Minister seems to think that if we have services in other parts of the world we are not to have those services here.  We cannot expect that if it cost £90,000 to establish a television station we are going to have one for half that or even at a reduced rate by waiting.  The question is this: are we going to have television in Ireland or are we not?</P>
    <P>Another question is: can we afford it?  The answer to that is that we cannot afford it, but we can afford it as much as we can afford any of our other social services.  Some time ago, early this year, I think in February, a London finance corporation, headed by an Irish-American, was given permission by the Irish Government to explore and plan television and after six months the company was to submit a conclusive report of its findings to the Department of Posts and Telegraphs.  The six months are now up and I would like to know what did it <Col N="1944" /> report.  We have not got any account at all from the Minister in the matter. We do not know what the report was. I would like to know if it is a fact that this London finance corporation, headed by this Irish-American, was given permission by the Government to hold such an inquiry.</P>
    <P>If so, what were the terms of reference of this inquiry that was to be held to explore the possibilities of a television service for this country?  Is it going to be left to foreigners and outsiders, I wonder, to step in and establish television here, or are the Government going to take any hand, act or part in it?  I think that the time has come when the Government should do something about this matter.  If the Minister does not think it worth his while to refer to it in this House, I hope he will write to me and let me know if they have got the report from the London finance corporation, headed by this Irish-American, that was given the permission of the Government six months ago.  Have they yet got the report and, if so, what were the findings? Have the Government considered the report, and with what result?  The man in charge of it was a Mr. Charles Sweeney, a high executive of the Federated Trust and Finance Corporation Limited.  Several inquiries have been addressed to Mr. Sweeney about the position.  Was any report on television submitted to the Irish Government?  Mr. Sweeney has at all times refused to make any comment on the matter.</P>
    <P>People may say that television is not of any great importance at all.  In my opinion, television is the greatest achievement to date.  It would be a very great pity if we were deprived of the service of television.  It can serve this country from very many angles.  I hope that some steps will be taken to encourage television in this country. We hear a lot of criticism from time to time of films that are unfit for children and films that deserve the blue pencil of the film censor.  A lot of the difficulties that arise with regard to unsuitable films would be solved if we had television.  Everybody is well aware of the wonderful influence of television.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1945" /> I can refer to a statement by a Father Raymond Pickard, a director in Paris of the International Catholic Association for Radio and Television. He says that television is a most powerful aid for the work of the Church.  He reports that television clubs have been organised in many parishes in France where one set is made to serve the people.  Here is another very important quotation, which was made by the Very Rev. Paul Reynard, President of the St. Louis University.  He says that television is the most powerful force available, if properly used, for elevating the intelligence and taste of the people.  It would be unfortunate if we were backward in that respect.  The Government may be wasting very valuable time by waiting.  If we are to have television, let us make up our mind about it.  So far as cost is concerned, we cannot afford any of the services that we have at the present.  In my view the question of television should be tackled.</P>
    <P>I want to pay a special tribute to the work of the National Council for the Blind of Ireland.  I think that their work deserves the praise&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>I want him to take responsibility.  That is what I was about to suggest.  I know that blind people do not have to pay a wireless licence.  Is not that so?  I think that sufferers from T.B. should likewise be facilitated.  I have in mind the case of a man who was in a sanatorium in my constituency.  He wrote to me <Col N="1946" /> and told me that there was a danger that his radio set would be confiscated because he could not pay his wireless licence.  I made representations to the Minister about this man's case.  I asked the Minister to consider this man's plea sympathetically.  He had only his T.B. allowance and very special circumstances surrounded his case.  The only company and pastime which this unfortunate man had was the radio that was placed convenient to his pillow. Everybody knows that sufferers from T.B. have to stay indoors and in bed not for days or weeks but probably for months and even years. It would be very wise and certainly it would be greatly appreciated if the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs would arrange, on the certificate of the county medical officer of health, to permit sufferers from T.B. to use their radio sets without having to purchase a wireless licence.  I cannot see that any very serious difficulties would arise from the granting of that concession.  Bear in mind that, in all the sanatoria throughout the country vast numbers of people are depending on the allowances which are paid in respect of T.B. patients.  I ask that a concession be made by the Minister's Department, whereby sufferers from T.B. will be exempted from having to purchase a wireless licence.</P>

The institution pays the licence for the institution radio set but if a patient brings in his own radio or if he gets one from the local merchant on the weekly system and brings it into the sanatorium with him he must pay a wireless licence.  I am sure I have the sympathy of the House on that.</P>

      <P>I am quite well aware of earphones.  I am dealing with the wireless licence which T.B. patients are obliged to pay.  I have asked the Minister to waive that regulation so far as T.B. patients are concerned, on the recommendation of the county medical officer of health or of the sanatorium concerned.</P>
      <P>I think that the Department of Posts and Telegraphs should set aside each year a sum from the amount estimated and voted for by this House and devote that sum of money towards the work of the National Council for the Blind of Ireland.  I think the Department should contribute generously and give help and assistance towards the provision of radio sets for the blind. We all agree that, possibly, Almighty God could not send a greater affliction than blindness.  I thing free radio sets should be allocated to very poor blind people living in rural areas.  The only way of solving that problem would be to work on the same lines as the scheme of the National Council for the Blind of Ireland.  I am not saying that they would take it&mdash;I am sure that if it were offered they would consider it&mdash;but I think that we would be doing a good day's work if a substantial sum were set aside to allocate radios to the deserving blind on the recommendation of the National Council for the Blind of Ireland.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1948" /> I want to make a request to the Minister, a request that has already been made, in connection with the broadcast of the Rosary over Radio Éireann.  Next year is a year which has been consecrated by the Pope to Our Blessed Lady and we in Ireland could show no greater honour and pay no greater tribute to Our Lady, who is the Queen of Ireland, than to have the Rosary broadcast over Radio Éireann.  It can very easily be done by means of a record which could be broadcast either immediately after the news or before the news.  If the Rosary were broadcast, it would certainly help to propagate and foster the good old Irish custom which thank God very strongly prevails in rural Ireland of the family Rosary.  In addition to using our radio to further our national outlook and to foster our Irish culture, we can lend a hand, and a very good hand, to the activities of Catholic action and we should be proud of doing it.</P>
    <P>I want to pay a tribute to Deputy Everett who was responsible for the Angelus being sounded from Radio Éireann and I hope and recommend that the Minister will take advice in this matter, because in this country, where the majority profess the Catholic Faith, it would be welcomed by all as a gesture during the Marian Year, if the Rosary were broadcast from Radio Éireann.  I very strongly recommend it and it would be very much appreciated by all.  I trust that the Minister will not alone give the matter his very sympathetic and favourable consideration, but will himself recommend it.  I trust that he will also consider the point I made with regard to extending the radio programme with the least possible delay until 12 midnight, because the station closes down too early at present.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dunne</NameTxt>
      <P>It was not my intention to intervene in this debate and my intervention will be as brief as possible. It is prompted by having listened last night to a vitriolic outburst from Deputy Briscoe in relation to a statement made by the former Minister for Posts and Telegraphs.  Deputy Everett <Col N="1949" /> adverted to some very important matters and in the course of his observations he indicated that he had no great liking for symphony music. Deputy Briscoe proceeded, with the approbation of the Minister, to endeavour to establish it as some kind of crime that such an opinion should be expressed and suggested, in fact, that anybody who did not set himself down to listen to symphony music was in the nature of a subnormal individual. There are many members of the House and of the Fianna Fáil Party who are probably as practised and as well versed in music as Deputy Briscoe, although, perhaps, not with such a degree of variations as Deputy Briscoe is able to display at times.  I have met many people who are skilled musicians who could not stand the sound of a symphony concert.  I myself have no strong opinions one way or the other.  Like most ordinary people who were denied the benefits of a classical education, I like light music, and I think it can be said, as Deputy Everett said last night, that the bulk of our people prefer ballads any day or night to a superabundance of symphony concerts.</P>
      <P>That was the view put forward last night by Deputy Everett.  Was there anything wrong with it?  According to Deputy Briscoe, it was something in the nature of a crime that such an expression of opinion should have been put forward.  I make no apologies to anybody for saying that I personally would listen to as little symphony music as I possibly could, and, as I have said, most honest people, outside the class who may have been specially educated to appreciate symphony or chamber music, will say: &ldquo;Give us a ballad or something light, so that we may enjoy it.&rdquo;  That is what was said by Deputy Everett and that gave rise to what I have indicated, a vicious, vitriolic effort by Deputy Briscoe to read into that statement something which was not in it at all.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A more serious aspect of the situation was referred to last night by Deputy Everett, an aspect in which I am particularly interested and in which every member of the House who has any regard for his responsibilities <Col N="1950" /> must take a keen interest.  I refer to the question of employment under the auspices of the broadcasting service. I am told that we have a symphony orchestra consisting of 40 people, and that 20 of these are non-nationals.  I I have nothing against non-nationals or foreigners, as such, but I do not think that, at a time when unemployment is rife in this country, and when our Irish musicians are being forced to go across to Britain to obtain employment, we should employ non-nationals. I am not alone in that opinion.  It is an opinion shared, if not by Deputy Briscoe, who was at great pains to justify the Minister's action in employing these non-nationals, by at least some members of the Fianna Fáil Party.</P>
    <P>I draw the attention of the House to a debate on 5th November of last year, when Deputy McCann, who has always taken a very keen interest in wireless broadcasting from the time it was initiated in this country, had some remarks to make.  They make interesting reading, particularly in contradistinction to the remarks of Deputy Briscoe last evening.  Here is what Deputy McCann had to say at column 957 of the Official Reports:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;I do feel it my duty, following Deputy Cosgrave, to speak here as Chairman of the Municipal School of Music and to say that I disagree profoundly&mdash;in this I think I am expressing the views of the great majority of people associated with music in the city, and also, in my opinion, of the great majority of my own constituents&mdash;with the development in connection with symphony and light orchestra of Radio Éireann and to say that it is not in the best interests of this country.</P>
    <P>I do not believe that we want an orchestra of international standard, if we have to bring in internationals to make it that.  If the money that is paid out of taxation in this connection is for anything, it is to nurture Irish talent in whatever direction it is available.  That has always been the tenor of my speeches in this House on Radio Éireann and kindred subjects.  I, therefore, fail to see how <Col N="1951" /> those who agreed with me in the past can disagree with me now.</P>
    <P>The Minister has made many pertinent remarks during the past few weeks but I think that the most impertinent observation that has come from him during the last few days is in the current issue of a journal called <i>Radio Review.</i>&lsquo;Completely inadequate&rsquo; is the description by the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs, Mr. Erskine Childers, &lsquo;is the training of musicians to concert standard in this country.&rsquo;  Now, it all depends on what the criterion of &lsquo;concert standard&rsquo; is.  If the criterion of concert standard is a standard on a par with the best to be had in other places in the world, well then, possibly, we do not come up to it in every aspect.  I say this, and I say it here deliberately&mdash;I say it from my association with people whose services have been dispensed with in Radio Éireann during the last few weeks&mdash;that they are as competent as any who have come here to replace them.  Yesterday I heard of two more dismissals during the last few weeks.  There was one man who had been playing for nine years with the Radio Éireann Symphony Orchestra and he was replaced by a German musician.  He is a man with a wife and family.  I suppose he can go elsewhere to seek employment.  However, whether these people are equal to, or better than, our own musicians, my contention is that what the Irish people want to hear is an Irish orchestra which can be gradually coached along until it reaches the stage of perfection which the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs so earnestly desires.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>That was not the speech of any member of the Labour Party.  It was not from Deputy Everett, it was not from Deputy Briscoe.  It was the reasoned view of a responsible member of the Fianna Fáil Party of long standing in this House, put forward here roughly a year ago.  We, of the Labour Party, hold that view; that if improvement in the standard of music rendered by the Radio Éireann Symphony Orchestra can be got only by sacking our own <Col N="1952" /> people and by importing these experts from foreign countries, then let us be satisfied with what we produce ourselves and with the standard we can reach ourselves.  I do not think that, simply in order that a tune may be made to sound sweeter, what Deputy McCann referred to last year can be justified&mdash;that a married man with a family, an Irish national who must have spent a great many years learning his craft as a musician, should be thrown out and told to go where he liked, to get a job in England if he could, while a non-national was employed to replace him.  If it were the situation that we had not in this country musicians qualified to take up positions in our orchestras, nobody would object to the employment of non-nationals. In this matter, as I have indicated, it is not my purpose to object on general principles to the employment of non-nationals, but in the circumstances as they exist to-day, the employment of 20 non-nationals in the Radio Éireann orchestra cannot be justified, no matter what attempt is made by the Minister on any aesthetic grounds or no matter what attempt is made by Deputy Briscoe, under the cover of a personal attack, to justify it.</P>
    <P>As I said, I do not want to dwell too long on this matter because, in the first instance, I am not qualified to speak at any great length on wireless broadcasting.  I have not very much opportunity to listen to the radio. Indeed, I often wondered, having looked up the debates on this particular matter in previous years, at the number of Deputies who seem to have such an immense knowledge of it.  I often wondered how a lot of these Deputies found time themselves to listen to so much on the radio.  When I do listen, on the few occasions that I find time, my reactions are the same as those of everybody else.</P>
    <P>Reference has been made to the item called, &ldquo;Take the Floor&rdquo;.  I heard it only once.  I am always struck by the peculiar situation that we find so far as the presentation of light entertainment in this country is concerned, whether it be on the stage, the radio or elsewhere.  It seems to be the plan and the design of those who write sketches and plays for the radio <Col N="1953" /> and stage to &ldquo;guy&rdquo; the Irish people, to make them appear ridiculous.  They always seem to develop a kind of accent that you would never hear in any part of the country&mdash;a hybrid kind of conglomeration of sound that you could not associate with any of our people.  If, in listening to an entertainment, we could hear an accent that would enable us to say: &ldquo;That fellow belongs to the West, the South, the North or to Leinster&rdquo; we would be satisfied that we were getting nearer to reality, to something that was native or racy of the soil.  But there seems to be some kind of conspiracy against that kind of thing in entertainment in this country.  This applies to the vaunted programme which is presented every Sunday by the famous pundit, Din Joe, as much as it applies to any other programme to which I have listened from Radio Éireann.</P>
    <P>Reference has been made to the broadcast of the play, <i>The Playboy of the Western World.</i>  I know that in the city and in the country we have followers of the drama who regard this play as a masterpiece and that it might be said to have been one of the foundation stones on which the Abbey Theatre built its reputation.  I must say that I saw it at least once and I could not understand what it was about or how it could have any relation, good, bad or indifferent to any aspect of Irish life.  I bow, however, to the superior knowledge of those who are able to appreciate it.  If there is a section who are able to appreciate what they call the lyric poetry of Synge let them enjoy it.  I would not go so far as to say that the play reflects discredit on our people, because I think it has withstood the test of time to some extent but a great deal of the support which we see accorded to plays of this kind is, in my personal view, a lot of intellectual bluff and pomposity.  If, however, people want to disport themselves in that way, let them; it is a harmless kind of recreation, anyway.</P>
    <P>There have been, no doubt, some improvements in the broadcasting services.  The introduction of the early morning news and the extension of hours have been of great benefit. <Col N="1954" /> In this drive to improve the services, I should like to know from the Minister, when he is replying, how many hours in a given period of broadcasting time are spent in the use of Irish. or in the effort to make Irish a spoken language in a more widespread fashion.  There is a feeling among language workers that insufficient time is being devoted to the use of the native tongue and that is something which should be corrected.</P>
    <P>It has crossed my mind at various times when listening to this debate and other debates that it would be a good thing if the Minister would consider at some time arranging a broadcast for, say, a week or so of the proceedings of this House.  I think it would have a very beneficial effect if the proceedings were broadcast.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFlanagan" hpid="Mr. S. Flanagan Mr. S. Flanagan">

    <Speaker pid="SeanDunne" hpid="Mr. Dunne Mr. Dunne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dunne</NameTxt>
      <P>It might be a reciprocal benefit.  I think a lot of the illusion which the public harbour with regard to their representatives would be dispelled on the one hand and that a good deal of the oppressive silence which has been lingering in the House for the best part of a score of years would be relieved on the other hand. The standard of the debate would certainly improve, I imagine.  It could not do any harm and it would be an interesting experiment.  I do not know whether that is done anywhere except in America.</P>
      <P>I heard reference last night to the fact that Deputies are debarred from broadcasting on most subjects.  That is completely irrational.  In England, I think it is a common thing for members of Parliament who specialise in particular lines of art, literature and commerce and whose services are thought to be of value are permitted to broadcast in the ordinary way.  I do not think that that regulation should be left there much longer.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My chief concern in speaking was to endeavour to dispel the false atmosphere which was created last night deliberately by Deputy Briscoe in relation to our stand on this question of the employment of non-nationals.  I <Col N="1955" /> think I have made it clear that not only we but all reasonable persons&mdash; and I instanced Deputy McCann of the Fianna Fáil Party speaking 12 months ago on this subject&mdash;feel that it is not right while we have unemployed in this country that we should bring in foreigners and dismiss our people from their jobs.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>Perhaps, I should say to begin with in connection with this debate that it has been very pleasant listening to the vast majority of the Deputies who spoke.  As Deputy McQuillan said, there are as many views on broadcasting as there are Deputies in this House, and I think he put the general position very well in regard to the extent to which any Minister could have regard to any statement made by a Deputy, that it is more or less in the nature of an opinion.  I particularly valued the contributions of Deputy Dockrell and Deputy O'Gorman, showing a real appreciation of the improvement that has taken place in Radio Éireann since the last Estimate came before the House.  In fact, the number of Deputies who were wholly critical in their observations was practically negligible.  I think Deputy Everett was one, but there were very few others.</P>
      <P>So far as the employment of nationals and non-nationals by Radio Éireann is concerned, I do not think that the House need have any feeling of inquietude in regard to the general position.  Since 1950 we have secured employment altogether in the whole of Radio Éireann services for 70 nationals and six non-nationals.  In view of the fact that broadcasting has many diverse functions and constituents, and that a number of the people who work for broadcasting have international connections, I think that that proportion is an excellent one.  I make no apologies for it.  I should like to have heard from Deputies about the 70 nationals who secured employment in the last few years as a result of reorganisation and expansion of services and of the programme.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think I can also say that a record <Col N="1956" /> number of tributes have been paid to Radio Éireann in the course of the debate, and that the new director and the comhairle will be encouraged to make greater efforts to improve the programme.  I will ask them to read the whole of this debate and to examine the various criticisms and observations made in the hope that some of the things which have been said here may help towards a still further improvement of the programme.  Deputy O'Sullivan said something on the same lines as Deputy McQuillan.  He said it was difficult for Deputies even to give a general view of what their own constituents thought because of the very great diversity of opinion in regard to broadcasting matters in general.</P>
    <P>Deputy Corish in the course of his speech asked why there were no details of salaries in the Estimate.  I gave the reasons for that in the first part of my Estimate speech when I said that there had been a complete change in the organisation of broadcasting, that far greater freedom is given by the Minister for Finance.  We are not breaking any statutory regulations.  All the information necessary for the Comptroller and Auditor-General will be available in the usual way.  We simply carried out a simplification which would bring about the sort of flexibility that is as essential in broadcasting as it is in any other entertainment organisation such as a newspaper. The Public Accounts Committee can, if they wish, examine all the accounts in the usual way, and I think that that is a safeguard against any unwise action on the part of the director or anything in the nature of financial expenditure of which this House might not approve.  Reference was also made to some of the fees paid by Radio Éireann.  Fees in the entertainment world are high.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanCorish" hpid="Brendán Mac Fheórais Brendán Mac Fheórais">
      <NameTxt>Brendán Mac Fheórais</NameTxt>
      <P>Surely the Minister will agree that when an Estimate is being presented we ought to have some details with regard to the salaries paid.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>I gave the fullest particulars in regard to this matter in the course of my Estimate speech, and when the Estimate was approved last <Col N="1957" /> year I made it quite clear that there would be a simplification with a view to giving Radio Éireann, as far as we can under statutory regulations, something half-way between the position of an independent statutory corporation, such as the B.B.C. or Radio Diffusion Belge, and being a complete and absolute branch of the Civil Service, having to obey all the regulations which apply to all the officers of the Civil Service. I said we had reached a half-way position. I also told the Deputy on this occasion that we had consulted the Public Accounts Committee and that they had accepted the position, knowing that there always can be a full examination of how the accounts are kept.  We hope we will always have confidence in the director and the comhairle, so that there will never be any need for an elaborate presentation of such expenditure.</P>
      <P>As I was saying, the fees in the entertainment world are high, and frequently bear no relation to salaries paid in other avocations.  Sometimes there are very few persons capable of a particular type of broadcasting, and these people have to be paid high fees. The same applies to the world of acting, to the world of the cinema and, in some degree, to the world of publication.</P>
      <P>So far as the fees paid by Radio Éireann to those who perform, shall I say, minor parts, the fees have increased by 33? to 100 per cent. since 1950.</P>
      <P>I hope the criticism that we do not offer sufficiently high fees to individual broadcasters in this country will no longer be thrown against us.  We have done our best to increase the fees. There certainly was a great need for improving them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The comhairle meets fortnightly and takes a very deep, immediate and personal interest in the running of the station.  It leaves all the details of the programme to the director, but they consider general policy.  It consists of people from a very wide variety of walks of life and I have confidence in them.  I should like to stress the fact that they meet fortnightly.  They are in the nature of a board which has a <Col N="1958" /> complete and absolute responsibility for the supervision of Radio Éireann, under my authority.</P>
    <P>A number of Deputies referred to the question of interference by domestic and industrial apparatus as distinct from external interference.  In connection with interference, the investigation staff has been doubled of recent months.  They constantly go from one end of the country to the other in order to investigate interference.  We have tried to arrange area campaigns, in which we advise the wireless dealers of a particular town that we propose visiting that town.  We ask them to co-operate with us by carrying out such publicity as they deem advisable, asking the public to help in eliminating interference.</P>
    <P>We ask the wireless dealers to help us because we find that 23 per cent. of all the interference which we investigate is the result of an imperfection in the set or in the aerial itself, so that wireless dealers have a good commercial interest in assisting to eliminate interference.  I should like to ask the co-operation of everybody in that regard.</P>
    <P>One Deputy&mdash;Deputy O'Donnell&mdash; seemed to imply in what he said that there might be some legal enforcement against interference.  That is a frightfully complicated matter.  It is extremely difficult to prove in court the existence of interference.  The British Government passed an Act&mdash;I think it was in 1949&mdash;in connection with which there are some 40 pages of complicated regulations.  So far as I know that Act is still not being enforced very rigidly&mdash;at least we have heard very little about it because we know it is extremely difficult to put it into operation.</P>
    <P>One of the things that would be required would be the right to search premises with all the unpleasantness that would involve.  We would prefer to have voluntary co-operation in the matter of eliminating interference. Suppressors for most classes of apparatus are carried by our inspectors. When the inspectors find some domestic apparatus they can generally offer to fit this suppressor immediately at a cost of from 10/- to £1 for most <Col N="1959" /> classes of small apparatus.  We also have very excellent co-operation with the E.S.B. who are ready immediately at any time to suppress interference arising from transformers or other apparatus which they use.</P>
    <P>In regard to interference from stations abroad, in 1948 a conference was held in Copenhagen for the allocation of wavelengths on the medium and long wavebands arising from changes that had taken place during the war.  The conference never succeeded in making a satisfactory allocation. Stations interfere with each other sometimes because they are too close and sometimes because they have the same wavelength as our own but exceed the power allotted to them under international conventions.  Seven countries were unable to subscribe to that convention because of the unfortunate results in regard to their own particular wavelengths demands.</P>
    <P>I should mention in that connection that the new Cork transmitter should be fairly effective in the region of Cork and should, I think, result in an improvement in transmission.  I hope we will hear fewer complaints from Cork Deputies who, as usual, spoke vociferously on this Estimate and made it quite clear that Cork should play a very important part in the Irish broadcasting world.</P>
    <P>The air is crowded.  There is an increased number of stations.  There is an international organisation in Brussels which tries to prevent interference. We make representations when we think it wise to that organisation. We also make representations to the countries direct.  One and a half years ago we suggested to an Italian station that they were emitting too strong a signal and they agreed to reduce it. That was a station with the same wavelength as ours but with a strength which should not ordinarily interfere with reception here.</P>
    <P>It is extremely difficult to secure unanimity in most of these matters. The ideal thing would be to do what other countries devastated during the war are now doing and that is to build <Col N="1960" /> their stations anew such as in Western Germany and have high frequency transmitters with any amount of room on the air.  The reception is very nearly perfect being almost entirely free from static under ordinary conditions.  The difficulty arising from this decision would be that it would be necessary to have a most modern transmitter installed and everyone in this country would have to spend approximately £10 to adapt their sets.</P>
    <P>I think I, as Minister, would be very unpopular if I asked nearly 400,000 wireless licensees to indulge in that expenditure even though, as a result, they got absolutely perfect reception. Some day some Minister will have to take that responsibility.  I feel that some day high frequency modulation transmission will be ideal for the country and sooner or later the steps will have to be taken.  I might add that the B.B.C. have not yet taken that step although their resources are infinitely greater than ours because of the number of households which pay licence fees to them.  They have not dared to take such a step.</P>
    <P>A number of Deputies spoke about the question of making use of Radio Éireann in the anti-Partition campaign. Deputy O'Donnell suggested that both sides of the controversy should be allowed to debate.  That would seem to me to create a number of difficulties.  He also suggested that there ought to be daily or weekly propaganda.  As everybody knows, we report all news concerning the Partition problem as forcefully as we can. We make no distinction in regard to the news which comes to us from any part of Ireland.</P>
    <P>Both this Government and the last had this matter under consideration. I think the answer is that there is no point in making use of Radio Éireann if, as a result, we gain nothing from what might be inevitably a slanging match between the two parties concerned. We are naturally outclassed in the number and the power of our radio stations.  There would be no point in carrying on propaganda if the only result was a greater amount of propaganda from the opposite point of <Col N="1961" /> view.  It is purely a matter of tactics and I have to rely on those who can give me advice on that matter.</P>
    <P>There has been more or less unanimity in regard to that whole problem for a considerable number of years. Just as we are, in fact, agreed on the Partition question, it would appear that we are also agreed that Radio Éireann should not be used for the purpose of transmitting deliberate propaganda.  It would not be advantageous to us.</P>
    <P>There were some questions asked about the short-wave station.  The position there is that we were granted an allocation at the last conference which took place in Palermo.  We were crowded out on the air.  We were in a very unsatisfactory position on the wave band although our delegates, of course, did their best.  Reception in the United States of America on the short-wave station at the present time would be negligible.  Therefore, there would be no advantage in undertaking the very considerable cost in using this station for either propaganda purposes or letting the world know of our cultural conditions and heritage.</P>
    <P>Deputy Everett and Deputy Dunne had a good deal to say about the question of employing non-nationals in the orchestras.  I think that the statement I made in the course of my Estimate speech fully set out the position.  The previous Minister himself made no effort to improve the training of musicians here.  I do not think that musicians gained anything of advantage from him during their term of office and some of the non-nationals commenced their employment during his term of office.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesEverett" hpid="Mr. Everett Mr. Everett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Everett</NameTxt>
      <P>On a point of explanation. The Minister will observe from the files that I refused to appoint one non-national during my term of office in virtue of the promise which I gave in the House that no further appointments of the kind would be made.  The Minister should look up the files on that.  It is a point of correction.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>I have my own records on that subject.  The orchestra itself costs £42,000, and not £84,000 per year. This amounts to about 10 per cent. of the cost of the whole radio broadcasting <Col N="1962" /> organisation.  Might I add in that connection that what is known as the very serious heavy music occupies about 10 per cent. of the time, and of that 10 per cent. about half does not consist of really heavy music, but of popular classical music?  I want to mention that no one should exaggerate how much time is taken up by the orchestra playing, or how much time is involved in the transmission of symphony music.  Naturally, I am aware that it is possible to be a perfectly normal human being and not to like symphony music.  People have varying tastes in this and other countries, and I do not need to be lectured on that subject by Deputy Dunne.</P>
      <P>My object, as I have said, is to create a first-class orchestra.  I hope that in ten years' time in this, as in most other countries, the orchestra will consist of 100 musicians at least, and I hope that these 100 musicians will be better paid.  It is perfectly certain that if we now have a first-class orchestra, if we have foreign musicians here who can provide the only kind of instruction available in this country up to concert standard, if we have a high standard, then we can encourage young people to take up the playing of instruments for which there is a demand in the orchestra, a demand we are unable to fill in connection with the vacancies that have been available recently.</P>
      <P>A number of other small countries have had to do exactly the same thing. The Swedish and Swiss orchestras have a very considerable percentage of non-nationals. In the case of the B.B.C. orchestra even in Great Britain, where they have a tremendous number of orchestras, and where they are able to insist that all the players are, actually, nationals, one will find that the names of a very high proportion of the persons in those orchestras indicate that many musicians were only very recently naturalised.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As I have already indicated, we have established an annual audition at which musicians, for the first time, are no longer told: &ldquo;You are fit to play in Radio Éireann or you are not fit to play.&rdquo;  They are now divided into three <Col N="1963" /> groups.  We appoint some of them, we encourage others to go on with their training, and we are appointing a student orchestra in which they can play, and then there is a third group composed of those who we think are unlikely ever to reach the standard of a symphony orchestra and to whom we say we can offer no special advice because they have not reached the half-way point in their teaching.</P>
    <P>It is all very well to be told that it is not in the interests of this country that non-nationals should be appointed. I would remind Deputies that a large percentage of the pilots employed by Aer Lingus are non-nationals because there were no others of sufficient standard available to fly the Aer Lingus planes. Aer Lingus is gradually training an increasing number of Irish pilots, but they are in exactly the same position as we are in regard to that matter. One could even make the comparison that a symphony orchestra of the standard, say, of the Danish Radio Orchestra must have a standard that will compare pretty well with the standard of the pilot who flies an aeroplane, in so far as quality is concerned.</P>
    <P>I mentioned a number of other factors.  I mentioned that we had appointed an Irish assistant conductor, one of whose particular jobs is to seek musical talent in this country and to co-ordinate with all institutions which are teaching musicians.  One would imagine, listening to Deputy Everett, that he did not hear me say that we had appointed six young violinists, whose training has not been completed, on a part-time basis; that we had appointed one viola player and a clarinet player in connection with the recent annual audition, and that we hope to encourage our people to acquire the art of musicianship.</P>
    <P>No one, of course, in this debate who spoke on this matter made any reference to what I had said in my statement in regard to the prizes offered at Dublin Feiseanna.  I said that, excluding the piano and violin, in connection with all other instruments in the orchestra in the senior, intermediate <Col N="1964" /> and open classes, there were, in relation to two Dublin feiseanna, 30 prizes offered and only 12 were awarded.  In connection with one feis, an adjudicator, who is Irish in origin, and who has every sympathy with this country, said it was quite obvious that talent in respect of a number of instruments of the standard required in a symphony orchestra was gravely lacking and that a number of the persons taking part in the feis, while showing great promise, would require, in nearly every single case, three or four years further training before they could join in a symphony orchestra, not of the standard of the New York symphony orchestra, but shall we say of a regional orchestra of the B.B.C.</P>
    <P>He was an examiner at one of the feiseanna, and is a person who has a very deep connection with the life of this country.  He is a person who is very much admired by the people who take part in these feiseanna.  I rely on his view.  Another thing we have done is to secure an increased grant of £1,000 for the Royal Irish Academy of Music, both for scholarships for musicians and for general purposes in connection with the training of musicians to concert standard.  We have provided them with some six new instructors.  All that I hope will help to develop a great musical tradition here.</P>
    <P>I also stated, although it seems to have been forgotten in this debate, that no permanent players whose standard remains as it is would be dismissed from the orchestra.  We now have an orchestra which can grow from strength to strength.  The difficulties to be faced at an earlier period, in so far as that matter is concerned, are over.  Now, as I have said, no permanent player whose standard remains unaltered need have any fears as a result of the agitation which we have heard in this debate from not more than two Deputies in the whole House.  If the popularity of the orchestra increases and if there is a further development in music then of course Radio Éireann will be unable to take the full responsibility for symphony music in this country.  We are primarily a broadcasting organisation, <Col N="1965" /> but there are other organisations which may have to take an interest in the improvement of orchestras.</P>
    <P>In Great Britain, for example, the Arts Council makes contributions and local municipal corporations make contributions to the maintenance of the great orchestras there, and I think the Hallé Orchestra in particular is now going to receive subventions from three different cities whilst receiving its usual subvention from the British Arts Council.  As I have said, that is a faroff development.  I cannot foresee how the development of the orchestra will proceed, but I should mention that matter because it is obvious that Radio Éireann may not always be able to be responsible for conducting the affairs of what is becoming the national orchestra of Ireland.</P>
    <P>I do not think I need say any more on that subject.  The necessary reorganisation of the orchestra has been effected, and I have given an undertaking that Radio Éireann will employ every single musician who is likely to come forward in the next few years and who is available to us.  I only wish that there were more musicians at this moment studying about six wind instruments and at least two string instruments and who are likely to reach the standard not, as I have said, of a great international orchestra supported by the subventions of millionaires but an orchestra of which we could be reasonably proud.  I hope everything I have said will encourage the development of a musical tradition in this country.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>I could not say.  The Suisse Ronarde Orchestra is still 59 per cent. non-national, and if the Deputy will get the list of the players in the B.B.C. Orchestra he will see from the very endings of their names that a huge proportion of them are naturalised citizens.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy McQuillan referred to the balance of the news and suggested that <Col N="1966" /> on occasions it might appear to accept the slant of the news from the B.B.C. So far as I know, the very excellent men who run the news service at Radio Éireann have independent minds.  I would like to deny that we favour aggressors of any kind from any source in our news commentary.  We get the news from more than one agency and the best possible is done to balance the presentation of the news.</P>
    <P>References have been made to the participation of Deputies in debates, and I am glad that Deputies on all sides of the House seem to approve of the idea that in connection with our debates on matters of interest in Ireland Deputies and Senators should not be excluded.  That matter is under active consideration and I hope we can go on towards being in the same position of every western democracy where Deputies and Senators take part in debates, where there are stated broadcasts by all the Parties in between elections, and where there are stated broadcasts during general elections.  It is a matter which must be carefully considered. We must ensure that we have unanimity between all the Parties in regard to the whole problem.</P>
    <P>One Deputy suggested we should broadcast direct the proceedings of Dáil Éireann.  That is a matter that would require very careful consideration. There are many persons interested in what I might call the philosophy of democracy who would say it would destroy the independence of this House, that it would tend to turn Deputies into pure delegates for their constituents; that it would tend to direct their attention to their position as delegates, which they are to some degree, and not to make them feel themselves as being persons elected for a term of office and having considerable independence of view themselves.  It is a matter about which we could have a very long discussion, but if we can perhaps extend the field of the reporting of debates in the Dáil as I have indicated, that is as far as we need go.</P>
    <P>I do not myself believe that the Parties as a whole in this House would <Col N="1967" /> wish us to adopt the Australian system, that is, in our present stage of development.  If we had a stand-up debate on that subject I think all sides of the House would be very much divided as to whether from the standpoint purely of the philosophy of democracy it would be a good thing to have the proceedings of the Dáil broadcast directly to the nation.  I am not sure whether as a result of any change in that direction speeches would be better or whether in fact there would be a close and independent examination of all the issues which we face.  I might add that I have not made my mind up nor have the Government, and I think we had better leave the question for the present.</P>
    <P>Deputy Giles and Deputy Cogan spoke about the necessity of having broadcasts on matters connected with Irish history.  There has been a considerable development in regard to that matter.  We have had portraits of 1916 leaders; we have had broadcasts on Robert Emmet, on Thomas Davis, on Roger Casement&mdash;I am speaking of recent date; we had quite a number of broadcasts in connection with Thomas Moore and his centenary, and we have had quite a number of commentaries on the war for independence and the battles of the Old I.R.A. We are having at the present time the history of Ireland in the form of music with a commentary by a very wellknown Irishman.  We are having a much greater variety of Irish music.  I think we are doing all we can to contribute to the Irish Ireland part of the programme, and I hope it will grow and improve in quality in the future.</P>
    <P>There has been a great deal of discussion on the plays broadcasts by Radio Éireann and the matter is made very easy for me by the fact that Deputies have obviously differed on this point.  There have been Deputies who said they saw nothing objectionable in the plays broadcast from Radio Éireann.  There were others who have raised objections and inevitably, of course, there will always be a diversity of opinion in regard to that matter. We ourselves have received no serious <Col N="1968" /> complaints in Radio Éireann.  Hundreds of plays of very varied types are broadcast, varied in their country of origin, in their dramatic content and varied in regard to their scene and theme.  It would be true to say that 90 per cent. of the plays broadcast from Radio Éireann are frequently played by purely rural dramatic companies, apart from those plays which can be seen at the Abbey Theatre.</P>
    <P>I would not believe for a moment that the Abbey Theatre plays only to what some Deputies describe as a Dublin sophisticated audience.  I believe a great number of people come to the Abbey who very recently arrived from the country and I would not say that a play that would be suitable for the Abbey Theatre might not be suitable for broadcasting because the audience was more sophisticated than a rural audience.  I say that statement is very much open to question.</P>
    <P>Some Deputies spoke about what they call &ldquo;stage Irish&rdquo;.  I have heard entertainment all over the country under every conceivable auspices and I have heard people laughing uproariously in one part of the country at a comedy which undoubtedly would be described as &ldquo;stage Irish&rdquo; in another part of the country.  I suppose we have had a good example of that in this House in regard to a certain comedian who was mentioned by Deputies.  One Deputy said that he was racy of the soil from which he sprang and another said that he provided a perfect example of very bad stage Irish.  My own belief from having observed a great deal of entertainment of that type is that it is very hard to know what exactly stage Irish is.  There is a certain kind of comedy that you come across in the London Coliseum, for example, which could definitely be labelled as pseudo-Irish. But when it comes to what you hear at a benefit concert in a hall in some remote rural parish or what you hear at big functions in the cities and towns of this country or what you see at the Abbey Theatre or presented by rural dramatic companies, I think it would be very hard for anybody to make any generalisation in regard to it.</P>
    <P>As everyone knows, the history of <Col N="1969" /> the Irish drama has been, roughly, in two phases.  There was the intensely romantic and idealistic period from 1900 to 1918.  If you pick up some three dozen of the leaflets, pamphlets and books circulating in the country in 1916, or even before, up to 1918, you will see that the whole of the literary movement played a vital part in the independence movement, directly or indirectly.  The drama tended to reflect the times in that the players were cast in a heroic mould.  Since 1922 there has been the almost inevitable reaction that takes place after a nation secures independence, particularly if there happens to be the tragedy of a civil war.  There has been since then a mordant cynical school of dramatic thought.  There have been writers who by their origin are deeply imbued with the national tradition, who have written cynical mordant plays which have been played throughout the country by rural dramatic societies, as well as by the Abbey Theatre, and which would appear to be very much enjoyed by Irish people of all sections and all types.  This is simply a literary phase through which we are passing.  We cannot hide the tragedy of existence in connection with plays we present through Radio Éireann.  Drama must relate in some way to &ldquo;holding a mirror up to nature.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Other countries, I might add, expose themselves through their drama.  Other countries present to the world at large plays which are cynical in themselves. We have only to consider the literature of many countries in order to see the truth of that.  For example, a writer who is considered to be one of the greatest Catholic novelists of any age, Mauriac, wrote a book, about a type of French society, which is of the most deeply cynical and tragic kind.</P>
    <P>Yet in France he is honoured as a writer by people of all classes and creeds.  I could not possibly accept the suggestion that <i>The Playboy of the Western World</i> should not be played from Radio Éireann.  There are plays which are traditional to our country. They may seem cynical to us, they may seem cynical to certain elements of the population.  Nevertheless I have seen <Col N="1970" /><i>The Playboy of the Western World</i> played by a dramatic company from a very small little town in Sligo; I have seen it played to a purely rural audience in another part of Ireland and I have seen the most vociferous applause from people of every kind for the presentation of that play.</P>

      <P>They were people of all kinds.  I hope that the director of Radio Éireann and those in charge of drama will make quite sure that nothing of a kind which could be regarded as offensive to the ordinary man or woman will come from Radio Éireann; but what one would class as offensive is obviously a difficult matter, as there is a difference of opinion even amongst Deputies here on that question.</P>
      <P>Several Deputies referred to the possibility of school broadcasts.  That is a matter about which I could not say very much this evening.  Once it became a purely educational function it would require a separate organisation, as in other countries.  You could hardly ask the present organisation of Radio Éireann to conduct regular education under the circumstances prevailing in regard to education as a whole to-day.  I think Deputies realise the difficulties we would face in that regard.  We hope to have some popular programmes for children which would help them in their studies and which would be ancillary to their studies.  Anything in the nature of a school broadcast programme would require a separate organisation for its creation and it is a matter of high policy which I could not discuss this evening.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not think I need say very much to the Cork Deputies.  They have expressed their views very effectively. The Cork studios are being constructed and will be completed in about 18 months.  The Cork transmitter, as I already indicated, is being changed and the transmission should be more perfect.  I think the Cork men have a good many programmes originating <Col N="1971" /> from the Cork people and that we are doing our best in regard to that matter. I should say to Deputy Keyes that we do not expect the Cork station to be heard properly in Limerick and I think he was under some misapprehension in regard to that matter.  Limerick people should be able to hear the Athlone programme.  The Cork transmitter, even when it was new, was never supposed to broadcast to Limerick.</P>
    <P>Deputy Flanagan made, as usual, a number of scandalous allegations.  I do not think I need reply to them here, as Radio Éireann is a properly run and highly respectable organisation.  Our contracts are kept with artistes and that is all I need say in regard to one matter to which he referred.  There is nothing peculiar in regard to the fees charged to those who undertake sponsored programmes.  Any reductions made are made on an administrative basis in relation to the constitution of the company concerned and there is no kind of discrimination or preference. I notice that Deputy Flanagan suggested there should be far more sponsored programmes.  If we had far more of them, we would be imitating more and more the Luxembourg programme. I do not know whether Deputy Flanagan wants that, but that is what is clearly implied by what he said.</P>
    <P>Deputy McQuillan and others referred to television and said we should not wait for ever, as there would always be changes in television apparatus. When I spoke of the changes that were taking place, I was referring to changes in the next three years of an important kind in regard to the possibilities for the exchange of programmes and the development of colour television.  I agree that, whatever decision the Government makes, it cannot postpone a decision on the ground that the apparatus would likely be absolete in ten years' time. It will have to be a decision on the basis as to whether we ought to have television, whether we can afford it and what should be the organisation <Col N="1972" /> to conduct it.  As far as I know, the Government would have no intention of sharing television stations with any other organisation or body.</P>
    <P>I think that in our present state, television will have to be entirely under the supervision of the Government. The principal difficulty is the great cost of a good programme. There are only 650,000 households and they can provide only a certain income for television.  The difficulty we have both in establishing a second programme on the radio and in establishing television is that we are a country of a very modest population.</P>
    <P>I will ask the Minister for Social Welfare to consider any representations made by Deputies in regard to the provision of wireless for those afficted with any particular malady. It is not the affair of my Department, but I think the Minister for Social Welfare has shown himself very willing to do all he can for the afficted and the ill and it is a matter for him to decide whether he would wish to make the concession suggested by one Deputy in regard to them.</P>
    <P>A number of Deputies suggested that there should be a ceremony in connection with the Rosary in the evening from Radio Éireann.  I have to take the advice of the director in that matter and the director in his turn, I am quite sure, would take the advice of the ecclesiastical authorities.  With regard to all religious matters, we have had a very happy experience since the founding of Radio Éireann.</P>
    <P>Ever since the founding of Radio Éireann we have moved very happily in complete co-operation with all the ecclesiastical authorities.  Certainly, in the last two years, so far as I am aware, there has been no conflict of opinion of any kind, and I am quite certain that if there was to be any move of this kind there would be the same co-operation and the same happy relations that have always existed in the past.</P>
    <P>One Deputy asked what proportion of the programme is in the Irish language. Apart from songs, about one-fifth of the programme is in Irish and we are always trying to improve the <Col N="1973" /> programme in that respect.  Recently our commentaries in Irish before matches and sporting events of various kinds have received very favourable attention.  We are trying to improve the programme in the native tongue to the greatest extent possible.  I do not think there is any other institution which gives even one-fifth of its time to transmitting messages, notices or announcements of various kinds in the Irish language, and I think Radio Éireann is doing the best it can in that matter.</P>
    <P>In conclusion, I want to thank the Deputies for their very kindly comments on the development of Radio Éireann.  The comments have been noted.  The criticisms will be examined. The suggestions will be scrutinised, and I hope that the next time the Estimate is presented to this House Deputies will be able to record the same degree of improvement as they say has taken place in the last year.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickSmith" hpid="Minister for Local Government (Mr. Smith) Patrick Smith">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Local Government (Mr. Smith)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move:&mdash;</P>
      <P>That a sum not exceeding £1,926,160 be granted to complete the sum necessary to defray the Charge which will come in course of payment during the year ending on the 31st day of March, 1954, for the Salaries and Expenses of the Office of the Minister for Local Government, including Grants to Local Authorities, Grants and other Expenses in connection with Housing, and Miscellaneous Grants.</P>
      <P>The net amount being provided in the Vote for Local Government this year is £4,576,760 being £141,740 in excess of the provision made last year. The principal increases are £300,000 in the amount provided in respect of grants to private persons and public utility societies for the erection and reconstruction of houses, and £400,000 being a new free grant for the improvement of certain roads in the Gaeltacht and congested areas.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1974" /> These and some other minor increases in certain sub-heads of the Vote are balanced to a large extent by a reduction in the Transition Development Fund grants to local authorities for housing schemes and sanitary services works.  These reductions occur in the ordinary course of the liquidation of the Transition Development Fund which is being replaced by the extension of the loan charges subsidy system.</P>
    <P>The Road Fund grants to county councils were increased in 1952-53 to £1,100,000 for main roads and £1,400,000 for county road improvement grants together with a grant of 40 per cent. of the amount expended by county councils on main road upkeep.  The improvement grants were further increased by £300,000 for main roads and £300,000 for county roads in the current financial year.  There is a further provision of between £100,000 and £200,000 for miscellaneous road and bridge works, which with the special grant of £400,000 make a total increase of some £1,200,000 in the subventions of road expenditure.</P>
    <P>Local authorities completed 7,476 dwellings in 1952-53&mdash;almost 300 more than in the preceding year.  The urban authorities, apart from Dublin Corporation, were particularly active in housing output during the year.  They built 2,911 houses, this being the highest production figure on their part in any year since the war.  The Dublin Corporation output was 2,200 dwellings as compared with 1,982 in the previous year.  The number of houses completed by county councils as the housing authorities for the county health districts was less than in the preceding year but here also the general progress is satisfactory.</P>
    <P>The need for some 70,000 dwellings estimated in 1947 has now been met to the extent of over 32,000 dwellings: 10,000 more are being built or comprised in tenders and sites have been acquired for a further 10,000.  Thus, out of the 70,000 needs figure more than 52,000 dwellings are now built, in course of construction, being contracted for, or are to be commenced within a reasonable time.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1975" /> It will be evident from this record of progress that a large number of the housing authorities have reached or are approaching the point at which they have fully satisfied the housing needs estimated to exist in their areas in 1947.  In fact, about 50 local authorities have already reached that point or are in course of attaining it.</P>
    <P>A fresh housing survey was completed some time ago in Cork County Borough, while in Dublin County Borough a new survey is also being undertaken.  No doubt further surveys of this kind or other reviews of local needs will be made in other areas also where there is any uncertainty as to the accuracy of current estimates of needs.  A decision as to the necessity for such surveys is a matter for the local authorities concerned.</P>
    <P>The Dublin Corporation have built over 10,000 dwellings since 1947 but the programme still before them represents by far the greatest of any housing authority in the country.  As their annual output of houses progresses, that output, taken in conjunction with the activities of private house builders in Dublin City and County, gives rise to serious problems in the planning of ancillary services and amenities.  The planning difficulties encountered were not based on any fanciful or idealistic standards.  They involved the coordination of other works programmes &mdash;water supply, sewerage, roads, road traffic, parks and children's playgrounds&mdash;all of which were essential to healthy and ordered community life in the new housing estates.  The members of the various committees of the Dublin Corporation and the city manager and his assistants are fully alive to the need for uniform and simultaneous progress in all these public services, and I, as Minister for Local Government, and my advisers are always available for consultation and for giving any assistance that we possibly can.</P>
    <P>Many of these difficulties have already been resolved and the present housing programme of the corporation, taken in conjunction with the other works in progress or proposed in the <Col N="1976" /> city, represents a very impressive aggregate of public activity.  I have every confidence that the annual housing output of the corporation for the next few years will at least maintain the high average set in recent years.</P>
    <P>Last year I was pleased to be able to report considerable improvement in the housing progress in Cork City. That progress has continued at an increasing rate.  Last year the corporation completed 299 houses as against the average annual output of 120 houses in the preceding five years.  At the beginning of this financial year the corporation had 1,400 house sites available for the continuation of their programme.</P>
    <P>The competition amongst building contractors for local authority housing work has improved considerably in recent times and the prices are consequently keener.  Side by side with this my Department has contributed considerably to the achievement of greater economy in the design and planning of the housing schemes.  I have reason to believe that these factors will help to lighten the cost of housing.  There is, however, still scope for greater economy without impinging on the minimum housing standards set for local authorities.</P>
    <P>Prospective progress in private house building is more difficult to assess than are the programmes of local authorities.  The number of new house grants allocated under the Acts in 1952-53 was 4,910 as compared with 6,093 in the preceding year.  For the first six months of the present financial year the number of new house grants allocated was 2,702, representing a slight increase over the corresponding 1952-53 figures, while the number of reconstruction grants allocated for the 12 months ended 30th September, 1953, has been 5,537 as compared with 2,908 in the corresponding previous 12 months.</P>
    <P>The volume of housing activity not necessarily represented by current grant applications but also by grants already allocated to the 31st December last may be gauged from the provision of £2,000,000 made in the Vote under <Col N="1977" /> this head in the present Estimates as compared with a total of £1,800,394 actually disbursed in 1952-53.  The current figures regarding the trend of activity in private house construction and reconstruction are, therefore, encouraging. The evidence of continued and increasing activity in the matter of reconstruction is a welcome tendency in the rural areas where there is a wide field for beneficial improvements of this kind as well as for the provision and installation of private water supply and sewerage facilities for which grants are also provided in the Housing (Amendment) Act, 1952. There is evidence of a very keen interest in this latter type of grant but the extent of the demand cannot yet be estimated.  As regards new house grants, I am particularly anxious that these grants, supplemented where necessary under the scheme of local authority grants introduced in the Act of 1952, will encourage those still most in need of better housing accommodation to build houses for themselves and in certain categories to lighten the burden of local authority housing.</P>
    <P>Road Fund income for 1952-53 amounted to £3,874,000 as compared with £3,261,000 in 1951-52 and £2,814,000 in 1950-51.  A further increase is expected in the present financial year of about £475,000 bringing the income to approximately £4,350,000, the greater portion of which is not likely to be received until the last quarter of the financial year. The annual loan charges in respect of the amount borrowed between 1948 and 1950 on the security of the Road Fund together with administrative charges will reduce the net amount available for payment of road grants to about £3,900,000.  The liabilities outstanding at the 31st March last in respect or road maintenance and improvement grants amounted to £1,685,000.</P>
    <P>I have already indicated that the main portion of the allocations for current work comprises £1,400,000 as a main road improvement grant; £1,700,000 as a county road improvement grant and a main road upkeep grant of 40 per cent. of the expenditure <Col N="1978" /> under that head by county councils. In notifying the grants, it was impressed on all county councils that the proposed works on both main and county roads should be planned well in advance and that the annual programmes should be so designed as to constitute successive stages of a longterm general plan.</P>
    <P>Grants totalling £150,000 were allocated last January from the Road Fund to the four county boroughs and the Borough of Dún Laoghaire. Furthermore, two of these bodies, the Dublin Corporation and Dún Laoghaire Corporation, have been notified that State grants will be available to them to carry out comprehensive programmes of road and bridge improvement works prepared by them for execution over a period of years. These works are estimated to cost £1,614,000 in Dublin County Borough and £625,000 in the Borough of Dún Laoghaire.</P>
    <P>The question of the arterial roads leading from Dublin has also been under review and the Dublin County Council have been asked to examine the position and to submit a programme of the works of improvement which they are to undertake.</P>
    <P>The position is under examination by all three authorities and detailed proposals are awaited.</P>
    <P>The average monthly employment by county councils on road and bridge works by direct labour in 1952-53 amounted to 17,438 men as compared with 16,962 in the previous financial year.  In addition, an average employment of 1,553 men was given on road and bridge works carried out by way of contract in 1952-53.</P>
    <P>Sub-head Q contains the provision to which I have already made reference whereby £400,000 was made available for the purpose of making grants to local authorities for the improvement of certain roads in the Gaeltacht and congested areas.  The schemes submitted from the counties concerned to the amounts required to absorb the grants have all been approved.</P>
    <P>In the last financial year, work was commenced on 65 water works and <Col N="1979" /> sewerage schemes, while 70 schemes were completed.  The schemes in progress in March last are estimated to involve a total cost of £2,595,550 as compared with £1,800,000 in March, 1952.  The prospects indicate a continuance of works of this kind up to at least the present volume of activity for a considerable time to come.  Shortly before the 31st March, 1952, work commenced by direct labour on the portion of the North Dublin drainage scheme comprising the laying of the intercepting sewer between Finglas and Raheny.  In October, 1952, preliminary plans for the second section from Raheny to the outfall at Howth were approved.  The acceptance of a tender for the carrying out of certain works along Sutton foreshore has since been sanctioned, and these works have commenced.  Detailed documents for the remaining portions of this section of the scheme are in the course of preparation.  Apart from the direct labour work, the entire scheme will comprise a total of 19 contracts and the all-in cost as at present estimated is over £1,600,000.</P>
    <P>In the same period, work commenced on two of the contracts for the North Dublin regional water supply scheme. These relate to the laying of pipe lines from Finglas to a new reservoir at Ballycoolan and the construction of the reservoir.  Deliveries of pipes have commenced for a third section comprising the laying of pipe lines from Ballycoolan to Blanchardstown and Castleknock, and for the extension of the scheme from Santry to Coolock. The documents relating to a further extension to Malahide have been approved.</P>
    <P>The contract documents for the Dún Laoghaire main drainage scheme have been approved as have also preliminary plans for a joint scheme being promoted by the Dublin County Council and the Dún Laoghaire Borough Corporation to serve the Foxrock/Killiney district.</P>
    <P>Other important sanitary services schemes approved in the same period included the construction of an additional reservoir for the Waterford waterworks system and a further section of the Galway main drainage <Col N="1980" /> scheme.  Regional water supply schemes also sanctioned included two contracts in Kildare, the Loch Mourne waterworks scheme in Donegal and a scheme to serve Passage West and district.</P>
    <P>An issue of £5,000,000 Dublin Corporation 5 per cent. stock redeemable in 1968/73 was made in February, 1953, at 98.  The issue was underwritten jointly by the Minister for Finance and the banks.  £3,316,590 stock was taken up by the public.</P>
    <P>The Cork Corporation made an issue of £780,000 5 per cent. stock at 97 in June last.  The issue was underwritten jointly by the Minister for Finance and the banks.  The whole of the stock issue was subscribed.</P>
    <P>The net indebtedness of local authorities increased in 1952-53 by about £14,000,000 and at the end of that year stood at £83,891,623.</P>
    <P>The supply position in connection with commodities required by local authorities and obtainable under the combined purchasing system improved very considerably during the year. Supplies of all essential commodities became more readily available and the prices of many of them showed a substantial fall.  The improved supply position enabled official contractors to be appointed for the supply of an increased number of commodities for the present contract year and the standards of quality of a number of important items were improved.</P>
    <P>The publication of the textbook on local government law has been retarded by printing and other difficulties but it should be ready in a few months.  Meanwhile the general preparatory work on the consolidation of all sections of the local government law is proceeding satisfactorily.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>I move that the Estimate be referred back for reconsideration. Naturally enough, and correctly, the Minister devoted the larger part of his speech to a survey of the housing position, because it is in connection with housing that the main interest on this Estimate arises. When an estimate was being made in 1947, to which the Minister referred, of the housing needs that there were <Col N="1981" /> in the country the difficulty that was going to confront whoever was responsible then, be it Minister or local authority, was clearly, in the immediate future at that time, one of supply of material and possibly supply of skilled labour.  That situation has, of course, entirely changed now.  The problem we have now to face in regard to the completion of our housing programme is not at all a problem of supply.  It is rather a problem of how to utilise the supply both in labour and in material that is there for utilisation.</P>
      <P>Some time ago I endeavoured to get some statistics of the comparative age of the houses and dwellings that were in the country.  Unfortunately, it is not possible to get statistics of a type that would enable us to judge how old on a statistical basis our houses were and how soon, therefore, they were likely to wear out.  It does appear, however, that in the census of 1901 there were then in the country a total of 642,327 houses and that in the census of 1946 there were then a total of 654,767 houses, representing an increase of only 12,400 in the 45 years that had passed between 1901 and 1946.</P>
      <P>It is not possible, again, to get particulars of all the houses that were erected in the same period, because there are no statistics at all that I can trace or that could be obtained for me in reply to a question, of houses built between 1901 and 1922; but from 1922 to 1948 there were built 115,300 houses.  Therefore deducting from that figure 12,000, the approximate increase that was shown, it becomes clear that in the first half of this century very roughly 100,000 houses had become obsolete and had been replaced by more modern buildings. That figure, of course, includes any type of house, even the worst hovel that there was in the country, and the fact that there has been that increase does not in any way mean that the problem is even yet within sight of completion everywhere.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The problem that there is now, however, is not the problem that there was in 1947.  The problem that there is now is one of building more modern houses at a price that will be within <Col N="1982" /> the means and within the income of the people who will be going into occupation of them.  The Minister has indicated that in his view the operation of the various supplementary schemes by local authorities under the 1950 Act, as restricted by the 1952 Act, will assist people to build themselves rather than that local authorities should build for them.  I personally hope very much that that is so, but I think that quite apart from that, having got over the difficulty of supply and material that there was in the earlier post-war years we should now apply ourselves to the problem of the cost, and the problem of bringing the cost of the houses, whether it is by way of rent or by way of annuity to redeem the principal and interest, within the means of the people who are going into these houses.  So far as I can see there has been no inquiry at all into that general housing problem since what I might term the Colivet Inquiry which reported in 1943.  That inquiry, though reporting in 1943, was, of course, dealing almost entirely with pre-war problems.  The actual work that was done during the war was not of any very great value for comparison purposes or otherwise, as it was clearly emergency work, finishing to some extent contracts that had been begun before and doing a little work here and there wherever a little material was available.</P>
    <P>As I say, without a factual inquiry of some sort here it would be almost impossible to assess how our costs have varied since pre-war days and whether anything more could be done to reduce costs in simplification of design while keeping comfort and standards to a reasonable level.  There was across the water a committee set up to investigate that problem of cost and to keep it under investigation. While the figures that were reported there would not be comparable with those that we might have here, yet I would like the Minister when he is concluding to tell us whether from the information available to him in his Department, he is able to say whether the trend here follows more or less the same lines as the trend there.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1983" /> In the report of that committee, which is called the &ldquo;Cost of House Building, Third Report&rdquo;, published in 1952, they set forth that the cost of building a three bed-roomed house had risen by approximately three times from 1939 to 1947, that apparently the cost had gone up from £400 per house to approximately £1,200 per house; and to account for a large share of that increased cost, they found that there was an increase of 45 per cent. in the number of man-hours which were required to build a comparable house in 1947 compared with 1939.  They found that that increase was equivalent to a decline of 31 per cent. in output per man.  I would not think that those figures would have the same relevant effect here.  I think that here our increase would not have been represented by the same decline in output and that, in fact, what one might term the organisation of house building&mdash;leaving aside the difficulties of supply in 1947&mdash;has probably improved here with the years rather than diminished.</P>
    <P>Continuing on the figures that they gave in their report, they computed the building cost in October, 1947, at £1,242 and the total costs, including site costs and professional charges, at £1,400.  In October, 1949, that increase had gone from £1,242 to £1,321 with a total cost, including site cost, and so forth, of £1,550.  In October, 1951, it had again risen to £1,450 and £1,690, respectively.  So far as I can analyse the figures given in that report, the floor space of the houses increased during the period that is covered by only 21 square feet&mdash;from 1,029 square feet to 1,050 square feet.  Therefore, we may take it that the figures they give are more or less comparable for the same type of house.  That striking increase in cost brought clearly to mind the essential task of producing some type of better organisation, some better simplification of design while keeping comfort and modern standards, which would mean that the rising cost would be reduced as far as possible.</P>
    <P>While I appreciate that the Department criticise and consider plans of local authority houses from the point <Col N="1984" /> of view of trying to make suggestions that will assist from an economic point of view, nevertheless I think it will be agreed on all sides that not enough is done in that respect.  I think it is undeniable that there could be even better organisation of work in the building industry, even better simplification of design, that would have a substantial effect in restraining further increases in cost, if nothing more.  Undoubtedly, the fact that there has been a freezing of competition, that there is now very much more competition for tenders for work by local authorities, has meant that comparative costs have declined to some extent but the costs have not declined sufficiently to meet the economic difficulty of the people who will be going in to live in these houses.  I would suggest to the House that it is to that problem that we should devote ourselves if we are going to go on with the solution of our housing problems.</P>
    <P>I found some difficulty in following the Minister's view that there was not going to be a decrease in housing activities.  I agree with him, of course, when he says that local authority housing is only a part of the problem. It is a part of the problem which was, of necessity&mdash;with the supply position as it was in 1948, 1949 and 1950&mdash;the larger part.  It will not be the larger part perhaps in the future and it is essential that we should consider carefully everything we can do to make certain that private building is enabled to carry on and provide the service for our people at the minimum cost.</P>
    <P>I do not quite understand the Minister's reference to the increase of £300,000 in the Estimate, on the one hand, for grants under the Housing Act of 1948 and his figure in which he suggests that the allocations of housing grants more or less are running on the same level as last year.  It would seem to me that the two are contradictory rather than that they are indications of the same trend.</P>
    <P>So far as private building is concerned there was introduced some time ago&mdash;I am not quite clear exactly when&mdash;a very desirable system by virtue of which, when a block application is made for the development of a <Col N="1985" /> housing estate, grants are allocated at a smaller fee for the approval if the whole estate is applied for at the one time.  Naturally, the effect of that to me is that there is a substantially larger application for grants and, therefore, applications for grants in advance of the actual work.  Unless that it so, when we take into account the decrease that there is in employment in the industry, it is impossible to reconcile the grant position with the number of persons who are employed.</P>
    <P>Incidentally, in passing and in dealing with this problem, might I say that I think it is probably not at the door of the Minister's own Department that the blame might be laid, but might I protest at the delay in the issue of the report of the Department? The last report issued, so far as the Library shows, is that for the year ending 31st March, 1951.  Now, two and a half years afterwards, we might expect a report.  I am sure that the Minister will tell us that that is the Stationery Office and the printing end of it, but it is an inordinate delay and it materially hinders consideration of the problem.</P>
    <P>If we look at the <i>Statistical Survey,</i> published a short time ago by the Statistics Office, we find that unemployment in the general building trade rose between 1950 and 1952 from 9.6 per cent. to 11.8 per cent.  In respect of bricks, building materials, pottery and so forth, unemployment rose from 3.3 per cent. to 4 per cent.  It also rose in respect of other construction works from 16.1 per cent. to 17 per cent.  There cannot be that rise in unemployment, as reflected in the statistics&mdash;there cannot be the evidence that all of us have individually witnessed in various parts of the country of substantial unemployment in the building trade&mdash;and yet be the continuance of building at the same level that the Minister has suggested in the speech which he has just delivered.  The only way in which I could reconcile the figures about grants is in respect of allocation being made in advance for large and substantial blocks in order to get the grants allowed at the lower rate.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1986" /> If one takes the figures in respect of those sites which have been acquired but which have not yet been developed &mdash;excluding, as I think we must, Dublin, because it seems to me that the problem in Dublin City is entirely different from the problem in the rest of the country&mdash;it would seem that, so far as local authority housing is concerned in a substantial part of the country, these bodies feel that it is unnecessary for them to develop to the full those further sites and that they visualise a very substantial slowing up. Everything, therefore, points to the fact that we have to make the position easier, that there will have to be an inducement for the person who is going to purchase under the Small Dwellings Act and that the cost of purchasing under that Act will not be prohibitive and will not be more than he feels he can afford.</P>
    <P>From time to time, various assessments have been made as to what proportion of income should be devoted to housing costs.  Recently, when Deputy Briscoe, Deputy Corish, the Parliamentary Secretary to the Government and I were in Canada, the Parliamentary Secretary and I made some inquiries as to costings there, particularly in relation to income.  The figures, of course, would only be of value as percentages, because incomes, when translated from dollars to sterling, mean very little.  I did ascertain there, however, that the National Housing Board set up under their housing Act gave the advice in all their pamphlets that what a person was going to have to pay for interest on the purchase price of his house, for his rates and taxes, should not exceed 20 per cent. of income.</P>
    <P>When we speak here of the percentage of income that is to be attributed to the cost of a house we never think of it in terms of anything but pure rent.  Perhaps on account of differential schemes as such we are inclined to think of our percentages in terms of rent and not inclined to think of them as a bulk global figure which includes rent, rates and taxes.  The differential rent schemes all over the country differ in individual cases, running <Col N="1987" /> from one-tenth of the income in the very low income groups up to onesixth, but again that relates purely to rent, as such.  I wonder if the Minister has any comparative figures to show what is the proportion of income which, by and large, works out as the general level in respect of rent, rates and taxes in any particular area.</P>

      <P>It is added to the rent, but is not included in the figure upon which the rent is assessed as a proportion of income.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>That is the case in Dublin, too.  In Dublin, in the first assessment of the tenant's rent, the rates are not brought in.  The weekly rent figure is struck as a proportion of the income going into the house and then there is taken a proportion of the yearly rates, which is added to the weekly rent figure.  The Deputy is a member of the Dublin Corporation and I am not.  I have only the figures the Dublin Corporation sent down to us in Kildare as being their figures when we wanted to compare our differential rent scheme with the differential rent schemes of other local authorities.  We were assured that that was the way the corporation operate it.  If we were <Col N="1988" /> assured incorrectly, no doubt the Deputy will be able to indicate in what respect it is incorrect.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>Certainly.  We do, too, but the proportionate rent computation on income does not include rates.  They are added afterwards and I think the Deputy, though he is a member of the Dublin Corporation, will find that is the way these figures are arrived at.</P>
      <P>Another thing we found done there was that the National Housing Board loans, which would be the equivalent of our small dwellings loans, provide that people earning wages pay their interest or annuity monthly rather than half-yearly.  So far as I know, that is not usual here and I think it is an arrangement of which advantage might be taken here to ensure that people will not have to meet in a lump sum a heavy impost.  Theoretically there is no difference between paying a certain amount once in six months or spread over six separate months, but we all know that in practice it is a very considerable advantage to wage earners to be able to pay over a period.</P>
      <P>They also have an arrangement that farmers who are borrowing for building their houses can, if they so desire, make their repayment instalments fall due at the particular time of the year at which their type of farming brings in their return.  In the grain areas it would be immediately after the harvest, and so forth. They can opt at the time of taking their loan and buying their houses for the date they would wish their instalments to fall due so that it will coincide with the time at which, in the normal course, they have their funds.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1989" /> We were told there also that their estimate of what they could cope with &mdash;having a bearing on the matter to which the Minister referred in relation to planning difficulties, the co-ordination of other works programmes of building&mdash;was an annual increase of 3 per cent. on the dwellings in any particular area; that if there was an urban area of 10,000 dwellings and their servicing of new dwellings was to keep pace with the building, a figure of 3 per cent. was about what they could manage.  I should like if the Minister would give us some indication of how that would compare with our experience here.  I noticed that the Minister, when referring to the coordination of building work programmes, presumably was referring only to works that were directly under his Department.  Of course, there would also be the question of schools, churches and transport facilities which would have a very substantial effect on new housing estates and new housing schemes.</P>
    <P>In the encouragement of private building, there is a very much better system of plans provided.  For a dollar it is possible to purchase a book&mdash;I suppose that is the best way to describe it&mdash;of plans of 67 different types of houses.  I do not profess to be an expert on plans but I think that people here who intend to build houses themselves speak&mdash;I was going to say with derision&mdash;not in very flattering terms of the plans provided by the Department.  I think there is very great room for improvement in the way of bringing out more attractive plans and providing a very much greater variety of designs.  The number of plans that are available is small.  Certainly if a much wider variety of plans were made available for purchase through the Stationery Office in Dublin or through some other agency down the country, it would substantially encourage building.  There might be, perhaps, the objection that if we did publicise plans too much, people would be inclined to depend on them too much and that they would not get sufficient skilled attention for the buildings.  I think that the competition which exists in the building industry to-day will act as a brake in that respect compared <Col N="1990" /> with what might happen if we were back to the difficult supply position that obtained in 1948 and immediately afterwards.</P>
    <P>I think that Deputy Lynch, the Parliamentary Secretary to the Government, will agree with me, as we discussed the matter there, and that Deputy Corish and Deputy Briscoe will also agree that, as regards the facilities provided, the ordinary traditional house built here is infinitely preferable to that which is built for the person of smaller means in Canada.  I was somewhat disappointed in that connection that we did not have some statement from the Minister with regard to his experience at the housing congress which he attended in Lisbon.  Because of the plentiful supplies of timber in Canada, the tendency there was very much towards timber erections that would not last so long and the roofing materials were bitumen felt.  If we were to put such materials on houses built by local authorities here, I rather think that the Minister or any member of a local authority who would advocate the use of these materials would hardly get away with his life.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>Has the Deputy any experience of the cost of maintenance of a felt roof?  I have had, in the case of outhouses, and I know how big the cost is because inevitably such roofs on outhouses require very much greater attention than a slate, a tile or an asbestos roof.  I do not see any reason why the cost of maintenance would be any different in the case of a dwelling-house.  I imagine it would be rather greater.  Perhaps I am wrong in that respect and that some architect or engineer would be able to give a more accurate estimate.  It is not a development that I should like to see here anyway as, undoubtedly, such roofs would have a shorter life and they would materially increase the risk of fire.</P>
      <P>I do not suppose that the rate of interest on small dwellings loans is entirely a matter for the Minister.  I am not quite clear, the rate being governed by the rate laid down for loans from the Local Loans Fund as determined by the Minister for dis-Finance, whether it is matter for discussion on this Estimate other than by way of a passing reference to the cost of houses.  As I understand it, the Minister is not the person who fixes the rate of interest but of course it does have a very substantial effect on costs.  We had all been hoping to see, without going into the financial problems of last year, now that interest rates have been reduced this year by at least one quarter per cent., that there would have been a comparable reduction in advances from the Local Loans Fund particularly for small dwellings loans, but so far we have not seen any such announcement.  As I may not discuss the matter directly on this Estimate, I would urge on the Minister that it is one of the things that it is absolutely essential we should do, to give the necessary encouragement in the erections of small dwellings and to decrease the costs for people who desire to acquire such dwellings.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>Unfortunately the rates for loans from the Local Loans Fund are fixed by the Minister for Finance and, therefore, I do not think the matter is entirely relevant to this debate.  Of course the whole problem of housing is governed by the question of cost.  We all understand that, but I understood that, while one might make a passing reference to it, one could not discuss interest rates as such on this Estimate.</P>
      <P>There is another thing which I think is desirable of extension throughout the country.  Many people in various parts of the country would be quite prepared to build their own house, particularly adjacent to towns, if they were able to get a site.  In Dublin, sites are developed more <i>en bloc,</i> but in the country there is none of that block development at all.  There was, I think, under the Act of 1950, which was introduced by Deputy Keyes, provision that local authorities could, if they desired, buy sites and lease or sell these sites to private individuals who propose to build with the assistance of the Small Dwellings Act or otherwise. I do not know how far that power has been exercised throughout the country, but it would be a desirable power, I submit, and one which the Minister should urge local authorities to extend as far as possible.</P>
      <P>In Kildare we did that in respect of one site at Droichead Nua and I think those Deputies who come from the South will agree that it is a nice scheme and was worth while doing.  In other areas I have frequently come across people who are quite prepared to erect their own house with the assistance of the grant and a Small Dwellings Act loan, but it was utterly impossible for them to get a site.  I urge, therefore, that local authorities should be asked to give early consideration to acquiring sites for the purpose of letting these sites, either by way of long lease or by way of direct sale to people anxious to buy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The difficulty about the direct sale is that the capital cost of the site cannot be included in the assessment of value for the Small Dwellings Act loan and therefore it increases the deposit which the person has to put <Col N="1993" /> down.  The only way of dealing with it so far as we could find was to make a lease for a period of years at what would be the equivalent of the interest by way of annuity to repay the cost of the site and thereafter at a nominal one shilling a year, which had the effect of doing exactly the same thing and yet did not contravene the terms of the Act.</P>
    <P>Apart from the question of housing, the Minister adverted to the amounts that were being made available for grants for roads and employment on roads and bridges.  I notice however that he did not make any references to the Local Authorities (Works) Act. One of the worst features of this Estimate is the fact that the amount under sub-head K for the execution of works under the Local Authorities (Works) Act has been reduced from £650,000 to £400,000.  Last year in his reply the Minister defended the decrease that there had been in the Estimate by saying that he had seen some work carried out under that Act that had not been satisfactorily done. I am quite sure that many of us in respect of any single side or section of local authority or central Government work could point to something that was not done very satisfactorily.</P>
    <P>I have seen recently road work carried out in a particular way under the direct instructions of the Department and before it was even concluded it was found that the departmental instructions, while excellent apparently for certain types of foundation, were entirely unsatisfactory for that foundation and therefore the work had to be ripped up.  I do not on that account propose to condemn the entire system of road construction, but that was the analogy that the Minister was applying to the drainage work done under the Local Authorities (Works) Act.</P>
    <P>All of us, whether we are on these benches or on the benches opposite, have agreed without question that there was a lot of extremely valuable work done under that Act.  I remember that one of the people who was agitating for something like that at the time was Deputy Corry, who wanted power for the Cork County Council to do work such as was given <Col N="1994" /> to local authorities under that Act.</P>
    <P>Not merely has the Minister kept to the reduced figure of last year but he has brought the figure down again this year by a further £250,000.  When the Minister is comparing the employment that might be given on roads and bridges I think it would be fairer if he took the figures for employment on roads, bridges and drainage works by county councils and compared the figures of the employment that would be given one year with another in respect of those three sections of work rather than two sections alone.</P>
    <P>I have before me the position in 1950.  There were then 18,300 people employed on roads and bridges and there were 11,200 employed on works under the Local Authorities (Works) Act.  These are the average figures for that year.  In the following year the figures were 17,900 and 8,100, respectively.  If the Minister took the addition mentioned in his speech when reviewing last year he would find, if he took the bulk employment of all three, the figure would be reduced very substantially indeed.</P>
    <P>I think the reduction under sub-head K is a very retrograde step and that the Minister should make certain when framing the Estimate for next year that he will take issue with the Minister for Finance and see that in his Estimate for 1954-55 the amount of money provided for the work that still remains to be done of that productive type will be restored to its former figure, or at any rate to a substantial proportion of it.</P>
    <P>Other Deputies, I am sure, have had, as I have had, complaints made to them about the delay in the payment of grants to local authorities on the one hand and to individuals on the other hand.  One of the greatest hindrances in getting small contractors to do building work throughout the country is the fact that they feel that grants will not be paid to them punctually for the work they are undertaking. While I admit that the delay is not as bad as it was this time last year, when it was appalling, nevertheless I think there is still very substantial room for further improvement.</P>
    <P>The worst problem that is affecting <Col N="1995" /> local authorities in respect of existing houses is the question of repair.  The Minister did not indicate in his speech that he had any solution in his mind for that.  It seems to me that the only possible solution is that local authorities would make an all-out drive to put their houses into proper repair and, when they have done that, give every encouragement and assistance to the tenants who occupy them to purchase them.  In that connection, looking at the number of cottages that are vested&mdash;I do not know whether or not it is due to the influence of the Minister or the Cavan County Council&mdash;I see that the Cavan County Council has, perhaps, the highest percentage of cottages vested throughout the country.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cunningham</NameTxt>
      <P>Last week, I listened to a contribution by Deputy Rooney on this Valuation Bill.  Listening to him speak, one would think that this Bill sets out to remedy all the injustices and right all the grievances that exist in regard to valuation.  It does no such thing.  It sets out to remedy the position so far as business premises and farm buildings are concerned.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>During last week's debate I heard Deputy Byrne plead for the owners of business premises in the City of Dublin.  He said that business people in the city were afraid to carry out repairs because they feared their valuations would be increased.  He seemed to indicate that the business community in Dublin were on the verge <Col N="1996" /> of bankruptcy, forgetting that a few years ago the cry from the Opposition Benches was that the business people were highway robbers and should be behind locked doors.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesHickey" hpid="Mr. Hickey Mr. Hickey">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LiamCunningham" hpid="Mr. Cunningham Mr. Cunningham">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cunningham</NameTxt>
      <P>Even if I were an Independent Deputy, I would vote against this Bill for the one important reason that it does nothing to relieve rates on cottages occupied by farm labourers and other classes of labourers.  Labourers' cottages do not benefit under this Bill.  That is a serious omission.  To my mind it is one which renders the Bill such that the majority in this House cannot see their way to support it.</P>
      <P>I know that the rates on labourers' cottages constitute a heavy addition to the weekly rent.  I have in mind proposed schemes for labourers' cottages in County Donegal where the prospective tenants are now asked to agree to pay rates to the tune of 3/6 per week in addition to a weekly rent of 6/6.  What is the point in giving concessions in respect of other buildings when we neglect to reduce the rates on labourers' cottages?  These cottages are occupied by one of the most important sections of our community, the farm labourer and the labourer in houses built by the county council.  Three and sixpence per week in rates on an already high rent is, I think, loading the dice very heavily against the agricultural worker and the manual worker in other occupations. For that reason I am very strongly opposed to this measure.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The second objection I have to the Bill is that while it proposes amendments it does not affect premises which have been revalued in the past or premises in respect of which a revision of valuations took place. Actually, it preserves the <i>status quo</i> in respect of those.  In my constituency we have the Buncrana revision of valuations, the <i>status quo</i> of which I for one do not want to see preserved. If this Bill became law the Buncrana revision of valuations which took place there would not be affected.  The <Col N="1997" /> people would be left to suffer as they are.</P>
    <P>I just want to explain what took place there.  Two or three years the urban council sought for and was granted a 100 per cent.  revision of valuations.  They hoped that many valuations which might be too small and others which might be excessive would be evened up.  A 100 per cent. revision took place, with the result that the total valuation of the town jumped from £7,000 to £11,000.  I do not want to see that position being made permanent in any valuation legislation which passes through this House.</P>

      <P>In this particular case a grievous injustice has been done.  We are, by other means, asking to have that remedied.  That is why any measure which makes permanent an injustice does not get my support. This measure is very limited in its scope.  I admit that there are injustices in the valuation code, but this Bill does not cater for the people who are suffering most under these injustices. For that reason, I am opposed to it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MatthewOReilly" hpid="Mr. M. O'Reilly Mr. M. O'Reilly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. O'Reilly</NameTxt>
      <P>Some years ago we had a very elaborate committee set up to consider the question of derating. That committee reported that the chief problem left for consideration was this: Suppose derating is removed entirely, who is going to provide the money which the rates formerly provided?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This measure is more or less in the same category.  Suppose that the valuation <Col N="1998" /> of premises that are repaired is reduced, then the rates will be reduced, and if money is required, as I am sure it will be, who is going to provide it? Are there to be extra charges on the taxpayer?  To my mind, this Bill is political nonsense or political deception because, as I have said, if the money is required it must be met and must come from some source.  I do not suppose that you can revalue land, but, of course, we can revalue houses. But suppose we did revalue land, what difference would it make?  Is it not all a question of the means we adopt to collect rates?  If the rates are reduced, there will be no means of collecting what is required from income-tax.</P>
    <P>There is no doubt that Griffith's valuation is very much out of date at present, perhaps not so much in the towns.  Revaluation is quite a big problem, and would cost quite a lot of money.  Griffith's valuation was a grain valuation.  It was a bit more than that.  The landlords at that time were beginning to feel the pinch.  Quite a few of them were able to get in touch with Griffith&mdash;he had a big connection &mdash;in order that they might be able to borrow more money, and so they got the poor law valuation of land increased. The borrowing of money on land is, to a large extent, controlled by the poor law valuation.  Some of these lands which were valued very highly have deteriorated to a large extent.  That is so in the County Clare, and, of course, that land is not equal to such a valuation now.  The result is that the people who are now paying on that valuation are in debt.</P>
    <P>I believe myself that if improvements are made to a residence, or to a business house, these should be subject to an increased rate.  I do not believe myself that business people are going to improve their premises without having a fair idea that it will mean an improvement in their business. Therefore, they are being asked to pay on the improvements they carry out.  What puzzles me is who is going to put up the money if the rates are reduced.  Is the income-tax to be increased? <Col N="1999" /> The money will have to be got from some source.  It strikes me that there is nothing in this Bill.  It is just a piece of nonsense, due to the fact that money has been greatly inflated. The pound is the pound anyway. These premises are worth a lot more pounds to-day than they were worth ten or 20 years ago.  If the owners have to pay, they are just paying in inflated money values.  I see nothing at all in this principle.  In the County Meath, for example, we have a big number of labourers' cottages.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamDavin" hpid="Mr. Davin Mr. Davin">

      <P>Quite so.  The occupiers of the labourers' cottages get no relief under this Bill.  We have quite a big number of them, and they quite possibly would have to contribute more in rates under this Bill than the owners of some business premises in our larger towns.  I think that the effect of this Bill would, to a large extent, be unfair to the community generally.  It would mean giving a good deal of preference to certain sections of the community, but the point is that the poorer sections would have to pay more in rates, although they are the people who are entitled to most relief.</P>

      <P>That is possible, but there should be no necessity for an amendment.  The Bill should cover all sections if it is intended to do any good.  My idea is that what it proposes is to change money from one pocket to another, and that, I suggest, is deception.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelJDavern" hpid="Mr. Davern Mr. Davern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Davern</NameTxt>
      <P>It strikes me as rather strange that, if there is a necessity for a Bill of this kind to-day, the same necessity was not there a few years ago.  Why, therefore, did the Fine Gael Party when it had the power and a majority not introduce this Bill then? I think we are all agreed that the <Col N="2000" /> largest ratepayers at the moment are the working people who have gone into occupation of new houses.  Their valuations are based on modern conditions in life.  I think that any Bill of this kind should have the interests of the workers at heart and should strive to give them relief.  That is not being done.  Those people are paying on very high valuations in proportion to the amount of property they own.  Perhaps I should not say own, because really they are only tenants.  They scarcely have the right of succession in their homes.  I think everyone will agree that, to-day, the valuation of workers' houses in this country is very high in proportion to what they own.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Perhaps somebody would say that a general revaluation of the country would be the fairest thing to do.  I am inclined to agree with that.  On the one hand we have advocates claiming that the ratepayers pay very little and on the other hand we have the smaller types of houses annually valued at rather a substantial rate.  We heard Dublin Deputies, in particular, telling us about the high valuations in Dublin. They forgot to tell us of the high volume of business being done in Dublin.  It is only natural to expect that if the Valuation Commissioners find a large volume of business they will increase that valuation when their attention is drawn to it.  I know full well that there are many people in this country getting under the wire, so to speak.  I would much prefer to see a Bill in this House which would have for its purpose some intention of meeting and remedying the situation that arises in many parts of Ireland, in city and country alike.  I know that people who are industrious and who try perhaps for the sake of better business and for the sake of improving their premises are what you might call penalised.  However, we hope that in the very near future a Bill will be introduced which will help to discontinue a situation which is very much out of place and in which people are penalised for spending money on their premises although they are incidentally beautifying our cities and towns.  They are helping to put us on the map by assisting us to show, especially to <Col N="2001" /> foreigners who come into this country, that we have and can have beautiful cities and beautiful towns that can compare favourably with those in any other country.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJDavern" hpid="Mr. Davern Mr. Davern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Davern</NameTxt>
      <P>When I speak too loudly, I am accused by Deputy Davin of bothering him, so I am trying by a better type of elocution to fill his poor empty belfry with very good ideas regarding valuation in this country.  As I said, it might be better to have a revaluation of the country and even then I think it would be right to say that there should not be any such thing as penalising people by increasing their valuations because they were prepared to invest money in their business.</P>
      <P>That applies in particular to the licensed trade because not alone are the rates increased but, unfortunately, in addition, their licence duty is increased very substantially.  Where there is £1 of an increase in valuation on a licensed house, the licence duty increases by 50 per cent.  Therefore you will see that the people who have most reason to grumble in regard to valuations are the licensed traders. They have a double grievance if their valuation is increased.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If we are going to have an alteration of valuation and a comprehensive survey, I would think it should be done after very full consideration and study of the conditions obtaining in the country.  Any Bill of its kind should also legislate for a reduction in valuation <Col N="2002" /> where a reduction is found necessary.  I feel that certainly applies in the case of labourers' cottages.  If we were to have general revaluation, I feel that many of the workers' houses should be considered for reductions in valuation.</P>
    <P>The Government has promised&mdash;and I think I can speak with sufficient authority on this&mdash;that a Bill will be introduced in a very short time which will meet a long-felt want.  We are going to have a two-thirds remission of rates for seven years.  I believe that is the type of Bill this House should welcome and I do not see any great reason for panic legislation.  If we had to carry on for many years under the present code there is no reason why another month or two would cause us great heartburn.  The question of valuation is a very ticklish one which must be handled very carefully so that all sections of the community will be dealt with fairly.  The remission of rates for seven years will not alone be fair to the people who will benefit but will also be of immense value to entice moneyed people to improve their business premises.  Let us hope that it will increase their business when they have the courage to invest money in it and give good employment by so doing.</P>
    <P>The principal objection to this Bill is that it does not in any way help those who are labouring under grievances&mdash;people who may have neglected in the past to appeal against the valuation of the Valuation Commissioners, people who for one reason or another found they were not financially in a position to go into court and fight the Valuation Commissioners there.  It gives them no redress whatsoever.  I believe that any Bill of this kind should have that as one of the very particular things in it. People of that kind with a grievance look forward always to obtaining redress some day.  This Bill gives them no scope for any redress.</P>
    <P>Needless to say, everybody whose valuation is increased will say they have been harshly dealt with.  I can appreciate that.  I know the law is there for them, but very often it is <Col N="2003" /> not possible for them to take advantage of it.  They may come to the conclusion that after spending money in law they are back to where they started.  In addition to having to pay a higher rate, they will have a higher bill to pay to solicitor or counsel if brought into court.</P>
    <P>We all feel that the valuations in the country need to be reconsidered. The valuation of land cannot be touched&mdash;and it is a very good thing that it cannot.  I suppose it is only right to reconsider it where people by reconstruction or by building new houses are obtaining large volumes of business as a result of their enterprise. On the one hand they suffer but on the other hand they gain.  As I said this evening on another Bill, what they lose on the swings they make up on the roundabouts.  We must agree that the question of valuations in general must be the concern of every Government. It is very unpopular for any Government to have a general revaluation of the country.  That was proposed some years ago and if it had been carried out there would have been less grumbling about valuation than there is to day, and we would have many more people taking advantage of reconstruction grants, building grants and loans.  At present, they are to a great extent afraid to carry out improvements, because of the danger of revision of the valuation of premises, farmhouses or homes.</P>
    <P>We know the rates are not what they used to be 40 or 50 years ago.  We know that every £ of valuation means a substantial reduction in the net income of the people concerned. There is hardly anyone optimistic enough to think that there will be any great reduction in rates in the future. The tendency all over the country, with the high cost of roads, water supplies and other things, is for the rates to continue to soar.  People are not content now as they were 40 years ago to bring water three or four miles in an old can or go to a well a mile and a half away, perhaps through a few fields.  The tendency is to seek more regional water supplies, other amenities of life, better roads and so on. <Col N="2004" /> All these things mean higher rates, and in their own way they have a serious connection with the valuation of the places concerned.  When the rates were low&mdash;I myself remember when they were 5/- or 6/- in the £&mdash; valuations were not the great concern they are to-day.  Now, as the rate gets higher so also greater becomes the concern of people with high valuations.</P>
    <P>Some Dublin Deputies talked about the high valuations in Dublin.  The people of Dublin have not much to grumble about, so far as the amenities of life are concerned.  In the rural areas, people on substantially high valuations are denied the amenities of life enjoyed by our people in the cities and towns.</P>

      <P>I was trying to point out to the House the many reasons why this Bill should not pass. Deputies on the other side know full well that the Minister for Local Government intended to introduce a Bill and I cannot understand this attempt to forestall him.  A serious effort will have to be made to redress the grievances that exist under the valuation code at the present time; this Bill will not do that.  If the time spent in discussing this measure had been devoted to co-operation in trying to get a satisfactory measure considered by a Select Committee of the House, valuable work could have been done.  Given co-operation we should be able to produce a Bill to remedy existing grievances.  I believe that, given co-operation, we would have a great measure of support for a general revaluation under which all would be brought to the same level and all would contribute fairly and equitably to the burden of rates.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Davern</NameTxt>
      <P>That is not what I have in mind.  I have in mind a Bill something similar to the Defence Bill, to which the Deputy contributed in large measure.  Any Valuation Bill will have to be divorced from politics, otherwise <Col N="2007" /> we will never successfully remedy the thousand-and-one grievances that exist. Nor will we ever rid ourselves of the cancerous growths in the present valuation code as a whole.  The Opposition would make a generous gesture if they agreed now to support the Government in any steps they take to eliminate existing grievances in relation to valuations.  We will never have a decent valuation code unless the House treats the matter seriously and decides that no political kudos can be gained by any Party here through the medium of the valuation system.</P>
      <P>I appeal to the Opposition to withdraw this Bill.  If passed, it may bring, justly or otherwise, some political kudos.  I appeal to them to face up to their responsibilities in this matter.  None of us is satisfied with the valuation code at the moment.</P>
      <P>An overhaul of this code as at present applied, especially to the licensed trade, is long overdue.  At every street corner or crossroads where this question is discussed the general opinion expressed by country people is that they are prepared to take their crack on condition that it is universal, that everybody else is put in the same boat.  If that were the case, there would be more equitable distribution of rates.</P>
      <P>I would be only too happy if I thought we had solved the many difficulties contained in the existing code. We will not solve these difficulties until we put the nation before Party and until the question of valuation is divorced from politics.  That is a matter that the people would appreciate more than cross-fire in the House and the expression of opinions that would not stand scrutiny.</P>

      <P>Consideration of many aspects of the question of revaluation is long overdue.  I have asked repeated questions here for a number of years as to the revaluation of Cork City.  I shall not support anything that will prevent that.  Unfortunately, Cork County has to join Cork City in every public service, such as the boards of assistance, mental hospitals, sanatoria, <Col N="2008" /> where the question of valuation arises. In home assistance alone, of every 1/- collected 9d. is paid by the rural area attached to Cork City.</P>

      <P>I will come to that later. Threepence is paid by the Cork City people and, in the distribution of home assistance, Cork City gets 8d. and the rest of the county gets 4d.  That is a very handy way of doing business, I admit, for a certain class of plutocrats. The valuation of Cork City took place in 1852 and there has been no revaluation since.  The poor people, who should be Deputy Hickey's personal care, the people of the suburbs, the people who were driven outside the city walls, are now paying on the new valuation basis for new houses.  In Cork City the valuations on big business premises are lower in some cases than the valuations on labourers' houses.  Deputy Hickey knows that. These are the facts.  It is a glaring matter that demands rectification.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MartinJohnCorry" hpid="Mr. Corry Mr. Corry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corry</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;which has been grossly over-valued, valued under entirely different circumstances from the circumstances that exist to-day, a town which even in doing its utmost cannot meet its county council obligations as regards rates due to over-valuation, due to the fact that that town has three times the valuation of any other town of its size in Cork County.  As a matter of fact, the situation there was so glaring that it is the one town in this country that can boast that it succeeded in getting 33? reduction in ground rents owing to the grossly high valuation that was placed on it.  The town was valued in entirely different circumstances when there was a British fleet in Cobh Harbour, when that harbour was the last sight that thousands of our people saw of this country in the days of the emigrant ship.  That was the period when that town was valued.  It is time that there was a revaluation of it for the purpose of reducing its valuation and reducing its rate&mdash;complete revaluation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Those are points that are sticking out and points that prevent me from <Col N="2011" /> voting for any measure of this description.  You have practically the same thing existing in any rural town to-day.  You have built up outside that town practically a new town in each case.  I would say that as regards Cork City the valuation of the suburbs has increased something like 300 per cent. in the last 20 years.  Deputy Hickey knows that.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Corry</NameTxt>
      <P>It would be time for me to know my geography.  You have springing up outside each of those towns at present a new town due to our housing schemes.  On those houses a new valuation is being placed, a different valuation altogether, and a valuation that means that the rural areas surrounding that city have to pay the piper and the people living in those houses who are very largely the poorer classes, very largely people whom the corporation in the old days would put outside the walls of the city, are paying the new rate.  But you have those people in the city proper who are getting all the business and the <Col N="2012" /> profit from that situation.  They are quite happy because they are paying under the old valuation.  That is why I certainly would not put any obstacle whatever in the way as far as revaluation of that city is concerned, or anything that would prevent a revaluation of the town of Cobh with a view to bringing it down to what it should properly be.  A business premises in Cobh is at present valued three times as highly as a business premises in Patrick Street in Cork, and the business done and the turnover of a shop in Patrick Street would be ten times the turnover of any business premises in Cobh.  Those are facts.</P>

      <P>Do not go spoiling it.  I would like people outside to think that all Deputies have a bit of intelligence, you know.  Therefore, I can see no justification whatever for any Bill that is going to prevent justice being done in so far as ratepayers with no redress here are concerned, and in my opinion this Bill would prevent justice being done in that respect.  I have endeavoured here time and again to bring to the notice of all governments the outrageous condition of affairs that exists in so far as the six rural areas that were attached to Cork City both for mental hospital, for home assistance and other things are concerned.  It is a disgrace that those plutocrats living in luxury there in the city on the earnings of the unfortunate people for <Col N="2013" /> 20 miles around, having all that wealth, the hard-earned wealth of the countryside, pouring into them, should be allowed to get away with the valuations that were made away back in 1852.  It is time that that situation was changed, and I am hoping now that we will have a revaluation in so far as Cork City and the town of Cobh are concerned.  It is long overdue.  I do not wish to hold up the House.  I came in here for the purpose of not allowing this Bill to go through without putting before the House that picture of the 9d. paid and the 4d. got back as far as the six rural areas surrounding Cork City are concerned.</P>
      <P>I have referred to it repeatedly here in this House.  My colleague, Mr. Broderick, the chairman of the Cork County Council, when he was a Deputy, called attention to it as well. It still exists and it is there like an ulcer eating into the earnings of the unfortunate people outside.  I am suggesting that that situation should be remedied and I am also stating that, in my opinion, this will prevent the remedying of that situation.</P>

      <P>In my opinion, this Bill will, if enacted, make matters worse.  A lot of things need to be remedied in the valuation system of this country.  Quite recently I came across an example in point.  The Commissioners of Valuation went down to an area to value turbary.  They went along to this townland and they put a valuation on the turbary of a very small farmer.  The unfortunate man knew nothing about it until he was presented with a demand note for payment of the money.  He went to the county manager and complained about the matter.</P>

    <Speaker pid="EugeneGilbride" hpid="Mr. Gilbride Mr. Gilbride">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gilbride</NameTxt>
      <P>I hope that satisfies Deputy Rooney.  This man of whom I was speaking knew nothing whatever about the valuation which was placed on his turbary until he was presented with a demand note for payment.  He went to the county manager and complained about the matter.  The county manager informed him that he was under no obligation to send him any word in regard to imposing this valuation. He further informed the man that he could appeal the following year.  The man did so and it was found that this turbary right should not have been valued at all.  However, the man had no remedy.  He had to pay that money which was wrongfully demanded of him and he was at the loss of all that money.  I submit that that is something that should be covered in a Bill of the kind which we are now discussing.  Is there, however, anything about it in the Bill?  There is not.  This Bill is purely and simply what it has been described&mdash;a Bill for one particular class and, as has been pointed out by many Deputies, that is a class that can best afford it.  The people who are to benefit under this Bill are the people in the towns and cities who improve their premises in order to save on surtax and income-tax. I can see nothing in the world wrong with asking these people to pay additional rates and, as a country Deputy, I have no hesitation in saying that here.  I cannot see how any <Col N="2015" /> country Deputy or any Labour Deputy will vote for a Bill of this nature which is for the purpose of relieving moneyed people at the expense of the small people.</P>
      <P>Revaluation is a very big question. I heard a Deputy, whom I had considered to be a responsible Deputy. state that the rate collectors wanted valuations increased in order to get more poundage.  The increase in valuation does not mean a thing.  If the valuation of the country were doubled to-morrow it would not make any difference. The same amount of money would be collected and would be required for the upkeep of certain services.  The rise in valuation has not anything to do with it.  I do not know whether a general revaluation would improve matters one bit.  It is a matter on which there could be a great deal of controversy because, no matter what might be done, there could be complaints.</P>
      <P>This Bill is for one certain class. Until a Bill is introduced that will relieve a lot of the grievances which different people have in regard to valuations, I do not think that we will make any progress in this matter.  I know that there are grievances.  Take, for instance, the one which I mentioned just a few moments ago of the very small farmer whose turbary was valued.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I heard remarks passed in this House about towns becoming derelict and people selling out.  That very remark was passed about my own native town and, since it was made, I have received letters from various people in that town asking me to repudiate that statement.  There is no truth whatsoever in it.  In fact, there is a bigger demand for houses in that town now than there ever was.  I think that 80 houses were given out in Sligo town by Sligo Corporation last Monday night, and there is still a waiting list of over 100 applicants for new houses.  That does not indicate that the town is becoming derelict or that the houses are being sold out.  If there is a waiting list of 100 applicants, I submit that it shows that quite the opposite is, in <Col N="2016" /> fact, the truth, and that, instead of people selling out and leaving the town, people are anxious to settle in it.</P>
    <P>Any man who makes a statement to the effect that the people in a town are selling out and that the town is becoming derelict is, I submit, doing a great disservice not only to the town itself but to our community in general. We are asking people to invest their money in industry in that town and in other towns.  I submit that irresponsible statements can do a great deal of damage because no man will come in and invest his money in industry in a town which is dying out.  People should be more careful and think before they make rash statements.</P>
    <P>When a Bill is introduced into this House which will cope with the grievances that exist in our present valuation code I think it will receive the general support of this House. However, a Bill such as this Bill, whose purpose is to relieve one section of the community&mdash;people who in my opinion are better able to bear it than the poorer sections&mdash;will not receive general agreement and I submit that it is only by general agreement that we will get a Bill of the kind which is wanted.  Some Deputies have already said that this Bill is merely a device to get us talking about this subject.  I suppose that any talk there has been on the matter is all to the good but I do not see how any Deputy can honestly support a Bill of this kind which is for the purpose of relieving one class of the community.  Therefore I think this Bill should be withdrawn.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PeadarCowan" hpid="Captain Cowan Captain Cowan">
      <NameTxt>Captain Cowan</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes.  I have been intrigued by the debate and by the observations we have had from all sides of the House in regard to this matter.  Obviously the matter of valuation and rates is very important and serious so far as the country is concerned because anybody who owns any property contributes a certain <Col N="2017" /> amount of money each year to the local authority by way of rates.</P>
      <P>During the course of this debate I heard the arguments advanced from either side of the House and I think it may be taken that, generally, the members of the House are unanimous in their opinion that the present system of rating is a bad system of rating and that it ought to be changed.</P>
      <P>I think the House is almost unanimous on another point of view that there are so many difficulties in the way that it is impossible to see how an alteration can be brought about without the setting up of a very laborious and costly inquiry which would spend many years probing into it.  I am wondering whether we have the right approach at all to it.  It strikes me as ridiculous, to some extent, that we should have a system of rating at all and I will put forward a view which would suggest itself from the general consensus of ideas which have been expressed during the debate.  If the system is so nonsensical as has been suggested by people opposed to it and so impossible to improve, why can we not get rid of it altogether?  Why can we not abolish it?  Why can we not do away with it and relieve all the people in the towns and the country of this fixed charge that comes along every year in respect of rates and property?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I see no reason in the world why we should have a system of rating.  The amount which the local authorities obtain from the rating of property is a very small sum in the general total of State taxation and I think that if the amount collected by local authorities by means of rates were transferred to the responsibility of the Central Fund and collected in taxes it would be a fairer way of dealing with the matter. Our rating system was introduced in 1852&mdash;what is known as the Griffith valuation, though I am not altogether sure of that&mdash;and obviously it cannot apply properly or equitably now.  For quite a number of years I have heard political Parties advocating the complete abolition of rates in regard to agricultural land.  We had that programme for quite a long time and I am <Col N="2018" /> wondering what great upset there would be to the State if we abolished rates on property entirely.  We might have to substitute some form of property tax&mdash;I do not know&mdash;but it seems to me that this old system of valuation has outlived its usefulness and that there is no great reason why we should continue it.</P>
    <P>If one studies the history of poor law valuation, one will find that, for a long period, rights of voting, rights of election and rights of representation depended on poor law valuation.  It was an important factor in the development of democracy and there were limitations imposed on the right of people to be represented, or at least to have any say in their representation, by the different poor law valuations. The House having had a most enlightening discussion on the question of rates, it should now decide that this Bill, a Private Members' Bill as it is, should be left aside and that some committee might be set up representing the House to consider whether or not we want to continue the system of poor law valuation as it exists in Ireland.  There are so many anomalies, so many difficulties and so many defects connected with it that I think it is a matter well worthy of study.</P>
    <P>This Bill was introduced by Deputy O'Higgins, who made a very good case for the particular point he has put before the House, but the whole system of rating is so big that he is dealing only with a small part of a big problem.  If he realises&mdash;and I think the sponsors of the Bill realise &mdash;that even if this Bill were to be accepted by the House in the form in which it has been introduced, it would create more difficulties than exist at the moment.  It is a most involved, complicated, antiquated and archaic system and I think it ought to be examined in its entirety rather than that we should make an attempt to deal with one small aspect of it now. I am very grateful to Deputies for the very valuable information they have given me as to the complexities of this problem and I hope the House will accept the very sensible suggestion I make with regard to it now.</P>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Brennan Mr. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>Every speaker in this debate is agreed on one point&mdash;that our valuation system does call for some overhaul.  Those of us who are members of local authorities are painfully aware of the inequity of the present system and we are also well aware that the Bill, while there is good in it, goes a very short distance towards covering any of the problems which exist in relation to valuation. One of the principal grievances held by ratepayers at large is the fact that, even in the same small village, you will find one house the valuation of which has been increased recently and side by side with it another house on which the rates are based on a low valuation struck many years ago.</P>
      <P>We in Donegal have the example of the town of Buncrana where a revision of valuation was asked for by the urban district council by a majority vote of one.  The casting vote of the chairman carried a motion asking for a revision of the valuation of the urban area.  The valuation was in the vicinity of £7,000. Rather promptly, the revenue people responded and a revaluation was carried out.  The people of that town found their valuation increased to a gross total of over £11,000.  These people have a very genuine grievance in a county where the rates are 35/- in the £ when they see their neighbours paying that high rate on a valuation which may have been struck 50 years ago.  I may tell the House that, in common with many other people whose valuations were increased recently, they are looking to this House to introduce some form of legislation that will bring some equity into the system whereby these people contribute to the annual rates.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PeadarCowan" hpid="Captain Cowan Captain Cowan">
      <NameTxt>Captain Cowan</NameTxt>
      <P>I asked the Minister for Justice the following question today:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;To ask the Minister for Justice if he will state whether special instructions directing members of the Garda Síochána to warn children alleged to have committed offences <Col N="2020" /> instead of bringing them before district justices have been issued recently; and, if so, if he will state what those instructions are and whether they were issued with his authority.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>To that question the Minister replied:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;The Commissioner, Garda Síochána, has issued instructions that children under 14 years of age are not to be prosecuted by the police for minor offences in any case until the district officer has considered the circumstances of the case, and that if the district officer is satisfied&mdash;</P>
    <P>(a)  that the offence can be regarded as a childish lapse,</P>
    <P>(b)  that the child is not of a criminal disposition,</P>
    <P>(c)  that his parents can be relied on to discipline him,</P>
    <P>(d)  that the injured party does not desire to see the child prosecuted, and</P>
    <P>(e)  that no person over 14 years of age is involved in the offence and is being prosecuted for it,</P>
    <P>the district officer may direct that the case be disposed of by a warning given to the child in the presence of his parents.</P>
    <P>The instructions were issued with the knowledge and approval of the Attorney-General, who was consulted beforehand.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>When I heard that reply, I indicated that I did not think it was a matter that could be dealt with satisfactorily on the basis of supplementary question and answer, and I gave notice that, with your approval, Sir, I would raise the matter on the Adjournment.  I want to say at the beginning that I welcome the fact that the Commissioner of the Garda has issued instructions of this kind to the members of the Garda because, in many debates dealing with the Department of Justice, I have indicated in this House that I disapproved of the practice of bringing before the District Court little children of eight, nine, ten, 11 or 12 years of age on rather trivial or minor offences.  I <Col N="2021" /> felt that there were grave objections to the bringing of these children before the court.  I instanced the case of the Dublin District Court, which is under the control of one of our most distinguished district justices, who is internationally recognised as an authority on this matter of alleged offences by children and, in fact, of child welfare in that regard.  Even in his court, children who had been brought there from all over the city, although they might feel on their way to the court that it was a serious matter to be brought there, once they had congregated in the waiting room and had met boys of their own age from different parts of the city and began to exchange stories about the reasons why they were there, took a different view of the matter.  I felt that that was detrimental in a general way for the children, and I suggested that perhaps it would be better if these children were not brought before the court at all.</P>
    <P>I am very glad to discover that the Commissioner has gone into this matter and has issued regulations which the Minister mentioned here this afternoon in answer to my question.  There are two aspects of the Commissioner's instruction with which I want to deal specially.  The first is that dealt with in sub-paragraph (d)&mdash;that the injured party does not desire to see the child prosecuted.  If the child commits an offence which the local district officer, the local superintendent, considers a childish lapse, I think we would all agree that there should be no prosecution in that case.  If, further, the local superintendent is of opinion that the child is not of a criminal disposition, we would all agree also that there should be no court proceedings in that case.  His parents can be relied upon to discipline him and I think we would all agree that the parents should discipline him rather than that he should be brought before the court and brought into an atmosphere which at his age may result in harm to him.</P>
    <P>The Commissioner's instructions say further that if no person over 14 years of age is involved in the offence and is being prosecuted for it, the district officer may direct that the case be disposed of by a warning given to the <Col N="2022" /> child in the presence of its parents.  I object to the injured party having any say in the decision as to whether there should be a prosecution or not.  Take a case where a little child of eight, nine or ten years of age steals three oranges out of a shop.  The owner of the shop reports the matter to the Guards.  It is up to the Guards to deal with the case in accordance with law and I think the House and the Minister would agree with me that the owner of these oranges should have no right to say whether the child should be prosecuted in court or not, because the owner of the oranges may be a cranky sort of person who would maliciously want to see the parents and the child hauled before the court.</P>
    <P>I want to make the point, in the first place, that the injured party, or as I described him, the owner of the oranges, should have no say&mdash;good, bad or indifferent&mdash;as to whether the child should be prosecuted.  I think the House will agree with me in that. We know what human nature is.  We know that a person of ordinary humane instincts would not desire a prosecution of any kind to be brought against a little child of ten, 11, 12, 13 or 14 years of age but we do know that unfortunately in our community, as in other countries, there are spiteful, malicious people and if the police officer went to such a person and said: &ldquo;We would not like to bring that child to court; are you agreeable that the charge should be dropped?&rdquo;  a malicious type of person would say: &ldquo;No, I want this young blackguard brought before the court.&rdquo;  I do not think the owner of the three oranges, the &ldquo;comic&rdquo;, or whatever it may happen to be, should have that right and I would take strong exception to it.  I am perfectly certain the Minister would agree that that is a point which should get more investigation in view of the objection taken to it.</P>
    <P>The next point which I mentioned to the Ceann Comhairle that I wanted very specially to raise was that the district officer may direct that the case be disposed of by a warning given to the child in the presence of his parents.  I feel that is objectionable. In this country where we have a Constitution <Col N="2023" /> based on Christian principles, a Constitution based on the authority of the parents and on the integrity of the home, if a child commits an offence that is of a trivial nature his parents can be relied upon to discipline him.  If that child is to be dealt with he can only be dealt with properly either by the court or by the child's parents.</P>
    <P>The point I want to make is that where an offence is considered to be of such a trivial nature that it should not be dealt with by the court, then the only other persons who have authority under the Constitution and the Christian outlook of this country to deal with the child, are the parents of the child, particularly where the parents are people who can be relied on to discipline the child.</P>
    <P>If the Guards are to warn children, I want to try and visualise what it would appear like.  A district officer may be of opinion that if there is a trivial childish lapse the matter should be brought to the notice of the parents.  In these circumstances, is a Guard to go to that house, is he to go in uniform or in mufti, is he to go alone or with somebody else?  When he goes into the house is he to say to the father: &ldquo;I want you and your wife to attend before me in this room bringing this child, Patrick, with you&rdquo;?  Are we to have a court in that room, a judicial hearing and what is the nature of the warning that is to be issued by the Guard to the little child?</P>
    <P>These are the difficulties which have struck me in regard to this, the conditions that make this procedure envisaged by the Commissioner objectionable. If one of my children committed a trivial offence of that nature, and if a Garda officer came to me and said that he wanted me to parade the child in the room and warn him in my presence, I would take the most serious objection to that.  I would feel that as a parent I was the person entitled to issue the warning or to take disciplinary steps myself, and I think the Minister would agree with that.  I am not condemning the Commissioner in regard to this, nor am I condemning the Minister or raising any point of <Col N="2024" /> criticism.  I think that very sound steps have been taken in bringing this matter to light, but I am taking the earliest opportunity to draw attention to what I consider are objectionable features in regard to it.</P>
    <P>There is another point we cannot lose sight of.  There is always the danger that a matter of this kind can be used as a sort of corruption or blackmail against the parents of the child.  The Guard can say to the parents: &ldquo;I could bring your boy to court but I am going to let him off with a warning and not bring him to court.&rdquo;  There are so many objections connected with that that I do not like to think where it could possibly lead. I would much prefer, if there is to be a warning given, that it should be given by an experienced district justice rather than by a person who would have no knowledge of how to deal with a little child in matters of this kind.  I put it to the Minister that there are so many difficulties and dangers involved that the question of the injured party having the right to say whether there should be a prosecution or not or a Guard having the right of warning should be reconsidered by the Minister and the Commissioner.</P>
    <P>There are other matters that will arise out of that which can also be considered.  One is that if this happens on two occasions or on three occasions what is to be done?  If the parents are not likely to discipline the child what is to be done?  I suggest to the Minister that where we have, as we have in Dublin, a most experienced district justice who is dealing with these problems in regard to these children every day of the week and these experienced court probation officers who are dealing with children every day of the week, it would be desirable for the Minister, the Attorney-General, the Commissioner of the Gardaí and the district justice to get together and work out some system that would be satisfactory.</P>
    <P>One thing which is always upheld in this country and in any country based on the form of democracy we have is that the judiciary is separate from <Col N="2025" /> the Executive.  The police are part of the executive authority, and if you give the police the authority to warn children you are giving them judicial functions in matters of a criminal kind and that has been resisted by all the people who are authorities on this particular matter.  The Guards are entitled to say: &ldquo;We will take no proceedings.&rdquo;  They do that on many occasions.  They are entitled, if they get a complaint about a child, to refer it to the parents, because the parents are the important factor as far as dealing with children is concerned. But they are not entitled, or cannot be permitted, to take upon themselves to say: &ldquo;We will warn this child in this form or in the other form.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I notice that in Dublin City, particularly in connection with children going to school, in recent years the Garda authorities have put Guards on duty to see that school children cross the road in safety.  I have been most impressed and delighted to see the spirit of comradeship and friendship between these children and the Guards.  I want to see that spirit maintained.  I do not want the Guards to be put in the position of being bogey-men to children.  I oppose on general principles the right of Guards to exercise judicial authority or to warn anybody, whether a child or a citizen, in connection with this matter.  I say that the Minister and the Garda Commissioner are taking a very important progressive step forward. I am asking the Minister to consider these two provisions with regard to the instruction in the light of the objections I have advanced in regard to them.</P>

      <P>I am afraid that the Deputy has raised matters that did not occur to me.  There is, however, one thing which I do not know how we are to get over, and that is the right of any injured party to prosecute.

      <P>Take the case of children playing football.  That is a very minor offence.  I do not see anything wrong in the Guard saying to the boys playing football: &ldquo;You better stop this.  You know you are committing an offence by doing that.&rdquo;  I can see no objection to a Guard doing that much. Suppose an adult parks his motor car in the wrong place.  That also is a minor offence.  If the Guard says to that person:  &ldquo;You better move on or I will have to prosecute you&rdquo; is that an exercise of a judicial function?  I do not think so.  As far as I understand Deputy Cowan he suggests that if a warning is to be issued it should be the district justice who should issue it.</P>

I agree that the parents ought to do it but we all know that there are parents who will not do it.  In such cases there is no alternative but to let the police do it.</P>

      <Col N="2028" /> I am glad the Deputy and other members of the House approve of the move that has been made.  It is ridiculous to prosecute a small child for very small offences.
