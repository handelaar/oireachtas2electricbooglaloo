    <Speaker pid="PatrickJCrotty" hpid="Mr. Crotty Mr. Crotty">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Crotty</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Industry and Commerce if, in view of the increasing unemployment in the anthracite collieries in Kilkenny, he proposes to prohibit the import of anthracite coal to this country.</P>

      <NameTxt>Parliamentary Secretary to the Government (Mr. Lynch) (for Minister for Industry and Commerce)</NameTxt>
      <P>As I indicated in reply to a similar question <Col N="1718" /> on 25th March, 1953, I have already taken steps to arrange that as from 1st January last anthracite would be imported only in quantities sufficient to bridge the gap between home production and estimated requirements. These steps are now fully effective.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJCrotty" hpid="Mr. Crotty Mr. Crotty">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Crotty</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Parliamentary Secretary aware that the production of the collieries here is ample for the home market?  At the present time miners are leaving these collieries, going to England to work and producing anthracite in Wales to send to Ireland?  I would ask the Parliamentary Secretary to prohibit completely the imports of anthracite until we have full employment in this industry.</P>

      <NameTxt>Brendán Mac Fheórais</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Parliamentary Secretary aware that Irish-produced anthracite is being sold in Britain at £5 or £6 a ton as compared with £9 a ton which people have to pay here?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Lynch Mr. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not aware of the price but I am aware there were recent exports of quantities of anthracite from this country.  As regards Deputy Crotty's remarks, I do not think he could suggest that the Minister or the Government could take any other steps than to restrict imports to such quantities as would be sufficient to supplement home production, having regard to estimated requirements.  That has been done and if there are difficulties in some areas they have not been communicated to the Department.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJCrotty" hpid="Mr. Crotty Mr. Crotty">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Crotty</NameTxt>
      <P>Apparently the Parliamentary Secretary is not aware that the Irish mines are fully capable of supplying the whole Irish market; and not alone that, they have a surplus. Due to the unemployment position at the present time and the lack of sales, production is being cut down altogether.</P>

I have also been informed by the board that of the other areas in West Cork which have applied for and are awaiting development under the scheme some have already been investigated and the others are awaiting investigation. Pending the results of these investigations it is not possible to forecast when the electrical development of the areas will take place.</P>

      <P>My attention has been drawn to a Press report of the 20th April, 1953, which indicated that different prices were quoted for the supply of meat to district institutions in Longford.</P>
      <P>It is a duty of the staff of each institution to ensure that the meat supplied is satisfactory.  In particular, medical officers of such institutions must inspect all provisions, including meat, supplied to the institutions as often as is necessary but at least once a week and any meat regarded as unsatisfactory is rejected.  I have no reason to believe that these arrangements, which are of general application, will prove inadequate in Longford.</P>

      <P>It is good to have even that microscopic move.  Will the Minister say when this benefit is likely to be available to these insured persons because what is happening at the moment is that either they are not having the urgent dental treatment carried out or, if they have it carried out, they are asked to pay very high fees to dentists in a private capacity?</P>

      <P>I can quite understand that the Minister wants to relate the pattern in Kildare to the proposals received from elsewhere, but these proposals have been submitted to him for some time and the persons concerned are in receipt of low rates of wages. The Minister knows that they are unable to bear the burden of the present cost of living on these low rates of wages.  Would he, therefore, expedite consideration of this matter, so that these lowly-paid workers may be paid the increases granted to them by the county council?</P>

      <P>The reference to the former Minister, which was broadcast in a sponsored programme on April 17th, was jocose but not insulting.  I understand that this record was not passed for inclusion in the programme by the Radio Eireann staff, and the producers of the programme have since apologised for including it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should add that I will give every encouragement to the director to make <Col N="1733" /> use of traditional or current political ballads, songs and comedy patter such as can be heard at concerts and variety shows all over the democratic world, using discrimination to ensure that there is genuine humour and that the composition is not vicious in content. Songs have been sung already about Ministers in office and there have been no complaints.  I do not propose to inquire into the character of the song referred to by the Deputy but to rely on the good sense of the director for having not passed it for broadcasting.</P>

I do not know what statement was attributed to the Minister, but it seems to me that, if the matter is raised here, we are entitled to know what statement the Minister is objecting to.  Otherwise, the Minister could have met you in the corridor and have had a that with you, and said that he disliked this, and the matter could have been fixed up in that way; but when it is brought into the House, and when the House apparently is being made the forum for raising this matter, surely we are <Col N="1759" /> entitled to know what has hurt the delicate skin of the Minister, and what is the statement he complains of.  If the Minister goes to you, Sir, in the corridor and consults you, I am not interested, but if the Minister raises the matter in the House, then I think the House is entitled to know what it is being asked to correct.  This volume is described as the &ldquo;Official Dáil Report,&rdquo; and we should know what monkeying about is going to be done with it before we agree.</P>

      <P>On a point of order.  In relation to your remark, Sir, as to what you will do about consulting the Minister's speech and seeing whether this paragraph is in it, may I remind you that this is a speech which was made by Deputy Costello in the presence of the Minister for Finance?  We find the Minister for Finance intervening by way of interruption at practically that very time. Surely, whatever the position is, nothing can be done without consulting Deputy Costello in the matter.  Are we to understand that the words that are going to be considered are the words following the words &ldquo;In his speech yesterday the Minister merely stated&rdquo;?  The words which follow are:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;I am presenting to the people this year the results of all the hardships they have gone through, of all the cruel impositions that were inflicted upon them, of all the misery that was suffered by them.&rdquo;</P>

      <P>When I moved to report progress last night, I was dealing with <Col N="1764" /> the charge which was frequently levelled at the Government that the recent Budget was calculated to retard production, to create unemployment and to accelerate emigration.  In support of my argument I was pointing out the big advance made on the road towards recovery over the last two years in agricultural production, brought about mainly by the policy of Fianna Fáil.  I was dealing with prices, markets and the marketing system in general and I was pointing out, first of all, that there were guaranteed prices for milk, meat, beef, wheat, barley, poultry and eggs.</P>
      <P>I was pointing out that the Government have succeeded in securing agreements abroad for the sale of our agricultural produce.  Towards that end and in order to boost production at home, they have extended the service of technical advice to farmers; they have provided financial assistance for the purchase of equipment and farm implements; they have extended and improved the various farm improvement schemes; and they have allotted more moneys towards their operation. Fianna Fáil increased the price of milk for the farmers, who got an increase shortly after Fianna Fáil came to power, and recently they secured another increase.  The guaranteed price for beet has increased by over 10/- per ton since the Government came into power, while at the same time additional free rail and other transport is provided now to the factory. The basic price of wheat has increased by 15/- per barrel since June, 1951.</P>
      <P>I do not propose to weary the House by going into detail regarding the Government's policy on agriculture. It is a well-known fact that, with less propaganda than the Opposition used when they were a Government, but with more purpose, we have succeeded in boosting agricultural exports.  We have succeeded in reserving the home market and in guaranteeing a price for the commodities I mention.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Fine Gael's attitude to this Budget and to the 1952 Budget is and was a desire to create an air of uncertainty, to give the impression that the business <Col N="1765" /> and affairs generally of the State were being mishandled.  My answer to that is the statistics published with regard to agriculture, with regard to industry and with regard to every other activity which goes to maintain the State.</P>
    <P>One of the best arguments one could use against that propaganda is the success of the national loan and the fact that that loan was taken up inside our own shores by Irish people&mdash; and not, be it noted, by the big financiers but by the small holders, the men who bought anything from £1 to £500 worth.  That shows in general that both farmers and the business community realise that the State's affairs are being handled in a businesslike fashion.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnOLeary1943" hpid="Mr. O'Leary Mr. O'Leary">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrankCarter" hpid="Mr. Carter Mr. Carter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Carter</NameTxt>
      <P>I will deal with that subject later.  They realise that the State's business is progressing on better and more efficient and, in general, more wholesome lines.  We are often told that good housekeeping methods pay dividends and that good husbandry in our economy also pays dividends.  Despite the charges made by the Opposition that unemployment and emigration have increased, I think we can go a good distance on the road to denying both these charges. I pointed out last night that employment had increased by upwards of 25,000 people, that we had put 25,000 extra people into employment since we took office in 1951.  Labour Deputies may shake their heads and may disagree with that statement, if they wish, but the figures are there and they speak for themselves.  It must be remembered also that the former Government carried an unemployment pool of upwards of 60,000 on an average.  If we make provision for the very extended social welfare benefits which came into operation under the present Government, we find that the raising of the means test to enable a man to apply for unemployment assistance has brought a considerable number of people on to the register who were there previously but were not eligible to draw unemployment assistance.</P>

    <Speaker pid="FrankCarter" hpid="Mr. Carter Mr. Carter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Carter</NameTxt>
      <P>They were small farmers and I can produce figures, if the Deputy wants to be convinced.  It brought on upwards of 9,000 people. As well, a number of people came back from England to claim unemployment benefit, reciprocal insurance, here, and I can give the figure from 5th January last when our extended social welfare services became operative to 30th April, 1953, of those claiming reciprocal insurance&mdash;4,090 people.  That meant 4,000 more people on the register whom the Opposition claim we forced out of regular employment.  It must be realised that in Liverpool, Manchester and various industrial cities in England unemployment has risen.  The figures for unemployment published some time ago in the <i>Manchester Guardian</i> reveal that unemployment has risen steeply and it must also be remembered that it is harder for an Irish man or woman emigrating to England to secure employment in England than it was here at home.  I am not trying to make an excuse on that basis, however, but I am trying to point out that we succeeded in bringing on to the register a large number of people who were not heretofore on the register.</P>
      <P>Regarding charges made that prices have increased, the position is that prices increased, as we all know, following the outbreak of the Korean War.  There was a scramble as between country and country to buy necessary goods and services, with the result that raw materials, transport charges and labour charges increased, which increases, in turn, showed themselves in an increase in the cost of living here. If it did, however, the Government took very effective steps to offset that increase by the process of wage adjustments and by including certain people within the scope of the social welfare legislation, so that it is not a valid charge to say that the Government did nothing regarding the cost of living. The cost of living increased by the same number of points during the régime of the former Government as under this Government.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Carter</NameTxt>
      <P>Sorry, a Cheann Comhairle.  I said, Sir, that we were taking effective steps to obviate the <Col N="1768" /> necessity to import New Zealand or Danish butter if we are allowed but the Opposition want to have it both ways.  We were trying to give better prices to the farmer; we were trying to give better conditions to the farm labourer.  There is ample evidence that we did something, that we did make a genuine effort to help both the farmer and the farm labourer.  We cannot do these things without increasing costs. Increased costs must be met from the price to the consumer.</P>
      <P>The charge has been levelled against us that the 1952 Budget resulted in a very steep increase in the cost of living.  I notice that when spokesmen of the Opposition refer, in dealing with that matter, to the period when food was subsidised they always go on the assumption that a man or woman could live on the rations that then obtained. They very conveniently forget, as Deputy Norton when he was commenting on the Budget the other night forgot, that there was a dual price system in operation, that at that time anybody who was short of rationed goods could go into the free market&mdash;some of us used to refer to it as the black market; it was a sort of black market&mdash;and could purchase sugar at 9d. a lb., flour at 7/- per stone, a 2-lb. loaf at 1/- and tea at 6/6 per lb.  We only get one side of the picture.  That is never mentioned by the Opposition when they are dealing with statistics regarding the Budget or with increased costs.</P>
      <P>In my opinion the Government have made a fair offer both on the industrial side and on the agricultural side. Shortly after taking office they gave encouragement to the cement factories to extend at Drogheda and Limerick. They gave encouragement to the sugar factories to extend their operations. We are beginning to see the result of that.  They guaranteed and they increased the price of beet, which has resulted in an increase of 11,000 acres of beet.  They encouraged Bord na Móna to go ahead and increase production and made the necessary money available to them to purchase the equipment for that purpose.  Therefore, when those wild charges are made by the Opposition speakers I should like to see them substantiating them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1769" /> We have created better conditions for our Defence Forces and have made £4,000,000 available to them to equip them to defend, if necessary, our shores.  The land reclamation scheme is going ahead.  It has been extended and the conditions for a farmer applying made easier.  The arterial drainage scheme has been expanded.  We hear about the cuts under the Local Authorities (Works) Act.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnOLeary1943" hpid="Mr. O'Leary Mr. O'Leary">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Leary</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrankCarter" hpid="Mr. Carter Mr. Carter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Carter</NameTxt>
      <P>The Opposition forget again that we have made available £850,000 from the Road Fund, as a result of the increased motor taxation, for the making of better roads and to relieve unemployment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnOLeary1943" hpid="Mr. O'Leary Mr. O'Leary">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>And you will not sanction road workers' wages.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrankCarter" hpid="Mr. Carter Mr. Carter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Carter</NameTxt>
      <P>In addition £400,000 has been made available for roads in congested areas.  There were certain charges levelled against the Government in connection with the Local Authorities (Works) Act.  I believe that any system of drainage should be linked up with arterial drainage.  The way in which the Local Authorities (Works) Act was being indiscriminately administered, if you like, was causing a certain amount of waste.  I have no hesitation in saying that.  I suggest that the moneys made available for roads, for roads in the congested areas and for the various other schemes, for harbours, for arterial drainage, would nearly absorb most of the people who might be disemployed as a result of the reduction in the Local Authorities (Works) Act grants.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In addition, the Government have made provision for better housing.  As I pointed out last night, for the first time county councils have access to the Local Loans Fund.  That is a very important step.  It is a counter argument to Deputy Finan's suggestion that we are doing nothing for the small farmer.  Heretofore a small farmer who wanted to reconstruct his house would get a grant only from the Department of Local Government.  Now he can get a supplementary grant from the local authority.  If he wants to build a new <Col N="1770" /> house he can get a grant from his local authority supplemented by a loan through the Local Loans Fund.  It is not fair, therefore, to suggest that this Administration have done nothing for the farmer.</P>
    <P>I submit that, having regard to our period in office, the Government have done a fair job of work, that the 1953 Budget is designed to consolidate the advance made so far and to prepare for a still further advance.  Given the opportunity and the co-operation of the people, despite the harmful propaganda of the Opposition, we can see the road ahead for the next two or three years at any rate.  By that time all this talk of prices, wages and living conditions will be put on one side if Fianna Fáil continues to advance as they have advanced for the last two years.  They are going about it in a businesslike way.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GenSeanMacEoin" hpid="General MacEoin General MacEoin">
      <NameTxt>General MacEoin</NameTxt>
      <P>This Budget is a continuation of last year's imposts. In the Budget speech of the Minister last year and in various statements made by other members of the Government during the past year the defence made for the harshness of that Budget was that the inter-Party Government left them wallowing in debt.  There was no question about the fact that it was a harsh Budget.  The Government Front Bench spokesman admitted that it was a harsh Budget but said that the necessity for it was the debts left to them by their predecessors.  If that reason for that harsh Budget was false or untrue, then not only was it harsh but unjust and unreasonable.  I propose to show beyond yea or nay that there was no necessity for the harshness of last year's Budget and certainly no necessity for a continuation of it this year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Before I do that I should like to point out errors made by Deputy Cogan and the Deputy who has just sat down.  Deputy Cogan said that the Government had stated that the limit of taxation had been reached and he made an appeal to the Government to state that the limit of local rates had also been reached.  Of course, what the Government said was that unless and until we get wealtheir no additional taxation could be put on.  Then Deputy <Col N="1771" /> Cogan and Deputy Carter start off to prove that we have got wealthier.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesEverett" hpid="Mr. Everett Mr. Everett">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GenSeanMacEoin" hpid="General MacEoin General MacEoin">
      <NameTxt>General MacEoin</NameTxt>
      <P>That we bought Tulyar and that we can go ahead with impunity, that the all-clear was given to the Minister to impose taxation in the Budget or by the method adopted by the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs or the method adopted by the Minister for Industry and Commerce of concealed taxation during the year. Speaking last night, the Tánaiste said that we were over the slump, so that there was a slump.  Notwithstanding what Deputy Carter, Deputy Cogan or Deputy Dr. Browne or anybody else may say, there was a slump last year and there were hardships imposed. But the Tánaiste last night said we are getting over it, that we have reached that stage, and that it took last year's Budget to do it.  What has that Budget done?  Notwithstanding what anybody may say to the contrary, it has increased unemployment.  Hardships have been imposed upon a very large section of our people, and this Budget will continue to impose them for another 12 months or until such time as this Government will go to the country and we will be able to get them out and have an opportunity of re-examining the whole matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister for Finance in his speech very blandly used two or three phrases which I thought could only be used by a Minister with his audacity for saying things.  He said that this Budget was within the capacity and the willingness of the people to pay; in other words, that they were delighted and that they should now be very grateful for having the capacity and the willingness to pay, and that they should not be given any remissions this year.  It is well known that the turnover of various businesses has decreased.  We know that the banks have restricted credit to business people, to builders and other people like that, and that where they have given it they have charged 6 per cent. so that the money is too dear for the people to make a profit on it afterwards. When any farmer or any businessman <Col N="1772" /> pays 6 per cent. for an overdraft, for whom is he working?  He is working for the bank or whatever finance corporation lends him the money.  The Minister for Posts and Telegraphs two or three times stated that the Budget was harsh and severe, but that the Government should not be blamed for that, that the unscrupulous people who formed the Government before them went out leaving them these debts.  Government spokesmen then built up a case on figures as false as could be produced. When we left a sum of £24,000,000 odd in the kitty how could we have left them debts?</P>
    <P>This year the Minister for Finance and the Government took out of the kitty £600,000 to buy Constellations. There was a sum of £600,000 in the kitty somewhere.  According to the Minister for Industry and Commerce, when we buy Constellations it does not cost the taxpayer one penny.  Why? Because the inter-Party Government left in the kitty somewhere this sum of £600,000.  The Minister for External Affairs told us in answer to a parliamentary question that the scheme for the distribution of the Marshall Aid grant of £6,000,000 is now before the United States Government.  The Minister knows that they propose to spend that £6,000,000 on the ground limestone scheme, on educational institutions and so on.  The fact is that most of the schemes which the Government have submitted to the United States Government are included in the Book of Estimates and therefore the Government have £6,000,000 to play with, and when the Minister for Finance and the Government say they propose to reduce expenditure by £3,500,000 they have their tongues in their cheeks because they have £6,000,000 there with which to play.</P>
    <P>Of the Marshall Aid loan, there was £18,000,000 left, and when one takes them all together, without the carry over out of which the Minister for Finance is going to take £400,000 to buy arms and equipment, a carry over of £2,800,000, one gets then the figure of £26,000,000 or £27,000,000, leaving assets to the tune of £26,000,000 or £27,000,000.  Then one is told that the <Col N="1773" /> reason they have to impose this taxation was because the dirty rascals in the inter-Party Government left debts to the tune of £10,000,000.</P>

      <P>I will quote a few more adjectives in a moment.  Then we get a former Minister who is now, like Deputy Cogan, practically part and parcel of the Fianna Fáil Party, saying there was cooking.  If there was cooking it was cooking in the interests of the Government that came in after us.  It was cooking to the extent of leaving a kitty with a load of money in it to the tune of £27,000,000.</P>
      <P>No Government ever suffered so much at the hands of another Government's propagandist, than did Fine Gael and their colleagues.  Since they went out of office they have suffered at the hands of both the present Government and the <i>Irish Press.</i>  In some ways the <i>Irish Press</i> and the present Government are not socialist enough, but they are socialist-minded in the sense that they are determined by propaganda to control the minds not only of their own Deputies but of the general public, and their propaganda has been so astute and they have repeated it so often, people really believe that the last Government must have left some debts behind them.  When I told them that was not so the answer was: &ldquo;It's no use saying the Taoiseach would tell a lie.  Of course, we know the Minister for Finance and the Tánaiste would try their hands all right, but do not say the Taoiseach would attempt for a moment to tell an untruth.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We get the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs excelling himself.  Speaking as a member of the Government and having, I presume, a sense of collective responsibility, he asserted in Tyrrells-pass that we were on a spending spree, that the inter-Party Government was on a spending spree and that whatever prosperity we brought about was brought about because we flaked the money around, here, there and everywhere, and did not mind.  He said that people who talked about repatriating sterling assets were committing <Col N="1774" /> treason.  He made the powerful statement that the sterling assets we have were a standing army in England, fighting this nation's battles, and that anybody who attempted to preach the doctrine that they should be brought home was guilty of treason.  He said that was treasonable conduct, no less. A few nights ago in Athlone we find him again using some very nice phrases.  As reported in the <i>Irish Times</i> and in some of the other papers, on 12th May, he is reported as having said: &ldquo;Pseudo economic experts who talked, clotted, sentimental, ignorant nonsense on foreign assets.&rdquo;  He said one would think that they were a pile of ingots that could be just brought home or carried about anyway at all.</P>
    <P>Who are the pseudo-economists about whom the pseudo-intellectual Minister for Posts and Telegraphs used such words?  I would refer the Government and the members of the House to the report made by the American experts last year in which attention was drawn to the fact that we have colossal external assets and starved capital development&mdash;no capital development of any kind or to any great extent.  I am quoting from page 20 G of the report entitled &ldquo;Industrial Potential of Ireland&rdquo;:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;The manner in which legal tender notes in Ireland have been covered by investment of external assets is indicated in Table 21.  The fact that the Central Bank has made no use of its statutory power to invest its legal tender reserves in Irish Government securities has handicapped the development of an active domestic capital market in Ireland, which is one of the country's primary needs.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Are these some of the pseudo-experts, the pseudo-economists to whom the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs referred?  There is a positive statement that the Government institute and the Government bank of this country has this money and has not utilised it in the interests of the nation.  Of course, the report goes further:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;The emphasis on complete liquidity that has led the Central Bank to invest so heavily in British Exchequer Bills at interest rates of a little over 1 per cent&rdquo;&mdash;</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1775" /> and the Government has to pay 5 per cent. and are very grateful when they can get £20,000,000 at that figure&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;as against long-term British Government securities with, perhaps, a 2 per cent. higher yield has represented an annual revenue lost to Ireland of, perhaps, £500,000.  The commercial banking system of Ireland, as well, has shown a similar tendency to operate in a fashion that channels Irish deposit funds into the British capital market rather than retaining them in Ireland for domestic investment use.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>What interpretation is one to take from that?  I think it is that these external assets should be utilised for the capital development of our own country.  The pseudo-intellectual Minister for Posts and Telegraphs says that sort of talk is clotted, sentimental and ignorant.  That is the sort of answer he gives and that is the answer the Government gives to any person or body that attempts to advise the Government as to what is the right thing to do.</P>
    <P>Of course anybody who says anything contrary to what the Government thinks is described as ignorant and ill-informed.  What he says is described as nonsense, irrespective of what the subject is.  As proof of my assertion may I instance the report of the Commission of Inquiry into Vocational Organisation.  That report was described as ill-conceived, ill-considered and slovenly.  That is the kind of attack that is made in relation to every person who does not agree with the Government.  I believe that is a most dangerous line of thought and a most dangerous line of action.  There is nothing Irish in it.  Where the Government got it I do not know, but that is the philosophy they preach.</P>
    <P>This Budget still continues on the people all the hardships that were imposed in the 1952 Budget.  No income-tax reliefs are given to the middle classes or the lower income groups.  Those who have a fixed salary must pay to the last farthing.  It is admitted that the purchasing power of the £ has been considerably reduced. <Col N="1776" /> Surely then, in equity and in justice, extended allowances should be given in the lower income groups.  When the Government brought in this Budget they thought that everybody should be delighted because there was no increased taxation.  They are forgetting, however, that the Minister for Local Government during the year increased taxation to a very great extent by the additional charges upon motor vehicles and drivers' licences, and so on, then that the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs had this other thing up his sleeve, and that the Minister for Industry and Commerce has imposed and is likely to impose tariff charges by Order that will bring up a higher rate of taxes on the people. The Budget has created unemployment and in respect of the figures that Deputy Carter gave, surely he must accept the break-down figures and the other figures given by the Central Statistics Office within the Department of the Taoiseach.  Their figures show that there are approximately 84,000 people unemployed.</P>
    <P>I do not think anybody in the House looks on that situation with favour and the Government themselves must realise that without emigration at all the number of unemployed people in the country constitutes a very great hardship and a very great loss.  I am not going to charge the Government with doing that deliberately; they are not, but that is the result of their policy about which, believe it or not, the Tánaiste said last night that whether it was right or wrong it was the policy they decided on after calm, cool deliberation.  Is it not time to rectify the policy that puts at least 25,000 or 30,000 more people on the unemployment list?  Why should the Government attempt to justify it and have people like Deputy Cogan trying to prove it is a great Budget, that we are doing excellently, that we are on the high road, and then telling us that because Deputy Desmond got an answer that people were eating more bread, and so on, than ever they did before, there was no indication that the standard of living was reduced.  It is reduced and reduced considerably. Everybody knows that since the subsidies were taken off there is a <Col N="1777" /> large number of workers who are using margarine instead of butter because they cannot afford the latter commodity. I have met workers who tell me although they receive a reasonable rate of wages to get meat once or twice a week is outside their range.</P>
    <P>This Budget is a bad Budget.  It is a continuation of the hardships imposed last year and unless and until the Government change their mind or give an opportunity to the people of the country of deciding whether they approve of it or not.  I am afraid we are going to have it.  The duty rests upon the Opposition to oppose it by every means at their disposal in the House and outside it.</P>
    <P>I am satisfied that after years of experience there is no use in trying to convince Fianna Fáil that they were wrong in anything.  They are the only Party in this country that was always right.  They never made a mistake. They are the people who go on from success to success, no matter how harsh or how wrong they may have been in their decisions.  Of course, everybody knows they have made ghastly mistakes in the administration of the law and in the administration of the financial structure.  Whether they accepted the directions of the Central Bank or not, they put what the Central Bank suggested into operation. It may be that their minds and the Central Bank's mind coincided; if they did, so much the worse, because then they did not examine the Central Bank's Report at all and brought in the Budget of 1952 with a very convinced sort of mind that they were right.  As the Tánaiste said last night, right or wrong, they had done it and the people should not be carping about it.  They should like it and be pleased about it.  I would ask the Government to place this Budget on the hustings at the earliest possible moment and then we will have no doubt whatever as to whether the people have the willingness and the capacity to pay which the Minister for Finance so plainly asserts that they have.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasAnthonyKyne" hpid="Mr. Kyne Mr. Kyne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kyne</NameTxt>
      <P>This Budget has been claimed by some members on the Government side as one which does not <Col N="1778" /> impose any new taxes.  As Deputy MacEoin pointed out, if we were to concede that the increases secured by the Government through the hidden taxation imposed in various ways&mdash;by the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs in his increased charges on postal services, on telephone and telegraph services, as well as those for wireless receiving licences, and those imposed by the Minister for Local Government by way of road taxes and driving licences&mdash;were not budgetary, we still will have to admit that this Budget is no better than that of last year.  We will have to admit that if there is no direct increase, there has been no restoration of the food subsidies which were taken from the workers in 1952 so that the ordinary working person has to pay an increased price for bread, for tea, sugar and butter.  They have not been restored in this Budget to the old level maintained by the inter-Party Government.  The taxes on beer, whiskey and cigarettes remain in force and reduce purchasing power for the ordinary working person by the very same amount as they did in 1952.  All the objections that were voiced by the Labour Party in 1952 to the then Budget are equally there in 1953.</P>
      <P>My Party made a very definite statement on the Budget in 1952 in connection with food subsidies.  My Party has still the very same outlook, that they will demand the restoration of subsidies on essentials of the working people.  There is a story going about that it was the intention of the Minister to reduce the tax on whiskey and stout at the cost of increasing the price of bread by a reduction of the subsidy of some £2,000,000.  I do not know whether or not that is correct, but I should like the Minister to state clearly that, in so far as this year is concerned, there will be no removal of the subsidy on bread in part or in whole.  That assurance would be welcomed by my Party and by the people of this country because we have very grave doubts that, were it not for the two by-elections in the very near future, with the results very much in the balance, we might have heard an announcement by the Minister that the subsidy on bread would be removed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1779" /> The Minister claims as an achievement the reduction in the balance between imports and exports.  While we, in common with all Parties in the House, would like to see that balance made as close as possible, we do not agree that it is an achievement to boast of, if the reduction in the balance between imports and exports is achieved at the cost of depriving working people and their families of necessary food so that a surplus is available for export.  We shall certainly not recommend to our people that they should be satisfied with any less clothing and boots than are necessary to protect themselves and their families from the ice, snow and rain of winter, on the ground that it is the national interest that we should use less consumer goods, until such time as every section or class of this country are stripped of their luxuries and they themselves are called upon to do without food and clothing in equal measure to the working person.  If sacrifices have to be made, the worker is as well prepared to make them as anybody else, but he is not prepared to see certain sections living on the fat of the land and enjoying the world's goods while he is called upon to do without.</P>
    <P>Had the Minister been sincere and had it been necessary to have this hair-shirt policy, why was there not a system of rationing in food introduced? Why was there not a compulsory utility clothing programme advocated?  Why was there not a heavy tax on luxury goods?  Why did not the State, through its President, its Ministers and its high officials give a lead by accepting reduced salaries in token of the sacrifices that were necessary for the country?  It seems to me that when anything of that kind is needed, the weight appears to be placed on those who have to work hard for a living on a small wage.</P>
    <P>If it is necessary to have 90,000 unemployed, if it is necessary that thousands upon thousands of boys and girls should fly to England and elsewhere to earn their living so that the gap between imports and exports would be reduced, then we in the Labour Party are not happy at what <Col N="1780" /> the Minister has done, because we shall never hold that the Central Bank method of achieving that balance is the correct one.  We believe that it is as outdated a policy as any Victorian would suggest in the present year.  Only to-day, Deputy Corish and I, on behalf of our Party, received a deputation from the unemployed of this city. Three of that deputation claimed that within one week they will be filling one of the largest halls in Dublin with unemployed people clamouring for the right to work in their own city and appealing to the Government that, if they cannot give them work, at least they should give them benefit that will enable them to keep their wives and children from starving.  These men will not be led by any anti-nationals; neither will they suffer from any &ldquo;ism&rdquo; other than the danger of pauperism.  They will be appealing as Irishmen for a very simple right in this land of ours&mdash;the right to earn a living.  If this Budget indicates anything it indicates to me that not only will these people not receive any increased benefits or any increased work but that their numbers will be added to, and that the numbers seeking the emigrant ship will equally be increased.</P>
    <P>The Minister claimed that he and his Government could take credit for the increased exports of last year.  He claimed that the reduction in the balance between imports and exports was mainly due to the corrective measures&mdash;I believe these are the words he used&mdash;imposed by his Government, but it is strange to notice that the Central Bank, in their report of last year, stated that they believed that a good deal of the improvement was attributable to the fact that the stockpiling of 1951 and 1952 had stopped.  It also claimed that the increase in exports could be due in measure to the machinery introduced in the form of various farm improvement schemes which, in its turn, has yielded a percentage increase in agricultural output.  These factors did not come within Government control since the change of Government in 1951. They were the natural reactions of a policy operated prior to that.  The machinery used for the improvement <Col N="1781" /> of agricultural output, land rehabilitation and drainage is now showing the results forecast by the then Minister for Agriculture, Deputy Dillon.  I think we on this side of the House can congratulate ourselves on the fact that that portion of Government policy which had been put into operation prior to the change of Government is now returning a very fine interest to this country.  I believe we have only seen the beginning of the return that the land rehabilitation scheme and the drainage scheme will show in the years to come.</P>
    <P>The last Fianna Fáil speaker, Deputy Carter, stated he felt that the Labour Party were making too much of the unemployment question.  He even went on to quote figures to show that there were certain people added to the register that were not formerly on it.  He claimed we were using these figures, but I want to quote briefly from the Industrial Analysis of the Live Register, mid-March, 1953.  On page 2 it states:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Changes since the corresponding month last year (continued), increases, agriculture, 8,839; building, contracting and works of construction, 5,986; construction and maintenance of roads and bridges, etc., 3,288; general building, construction and repair work, 2,698.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The reason given for these increases is &ldquo;general slackness and effects of Social Welfare Act, 1952, and later incidence of 1st Employment Period Order, 1953&rdquo;.  The increase in regard to general building, construction and repair work is explained by the simple words &ldquo;general slackness&rdquo;.  The figures given in respect of sugar manufacture and bacon curing are 327 and 319 respectively.  Less employment is the reason given.  I could go right down the list including transport and communication, personal services, metal manufacturs, engineering and vehicles, and find in all these an increase in unemployment.</P>
    <P>We do not need any figures from any sources.  Those of us who are in ordinary touch with the people know that there is more unemployment this year than there was the year before <Col N="1782" /> and that there was more unemployment last year than there was the year before that.  We know there are indications that in the year to come we will have still more unemployment because of the policy pursued by the Government. It was indicated in the Central Bank report of the year before last that it was necessary we should have unemployment and less State spending so that people would reduce the amount of consumer goods in food and clothing and that we would leave more for export.  We had a denial from the Government that they would implement that policy but, as clearly as night follows day, Government policy followed the advice of the Central Bank in detail with the result foreshadowed by the Central Bank that the gap between imports and exports would be reduced at the cost of the young men and women.</P>
    <P>As a Labour Deputy in this House, it is my responsibility to draw the attention of the Government to that unemployment problem.  There are almost 90,000 men and women unemployed. It is my responsibility to appeal to the Government and to the House to do all that is humanly possible to change that position.  As a contrast, we find the Minister indicating in his Budget speech that a sum of £1,800,000 is to be raised and spent on defence weapons for this country. Here is the quotation from the Budget statement of the Minister contained at column 1205, Volume 138 of the Official Dáil Report:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;The position in relation to international affairs which the State through its successive Governments has taken involves the maintenance of a highly efficient Defence Force, a Defence Force which, whatever its numerical strength, must be up-to-date in armaments.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Can I take it from that that this Government and the previous Government have entered into an agreement with any nation or State that our Defence Force would be kept to a certain level?  I feel sure that any interpretation of that kind would be wrong because I believe that this Government and the last Government must have known that it is the wish and the will <Col N="1783" /> of the people of Ireland that no commitments should be made with any nation with regard to defence or otherwise of this country.  It is our responsibility and our responsibility alone.</P>
    <P>I would like to know how the spending of £1,800,000 on modern defence weapons can be justified in this poor country when it must be clear to everyone in this atomic age and age of remote controlled missiles that it is ridiculous providing hand grenades, tanks or even aeroplanes to a limited extent to prevent attack when we could be blotted out of existence within a matter of hours by the Powers that are competing against one another. Would it not be more honest for us to stand straight and make a virtue of our poverty and keep in this country an army of sufficient size, whether it be a small army or a police force, to quell internal revolt and make sure that this Government will be able to function in the country?  As I say, we ought to make a virtue of our poverty and say to the world that here is a nation&mdash;&mdash;</P>

I would prefer to see that money used to give our people work or to pay our civil servants.  In that respect we have a Government who are denying to the working people in the Civil Service the very rights they have compelled employers to respect under the Labour Court.  While that position continues, it is impossible for the Labour Party to do otherwise than vote against this Budget.  We ask that an opportunity be given to the people who pay taxes to express their view as to whether or not they are in favour of a continuation of them.  I would say, and I hope my Party will say in a very short time, &ldquo;let this be decided in East Cork.&rdquo;  I should like to see the Minister joining with me in saying &ldquo;let it be decided also in Wicklow.&rdquo; I suggest that when the result of these <Col N="1784" /> two by-elections come to hand this Government will have received from the people an answer in no uncertain terms.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PeadarMaher" hpid="Mr. Maher Mr. Maher">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Maher</NameTxt>
      <P>I think it can be said in truth that never in the history of a democratic Parliament has a major Opposition Party of the size and experience of Fine Gael been guilty of so many insincerities and inconsistencies as the Fine Gael Party has been over the past two years in this House. It can be truly said of them that they have hunted every hare and run with every hound in order to secure for themselves some small piece of public popularity.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Twelve months ago, when the Minister for Finance introduced his Budget proposals in the House, there was the hue-and-cry from the Opposition Benches that the Minister was budgeting for a surplus.  Leading lights of the Fine Gael Party played a prominent part in advancing that argument. I said then, and I say now, that it was designed by a bunch of lawyers and twisted in order to convince certain sections of the community that the Minister, when the financial year came to a close, would have not only enough moneys raised by way of taxation to pay for State services over the year, but that he would have a substantial surplus; that he would have a nest-egg with which to buy for himself and his Party political popularity, and that he would be able to bring in what they prophesised would be an election Budget and then have a general election.  I think that erroneous argument <Col N="1785" /> about a surplus has been blown to smithereens.  In fact, it has been clearly shown that at no time was it well-founded and that it did not hold water.</P>
    <P>I can understand that type of argument coming from Deputies who had participated in a Coalition Government, because I believe that the weaknesses which are inherent in a Coalition Government tend to make its members devote their energies to trying to manoeuvre for public popularity realising as they must the inherent weaknesses which are in such a combination. I think it is a very bad system of government, and that in no uncertain fashion it has weakened considerably the economic structure of this country.</P>
    <P>Last year, the members of the Opposition were full of glee when the Minister for Finance was reluctantly compelled to apply certain corrective measures in order to re-establish here a firm footing and a sound financial position&mdash;in other words to strengthen the general economic set-up.  I was present last week when the Minister made his Budget pronouncements and could see a certain amount of disappointment on the faces of the members of the Opposition.  They saw, when no additional burdens were being placed on the people, that their chance of again regaining control of the destinies of this nation was gone.  I could see that they were a very disappointed body of people.</P>
    <P>We have here, undoubtedly, an unemployment question.  I do not think anyone here is so immature as to contend otherwise.  It is a problem which requires the whole-hearted attention and co-operation of all sections in this House if we are to get a solution for it.  To help do that does not, I think, present any insuperable difficulty.  I do not think that the attitude or the policy that has been adopted by the Opposition is helpful.  Although as I have said, we have an unemployment question, it can be truly said that there are more people in employment to-day than there were 12 or 18 months ago.</P>
    <P>A lot of criticism has been directed towards this Party due to the fact that the Minister for Local Government has <Col N="1786" /> reduced the appropriations for the Local Authorities (Works) Act in respect of ordinary drainage proposals, arterial drainage and land reclamation. I would like to point out that the amount of money to be spent this year on drainage in general exceeds by a substantial sum the amount previously expended under that heading.  In view of the amount appropriated for this type of work, the argument, I suggest, cannot be convincingly advanced that fewer people will find employment in carrying out drainage operations, which are directed towards improving the fertility of the land.</P>
    <P>Apart altogether from the substantial increase which we gave to the local authorities to carry out their programme for the reconditioning and resurfacing of roads last year, this year the Minister for Local Government has imposed additional taxation on private and commercial vehicles, and so it is hoped to secure in this way an additional £800,000 to recoup or enlarge the Road Fund.  Every penny of that sum will go back for the improvement of our roads.  I think every reasonable Deputy will agree that this additional money, which is to go towards the roads, will reflect itself in the employment of additional workers on road maintenance and road reconstruction.</P>
    <P>About this time last year, we had a recession in the textile industry.  It is true, of course, to say that world conditions operated to some extent to bring about that situation.  It is also true to say that the Minister for Industry and Commerce under the Coalition Government allowed in here excessive supplies of manufactured cloths.  Speaking from memory, I think we produce here in the region of 6,000,000 square yards of cloth annually. Our domestic requirements are in the region of 10,000,000 square yards. In the year ending 30th April 1951 the then Minister issued licences regulating an inflow of 8,500,000 square yards, thereby bringing in, in a period of six or 12 months, twice our normal annual requirements.  Until these stocks were liquidated we had the unfortunate situation here where, in my constituency anyway, many workers in the textile industry found themselves <Col N="1787" /> either displaced or on parttime.</P>
    <P>I had occasion to attend some meetings in connection with the situation that had arisen, and I was prepared to make a fairly generous effort to bring about a solution of that position.  I had to stand up to political propaganda from my political opponents who tried to twist and distort facts to escape from the situation for which they had been to some extent responsible.</P>
    <P>However, I want to place on record, speaking on behalf of a number of those workers engaged in Messrs.  Salts in Tullamore and in the Irish Worsted Mills at Portlaoise, the profound gratitude of those workers and their wives and families to the Minister for Industry and Commerce for applying the corrective measures.  I am proud and glad to be able to say now that they are working not alone full-time but overtime, and they are capable of taking on additional staff when it is available in both those industries.</P>

      <P>As far as social services are concerned, I have heard from time to time from the Fine Gael Party that they are too costly.  It is an argument they advance, but I do not agree with it.  I will certainly listen to them with respect, provided they do not qualify it by saying: &ldquo;Even though social services are too costly, we cannot reduce old age pensions, widows' and orphans' pensions, children's allowances, national health insurance, unemployment insurance or any one of the variety of such services that we have.&rdquo; The argument that they must be reduced, that they are too costly, while at the same time saying we cannot cut out any one of them, is most contradictory and most inconsistent.  Fine Gael have indulged in that type of argument for a considerable time.</P>
      <P>A leading member of the Fine Gael Party, speaking in Portlaoise and reported in the <i>Leinster Express</i> of 20th April, 1953, said that social services were too costly and that they must be reduced.</P>

      <P>That has been the Fine Gael attitude towards social services. The British Government gave our people an old age pension at the rate of 10/- per week.  Cumann na nGaedheal, as they were then, said that was too much, and they reduced it to 9/-. Since then, due I suppose to the widening educational facilities and to many other factors, our people have been demanding, and rightly so, social welfare legislation that would protect them against the ordinary hazards of life, just as the people of the United States of America or the people of England are protected.  We have become accustomed to the standards that we associate with western civilisation, and I think we have the resources to give our people these services without in any way damaging the economic set-up of the country. Fianna Fáil has blazed that trail and has given us the bulk of the social welfare legislation that we have.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I feel that the vast majority of the people are fully conscious of what has <Col N="1789" /> been done, and that there is no real hardship here.  If a man finds himself displaced or unable to work due to illness, there are facilities provided for his wife and family.</P>
    <P>With regard to housing we were an oppressed people for 700 years and we were bequeathed by an alien Government an evil legacy of bad housing. Our people were called upon to do in ten or 20 years what other people had done over a much longer period.  No one will deny that the strides made in launching the housing drive here were significant&mdash;thanks, perhaps, to successive Governments&mdash;and that we have come a long way towards providing the necessary housing accommodation for our people.  Most local authorities are now reaching finality, I think, in the housing programme.  It took a lot of ingenuity and hard work and selfdenial to bring that about and every section of the community was called upon to contribute towards it.  I feel that from the modern houses that we have built, containing all the modern amenities, there should emerge a body of people strong in character and strong in will, capable of going forward to even greater achievement for this country in the future.  If they yield to temptation, if they wilt under the criticism and ill-founded propaganda of the Opposition, we will not get the results we need.</P>
    <P>In connection with turf, I represent a constituency which has very vast tracts of bogland.  The development of bogs and turf production and the generation of electricity has conferred many great benefits on the people of Laois-Offaly.  In fact I think I can say with truth that no constituency in Ireland has derived more benefit from the Fianna Fáil programme of peat production than the constituency I represent.  I know, too, that the vast majority of the people down there agree with that contention.</P>
    <P>During the period of the Coalition Government, two electricity generating stations were erected but unfortunately both of them were designed to burn foreign fuel.  The undeveloped potentialities of the boglands of my constituency or some other constituency could have been harnessed to give permanent employment to our people in <Col N="1790" /> this very valuable national work.  The people who are now bewailing the unemployment position could have made a valuable contribution to alleviating the situation in some way if they had had their wits about them and had ensured that the generating stations erected during their period of office were designed to burn native fuel, but unfortunately that was not so.</P>
    <P>Last year, the Minister for Finance had occasion to float a national loan and the public demonstrated in a very emphatic way that they supported the financial policy he was operating, because that loan secured a wider measure of public support than was secured by any loan floated in this country.  I suppose that all Parties helped to secure that and it was a good thing.</P>
    <P>In the course of his Budget statement, the Minister said he proposed to effect economies in the coming year to the extent of £3,500,000.  When speaking in the Budget debate last year, I was very tempted to say that I believed that very significant economies could be effected in Government Departments, but I refrained from doing so because I felt it was something an older Deputy should have said.  However, the Minister is travelling on the right lines and there is no doubt that very significant savings can be made in, I think, nearly all Government Departments.  If they try to secure these economies, I feel that it is quite possible to secure them.</P>
    <P>It has been said that taxation has reached the limit, and I believe that is true, at least, as production stands at present.  Our economy could not carry any more taxation, but, although that is so, I believe that the greatest future in the world is before the people of this country, if they realise the 1,000 opportunities that are theirs. We must turn our eyes to our staple industry, agriculture.  The scope for expansion and development in that industry is practically unlimited, and, with the utilisation of the technical knowledge now available and the application of lime and fertilisers, there is nothing in the world impossible for our people, if they take advantage of their opportunities.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1791" /> The ground has been cleared and there lies immediately before us an era of real prosperity which will bring permanent employment and security to our people.  Every Party should set a fairly high goal and should make a generous effort to reach it, forgetting about the personalities and political criticism which are far too often indulged in.  I believe that the destinies of the country are in very safe hands, and, speaking for the younger people, I say that we are prepared to follow Eamon de Valera in the prudent and courageous path he has decided to travel.  I believe that it is only under his leadership we can achieve the objective we have sought to achieve for quite a protracted period of making this country a self-supporting and selfrespecting nation.</P>

      <P>In considering the Budget of 1953, we have to take into consideration the repercussions of the Budget of 1952, and, as we are all aware, the Budget of 1953 is just a repetition of last year's Budget.  There is no doubt in anybody's mind that that Budget was severe, harsh and unjust. I say it was severe because it brought the cost of living to the highest pitch for a long number of years and also caused unemployment.  Because it caused unemployment, I have no hesitation in saying that this Budget is a vindictive Budget, because a much larger number of our people are unemployed as a result of the Government's policy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When the workers found themselves having to pay more for all the necessaries of life soon after the Budget of 1952, they appealed to the employers' organisations, and, after many conferences and exchanges of views, it was agreed that some increases in wages were due.  These increases were given, to a large extent, without any recourse to the Labour Court.  Many industries were unable to grant them, but to a great extent the increases were given, increases which were denied to other sections of workers.  I refer to the workers employed by the Government, the civil servants.  If anybody should give a lead in matters of that kind, it is the Government, but the Government <Col N="1792" /> refused, until this Budget, to give to the civil servants what other employers gave.  I believe that the civil servants are morally entitled to increased pay because of Government policy and that the Government evaded its moral duty in refusing to grant that increase from the date on which the Arbitration Court awarded it.</P>
    <P>We have heard during this debate and other debates comparisons between inter-Party Government and Fianna Fáil Government, the attitude of Fine Gael and the attitude of Fianna Fáil, but I want to examine one point of policy, the financial policy of the present Government.  In 1950, when it was thought that a war could not be avoided, that the Korean War was taking a turn which would bring about a war similar to the recent war, the Government of the day had a duty to protect its people from the economic repercussions of war, and the Government Departments responsible, many trade organisations and business people and their staffs, in view of the experience they had had of shortages during the last war, decided that it would be in the national interest to stockpile raw materials and goods which, in case of war, would be unobtainable or in very short supply.</P>
    <P>That was a very sound and wise policy, whether it was Fine Gael or inter-Party policy.  I do not propose to shout about it as Fine Gael policy, because I believe it was a policy which was in the national interest and a policy which I personally would support no matter what Government were in power.  Large quantities of raw materials and manufactured goods which would not be obtainable in case of war were being brought into the country and to bring these goods in meant opening very large credits.  The credits had to be opened through the banks and the banks readily gave them to the firms with whom they had for years been trading.  Very large quantities of goods were brought in as a result of the foresight of the Government of the day, of the business people and all those connected with trade and industry.  As a result of that, it was only natural to expect an adverse trade balance.  That adverse trade balance <Col N="1793" /> was created with the consent and with the sanction of the banking institutions of this country because the goods could not be supplied and would not be supplied were it not that the banks sanctioned payment to all the firms concerned.</P>
    <P>I will mention one industry in particular&mdash;the timber trade.  The timber trade is very closely allied with housing. We know that the timber trade brought in huge quantities of timber in case the housing programme would be interrupted in the event of war.  People might say it was speculation or good business.  Perhaps it was good business to this extent, that the people were protected, even if the timber trade wanted to speculate because the timber merchants had to go before the Prices Advisory Body and have the price at which the timber would be sold fixed and I say and believe that no undue profit would have been made on that transaction if a war had taken place.</P>
    <P>That large adverse trade balance was created as a result of that policy but, if we had an adverse trade balance, we had goods in large supply for two and perhaps three years in advance, in many cases goods that would not be obtainable in the event of war. There was no necessity to stockpile goods of which we had the raw material in the country or which could be manufactured here.  The policy that I have referred to was good policy and as a result of it the economic interests of the country and the employment of people were protected.</P>
    <P>What happened soon after that?  In July, 1951, the Minister for Finance and the Minister for Industry and Commerce suddenly proclaimed that the country was on the verge of bankruptcy, that we could no longer buy goods from outside, that we had drained the last penny in the bank. That was a very mischievous statement. It was a statement that should not have been made.  Certainly, it was a statement that was not true.  Events have proved how untrue it was.  Since 1951 to 1953 the position has been that the adverse trade balance has been rectified, to a large extent by increased exports and to a great extent by a reduction <Col N="1794" /> in the importation of goods such as those that I have described which had been imported in previous years.</P>
    <P>If it is a sin or a fault or a crime for a Government to take precautions, to look after the interests of its people in the event of war, I would like to belong to that Government.  I do not want to make political capital out of it, but I believe that it is only what is due to the workers from their employers, from those in large industries and from financial institutions.</P>
    <P>There is no bankruptcy in this country.  That has been proved over and over again but there is unduly high taxation and that taxation will cripple enterprise and initiative.  Industries must be run for profit rather than for a Government Department.  Recently, there has been added to the list of indirect taxation £700,000 by the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs.  I have no hesitation in calling that taxation.  Industry will have to bear its share of it and every private individual who has a telephone will have to bear his share.  It is very difficult to understand why it is necessary at this stage to say that the Post Office must be run on the same lines as the E.S.B. is run.  The E.S.B., in addition to supplying electricity for power, heat and light, is engaged in commercial enterprise.  It is trading, if you like, with the ordinary traders, supplying many goods.  The Post Office is a monopoly.  The Post Office has taken on many side-lines.  I agree that other State Departments have encroached on the work of the Post Office.  It is unfair to throw the whole weight of the additional cost of running the Post Office on the users of telephones and on firms using the parcel post and other postal services.  A continuation of the policy that was operated for a number of years of contributions being made from the Central Fund to the Post Office would be a much fairer method.</P>
    <P>High taxation, which is the policy of the Government, is a hindrance to the recovery of this country because with high taxation, I am afraid, we will have unemployment.  Unemployment is <Col N="1795" /> no credit to any country.  No Government likes unemployment.  If I criticise the Government on points of policy I do so in the hope that the points I have to put before them will be considered.  Instead of arguing as to what Fianna Fáil are doing, what Fine Gael are not doing, what the Labour Party are not doing, the Government must seriously consider what they must do to serve the country, to see that those at present unemployed get some measure of employment and to stop emigration which is draining the country of its youth, of the people whom we had hoped to retain in the country, whose services could help to build up the country.</P>
    <P>The Government, in introducing this Budget, has inflicted a very severe hardship on the people, a hardship which, because there is so much unemployment, will fall very heavily on people who cannot get any increase in their remuneration, people who are living on small incomes, who are feeling the real pinch of the Budget.  It is regrettable that the Minister did not see his way to make some reduction in the Budget.  It is our belief that he could have done so and should have done so.</P>
    <P>I hope it will not be the policy of any Government to introduce financial restrictions that will impose hardship on our people.  I believe it is unnecessary because we are not a debtor nation. We have large investments in other countries and it is rather strange to see our people having to leave their own land to go to these countries to get employment.</P>
    <P>As I have said, the effect of this taxation falls very heavily on our people, particularly people in industry. I feel that industry will not be able to carry that weight of taxation, because not alone are business people and industrialists asked to carry direct taxation, but they are also subject to indirect taxation by local rates, post office charges, etc.  Practically every one of these charges has gone up and up all the time.  For that reason I say that this Budget of 1953 stands condemned by the people.</P>

      <P>The Budget of any country every year is naturally looked forward to by vast sections of the community with varying feelings, some with a kind of dread, some with trepidation and fear and, in some instances perhaps, with a shadow of hope.  If the people of any country in the world were entitled to look forward to the 1953 Budget with any degree of hope it would be the residents of the Republic of Ireland.  Having regard to the Budget inflicted on them in 1952, which was admitted by its framer and the Government to be a harsh and severe one, having regard to the repercussions of that Budget on every section of the community, having regard to the statement made by the Taoiseach in the intervening period that taxation has reached its limit and that the people could not stand any more, they were definitely and reasonably hoping for and looking forward to getting some relief from the vicious taxation of last year.  These hopes were doomed to disappointment, and a replica of the Budget of 1952 was brought in posing as a new Budget when actually there was no change.</P>
      <P>It has been realised that there is no chance of extracting any more from our people, as owing to the last Budget we cannot get any more from them.  It is reminiscent of the common sense of the highwayman who put his victim on the ground and tried to extract £1,000 from him when the man had only £100.  There was much more of a real threat when he extracted that £100 than there was of extracting £1,000.  The people have been bled white by the Budget of 1952, and apparently the Government have learned nothing in the intervening period because they do not attempt to give any relief.  They do not make any apology for what they did last year and are repeating this year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The speeches which have been made were somewhat illuminating.  The most illuminating speech I heard was that delivered by the irrepressible Deputy Corry.  This Budget wants a bit of illuminating, if anyone could do it.  But Deputy Corry is always illuminating and always 100 per cent. sincere.  The sincerity of some <Col N="1797" /> Deputies' approach to this Budget is reflected by the speech made by Deputy Corry.  He congratulated the Minister for having granted an increase to the civil servants if only from the 1st April.  One wonders what kind of congratulation he would offer to the Minister if he had refused to give that increase.  I can see Deputy Corry falling on the Minister's neck and calling him a hero for refusing to give any more to these &ldquo;drones,&rdquo; which is the highest sounding title he could find for the civil servants.  Yet, to show his sincerity in regard to the Budget, he congratulated the Minister on having granted the increase to civil servants, even if belatedly five months after it was awarded.  If the other thing had happened, we would have had even more enthusiastic congratulations for the Minister for having had the courage to stand up and put these &ldquo;drones&rdquo; out of action.</P>
    <P>The real trouble with regard to this Budget is not what it will do by way of infliction on the people in the coming year.  The real trouble is the hope deferred of the Irish people who have been looking forward to some change, something to rescue them from the slough of despond.  They have got a clear indication that they are definitely committed to a policy which will lead to nothing but a further sinking down of the hopes and fortunes of our land.</P>
    <P>After 30 years of native government, we are entitled to ask what is our position, where are we going under native government?  The Budget is the acid test each year.  We find our population declining instead of increasing. We have complained all our lives of the exodus of our people following the famine of 1848 when, under an alien Government and after an artificially created famine, our people were driven to death or into the emigrant ships to cross the ocean.  We find ourselves now with less than half the population that we had in 1848.  The exodus after the famine cleared the people from our shores and subsequently they were driven out by the battering ram, bayonets and foreign agents.  What have we done since to restore the balance? We talk about the balance of trade. What has this Government or any Government <Col N="1798" /> since we got native government done to try to restore the balance of our population?  Do we consider it is worth restoring?  We ought to examine our consciences on this matter and ask ourselves where are we going. Is it a question of the balance of trade or the restoration of our race?  I make bold to suggest that our race is dying.</P>
    <P>When we speak of the revival of the Irish language and the Gaelicising of our young people we forget that they are being exported and that the number left behind to speak either Irish or English is very small.  We are being left with the old age pensioners, the invalids and other old people.  The real producers of our country are going away week after week and day after day.  The emigration &ldquo;specials&rdquo; from Belfast are labelled.  We have no labels on our &ldquo;specials&rdquo;.  In fact we do not call for &ldquo;specials&rdquo;.  The ordinary trains and the ships take our people away to make wealth for other countries, while our people should be put into employment to build up the fortunes of this country.</P>
    <P>Speaking on the radio last night, the Minister for Industry and Commerce asked: &ldquo;Does anybody suggest for a moment that the Fianna Fáil Government are pleased at having Irish money invested outside this country?&rdquo; But the Taoiseach stated last year in this House and at the Fianna. Fáil Ard Fheis that our investments in London should have been protected and kept there and said it was a stupid and inane act of the inter-Party Government to repatriate any of that money which was lying over there earning small interest as a shield and a shelter for our international protection.  He said that that money must be put back forthwith, that we must tighten our belts, eat less and export more in order to restore that money over there.</P>
    <P>That poses the question: If we have £400,000,000 lying over there as a shelter and protection have we so little courage and so little confidence in the future of our country that we will not repatriate as much of that money as is necessary from year to year for expenditure on reasonable, sound, common-sense proposals. for the rejuvenation of our land and the employment of our people, for national schemes <Col N="1799" /> of reconstruction at reasonable rates of wages, for land reclamation to improve the fertility of our soil, to increase its productivity and create for ourselves thereby a real pool of natural wealth infinitely better for us in the long run than all the banknotes lying idle in the Bank of England or elsewhere? We are living in a world that is hungry for food and that will be hungry for food for the next 20 or 30 years.</P>
    <P>We are a food-producing country and we are not producing at the moment a quarter of what we are capable of producing.  We cannot increase production if we keep putting people out of employment.  That is a truism, surely; one cannot increase production by reducing the number of people in employment.  Production is increasing in other countries.  It is not increasing here.  In the last six or eight months this country has reached the highest figures ever for unemployment. The unemployed have no hope and the sad fact is that the figures produced by the labour exchanges are not truly representatives of the situation. They are fictitiously reduced because many of the people who ought to be registered at the exchanges have fled the country to seek work in England. I made inquiries in my own city during the last few days.  Many of the young people there have gone away to jobs in Birmingham.  There is an employment bureau for Canada operating at the moment and those who go away act like catching-birds for those they have left behind them.  The moment they get out of the country they look for jobs for their pals and bring them out after them.  We sit supinely looking on.  We are the Parliament of the nation.  We have a responsibility for building up the fortunes of the country and maintaining our people at home. Do we do that?  Does the Fianna Fáil Government consider that investments in the Bank of England are more important than maintaining our people in moderate affluence in their own land? All they ask is the right to work.  The Government should be able to initiate schemes to absorb all the willing workers in our cities and towns and in <Col N="1800" /> the rural areas, but all the evidence goes to show that Fianna Fáil are not seriously impressed with that aspect of the matter.</P>
    <P>The Local Authorities (Works) Act was devised by the inter-Party Government. That was, perhaps, its chief offence.  Had it been devised by somebody else it might have been given an opportunity.  That scheme provided work in the rural areas without any contribution from the county councils. During its operation there was practically no unemployment in the country. That is recorded in the exchanges; the figures were reduced to zero.  In what were the people engaged?  They were engaged in work of national reconstruction, clearing outfalls from the land and the roadside trenches, schemes for which the county council would normally be responsible.  All this work provided better facilities for the farmers and better drainage for their lands.  All this work was done in the public interest and employment was created such as was never created before in this country.</P>
    <P>There was a period of prosperity in the rural areas during those two years. The housing drive was intensified until it reached the stage that not another house could be built.  Full capacity was reached at 1,000 houses per month. Those who had gone away were brought home again to help in the drive.  Does anybody suggest the housing drive was not as sound an investment for our money as the Bank of England is?  I do not think Irish money could be put to better use than its conversion into bricks and mortar and concrete to provide our people with decent homes.  The rural areas got their share of housing <i>pro rata</i> so that Irish men and women would have decent homes to go into when they got married, so that we would have a better balanced community and labour would be available for the farmers in order to increase production following on the implementation of the land rehabilitation scheme.</P>
    <P>What do we find to-day?  The farmers are getting no encouragement. The Government has put a heavy impost even on the fertilisers they require for their land.  Fertilisers are the raw <Col N="1801" /> materials of the land.  I am a carpenter by trade and I have never heard of a tax being imposed on the implements of a man's trade.  The farmer has the implements of his trade and they are even more important to the country than they are to the farmer, because he is merely the custodian of the land for the time being.  If the land is to be put into good heart the farmer must use fertilisers and I hold it is a crime to charge customs duty on fertilisers. Indeed, they should be subsidised and the farmer should be encouraged to use plenty of them.  Far from preventing the farmer from using them, I would punish him if he failed to use them. Under the present system a farmer is prohibited from producing the best from his land.  He is prevented from increasing production and there is no exportable surplus, a surplus which would be a much sounder investment to keep us in a better financial position with our creditors than having banknotes lying idle in the Bank of England. These notes have already been written down and there is nothing to prevent them being written down again.  We have made the mistake of putting all our eggs in one basket and the basket itself is bankrupt.  We have not sufficient courage to invest that money to put our people into work at home.</P>
    <P>That is the dismal, gloomy outcome of this unimaginative Budget of 1953. Last night the Tánaiste spoke over the radio.  He made an appeal to the people not to be pessimistic, not to be despondent and not to be gloomy.  For a long time the Taoiseach, the Tánaiste and the Minister for Finance, have been upbraiding us for our gloomy speeches.  They have been imploring us not to sink the ship of State with pessimism.  Last night the Tánaiste comes along and sings the same song. He appealed to us not to talk despondently. He said we are on the point of turning the corner and he hopes we will all be able to enjoy the sunlight, which will probably blind us if we do not get sun glasses, that will be turned upon us as a result of this Budget.</P>
    <P>This country will live in spite of Fianna Fáil.  It will not be submerged. Travelling over the South of Ireland <Col N="1802" /> one sees the Golden Vale, the rich lands of Tipperary and Cork and Limerick; and in that area one sees an odd house here and there surrounded by acres of luxuriant land, but deserted from the point of view of human life.  The numbers in the countryside grow less and less.  The young people are flying from the land. Only the old are left.  We can have our social welfare schemes for the aged and infirm, our orphans' pensions for the fatherless and something to educate the youth.  We have no respect for the real wealth producers&mdash;the people in between&mdash;and we are sending them away in the emigrant ship.  We have 90,000 unemployed and that does not represent the true picture of our unemployment situation.  That is the figure shown in the official publications but no cognisance is taken of those who are in part time employment and who are not registered at the exchanges. They would bring the figure up to at least 100,000.  I think it is true to say a tithe of our total population is living just below the poverty line and they are not pulling their weight.  They are not earning anything for themselves or for the nation.  They are living on the nation, eking out a miserable existence. Yet, some of the defenders of the present Budget have told us everything is lovely in the garden.  The attitude seems to be if people wait long enough, Micawber-like, something will turn up.</P>
    <P>I have nothing further to say in connection with this Budget except to commiserate with the people of the country for having had inflicted on them a Government Party and a Minister for Finance who are not capable of doing something better in their responsible position for the people who have put them there, something that would hold out some gleam of hope.  If some alteration does not take place in the very near future apart from the advice given by the Tánaiste, Deputy Lemass, not to be pessimistic&mdash;I am not&mdash;I cannot see any real hope for an improvement in conditions for the community. If the present Government remain in office and continue to implement their policy, there will be a further sinking down of the standard of living and a <Col N="1803" /> greater submergence than ever we have had in the past 20 or 30 years.</P>

      <P>I am very grateful to Deputy Dillon for preventing me from wasting my sweetness on the desert air.  Evidently when he represented the constituency I represent he considered himself as wasting his sweetness up there and proceeded to desert it.  However, having listened to the speeches delivered by members of the different Opposition Parties I am inclined to follow some reasoned line of argument.  The first thing that has struck me is that not alone do the views of the various Parties differ in regard to the Budget but also that the views expressed by individual members are fairly contradictory.  The theme seems to run something like this, that we want more expenditure.  We have heard it during the Budget debate; we have heard it in speeches recently&mdash; more expenditure, a better health service that would cost more.  Their theme is that they want to expend more money on replacing the subsidies, and it is the same in other spheres, spend more money.  They have promised to do that.  Deputy Costello has stated that his Government will give a better health scheme.  Deputy O'Higgins I think, as spokesman for Fine Gael, said they would put back the subsidies.  Some other Deputies said that they would pay the Civil Service award in full, and so on.  In order to do this, money is required. They are objecting to the expenditure in this Budget, yet they promise that they would add to that expenditure if they were in Government.  Extra moneys can be found by taxation but they have not said where they will find it.  They insinuated that they would not tax.  They also said they would not borrow; they said they would not borrow at 5 per cent.  Therefore it still remains a mystery to me how they will expend more and tax less. I would like to hear some authoritative view on how the money will be found and how it will be expended.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1804" /> Emigration and unemployment were two of the main planks in the speeches made by the Opposition.  Listening to Deputy Norton's speech on the radio the other night, I heard him saying that he went to the trouble of looking over the Budget speech and counted every word.  It must have occupied some considerable time to do that.  He found out how many words there were and said that he did not find the word &ldquo;unemployment&rdquo;.  Then he proceeded to give us figures for unemployment. I take it that speech was well prepared, that it was checked and rechecked; nevertheless, in the figure which he gave for unemployment an error of 2,000 occurred.  I am not trying to make it appear that unemployment is not a serious problem but when authoritative statements like that are made and where an error of 2,000 occurs, one must begin to doubt the other facts and figures given by such speakers.  If one must criticise&mdash;and it is a good thing to do so; we all do it&mdash;at least one should be fair in that criticism and not exaggerate the position as is being done at the present time.</P>
    <P>The unemployment problem is serious, but there are indications that the situation is improving.  In the last three weeks there was a drop in the number of unemployed from 86,000 to 84,000 and again from 84,000 to 82,000.  We still say that the position is not satisfactory, but we are hoping that that drop will continue. In regard to emigration, there are no authoritative figures available at the moment but personally, from seeing the number of returned emigrants in different parts of the country, I feel that emigration is not as high as it had been.  I know myself people who have returned and they have returned for a number of reasons.  First of all, work is not so readily available in England and Scotland as it had been and overtime which gave Irish workers there a chance of earning large sums per week is not available now.</P>
    <P>It is impossible in many employments in Great Britain to get overtime and emigrants feel that a wage of from £7 to £8 per week for a 48-hour week is not worth while, because out of that <Col N="1805" /> sum they have to provide for lodging, food, cigarettes and income-tax.  I have been told by returned emigrants from England and Scotland that it is not worth while for those people to go over there unless they get overtime, and overtime, in a very large number of industries, is a thing of the past. Therefore, I claim that the situation is not as bad as it is stated to be by the Opposition.  Again, Opposition speakers do not mention the fact that in the year 1951 the figure for emigration was 41,000, the highest on record.  The worst feature of that was that it was mostly farm workers who emigrated during those three years, with the result that in many parts of the country farmers found it very difficult to get agricultural labour.</P>
    <P>Deputy Costello stated that they had blue prints of a policy and, while he was speaking on the health scheme, he said that he had blue prints of a scheme there too.  We are interested here in facts, and we should like to hear, in regard to that policy of which they have blue prints, all the finer points in it.  We should like to hear what it would cost the country, the amount of money it would cost the taxpayer, if they will impose taxes to get the money to carry out their policy, if they will borrow it and, if they borrow it, from whom or from what country they will borrow and the rate of interest they will pay.  These are matters on which we should like some information; possibly Deputy Dillon will tell us in his forthcoming speech.</P>
    <P>A point made yesterday, which seems to contradict statements made earlier, is that industry is overtaxed.  The speaker who made that statement said that reliefs in taxation should be granted to industrialists and manufacturers, that some concession should be given them in order that plant and machinery could be reconditioned or new machinery purchased.  That contrasts very significantly with the statement made some years ago that industrialists should be behind prison bars, that they were fleecing the people and making exorbitant profits.  If industrialists for the last ten years made exorbitant profits, is it not quite reasonable to expect that they would <Col N="1806" /> invest these profits in reconditioning existing machinery or in purchasing new machinery?  That just shows the line of thought running through various debates in this House and especially through the Budget debate for the last few days.</P>
    <P>I should like to congratulate the Minister on the proposal to effect economies in central government.  His statement to the effect that economies to the amount of £3,500,000 will be carried through this year is something to be welcomed, particularly if such economies can be carried out without interfering with the numbers employed or with the wages of the people in the service.  Economies could, I think, be made in local government also.  I know that some housing schemes and other schemes were planned and these plans were scrapped and further plans drawn up.  A good deal of time and much money was wasted in that procedure, so that the announcement that a scheme of economy in central government is to be operated will be welcomed. I would recommend that a similar course be taken in regard to local government.</P>
    <P>One point that has cropped up very often had reference to rates of interest and loans&mdash;loans to farmers, speculative builders, to private individuals for the erection of houses and to different people in various industries.  I do not know myself if there is such a great demand from farmers, and private individuals wishing to build houses, for loans.  If there is, it is something new in the mentality of the Irish people. To my mind the mentality of the Irishman was to work hard and to expect that, as a result of thrift, he would be able to do any of these things from his own savings.  If a farmer wanted to purchase some article of machinery he saved up and purchased it.  I do not think that this curse of living in tomorrow and in the years ahead has got a grip.  I hope it has not got a grip. I hope the Irish farmers and the Irish people generally have not got into this lazy habit of loans for this, that and the other thing.</P>

      <P>I think there are enough opportunities in this country for anyone who wishes to avail of them to have the means to purchase the articles which are required for one's business or farm.  It happens, often enough, unfortunately, that a farmer, through mismanagement or some other cause, may not have the wherewithal to carry on his business effectively.  In that case it is a good thing to be able to come to his assistance but it would be a bad day for this country if all our farmers or the people who provide houses for themselves find they are tied up in one way or another with banks or other credit-giving concerns.  I do not think it is a good thing and if it is wholesale I think it is very much foregin to the Irish mentality and the Irish way of life.</P>
      <P>It struck me as being rather unusual when yesterday I heard Deputy Murphy, a member of the Labour Party, state that he agreed with stability in regard to the cost of living and wages.  I do not know whether that is in keeping with the statements made by the other members of that Party.  A standstill on prices and a standstill on wages being advocated by a member of the Labour group is certainly something new.  Of course, the Labour group are very vociferous in advocating increases to the Civil Service. Now that that has been done they will not be satisfied until they have the full letter of the law fulfilled and have the full arbitration award made available to those State workers.</P>
      <P>I remember the time when another committee&mdash;the Roe Commission&mdash;recommended increases to a very considerable section of State workers&mdash; teachers.  The Government of the day, which was the Coalition Government, not only turned down the majority report, but they did not put fully into effect the minority report.  These are the people who are now saying that we must honour the Civil Service arbitration award in the letter and to the day.  That does not tally with me.  It just does not even up.</P>

      <P>Another point made by many Opposition speakers was that money under the Local Authorities (Works) Act was cut down. It was and is, but more than compensatory grants have been given to local authorities.  As everybody knows, extra moneys are being made available from the Department to county councils and to other bodies this year.  In addition, in tourist areas further grants are being provided on behalf of tourism. I started off by saying that I could not see any constructive thread of argument running through the speeches made by the Opposition.  They all seemed to differ as between one Party and another and as between one individual and another.  Even in individual cases statements were contradictory.</P>

Deputy Cunningham spoke very well.  Another Deputy spoke yesterday but they all spoke from little white cards.  I knew that Fianna Fáil kept a <i>Pravda</i> to supply the Party line down the country but this is quite a new technique on which I compliment them.  I would be intrigued to know whether all the little white cards were shuffled up in the morning and dealt out 12 apiece and whether they will be shuffled out to-morrow morning and dealt differently. It is a most delightful technique on which I compliment the Party organisation but it does reduce our proceedings to a rather tedious level because no matter how skilfully they deal the cards each morning you do hear the same material trickling out in pretty much the same way.  I think <Col N="1809" /> that is an unjustifiable trespass on the patience of even so attenuated a House as Deputy Cunningham had to speak to.</P>

    <P>We were told last night that pessimism begot gloom and that gloom begot national disaster.  Who started the gloom in this country?

      <P>The author of the Budget protests that it is unthinkable that he should have to undertake the assignment of persecuting his fellow countrymen if he anticipated seeking re-election at their hands.  He does not anticipate seeking re-election at their hands.</P>
      <P>I want to ask the House to look at the facts.  In 1951, when we left office, the penal taxes had been removed from beer, spirits and tobacco.  The prices of bread, sugar, tea and butter were relatively low.  Cream was expanding, and subsequently our export trade reached over £100,000,000.  Employment was higher in the country and unemployment lower than it had been since before the war.  We had £24,000,000 sterling of the Marshall Aid Loan Counterpart Fund in reserve unspent.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1811" /> Now, the price of tea has doubled; the price of butter is very nearly doubled and the prices of tobacco, beer and spirits have risen by the margin with which we are all familiar.  The bank rate has gone up by 1 per cent. so that every man in business, every farmer and every individual in the country who owes an overdraft to the bank, has to pay 1 per cent.  per annum more for it.  Income-tax has gone up by 1/-, postal rates have to go up by £750,000; motor taxes have gone up by £800,000, and unemployment has undeniably doubled.  Emigration is flowing at a rate that I have never seen it flow at before, certainly in the West of Ireland.  The burden of Government outlay is heavier than it has ever been, largely made so by the adjustments made necessary by the rise in the cost of living, consequent on the rise in the cost of foodstuffs to which I have referred.</P>
    <P>The sad part is that those who have received increases in wages, salaries and social services nominally to offset the increase in the cost of living, which went up from 103, early in 1951, to 123 in February, 1953 are worse off now than they were before the adjustments, to meet the increase in the cost of living, had taken place.</P>
    <P>I would like to ask Deputies, who is better off?  Is there anybody in this country better off to-day than he was in June, 1951, and if there is not, what was the purpose&mdash;&mdash;</P>

If one could point to any <Col N="1812" /> section of the community and say that they are better off, I would have some sympathy with what has been done, but, as far as I can see, the whole thing has been torn up and jettisoned with the net result that everybody is a great deal worse off.</P>

      <P>I listened with admiration to the admirable sentiments laid down in the Taoiseach's contribution to this debate. He is quite a remarkable man.  There is nobody more competent to get up and protest all the attributes of virtue, provided he has at hand a sufficient number of assistants round the throne to perpetrate all the vices he is so solicitous to condemn.  The Taoiseach, speaking at column 1492, No. 12, said:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;What is the sense in trying to look towards the year in advance if during the year we encourage expenditure for which provision has not been properly made?  It is a senseless procedure to have supplementaries to the extent to which we have had them in recent years.&rdquo;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I seem to remember a number of Supplementary Estimates. Deputy Killilea says it is quite true, and why should it not be so?  Others say it is not true at all.  It is time to shuffle the cards and deal out again. The Party line is getting a bit out of plumb.  As given at column 1492 of Volume 138, the Taoiseach said:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;The Leader of the Opposition asked how it is, if you had a deficit in the past year and taxation rates remain the same&mdash;that is what I understood <Col N="1813" /> his argument to be&mdash;you are proposing to meet higher expenditure this year unless you have a concealed surplus from the past year? The answer is very simple.  It is expected that, even with the present rates of taxation, there will be an increase in revenue of £5,000,000.  There is an increase in expenditure of £3,000,000.  The £5,000,000 increase in revenue will meet that and cancel the deficit of £2,000,000.  There is nothing extraordinary in it.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>But that affirmation is hard to reconcile with the Taoiseach in column 1494:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;We considered the balancing of our Budget of tremendous importance and, if there is one charge that can be levelled against us as a Government, it is that events have proved that we have not, in fact, succeeded in balancing our Budget and that there is a sum of £2,000,000 current revenue that will now have to be met by borrowing.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>You pays your money and you takes your choice.  At column 1492 we are going to tax in this year for revenue wherewith to defray the deficit of last year, but at column 1494 he is profoundly concerned that he has to borrow to meet the deficit of the previous year.  Mind you, both paragraphs are uttered in the most rightly respectable accents, well qualified to edify, whichever way you look at the problem.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach, amidst loud encomiums of praise from the <i>Irish Times,</i> delivered himself of the affirmation here some weeks ago that the extreme limit of the people's capacity to bear taxation had been reached&mdash;not another penny could be had.  His Minister for Posts and Telegraphs was sent galloping into the House three weeks ago, to say he was going to raise another £750,000.</P>

      <P>Deputy McGrath was saying a few moments ago that a rose by any other name would smell as sweet.  Would that observation be relevant to Deputy Briscoe's illuminating intervention, that the Minister's raising of £750,000 on postal rates is not taxation?  I would not care to describe it as a rose.  I suppose I might also say that a midden by any other name would stink as strong.  Whether it is taxation by the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs to the tune of £750,000, or by the Minister for Local Government to the tune of £800,000 on motor taxation, or by the Minister for Finance, or by the Minister for Industry and Commerce by way of tarriffs and quotas, it all appears to me, if the public have to pay it, to be taxation. I think that is the way the public look at it but, of course, I concede at once that that is not what is written on the little white cards and, therefore, it is treason for anyone on the far side of the House to say that the imposition of £750,000 extra for postal services is taxation, when the Taoiseach himself has said that the people cannot bear any more taxation.  At column 1495, the Taoiseach became reflective:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Is milis fíon ach is searbh a íoc&rdquo;. He was polite enough to translate it for us&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;In other words, it is pleasant to drink wine but it is bitter to have to pay for it.  If we do not want the bitterness of having to pay for it, then we must restrain our drinking&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>This is presumably the root of the proposed taxation on beer, wine and spirits.  Since the Taoiseach gave up the consumption of these commodities he apparently thinks his neighbours should follow suit and he intends to make it so bitter for them to drink that they will give them up&mdash;though I admit that in this context he was speaking by way of allegory.  He continued at column 1495:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;We have heard a good deal about savings.  There were no net savings at all practically in the year in which the deficit was £61.6 million.  We were simply, to use the ordinary expression, living beyond out means.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1815" /> It is tedious to recapitulate the correction of fraudulent misrepresentation of this kind, but it is requisite to nail this kind of falsehood the moment it is uttered.  We pointed out to this country that in the financial year 1951 we proposed to create a deficit in the balance of payments.  The Taoiseach invited the editors of the <i>Irish Times</i>, the <i>Irish Independent</i>, the <i>Irish Press</i> and the <i>Cork Examiner</i> to his office and he explained to them that a programme of stockpiling was about to be embarked upon and he asked them not to give publicity to it, lest such publicity should further complicate the problem of the buyers commissioned to purchase the necessary goods.  I want to draw the attention of the House to the actual reductions in purchases that were made in 1952 as compared with the purchases made by our Government in 1951.  In 1951 our purchases of tea amounted to 36,800,000 lb., costing £7,100,000.  In 1952, 17,000,000 lb. cost £2,500,000.  That was a difference of £4,600,000.  Was it right or was it wrong to lay in stocks of tea designed to carry us over any probable emergency if war should eventuate?</P>
    <P>I can remember distinctly in the autumn of 1950 these benches ringing with shrieks from Deputy Major de Valera and from the present Minister for Industry and Commerce, then Deputy Seán Lemass&mdash;and I think Deputy Briscoe&mdash;crying out that the Government was failing in its duty to protect the people from the possible scarcities that would arise if an emergency came upon them.  I do not think any of them can deny that.  Was the Government right in believing that one of the things it would be well to lay in, so that with judicious rationing in a time of emergency the people's requirements could be met, was tea? I think it was.</P>
    <P>In regard to coal, in 1951 we brought in 2,000,000 tons of coal.  In 1952, 1,699,000 tons were brought in.  We spent £12,250,000; our successors spent £10,000,000.  Were we wrong to bring in that coal?  Is it suggested that there was an improvident user of coal? Does any Fianna Fáil person believe that we consumed 36,000,000 lb. of tea <Col N="1816" /> in that one year, or 2,000,000 tons of coal?  &ldquo;Deals, planks and boards of softwood for building&rdquo;&mdash;we brought in 64,762 standards which cost us £5,000,000 and our successors brought in 45,000 standards which cost them £3,900,000.  Were we wrong?  We wanted the building programme to continue uninterrupted, even though our communications with the outside world might be temporarily suspended.  Were we wrong?  I think we were not.</P>
    <P>When we come to worsted yarns and the like, we discover on closer examination of that item in the imports statistics, that imports of textiles and worsteds cover wool and wool tops.  We brought in 28,000 centals of wool tops in 1951 and our successors brought in 9,000.  We spent £2,100,000 on wool tops and they spent £633,000.  I should like to ask young Deputy Maher, who is so distressed about the workers in Salts (Saltaire) Ltd., what would these workers have been doing if we had not brought in the wool to keep the factory open?  Salts (Saltaire) would have closed down&mdash;it would not have been a question of short time or unemployment, but a question of the whole business closing down.  We brought these wool tops in.  Were we wrong?</P>
    <P>Of woollen and worsted yarns, we brought in 2,352,000 lb., which cost us £1,900,000 against our successor's purchases of 1,633,000 lb., which cost them £976,000.  Were we wrong?  What wool textile factory in the country could have remained open, if that wool had not been brought in?  I think we were right.  We brought in 70,000 cwt. of rubber and they brought in 48,000 cwt.  We laid out £1,500,000 on these imports and they spent £667,000.  Were we wrong?  Was it not good to have a strategic stockpile of rubber in the country lest an emergency might make it impossible to come by?  Here is another economy they made.  We brought in 93,078 tons of superphosphate of lime and they brought in 31,000 tons.  We spent £1,200,000 on these imports and they spent £565,000.</P>
    <P>Does Fianna Fáil still adhere to the falsehood that there was an adverse balance of trade created by excessive consumption of consumer goods in this country?  Do they now admit that <Col N="1817" /> their own Ministers have referred time and time again to the fact that there were large accumulations of stockpiled goods in this country and that they professed to have experienced difficulties as a result of the size of the stockpile? Is that falsehood about excessive consumption of consumer goods in 1950 and 1951 abandoned?  <i>Pravda</i>, the little white cards and the Party line have been keeping that going for a long time.  Is it dropped now?  That is the reason for £61.6 million adverse trade balance, but that balance was interpreted by the Minister for Finance to justify budgetary procedures, designed to restore what he called a balance of payments, which have precipitated unemployment, emigration and what the Tánaiste called the slump out of which he hopes we are now about to find our way.</P>
    <P>He says the slump was a world-wide phenomenon.  There was no need for any slump in this country.  There was no slump in 1951 and remember that, when he came into office and saw all the confidential files, his diagnosis was that we had a wild inflation in front of us&mdash;no slump but a booming inflation. But he was determined to arrest that, and he gives us, instead of that, a slump, out of which he bids us take heart of courage as we may hope to emerge from it now.  We promised the people neither slump nor boom.  We promised them steady progress, and, by a courageous policy of investment in our own country, we foretold to them confidently: &ldquo;You will see a steady decline in the volume and cost of our imports and a steady increase in the volume and value of our exports.&rdquo;&ldquo;No,&rdquo; said the Minister for Finance, &ldquo;there is no conceivable factor in the situation as revealed to me as Minister which would extend any hope of balance of trade being redressed by any increase in exports.&rdquo; That was in a year when our exports passed the figure for value of £100,000,000 for the first time since the State was established.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach, carried along by his philosophising, came to column 1496, where he said&mdash;I should say that he is now back in the sphere of allegory:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;It is very easy when you are in <Col N="1818" /> a boat to set your course and row for land, and when you arrive to say that you would have arrived at land anyhow, that you had a fine wind behind you and if you had allowed yourself to drift, you would have been taken by the wind right on to land without any effort of your own. It is very easy to look back when things have happened and say exactly what should have been done and what should have been foreseen.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>If we are to follow this figure of speech still further, if you are sailing towards a westward land and have upon your sails a strong breeze blowing from the east, it does not require much wisdom to say that you should not double or treble your area of sail, lest, instead of floating safely home upon this breeze, you drive your craft upon the rocks.  That is exactly what this prince of folly did&mdash;jumping into the Department of Finance, he cried panic, red ruin and the breaking up of law. &ldquo;Inflation is upon us, with danger from every side; let us spread every sail we have and find a strong deflationary breeze and run before it, lest we be overtaken by the storm&rdquo;&mdash;and he ends up on the rock of slump, off which the Tánaiste now exhorts us to haul the ship, quite oblivious of the fact that the ship now has a large hole in its bottom which the Fianna Fáil T.D.s are sent in here to plaster over with their little white cards and, where they are insufficient, to purchase the returned copies of <i>Pravda</i> and stuff them into the bottom too.  But the boat will not float.  The hole has been driven in by Fianna Fáil and unless that crew is taken off they will pull it off the rocks and they will see it sinking.  I exhort, now that they are stopping on their rock of slump, before they put to sea again, to come and consult the people and let the people say what they think of their seamanship, let the people say what they think of this mariner who drives towards the coast with such confidence, and let a competent crew get aboard who will put a new bottom in that boat and then float it off unafraid to use its resources to go whither our people want to go, not to riches, not to power, not to affluence <Col N="1819" /> but to dignity and decency and peace in their own country.</P>
    <P>I commend those Deputies of the Fianna Fáil Party who can spare the time from their little white cards to read the Official Report.  I commend them to read the Taoiseach's description, in column 1496, of how the deficit was created.  I commend them to dwell on his confidence that his supporters would have forgotten that at column 1494 he had been explaining that the reserve stocks in hand were so large that his Government had no cause to purchase any more throughout the whole financial year.  Pious affirmations will get us nowhere and, mind you, we had better get somewhere pretty quick or there will be nobody left to go.</P>
    <P>Before I depart from the Taoiseach's speech I want to draw attention to another pearl of wisdom.  At the bottom of column 1493 the Taoiseach turned his mind to the allegation that there had been an overestimate of the charge for interest on the national debt.  Now listen to this masterpiece of public finance.  The Taoiseach said:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;He spoke, too, about an increase in the interest charge on the national debt.  If he looks the matter up he will find that, whilst it is true that the amount put to interest is less than the amount put to sinking fund is greater, the two taken together amount almost exactly to the figure given for the servicing of the national debt.  I have dealt with the £2,000,000&rdquo;&mdash;</P>
    <P>He then goes blandly on.  I think it is a most glorious gesture for the Taoiseach, in dealing with the question of the amount appropriated to sinking fund of the national debt and the amount chargeable for interest, to say to his loyal supporters: &ldquo;Listen boys. It does not really make any difference if you overestimate the charge for interest on the national debt by £4,000,000 a year and tax accordingly. All you have to do is to pay the £4,000,000 into the sinking fund and it all comes out in the washing&rdquo;.  But, of course, anybody who knows anything <Col N="1820" /> about finance is well aware that if you pay the £4,000,000 into the sinking fund you amply justify the allegation of grossly excessive taxation for the servicing of the public debt.  Where else does a Budget surplus go but into the sinking fund?  How else can you appropriate a surplus on your Budget than by using it to liquidate the public debt?</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach just does not think that that matters at all.  Provided it all goes in that general direction, his view is that it comes out in the washing and that it is a perfect answer to say to anybody who says that you have budgeted too heavily for the service of the national debt, that anything that comes in over and above what we require for interest we put back into the sinking fund; is not it all the same thing?  So far as the faithful and loyal supporters of the Taoiseach are concerned, I suppose it is the same thing, but for the unfortunate taxpayer who has to meet the consequences of that folly it is not the same thing and, in the poetic phrase of the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Social Welfare, Deputy Kennedy, that cock will not crow with anybody who knows anything about the matter to which the Taoiseach was referring.</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Taxation presses lightly on the land&rdquo;&mdash;that phrase was employed by the Minister for Finance at column 1185, Volume 138, No. 10.  Do not forget that the Leader of the Fianna Fáil Party in the Seanad recently declared that he thought there ought to be an export tax per head levied on the live stock of this country.  The Minister for Finance says: &ldquo;Taxation presses lightly on the land.&rdquo; I would like to ask the Minister for Finance, if taxation presses lightly on the land, where does it press heavily?  Does not it all ultimately go back to the land?  Who pays the tariff on fertilisers? Who bears the increased rates due to the removal of subsidies on food?  Who pays the extra tax on petrol and tractors and fuel oil?  Who bears the increased cost of agricultural wages made necessary by the increased cost of living?  Who bears all the tariffs and quotas by which the <Col N="1821" /> most burdensome social service in this country is maintained?</P>
    <P>I am glad to see Deputy Maher back amongst us.  He said that I was on record in Portlaoise as having declared that the social services in this country were too great a burden and should be reduced.  No, Sir.  What I said was that I was brought up to understand by social services taxes levied on the community to sustain the poor, to sustain the sick, to sustain the old, to sustain the disabled, to sustain the blind and that these no one in this country desired to reduce so long as they were necessary, but that there had developed in this country a new social service the beneficiaries of which were not found in the hospitals, were not found in the home, were not found destitute or poor by the wayside but were sailing about this country in Chryslers and Daimlers.  I do not understand the meaning of a social service which taxes the poor to maintain the rich.  And what are tariffs and quotas but a social service designed to maintain in this country a body of men who claim the right to extract from the poorest of our people the prices that will maintain them in Chryslers and Daimlers, in villas and in luxury? The people are compelled to pay the prices they demand under the protection of tariffs of 75 and 100 per cent. and of quotas that admit of no competition by imports at all.  That is a social service unknown in any other country in the world.</P>
    <P>When I hear the Minister for Industry and Commerce announce that it is his purpose to do away with the Control of Manufactures Act and invite in foreign capital, I welcome the thought of foreign capital being invested in this country under the control of our Government, but I recoil from the idea that foreign capital should be invited in under the protection of tariffs and quotas and that we should be constrained in future, not only to maintain and fatten our own parasites, but a whole new horde of locusts called in from the four corners of the world to batten on our farmers, our people and our land.</P>
    <P>That is a social service in which I have no pride in participating.  I do <Col N="1822" /> not want to feed the locusts and the parasites.  The less I see of them the better pleased I am.  All honour to the businessman from wheresoever he may come who sets up his business in Ireland and by superior skill and industry produces his goods better and cheaper than they are produced anywhere in the world.  The more profit that man makes the more valuable a citizen that man is.  I do not care whether he makes 10 per cent, 20 per cent., 100 per cent. or 500 per cent. profit on his capital if he sells his commodity in competition with all comers as regards quality and price.  The more he does, the better citizen he is.  But the time has come to face up to the fact that the land of this country, which ultimately carries them all, is carrying enough without carrying the parasites and the locusts who live upon us under the protection of tariffs of 75 and 100 per cent. and quotas and who want to get their pint of blood and pound of flesh.</P>
    <P>Taxation presses lightly on the land! Who keeps this country going but the people who live and get their living on the land?  Have they any tariffs? When they go to sell bullocks, or heifers, or pigs, or sheep and bring them to Birmingham, Manchester or London or wherever they go, is there any tariff there to protect them?  None. They have to met competition from the Argentine, the United States, Chile and the whole world.  They have to meet and beat the Dutch, the Danes, the French, the Germans and the Greeks.  With the money so hardly earned in these markets against competition they have to come home to the privilege of maintaining through this new social service the parasites and locusts who prey upon them in Ireland.</P>
    <P>That is the social service I want to-see reviewed and cut down.  It is the burden of that ignoble social service which I say is becoming impossible to bear and I for one make no apology for saying that those who work as our people work on the land have a right to cry out against the injustice of having imposed upon them the obligation of maintaining a body of men who perceive it to be no crime to live in luxury whilst their victims struggle to keep body and soul together.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1823" /> Taxation presses lightly on the land! Who bears the subsidy annually paid to the leather and boot and shoe industry of this country through the hides of our Irish cattle?  Reckon it up and see what it comes to.  Remember, when you reckon it up, that one of the leather factories in this country distributed a bonus of 100 per cent. shares to their shareholders and maintained their dividend.  Every farmer in Ireland pays a subsidy to that firm through every beast that is sold in Ireland.  Reckon it up, and then tell me if taxation bears lightly on the land.  Who bears the subsidy paid out to the fellmongers of this country but every man who has a sheep to sell? There is not a sheepskin sold in Ireland which must not go through the hands of the registered fellmongers.</P>
    <P>Then I am told that taxation bears lightly on the land.  What stands between our people in the towns and cities and all through Ireland and destitution?  Is it not the land and the people who live and get their living on the land?  If we had not our agricultural exports wherewith to pay for the import of raw materials for our industrial activities, for our transport services and for everything else we do, would there be a town in Ireland in 12 months after the suspension of the export trade we do?  Then I am told that taxation bears lightly on the land.</P>
    <P>I could pursue this wretched Budget and the hateful record of this foolish man who is now Minister for Finance and his unspeakably irresponsible colleagues <i>ad nauseam,</i> but there is no need for me to particularise the consequences of what these men have done.  Come you to Wicklow, come you to Cork and ask the people what in their experience has been the consequence of Fianna Fáil's administration. Surely that is a reasonable suggestion.  Cut short the argument here, cut short the argument whether it is so or not, and come and ask the people, whom we say are suffering, come and ask the people who have the right to choose who shall sit on that side and who shall sit on this side of the House, and let us all pledge ourselves in advance to abide by their <Col N="1824" /> verdict.  If you believe, as you profess to believe, that there are seats available which you may win, choose them and we will try to accommodate you. In what constituencies in Ireland do you want to fight?  You tried South Galway and you could not get your Deputy to resign.</P>

We have priced ourselves out of the market for butter. We will never sell butter abroad again at prices which we ourselves elect to fix for production in this country.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Just a moment.  When we talk of an economic price, what do we mean?  We mean a price which will leave the farmer who produces the merchandise a profit on his work. What is the farmer's profit?  The farmer's profit is not his price.  The farmer's profit is the difference between his cost of production and the price his produce fetches in the market where he sells it.  Our prime aim is to raise the price wherever we can, by treaty or agreement, and to date, the agreements we made in 1948 and 1951, <Col N="1827" /> have given a pretty good account of themselves.  They cover cattle, sheep, pigs, meat and bacon.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>No. There is no reference to eggs in the annexe of the 1948 Trade Agreement.  They were regulated by the provisions of the 1947 Trade Agreement and in 1948 no reference was made to eggs in London and there is no mention of them in the annexe to the agreement.  That agreement and the 1951 Agreement that was made subsequently covered cattle, sheep, pigs, meat and bacon.</P>
      <P>What will happen if the costs of production of these commodities here is raised by the action of our own Government to a level which leaves no margin between the price provided in these trade agreements for cattle, sheep and pigs and the costs of their production?  There lies the danger. Do Deputies in the Fianna Fáil Party know what it at present proceeding? Do they know that their own Minister has put a tariff of 20 per cent. on fertilisers? Do they know that that represents 2/- per cwt?  Do they understand that that represents a tax of 8/-to 10/- on every statute acre of land in Ireland?  Do they realise that the land of Ireland, the land annuity on which is not 10/- per acre per annum, is now paying in tax on the manure the farmers use upon it a cess in excess of land annuity?  Do they realise that at this moment imports of maize are being manipulated so that the cost of feeding stuffs is approximately 3/- per cwt., if not more, higher than it ought to be? Do they understand that the common reckoning is that it takes 8 cwt. of meal to raise a pig from gestation to the condition in which it is sold to the bacon factory?  Do they realise that if they only reckon it to be 7 cwt. that tax on foodstuffs has lopped off a profit of £1 per pig on every pig going into the bacon factories, and on every pig exported as pork to Great Britain? Think of it! £1 per pig, and then I am told that taxation presses lightly on the land.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Has Fianna Fáil gone mad?  I warn you that we made an agreement with <Col N="1828" /> Great Britain in respect of pigs and bacon in the knowledge that, having negotiated for eight weary months, we had extracted from the British the last farthing we could get and that, at that, we were balancing on a hair.  We just got a price basis on which a very modest modicum of profit could be reserved for the producer.  The Fianna Fáil Government have put a cess, a tax of £1 per pig on every pig since they came into office.  I warn them now that cess is in excess of the pig and bacon industry's capacity to bear and, if it is indefinitely maintained, I warn Fianna Fáil and their Government that, so surely as we stand in this Chamber, the pig and bacon industry will be destroyed in this country.  Remember, if it is twice destroyed in one generation, as we have seen it, not all the king's horses and all the king's men will persuade our people to embark in that industry again.</P>
    <P>That will leave us with sheep and cattle.  Do not forget that at the present time a sheep with a fleece on its back of six to seven lb. weight, not to speak of the Galway sheep with a fleece of eight to ten lb. weight, may, as to 25/- or £1 of its price, depend on the fleece it carries.  Who believes that the price of wool will be long maintained at the level of 3/- per lb. which it fetches at the present time?  Sheep must unquestionably face an adjustment in the price of wool and that may well bring them very close to the border line of profit and loss.  I warn the present Government against the folly of rainbow-chasing after markets which have no enduring value for our people. Just imagine the intellect of men who solemnly declare they propose to rebuild the live-stock industry of this country on the basis of shipping prime beef to Omaha and Chicago&mdash;where they slaughter more cattle in a week than this country could produce in a year&mdash;merely because there was just a transient scarcity which has manifested itself time and time again in America. At a fancy price obtainable while that transient shortage existed we were to build &ldquo;a new Jerusalem&rdquo; in the live-stock industry of Ireland on exports of prime beef to Omaha, Nebraska.</P>
    <P>These are the men who are in charge <Col N="1829" /> of this country now.  You remember that these were the men who told us that the future of the Gaeltacht was guaranteed to be a land flowing with milk and honey, that it would be covered with tomato glasshouses as soon as they got back to office.  Do you remember the paroxysms of rage?  Do you remember Deputy Aiken when he was here moving the adjournment of the House because his heart was bleeding for the poor people of Connemara and Donegal for the reason that they were not given access to this flowing fountain of wealth, joy and happiness, abundance and comfort, which he had thought up and which he was so anxious to extend all over Connemara, all over the Rosses and Gweedore, straining at the leash to get down to the Donegal peninsula so that glasshouses might spring up there?</P>
    <P>What have you been doing for the two years back in office&mdash;installing one boiler to heat one house, to cost £413 before they ever lit it?  These are the men whom the &ldquo;Busted flush&rdquo; have chosen to rule Ireland.  These are the men who talk of the rehabilitation of the land of Ireland and their most prominent gesture since they came into office was to sell the machinery so that full effect might be given to their loathsome doctrine.  They would use the machinery on the land of the rich and well-to-do but it was not worth while wasting money on the peasants of the West, and Deputy Beegan believes that.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>It was a noble gesture and it was a measure of their confidence and belief in the rehabilitation <Col N="1830" /> of the land.  I cannot help feeling that much of what we say and do here now is time wasted.  I want to see where effective remedies can be provided and there is nowhere else but the forum of the voters.  I want to be afforded an opportunity of going to the voters and asking them to choose between our outlook and that of Fianna Fáil.  We believe in the land.  We believe in our own people.  We believe in the investment of our resources in our own country and we believe that it is better to put men to work in Ireland and to export the fruit of their work for sale at a profit than to export the money for investment in Great Britain and the men to work and send their earnings home.</P>
      <P>That is the issue joined between us. We believe the land of this country can be made to yield an income, a national income which will provide for our people, not riches or wealth, not affluence or grandeur, but which can provide for our people in town, city and countryside a standard of living as good as or better than that enjoyed by any other agricultural community in the world.  If you look back to 1951 you may remember I issued that challenge then, to scan the world's horizon and see if you could find any other country where a man might raise a Christian family in greater peace and happiness than he could in Ireland, and there was none to take that challenge.  I ask you to-day: could any Deputy of the Fianna Fáil Party issue that challenge seriously to-day? With 80,000 people on the dole, could you seriously say that this is the best country in the world for a man to marry and start raising his family in to-morrow when in your heart and soul you know that one of the first problems before him is to get the wherewithal to keep his body and soul together never mind his family?  I am certain if he established a family his first duty would be to leave them in order to earn in a foreign country the wherewithal to keep them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We believe the land of this country should be rehabilitated for the people who live on it and the sacrifice and injustice precipitated by the land was redressed.  I received to-day, <Col N="1831" /> strangely enough&mdash;and I do not know who sent it to me&mdash;an extract from the <i>New Ross Standard</i> of Saturday, May 12th, 1888.  I did not know why he sent it until I read here that a certain politician was then addressing a meeting at which the Corporation of Drogheda was concerned to confer their freedom on him.  They said it was the reward for his part in launching the Plan of Campaign.  On that occasion he gloried in the fact that, Cardinals and the Curia of Rome notwithstanding, he was proud to claim part ownership of the Plan of Campaign.  Those who fought with him had little time for saving or little time for rehabilitating their land, but they got the land for the people of this country.  I thought it would be a proud boast for this generation to make of that land something which was worth bestowing on their children and their grandchildren.</P>
    <P>I believe we were right.  We of the inter-Party Coalition Government had put our hands to that work and Fianna Fáil are concerned to stop it. We had the purpose of providing for our people through the parish plan an effective system of information service and assistance from the Department of Agriculture or any other Department of State that could help in increasing the output of every acre of land in every parish in Ireland.  We sought to do it with the collaboration of those who would constitute the parish councils of this country.  We laid down the doctrine that the raw materials of the agricultural industry should carry no tax, quota or levy for the benefit of the parasites who claimed the right to get their pound of flesh out of agriculture before the farmer got anything at all.</P>
    <P>We undertook to secure markets for the output of our farmers and we got them.  I like to remember that I was not four weeks in office before I went to London, met the British Chancellor of the Exchequer and succeeded in protecting the live-stock industry of this country from a disaster from which it might never have recovered.  That was followed by the Government delegation, of which I formed one, in June, <Col N="1832" /> 1948, and which negotiated the trade agreement of that year, so much denounced by Fianna Fáil then but so sacrosanct since they came into office. We believed that it was eminently desirable to build up the agricultural industry of this country, not on the basis of collective farms but on the basis of the right of our people to the ownership of land, where men could work as farm labourers under enlightened industrial management.  We chased one set of landlords out of this country not for the purpose of installing another set.  Our aim was, on the basis of fixity of tenure in the holdings which they owned, to provide our people with facilities to extract from those holdings a better living than they had ever known before for themselves and their families in the certainty that the national wealth so produced would provide a decent living for every other section of the community as well.  We believed it was good policy to maintain good relations with our friends all the world over and not to send the trash of Irish public life to insult our friends in the forums wherein the big nations forgather, in Strasbourg or elsewhere.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>I have told this House before the story of Newfoundland.  Newfoundland was a sovereign State and depended for its existence on the prosperity of its fish trade.  Fish was to Newfoundland what live stock is to Ireland. There came a generation in Newfoundland, strangely reminiscent of Fianna Fáil, who determined that it was inconsistent with the dignity of the people of Newfoundland to depend so substantially on fish.  It was very reminiscent of the days when the Taoiseach went to Arva and thanked God that the British market for cattle and live stock had gone, and gone for ever.  He exhorted the people to take <Col N="1833" /> to alternative means of subsistence and he ventured to recommend the cultivation of the honey bee, of which he told them the Egyptian variety was the best.  A countryman told me that he was at that meeting in Arva when the Taoiseach told the people to thank God that the British market had gone for ever and that they had better turn to other methods of husbandry, one of the first importance being the production of honey and the cultivation of the honey bee.  For their information, he said that the best advice he had was that the most prolific variety was the Egyptian bee.  Our memories are not so short as to forget that phase of thought.  We were to become self-supporting, self-sufficient.  We were travelling down the broad high road of Robinson Crusoe, quite oblivious of the fact that the only man in the history of mankind who succeeded in establishing himself on an island to live a self-supporting régime was Robinson Crusoe and that there was no man so anxious to leave his native heath as the same Robinson Crusoe.  That was Fianna Fáil's objective.</P>
    <P>Do you remember the happy days when the Minister for External Affairs used to say that, even if all the ships of the world were blown off the seas or sent to the bottom, this people would be the better for their segregation? It grieves me the more when I see the countenances of my old Donegal colleagues who would share my nostalgia for the halcyon days when we used to go down by Annagry with torches burning and when a Fianna Fáil Senator, as he then was, thanked God that we would never send live stock abroad again.</P>
    <P>Deputy Cunningham deplores to-day the tendency of our people to borrow in order to build their houses.  Does he forget that it was his Government taught our people that it was noble and edifying to live on free beef?  Does he forget, because some of us remember it, when the calf in this country had become so disreputable that he was buried in thousands behind the ditches of this country, and when anyone who dared to think of live stock on his land was suspect and in danger of being charged with loving another country better than his own? <Col N="1834" /> Something has upset the Minister for Finance since he came in.  He is quarrelling with his colleagues on the Front Bench.  He should reserve his capacity for quarrelling for those who are about to quarrel with him to good purpose.  Let him not forget Newfoundland. They grew too grand for fish, just as Fianna Fáil, in their day, grew too grand for calves.  They invested in great industrial projects and they were going to become a self-sufficient land.  They woke up one morning to find they could not carry on.  They sought the aid of the British Treasury and the British Treasury promised to finance them if they would hand their Government over to three Treasury officials.  They wondered if they should do it, but they did.  Then came the war and fish became quite aristocratic during the war.  Next came the post-war period and the British Treasury got tried of footing Newfoundland's bill.  They eventually invited Newfoundland to make their choice, to hoe their own row in poverty and approximate destitution, or to go to the neighbour's house, there permanently to abide because they were no longer able to provide their own shelter.  Newfoundland is now a province of the Dominion of Canada.</P>
    <P>It is only 14 short years ago since the constitutional status of this country and that of Newfoundland were identical. Newfoundland as an independent State is no more.  She will never be heard of again as a sovereign State. Ireland is a Republic, but, so certainly as we stand on this floor, the survival of that Republic, as a sovereign indedependent State, depends on the land of Ireland and on the people who live and get their living on it.</P>
    <P>Rob them of their profit and nothing stands between this country but the dialectic that brought Newfoundland where she is except that when the time comes for us to seek a neighbour's house where we may with dignity get shelter we will discover then too late that there is not such a thing in the whole world.  Ireland herself is a mother country and there is no other national home that ever was thought of large enough or great enough to hold <Col N="1835" /> a nation with our history.  Posterity will have to tell what we did with our inheritance.  There is nothing ignoble or unworthy in identifying the future of our nation with the land on which it stands.  Everyone that is worth his salt in Ireland loves the land and has in some generation of his family been proud to serve it.  I warn this House and the Fianna Fáil Party that if they continue to maintain on the people who live on the land itself the burdens they have at present put upon them they will destroy the independence of this country.</P>
    <P>The Minister who could say in his Budget statement that taxation presses lightly on the land does not know the meaning of taxation and does not understand the significance of the land.  A Party that could make him Minister for Finance and that could be led in Seanad Eireann by a man who advocates the taxation of every beast exported from this country is not fit to constitute the Government of this country.  We might well despair in Ireland if we had not the invaluable right of democrats to appeal to the authority on which government in this country rests. Fortunately, vacancies exist in Wicklow and in Cork.  Am I unreasonable if I ask the present Government for no other relief than that they should transfer this discussion to the hustings of Cork and Wicklow in the certainty that by the verdict of these constituencies we are all prepared this year to bow?</P>

      <P>The difficulties we face have been faced by all other countries in Europe.  We are facing the difficulties which all countries faced where a post-war boom has ended.  If our difficulties are any greater it is because the Government that was in office during the boom was improvident for the sake of political popularity rather than for the sake of conserving our resources to enable us to deal with the problem we have to face now with greater ease.  I say this as applying to small countries in Western Europe that were neutral during the last war and undevastated during the last war and to small countries of every kind.  I am prepared to face the electors in Wicklow and Cork when the time comes and to tell everyone from the platform that I consider that at this moment we are a very happy little country in spite of all our difficulties and the vast majority of the people know that in their hearts.</P>
      <P>There is a heavy burden of taxation, but taxation at the present time is no higher than it is in other small countries in relation to their national income per head.  Taxation is no higher than it is in a country such as Sweden, for example, that was not devastated and was neutral during the war. Sweden found it essential, in order to pay for her social services and other expenses, to levy a volume of taxation which in relation to their national income per head bears some relation to ourselves.  I am well aware that it is difficult to make exact comparisons, but the errors in the comparisons that we make are repetitive errors and one can make some sort of effort to find out whether the people here are more burdened by taxation than elsewhere.  My own opinion is that taxation, heavy as it is, is not at the present time excessive compared with that in other countries.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Since a great deal has been said to <Col N="1837" /> asperse the reputation of the Taoiseach, Eamon de Valera, I think I should repeat what has been so often said, that the making of this nation, as it is to-day, is largely the work of Eamon de Valera, the Taoiseach.  If one were to walk half a mile from any small town or village into the countryside, 90 per cent. of all the evidence of national reconstruction and the betterment of life would be found to be the result of Fianna Fáil legislation, or projects.  One would see people benefiting from grants for reconstructed houses, new houses, land reclamation, improved farm buildings; one would meet people enjoying new social services or employment in industry in a nearby town.  As I have said, the vast majority of all the development from machine-won turf to rural electrification was the work of the Fianna Fáil Government and was inspired and directed by the Taoiseach, Deputy de Valera.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>There is nothing that anybody can say on the other side which will disprove that when the history of these times is written.  Deputy Dillon mentioned the Shannon scheme. I am perfectly prepared to give credit for that to the Cumann na nGaedheal Party but I shall later speak on the progress made since the Shannon scheme in regard to electric power schemes and our share of the responsibity for the additions to the electric power network in comparison with that of the previous Government.</P>
      <P>Deputy Dillon sometimes talks in vague generalities with the air of a great statesman.  He sometimes talks for a few brief minutes like a convert to Fianna Fáil.  He sometimes talks as though he were one of these crank credit specialists whose arguments are so difficult to refute until they are tried and then found disastrous.  He sometimes talks like a good old-fashioned free-trade Tory.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>It is difficult to find <Col N="1838" /> any answer to his general vague aphorisms, but I would say that he has proved to be a very poor prophet many a time.  We all remember the time when he said&mdash;it is not very long ago&mdash; that, after wheat and beet, please God peat will go up the spout. We remember the time when he was completely and absolutely opposed to all these three forms of economic production. We can remember when he was promising to drown the British in eggs, and we recall that in 1951 there was a reduction of poultry to the number of 2,300,000 head compared with 1950.  We remember the time when he promised to smother the British in bacon, but by the middle of June, 1951, there were 89,000 less pigs than there were the year before.  We remember when he promised to restore the pig population in 12 months if given the opportunity, and when he said that there would be no foreseeable increase in the price of maize when the £ was devalued.  We also remember when he spoke of an adverse trade balance of £2,000,000 as if it was something that was going to bring economic disaster to the nation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As I was saying, Deputy Dillon's exaggerations are so gross that it is very hard to deal with them in detail. I think the best thing to do is to get down to a proper discussion of the Budget and its economic consequences. I would like to repeat again what has been said here before that the main element of difficulty in the present Budget, as in the case of the last Budget, is that there were expenses which were known to the Coalition Government in May of 1951 and which were not provided for in that Budget. If the total amount of money which has to be provided in this Budget was £8,000,000 less, the amount that was not provided for in the Budget that was introduced in May, 1951, there would not be the same sense of burden in regard to tax levels.  It is very important that everyone in the country should realise that the principal difficulty we are faced with, and the principal effects of the burden of taxation, were created not by us but by the last Government through their improvidence and through their excessive expenditure, and that ever since then <Col N="1839" /> we have been trying to make ends meet.  We have been trying to ensure that we can meet current expenditure by current revenue, and at the same time carry on with the development of the country.</P>
    <P>I charge the Coalition Government with having misused completely all the opportunities they had during the period of the post-war boom and during the boom period created by the scare of a fresh war with the consequent rise in prices.  I charge them with not having taken advantage of that period to conserve our reserves by provident methods of finance so that we could have something in reserve when the boom period ended. They failed to take advantage of the fact that agricultural prices were rising while other prices remained stable.</P>
    <P>They failed to take account of the fact that there was a period of universal and of very badly co-ordinated and unstrategical stockpiling all over the world.  They were unable to exercise any discrimination in the choice of what should be stockpiled and of all the economic effects that must occur when stockpiling takes place.  They took no advantage of the position they had at that time to insist on providence in finance.  They took no account of the fact that agricultural prices were rising continuously during that whole period, and that there must come a time, sooner or later, when they would be stabilised.  They never warned anyone in the community that the boom would not go on for ever, that there must be an end to it sometime.  The boom would end either in war, or else for the time being men's eyes would turn away from war and consequently there would be an inevitable end to price rises.</P>
    <P>The circumstances of the time were of course beyond our control.  During that period they spent £22,000,000 in three years on Supplementary Estimates and only provided £3,000,000 for the whole of the £22,000,000 in their Budget.  When Deputy Dillon spoke of the Supplementary Estimates for which we found ourselves responsible, the actual fact is that in the financial <Col N="1840" /> year 1952-53 we budgeted for a higher proportion, in advance, of Supplementary Estimates than actually accrued, than they had done during their whole period in office.  We were left with a tradition of overspending which it was absolutely impossible to overcome or deal with in one financial year.</P>
    <P>It is extremely difficult for any Minister for Finance to manage a situation where a Government could actually spend on Supplementary Estimates the huge sum of £22,000,000 and only provide £3,000,000 for them, where a Government was always gambling on getting increased yields from taxes and on a boom&mdash;whose end could not be foreseen and which must end sometime.</P>
    <P>The result of all that was that, during their period, the Coalition Government doubled the national debt. They borrowed £45,000,000 from the United States; they misspent it and they left us with an unbalanced Budget. They reduced the entire net external reserves of this country by 40 per cent. in two years, and were in sight of running us into debt with Great Britain.</P>
    <P>I might add that there is no known economic theory in the world underlying the acts of the Coalition.  They frequently pretend to be advanced economists. There are many economic theories.  There are many ways of applying national policy to the economic life of the people.  There is for example the general attitude towards economic life in England.  The Socialists and the Conservatives in their general attitude have agreed on many points.  As regards the Coalition Government their economic experts talked as though they were followers of Lord Keynes.  I hope that the people of this country are beginning to realise that the Coalition operated Lord Keynes' theory of an expansionist economy in reverse.  They did all the things he recommended to do in entirely different circumstances. They poured money into circulation when agricultural prices were rising. They poured borrowed money into circulation during a period when stockpiling was going on.  They borrowed money as fast as they could and threw it into circulation, knowing that they <Col N="1841" /> would have to pay it back.  They did that at a time when they should have thought twice of conserving finances for the period when prices might not be so satisfactory.  That policy, of course, was wholly political and designed to create popularity, and to maintain in office a group of men who had little interest in common save a dislike of the present Government.</P>
    <P>The boom is over now in Europe and here, and we are facing, as I have said, some difficulties that are universal, and some that have been forced on us by the last Government.  Everywhere all over the world a buyer's market is beginning. Prices have risen to such a height that people all over the world have stopped buying freely.  People all over the world are providing problems for their Governments in regard to such matters as revenue and problems of employment.  The people are hesitant to buy in the belief that prices will fall.</P>
    <P>Every Government is being faced with exactly the same kind of general difficulties with which we are faced&mdash; an enormous increase in costs, the necessity for imposing higher taxation, the necessity for reducing the adverse balance of payments.  The O.E.E.C. has reports inches thick from every country in Europe, pointing out the fact that there was a false boom, that the boom had ended and that every country would have to look after its balance of payments, would have to try to do the impossible, maintaining a liberalisation of trade while at the same time restraining excessive imports. Every country in the world has been given exactly the same sort of advice as to its economy by that organisation as we have given the people of this country and the same conditions apply not only to countries devastated during the war but to countries which were neutral.</P>
    <P>The difficulties we have to face in this country are exaggerated by the fact that many of the countries in Europe are still enjoying enormous dollar did from the United States Government.  We face the position that we borrowed £45,000,000 and were compelled to spend it all in two years and then quite suddenly we found that the <Col N="1842" /> whole of the aid had ended.  Marshall Aid was a very heady tonic for the people.  It was equivalent to the entire expenditure on food and drink for one complete year.  It came quickly, it was spent quickly, because the bills that were left to us to pay demanded the expending of the balance.  Now that it has ended it is naturally going to be more difficult for us to continue our national reconstruction campaign.  We have to do without what amounted to £20,000,000 of borrowed money in each of two years, loaned to us from another country.  It was, of course, misspent in every sense; and God forbid that we should ever borrow again from the Americans and spend money in the same way.  If ever there should be a loan on any basis, I hope it will be spent prudently on projects from which there could be some return.</P>
    <P>The Tánaiste, in the course of his address over the radio, said that he thought conditions were improving.  I think that is our principal message to the people of this country on the occasion of this Budget, that there is some stabilisation of prices, but that prices are unlikely to be reduced to any large degree.  There are so many price support mechanisms operating in various countries that at least this year we see no indication of a slump in prices.  The stockpiles have been almost absorbed completely.  There should be a period of stability, when we can look forward to greater employment and the continuance of the Government's reconstruction campaign.</P>
    <P>A great deal of the employment given in 1950 in this country was of an entirely false and temporary character, and it is well to be frank about it and say that it was temporary.  It was due to the fact that the stockpiling by the last Government operated in two ways.  First of all, in the beginning the goods that were imported consisted both of raw materials and finished goods.  The raw materials were made up in the factories and the factories produced great quantities and gave great employment.  Then, suddenly, they found that at the same time the finished goods were being imported.  There were huge volumes of finished goods and goods manufactured <Col N="1843" /> here, thrown on the market at the same time, with no thought or planning behind it.  The natural result was that there was later a very considerable period of increased unemployment. Some of that mercifully is passing away.  Many of the goods manufactured from raw materials imported at such high prices due to the post-war rearmament are most difficult to sell at the present time&mdash;articles made of steel, copper and bronze and articles made of high-priced metals. These naturally found a consumer resistance, because they were imported at a time when prices were sky-high.</P>
    <P>The new prosperity that will come for this country will come through solid stable production; it will come through the efficient labour of our people; it will come from modern methods in industry and agriculture; it will come through a progress that is real, a genuine economic progress; it will come from an improvement in the character of production.  It will not come through unbalanced Budgets; it will not come through borrowed money, poured among the population at the worst possible moment; it will not come through stockpiling during a period of war hysteria.  It will come through the normal process of national reconstruction which has been going on for many years and which was fostered by the present Government during its first period of office; now that we are getting over our difficulties I hope that we shall go on with the same kind of reconstruction policy and look forward to the same kind of success.</P>
    <P>I should advert on this occasion to the fact that it is obvious that the alliance, if such exists, between the Fine Gael Party and the Labour Party has become uneasy and that is a significant fact that the country should realise.  The Labour Party gained few votes and little kudos from their association with Fine Gael.  They had the satisfaction of knowing that it was they alone who persuaded Fine Gael to carry on, in a faltering way, in an inefficient way, with some of the many plans that we left for the reconstruction of this country in 1947, when we were defeated.  We need not go far to <Col N="1844" /> seek the reason for the fact that this alliance appears to have been more or less severed.  Compelling Fine Gael to go Left is not a profitable business for the Labour Party.  They will find that the solid programme of national reconstruction of Fianna Fáil will always pay them better, even though they may be disappopinted at times, even though they may think that, from the standpoint of the working man, there are temporary setbacks.  They were naturally disappointed because no Social Welfare Bill emerged during their period of office.</P>
    <P>I would like to recall what Deputy Norton said on the 13th July, 1950:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;We have introduced into this House a Bill which will provide a scheme of social security based on the provisions of the White Paper. That will be done just as relentlessly and as remorselessly as the other things which we have done in the sphere of social security.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>We had Deputy Larkin saying by the end of the Coalition régime&mdash;or rather a few months after it ended:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;We know that Fine Gael utilised every opportunity that came, not only in the open light of the day but in the dark of night.  Next time we may know better.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>He was speaking of the efforts to frustrate Labour legislation.  The Labour Party equally have been disappointed by the fact that their pricefreeze measure, instituted by them in the hope of keeping down the cost of living, was an utter failure and by the fact that the working people know very well that nearly half of the whole increase in the cost of living took place before the Budget of last year. It is well to remind the people that in August, 1950, an average group of commodities worth about £5, by August, 1951, was already worth £5 11s.  owing to the Korean war and to the consequent increases in prices. We, of course, have been blamed for the whole increase in prices that has taken place, although the cost of living steadily mounted from the time that the Korean war commenced.  I hope that the Labour Party at least have some consolation in knowing that <Col N="1845" /> the statement made by the Trade Union Congress economic expert in April, 1952, that we had forecast the trends of expenditure in the Budget then, was correct, that we did not provide for a £10,000,000 surplus.  I hope the Labour Party feels slightly humiliated by the fact that they now realise that some £8,000,000 had been omitted from the 1951 Budget, that that had to be paid for somehow.  We hear a great deal from the Opposition about suggestions that we want to cut consumption.</P>
    <P>It should be made clear that our only object is to cut consumption for which we cannot afford to pay.  There has been no reduction in the consumption of essential foodstuffs in this country since the Budget in which the subsidies were reduced.  The consumption of bread was about the same in 1952 as in 1950; the consumption of butter was down by a very small fraction and the consumption of margarine up; the consumption of sugar went up by 16 per cent. in 1952 compared with 1950; and the consumption of tea remained the same, so that the suggestion that we are trying to prevent the people from consuming the necessaries of life is ridiculous and denied by the facts.</P>
    <P>It is well for those who believe in a broad policy of social welfare development to realise that the Fine Gael Party are swinging to the right again in regard to their attitude on social services. We heard a statement from Deputy Costello the other day in the course of a recent debate in a university in which he said he did not believe in the welfare State, and he defined the welfare State as one in which there was a large measure of social services. It is a warning to all those who are interested in the security of those with modest incomes of what might happen if the Fine Gael Party were re-elected to office.  My own belief is that they have an instinctive regard for right wing over-conservative policies still in their hearts and that they are merely condemned to modify their policy because of the necessity of coalescing with some Party or other.</P>
    <P>We should make it perfectly clear that we believe in social services for <Col N="1846" /> workers who have no property and who are unable to safeguard themselves against the hazards of life in the same way as those who own businesses. The workers are unable to save voluntarily sufficient sums to provide themselves with protection against the hazards of life; and it is essential and right in a Christian community to redistribute a portion of the national income every year for this purpose. Taxation should be raised in reasonable measure more from the better-off sections than from the less well-off in order to provide that redistribution.</P>
    <P>It is well to remind the House of statements made at one time by Deputies in the Coalition Government in connection with this matter.  Deputy Costello is reported, on 13th March, 1947, as saying:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Money is wanted for social services. This is the justification of all the extravagances inflicted upon the country.  The existence of social services is an indication of ill health in the body politic.  In any case, as has been said, they are nothing more than a row of medicine bottles.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The actual facts are that the countries that are best off in Western Europe are those with the most highly developed social services of every kind. Countries which have intelligent Governments, provident Governments, Governments that have well protected the economies of their countries, have developed social services with large benefits, and have been prepared to impose taxation when it is necessary in order to cover these services.  The existence of social services has no longer any relation with poverty in any civilised country, and Deputy Costello's views of 1947 are completely out of date.  They are part of an old conservative tradition which has long passed away, but which we see occasionally emerging, as, for example, in the case of Deputy McGilligan who, in Cork, once more seemed to throw doubt on the whole value and conception of social services in this country.</P>
    <P>I imagine that those people in the Labour Party who hoped there might be some permanent increase in employment under the Coalition Government, <Col N="1847" /> that the increase in employment would be of a permanent character and would not be due, as I have said, to stock-piling, to inflationary policies, to unbalanced Budgets, are now disappointed by the result of all that happened.  I myself am perfectly prepared to face the challenge that there is an increase in the number of unemployed compared with 1951.  I have indicated the reasons for it&mdash;the fact that there has been a slump all over the world and a recession in trade.  I am prepared to face the challenge because I know that, during the period of the Coalition, in reality, they did not succeed in providing permanent employment.</P>
    <P>The average unemployment, in 1948, the average number of persons unemployed, was 61,000.  That figure fell in 1950, their last full year of office, to 53,000 and during that period nearly 100,000 emigrated and over 50,000 persons left the land.  It is a ridiculous assertion to make that they were in sight of solving either the emigration or the unemployment problem.  If we have learned anything from the change of Government that took place three years ago, it is that we all of us, on both sides, ought to be extremely restrained in any statements we make in regard to our ability to end emigration speedily, or even to give any large measure of employment in a particular year or for a particular short period of time.</P>
    <P>The present Government did succeed in reducing emigration for a considerable period before the war.  Emigration rose again during the war and was again later reduced.  I do not pretend that we will be able to cure that problem in a short time.  I believe we are making steady progress towards giving greater employment, towards ensuring permanent employment.  In this connection I should mention the fact that, in spite of all our difficulty, and although the number of unemployed has increased in connection with certain industries, the Social Welfare Act came into operation and enabled a large number of persons in rural districts to register for unemployment insurance during the winter.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1848" /> Before there was any change in the scope of social welfare legislation, we now know that, in 1952, there were approximately 25,000 persons more employed than in 1950.  That calculation, as everyone in the House knows, is made by working out the number of national health insurance contributions and providing an average figure for the year.  I shall be able to give in more detail the reasons for the increase in employment later.</P>
    <P>I suppose some members of the Parties supporting Fine Gael were under the illusion that the Coalition Government, if they could do nothing else, could carry out national reconstruction schemes at a greater pace than we ever did.  I hope they are disappointed and that they will alter their opinions in regard to the present Government when they realise how completely we have outstripped the Coalition record in relation to virtually every single project for national reconstruction, most of which were projected by us or in operation in 1947 and many of which were mishandled by the previous Government.</P>
    <P>I should mention, in connection with the general question of giving employment, that we note that once again Deputy Dillon appears to be slipping from Fine Gael who showed themselves to be, shall we say, rather fainthearted converts to the Fianna Fáil tariff policy.  The Deputy appears to be slipping again to a position of lofty independence of his Party whom we taught, in 16 long years, to believe in tariffs.  His ferocious attack on the whole world of Irish industrialists during the course of his recent speech leaves that in no doubt, and I hope that any person in this country who is interested in the welfare of workers in towns and cities will ask himself the question whether it is safe to support a Party one of whose principal supporters condemns so utterly and completely the whole of the new industrial world of this country.  I wonder whether, for example, Deputy Norton would like to have been in the House and to have heard Deputy Dillon talk about tariffs, knowing the employment given through the aid of considerable protection in his own <Col N="1849" /> constituency in towns such as Naas, Newbridge and Kildare.  I wonder whether he still has the same faith as he once had in Deputy Dillon's omniscience, in his supposedly divine instincts in regard to politics, which have been so frequently shattered through the fact that he is never able to record that his prophecies came true and the fact that his policy changes with every wind.</P>
    <P>I think it is important to record the actual progress made by the Government in regard to agriculture and industry and the many other schemes for which we have always been responsible. In connection with agriculture it is well to remind the House that in the last year of their office every branch of agriculture was in a state of decline save the cattle industry. Pigs were declining in numbers, poultry were declining and tillage had gone down by 53,000 acres.  It is well to remind the House that Deputy Dillon boasted that he spent $5,000,000 on wheat in one afternoon as a method of getting rid of Marshall Aid and that nevertheless he was forced, late in April, 1951 to advocate tillage and to put at the head of the list of advertisements that appeared in the newspapers the hated wheat.</P>
    <P>The only thing he did so far as agriculture was concerned was to run us into debt with America to the tune of £27,000,000 for wheat that we could grow here and could grow without difficulty.  At the end of his term of office agricultural production was still below the 1938 level and was, in fact, no higher than it was during our administration in 1945, after years of war when there was almost a complete absence of fertilisers and machinery.</P>
    <P>To record some of the progress that we made: We considered it right to give milk producers two increases in price.  We have at last got a substantial increase of beet sugar produce, the price having been increased by 10/- a ton: We have given increases of 15/- a barrel in the price of wheat since June, 1951.  Deputy Dillon talked about the difficulties facing the pig industry at the present time.  In actual fact the pig population has been growing ever since we came into office <Col N="1850" /> because of an agreement made whereby the proportion of pork exports to bacon exports was altered in our favour and as a result a very profitable trade has grown up.</P>
    <P>All agricultural exports have improved. Agricultural exports in 1952 were 20 per cent. in value over those in 1950.  Production did not increase very much.  We still have that problem to face but there was a small, measurable increase in the actual quantities of produce which came off the land in 1952.  There has been great progress in regard to the fresh and frozen beef trade of this country, in which exports went up by 71 per cent. compared with 1951.  In general, there was an air of prosperity in regard to the agricultural industry last year.</P>
    <P>We have always regarded the application of limestone as one of the most important factors in agricultural production. It was during the office of this Government that eight new limestone production plants have gone into operation, making the total number in the country 26, and it was during the period of office of this Government that the production of ground limestone increased from 75,000 tons to 500,000 tons.</P>
    <P>Deputy Dillon was talking about the parish plan for giving instruction to the agricultural community.  The number of instructors increased from 88 to 107 during the period of office of the present Government.</P>
    <P>I mention those things to show that everything is being done by the present Government to foster agricultural production. The scope and variety of loans have improved.  Credit has been made available to farmers for wheat seed and fertilisers.</P>
    <P>When we come to talk about the famous land rehabilitation project that was the king-pin of Deputy Dillon's agricultural policy, not only are we altering the scheme to provide benefits which will be to the advantage of the average farmer in this country, but the work done on the scheme in its present form, modified by the present Minister to ensure better results, has enormously expanded, expanded to the point that in connection with the scheme whereby farmers do their own <Col N="1851" /> work, in 1950-1951 there were 20,000 acres of land reclamation completed and by 1952-1953 the figure has increased to 75,000 acres.  The same sort of progress is being shown in connection with the scheme under which the work is done for the farmer by contractors.</P>
    <P>When we come to industry we see the same sort of progress.  We have to record the implementation of 140 projects for new industries or extension of industries.  We have to record that we and not the last Government succeeded in providing for the extension of the cement factories, factories which are of the kind that should appeal even to the stony-hearted Deputy Dillon who so much detests tariffs, factories that produce articles largely made from raw materials available here.  If the decision had been made as to how that extension should take place there would have been more employment and I believe there would have developed a very creditable export trade in cement.</P>
    <P>It was not the Coalition Government that expanded the beet sugar industry and arranged for an increase in the productive capacity of all the four factories; it was the present Government. We believe that beet sugar is not only a good industry in itself but that it improves the land and gives employment and ensures good scientific methods of cultivation.</P>
    <P>It was the present Government who made the final decision about the future of the tourist industry.  The Christenberry Report on the tourist industry lay, apparently untouched by the then Minister for Industry and Commerce, for months and months.  It was the present Government, who believe the tourist industry is second in importance in this country only to agriculture, which is our main industry, who reformed the Tourist Board, provided large sums of money in order to advertise this country as a tourist centre and finally made available guarantees for loans in respect of the improvement of hotel accomodation up to the limit of £3,000,000.  The last Government had three years to do all that, but their Government was composed of some people who did not even believe <Col N="1852" /> in the tourist industry, who did not think it was good for this country.  We are very well aware of the fact that if the tourists leave £25,000,000 a year, it is an industry that cannot be ignored, that we could not continue to provide a mere £40,000 for the Tourist Board, that such an industry needs sums of money running into hundreds of thousands of pounds if the work is to be well done.</P>
    <P>Then I come to the question of electrical development.  Having, as usual, to dispose of the difficulty which I always find with the members of the Fine Gael Party who point to the Shannon scheme, I might mention the fact that during the period of the Coalition Government they never made a single proposition for any kind of power station using native fuel and that since then there are water-power stations going up in three areas, peat fuel stations in three other areas, and four hand-won turf stations, and that a station is to be erected using Arigna coal.</P>
    <P>To give the House another illustration to prove that we know how to advance the development of this country, I would remind the House of the fact that Irish Shipping, Limited, were compelled to do something for themselves in the way of purchasing ships as they could not get any positive reply from the former Minister for Industry and Commerce as to what development they should undertake, and Deputy McGilligan subsequently reproved them sharply for making a decision without consulting the Government. It was left to us to increase the number of ships and provide for the expansion of Irish Shipping, Limited.  Although the Harbour Development Act was passed in 1947, no real work was done in sanctioning schemes until we came into office.  Now there are no less than 17 schemes in operation involving a total expenditure this year of £500,000.</P>
    <P>I do not think I need say very much about the dreadful nonsense talked in connection with C.I.E., the condemnation of diesel electric traction by the former Minister for Industry and Commerce. The present board of C.I.E. has been unchanged, and the members are the same as they were in the time <Col N="1853" /> of the Coalition Government.  They have had to admit that the use of diesel trains was the only possible way of maintaining reasonable employment on the system and removing the enormous costs against the system by the use of steam.</P>
    <P>As I said, there are many people who supported the Coalition who were bitterly disappointed with the fact that one of the prophecies they made that we would not be able to carry on capital development has proved untrue.  It is just as well to remind the House of what we did in general in regard to these schemes.  We completed 13,000 houses in 1952 compared with 12,000 in 1950.  We spent some £800,000 more on the construction of new hospitals in the last financial year than was spent in the previous financial year.  We extended the construction of schools.  The number of new schools in progress in January, 1953, was 107 as compared with 66 in January, 1951.  We enabled an enormous expansion to take place in the manufacture of machine-won turf so that production in tons went up from 214,000 in 1950 to 600,000 in 1952. In connection with rural electrification, about which the Coalition tried to take some credit to themselves, all the plans were made and the wires were going up towards the end of 1947.  The number of consumers connected went up from some 14,000 in 1949-50 to 80,000 in 1952-53.</P>
    <P>Then in regard to forestry, let us remember that Deputy MacBride said he would plant 1,000,000 acres if he had the chance, and Deputy Blowick stated that in less than no time he could plant 25,000 acres a year although he was unable to find the reserve of plantable areas for that purpose.  We succeeded in extending forestry so that in 1952 there were 15,000 acres planted in comparison with 7,400 in 1950.  I have already given figures in connection with our work in making the land improvement scheme operate properly. We extended arterial drainage.  There are more people employed on arterial drainage this year than in 1950 or 1951. We have made a grant for roads in tourist districts and have enabled a much larger sum to be afforded for road development in general.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1854" /> I wanted to give these facts because we have proved to be a Government that is alive to the needs of this country.  We have disproved all the doleful prophecies in regard to the abandonment of capital schemes and that we intended to adopt some fantastically conservative policy which would involve the disemployment of thousands of people who had been employed by the Coalition Government in what I might call the half-hearted operation of the schemes left by us to them in 1947.</P>
    <P>I do not think I need say very much more except once again to repeat that we are now entering on a year of a kind which has not been seen in this country for a very long time.  Prices have been increasing, slowly or rapidly, for nearly 17 years and the price rise has nearly come to an end, in respect of most commodities.  That will make a very big difference to the people of the country.  It means that the policy of the Government will have to be elastic, that we will have to allow for changes that might take place in our foreign trade.  It means that it will be no longer possible to make an automatic profit on anything, even agricultural produce, for the next few months, simply because of the fact that the price has risen in the meantime.  It compels upon us the need for greater production per acre and greater production per man.</P>
    <P>One of the reasons why the people of the country showed most marked discontent with the present Government in connection with the last by-election is the fact that it is very hard to make people realise that prices all over the world had gone sky-high, that they have suddenly become stable and that everyone is hesitating to buy.  We are faced with a completely new situation all over the world, a situation which, of course, may be upset at any time should there be another war scare or another devaluation of the £ or any other change in the world, which we cannot foresee and for which we have no responsibility.</P>
    <P>We believe that, having got over our budgetary difficulties and having decided to make economies in expenditure which have not been made for <Col N="1855" /> many a long year, we shall be able to advance ahead.  I should stress the fact that the decision of the Government to maintain the Supplementary Estimates as far as possible in the region of £750,000 in a year is a complete innovation and a sign that we really mean to control expenditure in a way that was never envisaged by the last Government.</P>
    <P>I would repeat again that they indulged in Supplementary Estimates to the tune of £8,000,000 or £9,000,000 per year.  They budgeted for practically no anticipated increases.  They budgeted for a very small proportion, indeed, of the very large amounts that they were forced to spend.  In addition to making economies, totalling £3,500,000, in our present expenditure, the fact that we will not spend an average of £8,000,000 a year, so to speak, is very remarkable.  That is something that will call for great restraint and it will not be popular in certain quarters.</P>
    <P>There is one thing that people invariably forget when they talk about high taxes and that is the fact that if expenditure comes down somebody gets hurt, in the same way as people get hurt when taxes go up.  The restraint we will show should set an example to the rest of the community in relation to the new economic situation of price stabilisation.  The way may not be easy but it is nevertheless the best way in which we can overcome the difficulties we inherited from the Coalition Government.</P>
    <P>I would like to remind the Opposition that in the 1951 Budget there was an expenditure of £8,000,000 for which no provision had been made.  If we had not had to impose taxation to bring in that £8,000,000 the burden would have been far lighter.  Our task would have been much easier if the Government had shown some prudence and some providence during the year 1950 and the first half of the year 1951.  It is a fact that the difference between the £15,000,000 we had to raise and the £7,000,000 we might have raised had there not been that improvidence, is literally the difference between what seemed, at least at the time, to be <Col N="1856" /> crushing taxation and the taxation that was inevitably demanded by increasing costs and increasing social services.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatOReilly" hpid="Mr. P. O'Reilly Mr. P. O'Reilly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. O'Reilly</NameTxt>
      <P>I listened very carefully to the Budget speech and the more it is re-echoed by the Minister's own Party the more it reminds me of little Jack Horner when he put in his thumb and pulled out a plum, &ldquo;What a good boy am I?&rdquo; Unlike little Jack Horner, however, the Minister has pulled out some very bitter plums.</P>
      <P>Will this be the only Budget with which we will find ourselves faced in this financial year?  Since the 1952 Budget we have had two interim Budgets.  We had the Minister for Local Government coming in here with increased taxation on motor lorries, tractors and motor cars.  We had the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs some weeks ago coming in here with increased taxation on stamps, telegrams and telephones.  After the Wicklow and Cork by-elections, will we have a new Budget?</P>
      <P>The people throughout the country have had a serious set-back.  The henchmen of Fianna Fáil up and down the country have led the people to believe there would be some relief in taxation.  They told the people that the Budget last year was necessary in order to rectify the position in which the Coalition had left the country.  It is odd that the inter-Party Government is always described as a Coalition by Fianna Fáil, but they never refer to themselves in their present set-up as a Coalition.  The henchmen of Fianna Fáil told the people that one decent Budget would put the country right.</P>
      <P>When the inter-Party Government was in office a sum of practically £2,000,000 was provided under the Local Authorities (Works) Act.  This year that provision has been reduced to £400,000.  Two years ago Cavan, the constituency that I represent, had £44,000 allotted to it under that Act. Last year the amount was cut to £22,000 and this year Cavan will receive a paltry sum of £11,000.  I take it other countries have suffered in the same way.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When the Undeveloped Areas Bill <Col N="1857" /> was being piloted through the House I made a plea for Cavan's inclusion in that Bill.  Fianna Fáil's political prestige in Cavan is regarded as being very high.  The Arterial Drainage Bill was never implemented in Cavan. Taking everything into account surely it is unfair that Cavan should now be allotted a paltry £11,000 under the Local Authorities (Works) Act.  The money spent under that Act was used to advantage to carry out very useful works.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Agriculture made a statement, reported in the daily papers, at the Spring Show to the effect that the flight from the land has suddenly ceased.  There never was such a flight from the land as there was during the Spring Show because the country people were anxious to find out how they could develop their land by modelling their methods on what they saw at the Show but I am afraid the Minister has overlooked the fact that 78,000 have left the land in the last two years.</P>
    <P>The Minister has stated that he intends to float a new loan.  Everybody is anxious to know at what rate of interest that loan will be issued.  It is very difficult for the farming community to get credit at the present time at 6 per cent.  It is impossible for a farmer who wants to stock his land to borrow money at 6 per cent.</P>
    <P>The effects of this Budget are being endured by the man-in-the-street.  They have also to be endured by our institutions, our hospitals and our county homes.  If things continue as they are at present we will find ourselves faced with national collapse.</P>
    <P>A good deal of money is provided in this Budget for unemployment assistance. The recipients of that unemployment assistance who genuinely cannot find employment are entitled to everything they can get, but I am afraid that a number of the recipients are not genuinely entitled to it.  One sees recipients lined up outside the barracks in every town in the country.  Many of these are people who, if they were offered employment with a farmer, would not take it.  They prefer to receive their 50/- unemployment assistance, or whatever the sum may be.  I <Col N="1858" /> think it would be better if the money provided for unemployment assistance was utilised for the more productive purposes. If it could be handed over to the farmer to encourage him to engage more in tillage or if it could be handed over to the local bodies, county councils, etc., I think the Minister would be doing a good day's work.</P>
    <P>Somebody here remarked during the debate on the Estimate for the Department of Posts and Telegraphs that due to the size of the Thomas Moore commemoration stamp it took some licking.  However, as a result of the increase in the price for bread and butter, the reduction in the Local Authorities (Works) Act grants and in the number of people employed, I feel that should the electorate get an opportunity in the very near future the Fianna Fáil Government will be licked out of existence for all time.</P>

      <P>On that occasion they were hopeful that they might be able to make sufficient capital out of the unpopular increases in some taxes to lever their way back to office once again.  That hope has receded, but in connection with this year's Budget they have resurrected the same speeches as they used last year though lacking the same punch and vigour as they had on that occasion.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Personally I think it is a good Budget.  It is a Budget which plans to expand capital development where capital development is required, and <Col N="1859" /> in so far as capital development can absorb unemployment in this country. It expands development in the right direction and makes provision for economies where economies are required and at the same time puts the financial structure of this country on a solid foundation enabling us to pay our way.  Taking it on those bases it is a good Budget, a Budget which foretells well for the future and gives confidence to those who are prepared to lay out money on development of industry in any particular line in this country.</P>
    <P>Every Deputy is entitled, without being too parochial, to apply the test of the past year to his own area.  I was anxious recently to know how expenditure on public works affected my own county.  I put down a series of questions in the House which elicited replies exactly in accordance with what I thought.  I found that the amount expended on afforestation was very much in excess of the amount in the previous year, which was already much greater than the amounts in any of the years of the Coalition Government; that the amount of money expended by Bord na Móna over the same period showed a marked upward, healthy trend; the amount of money expended by the E.S.B. on rural electrification showed a significant increase; the same applied in so far as the textile industry was concerned, the knitwear industry and particularly the industry sponsored and carried on by Gaeltarra Éireann in Donegal. Expenditure showed a marked increase in the pay packets distributed weekly to the workers in Donegal. These are the things which are really the barometer as far as we are concerned in relation to public expenditure.</P>
    <P>Those people who talk of extravagance on the one hand, too much money being spent on social services and so forth, and at the same time condemn increasing taxation, are leaving a vacuum; if they curtail expenditure, reduce taxation and at the same time carry on the social services which at least some sections of the Coalition are yet strongly supporting, <Col N="1860" /> they are leaving a void which the public wonder by what means they intend to fill it.  We hear a lot of talk about how anxious the Opposition pretend to be in relation to a general election or a by-election.  I wonder what answer they have for the public, particularly the section of the public who usually support those Coalition groups, as to how the Labour Party, which is an indispensable part of the Coalition Government, propose to reconcile their present differences with Fine Gael, since one of the leading spokesmen of Fine Gael has condemned the many social services as an evil which must be avoided, while the Leader of the Labour Party points out that our progress in social services is not by any means going the distance which he would like it to go.  How these two Parties could reconcile that marked difference for the future in order once again to form a Coalition, if the opportunity arises, is a question which will, no doubt, perturb the minds of their supporters but, indeed, will not cause any alarm as far as Fianna Fáil is concerned.  When one considers this hiatus in the former Coalition programme one will realise how anxious the Coalition really are that an election should not take place until it is due to take place, and as we believe it will take place, in 1956.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EamonnRooney" hpid="Mr. Rooney Mr. Rooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Rooney</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Deputy believe it?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JosephBrennan" hpid="Mr. J. Brennan Mr. J. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy believes it definitely.  Last year the trend of our speeches was to point out the inevitable aftermath of the Coalition spree, to point out that the Budget which was then introduced was the inevitable result of the three careless years of Coalition Government.  In doing that we were not the first people to give a warning to the electorate in this country that that sort of thing was bound in the end to lead the country to ruin.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Looking over the official records of this House to-day I came across a report which I remember reading when I was not a member of this Assembly and in which I took a particular interest at the time.  The statement was made by a very famous, self-styled economist, Deputy Dillon, who said at <Col N="1861" /> column 232, Volume 62 of the Official Debates of 13th May, 1936:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;I charge the Fianna Fáil Government and Party with deliberately living from day to day without any regard for the future solvency of this country, with emulating the example of any fool who wins a sweepstake and proceeds to go on a drunken spree, and does not give a hoot for what will happen when the proceeds are gone.  I say that if that drunken spree continues, this country will pay, and pay bitterly, for it in the long run.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>That solemn warning was given by Deputy Dillon at a time when, I would say, he had less reason to draw the attention of the Irish people to the state of affairs that then existed than he had in 1952 when, as a result of the greatest spree ever held in this country, not because of anyone winning a sweepstake but as a result of the Coalition Government throwing into circulation money borrowed from America and from every source which they could get it, in order that they might live from day to day and capture the popular vote, things went from bad to worse.  It was the three years of that type of spree, a much more joyous spree than that to which Deputy Dillon drew attention in 1936, which necessitated the Budget of 1952 about which there was so much talk from the opposite side and about which Opposition members are making the same speeches to-day.  If what Deputy Dillon said was true in 1936, when there was a very temperate and comparatively moderate expenditure of public moneys in relation to what his Government carried on during their years of office and if he believed it was true, it was certainly ten times more true, if one could put it that way, in 1952.</P>
    <P>That type of day-to-day policy which they pursued in order to court the popularity of the electorate was not for the country's good.  It was never indulged in to any serious extent until the Coalition Government found themselves by accident in power.  They knew perfectly well that the evil day might not be far distant and it was only by the careless manipulation of <Col N="1862" /> the financial structure of this State that they succeeded in postponing that evil day as long as they did.  Remember that those speakers on the Opposition side, who refer to the alleged prosperity of the years of Coalition, never once made an attempt to explain why, if things were going as well as they would like us to believe, they did not remain in office until the statutory period expired.  They were not defeated but they knew that when the Budget of 1951 was introduced it was better that the true situation should not be revealed to the light of this House and that the public should not realise the position as it really was in the belief that, as the public were still metaphorically asleep, they could creep back into office and then introduce the necessary Supplementary Budget to finance measures necessary to implement the programme which they would have to operate for the year to come.</P>
    <P>That very unpleasant task was not entrusted to them by the electorate. They were found out and the task was entrusted to the Fianna Fáil Government who tackled it in an honest way. They tackled it in the only honest way in which it could be tackled and that was to make adequate provision for the future.  The day-to-day spree, to which Deputy Dillon referred, was over, and sound planning had to be undertaken in order to restore confidence in the finances of this country, in order that the economic fabric of the State could be strengthened, that planning ahead could be embarked upon and that the crash which threatened could be averted.</P>
    <P>The success of the Budget introduced by Fianna Fáil is now evident to everybody who has a serious interest in the affairs of this country and more evident to those who contemplated investing their capital to establish industries in this country, whether they invest it in the agricultural industry, the manufacturing industry or any other kind of industry.</P>
    <P>There is one serious problem which existed during all these years, and prior to those years, but which certainly was exaggerated during the three years of the Coalition Government. It still, unfortunately, exists in <Col N="1863" /> this State.  I refer to the depopulation of the western seaboard, a state of affairs in which the people are flying to the cities and swelling abnormally the population of our larger provincial towns and particularly of the cities. You may describe it as a flight from the land; you may describe it as a quest for a better standard of living, but the fact remains that it is a serious problem and it has been thoroughly revealed in the result of the last census.  Fianna Fáil is the only Party that has ever undertaken corrective measures towards the solution of that serious problem.  They took these measures without delay when they appointed the Parliamentary Secretary to the Government charged with the responsibility of promoting any scheme calculated to solve that serious problem. While the Opposition were jealous of the Undeveloped Areas Act&mdash;and it was only one of the measures taken&mdash; and while it was criticised as a piece of political manoeuvring and the prophecy was made that it would not be a success, it is noteworthy that it is now producing the desired results. I am confident that it will eventually bring about the decentralisation of many important industries which are bound, in the ultimate, to have an important bearing on the solution of the problem of the flight from the western seaboard.</P>
    <P>The money voted for tourist roads and schemes contemplated to alleviate the problem to which I have referred, will eventually, I hope, bring people to realise that as good a standard of living as is available elsewhere can be found on the western seaboard.  When the people who are attracted to the cities, where there is overcrowding and lack of housing and where there are more people than there is productive employment to absorb, realise that, they will remain at home with the hope of securing, not relief work for a fortnight in the winter, but permanent jobs in which they can settle down. Then we shall have gone a long way towards solving the problem of the flight from the western seaboard, a problem which goes hand in hand with the problem of emigration generally.</P>
    <P>We do not believe that emigration <Col N="1864" /> can be cured by a Local Authorities (Works) Act, or any temporary measure which will temporarily bring down the figures in respect of the unemployed at a particular period.  We believe in putting this nation in a position where those who would venture to invest in industries would realise that it would be prudent to invest in industry, where employment of a permanent nature would be created, employment of the kind envisaged by the pioneers of national self-sufficiency, employment that would remain and not apply from day to day but be such as would eventually absorb our entire surplus of unemployed.</P>
    <P>I was wondering, when listening to some Deputies speaking to-day, whether they had anything to boast about in relation to the figures for unemployment during the years of the Coalition Government.  What type of employment must it have been if it subsided over the last two years?  We did nothing to prevent employment or put people out of employment.  On the contrary, we put people back into employment in industries that were virtually closed down when this Government took over.  One has only to cast one's mind back to the position in which those engaged in the textile industries found themselves at that time.  That matter has been referred to here repeatedly and it is not necessary to give the figures again, but the Opposition could not be reminded too often of the position which existed in relation to the textile industry when the people who would be the customers of manufacturers found their stores chock-a-block with imported shody material and manufactured piece goods from abroad while their own concerns stood idle leaving off men day by day.</P>
    <P>I think the figure given to me by the Minister for Industry and Commerce at the time showed that over £3,000,000 worth of finished knitwear was imported during the year ending 30th June, 1951.  That was a scandalous state of affairs to exist in a country where we could produce the best knitwear in the world and where firms at our doorstep in Donegal were working on short-time with skeleton staffs because they could not sell their products. A very inferior type of material <Col N="1865" /> was imported.  The people opposite are the people who tell us that the employment position was better in their time than it is now.  If it were better, then it must have been a very temporary type of employment, because we put more people back into those industries during the past two years than the Coalition employed altogether during their years of office on temporary employment.</P>
    <P>I have repeatedly said in this House that if the unemployment problem was to be tackled seriously in this country it would never be solved by throwing money down the drain for a few weeks at Christmas time to employ men and bring down the figures in regard to unemployment for a few weeks.  The making of drains, bog roads and the provision of special employment schemes, however commendable or necessary those jobs sometimes may be, are not sufficient to solve the problem. The position is that our entire economic structure must be so developed that industrialists will not be afraid to venture to set up industries in this country and will not be afraid to invest thousands of pounds in those industries to give our boys and girls permanent employment in which they can remain under a Government that will give the necessary protection to the materials they produce and enable the industries to carry on successfully for the rest of their lives.  That is the situation towards which we are rapidly advancing at the moment.</P>
    <P>People who have money at the present time are not afraid to give it to the Government.  They are not afraid to invest it in industry in order to solve the unemployment problem which exists.  The more we spend in that way the more we will tend towards a real solution of the unemployment problem. Every year from Donegal, Mayo, Kerry and the congested areas come thousands of proposals in regard to schemes known as minor employment schemes.  These proposals are submitted to the Special Employment Schemes office at Earlsfort Terrace. Thousands of pounds are expended on giving relief work to a number of people for a period of time when the figures in respect of unemployment are at their highest.  I suppose that is a <Col N="1866" /> necessary thing to do but I often wondered whether if all the money that was expended in that way was spent on the creation of permanent employment the work would not merely endure but expand as time went on. If we did that we would be doing something really important and worthwhile towards the solution of unemployment. It is only by creating confidence and by restoring the confidence of the people who have money to invest that we can hope to succeed that way.</P>
    <P>In so far as housing is concerned, I think a rather amusing situation developed in the course of the debate. The Coalition Government claimed credit for our success in housing over the last year.  They said we could not have succeeded to the extent we did unless the plans were already laid in the past.  They took full credit for the housing development during their immediate years of office.  Therefore, we would only be following their argument to its logical conclusion by adducing that if they were responsible for the success of the past year's housing programme then we must have been responsible for the success of the entire housing programme during their term of office.</P>
    <P>As a matter of fact, neither is true. As a member of a local authority, I remember that as far back as 1936 we prepared and laid the foundations of our housing schemes as they have been developed ever since.  With a great deal of care on the part of our county medical officer of health, his assistant, the engineering staff and the architects we made a general survey of all the housing that was required in the entire county.  Not merely did we make a survey but we acquired sites in every possible town, village and hamlet for the purpose of going ahead, as the Minister for Local Government was pressing us, at full speed with the housing programme to meet the entire needs of the people of our county.</P>
    <P>Those were the days when housing development was sponsored, and when the plans were laid that brought success to the housing situation in this country.  That success did not come about as a result of anything that was done a year or two ago under the <Col N="1867" /> Coalition.  If people will cast their minds back they will realise that the success of the Fianna Fáil Party, when they first came into power, with their housing programme, confounded even the earliest forecasts of the Labour Party.  This Government at that time built thousands of houses, more than the Labour Party of the time said it would be possible for them to build.</P>
    <P>It is no harm either to remind people of all that this Government has done over the last 20 years in providing social services for the community.  They improved the position in regard to old age pensions and widows' pensions.  In regard to some of those social services, the country had not even heard of them until Fianna Fáil introduced them.  I did not happen to be a member of the House at the time, but in those early days this Government laid the foundations for many of our present-day social services.  It was the first Government in the world to introduce a non-contributory widows' pension and was a pioneer in the provision of children's allowances.</P>
    <P>I remember the dark and evil days of the Cumann na nGaedheal Government when an old man could not get a pension of any kind if he had a bit of land.  These things bring to mind the speech which was delivered in Cork by a Front Bench member of the Opposition.  In that speech, which was fully reported in the Sunday papers, he indicated that he would like to see this country going back to the days when the old age pension was reduced by a shilling, and when the means test was so severe that a man with a few acres of land could scarcely qualify for anything in the shape of a pension.  We do not want to go back to the days when the people in the congested and uneconomic areas were flying from the country in despair because they saw no future for it, and felt that the foundations of the State had been badly laid.  That was the period 1923 to 1932.  That situation has been rectified, and tribute must be paid to this Party that did it.  The position now is that no one will get up and suggest that we should go back to the conditions which existed in those days.</P>

Deputy O'Reilly's statement was an important one in view of all that has been said here over the past few weeks about unemployment.  He said that most of the people who were signing in his area and in other areas throughout the country for unemployment assistance were people who would not accept employment if it were offered to them. If that statement of his is to be taken at its face value, then all this talk about the increase in unemployment can be easily explained.</P>

The fact remains that the Opposition continue to play the same old game.

They cannot have it both ways.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In conclusion I want to refer to what I said at the outset in connection with the quotation I gave from Deputy Dillon's speech.  To use Deputy Dillon's argument, if the spree continued the position could ultimately become so serious that we might not be able to retrieve ourselves from it. That was the warning that he uttered in the Dáil at that time.  It was equally true, only more so, in 1952.  I do not suppose that, when Deputy Dillon said that, he contemplated that he would be boasting many years afterwards of starting on a spree himself <Col N="1869" /> and spending, as he said, $5,000,000 in an afternoon.</P>

      <P>Deputy Dillon's spree had, of course, to come to its inevitable end.  I congratulate the Minister on introducing a Budget which has shown a definite steadying up of the economic structure of the State. We are now in the position in which confidence in our finance and in the nation has been restored.  The position is exemplified beyond doubt in this Budget, as well as in last year's Budget, that a balance has been reached between revenue and expenditure. If that position had not been brought about by the Minister, one could hardly expect to see confidence restored in our finances.</P>
      <P>The Minister also indicated that certain economies are to be effected. His statement on that will be welcomed by everyone.  At the same time, he is making provision for expenditure on works of capital development.  These will tend to absorb the unemployed. The Minister has also initiated a pay as you go system.  That will ensure that this country will not be plunged into irretrievable debt, and so will not be put in pawn to any other nation in the world.</P>

      <P>I do not think I have ever listened to Deputy Brennan speak at such great length in this House with so little effect.  He finished his speech on the note that confidence has been restored in the country.  The significant feature of the general demeanour of the people throughout the length and breadth of the country at the present time is a complete lack of confidence. That lack of confidence must inevitably ensue as a consequence of this Budget.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Brennan, in the course of his long peroration, said that Deputies on this side had been repeating, more or less the criticisms which they had offered on the 1952 Budget.  Not only must we repeat them, but we must add to them in a serious way.  I intend on this occasion to try to reflect in the discussion here what is the real feeling of the people at the moment.  There is <Col N="1870" /> undoubtedly no leadership in this country.  There is undoubtedly, at the moment, not only no confidence in the Government but a complete lack of confidence, and an ever-growing desire and demand from the people to know &ldquo;when are you going to get them out?&rdquo; That is something that Deputy Cunningham will laugh at.</P>

Anyway, to bring a bit of realism into this discussion, a Budget is the instrument by which the Government plans the general economy of the country.  The Budget introduced this year shows all the traits of the 1952 Budget, no amelioration, no improvement.  The only gesture is a belated one to the public servants who had been too long denied what they are granted.</P>

If one has to face the tenacity with which they cling to power, that they managed to slip into on the busted five &mdash;now one recalcitrant member rejoined &mdash;if one has to face the prospect that the people may be misled by the particular Government in office, you are not inclined to get more youthful looking but rather, in the discharge of responsibility, to make long hours of sacrifice in trying to keep the people from the slough of despair to which they are being driven willy-nilly by the present Government.</P>
      <P>The amazing feature of the present crisis in this country is that a tremendous number of people in substantial employment are agitating to get out of it because they find, with the impact of taxation and the present economic situation, their wages do not enable them to carry on.</P>
      <P>Let us be serious when we deal with the problems of the nation.  No matter what the thrust and parry of debate may cause, we cannot get away from the basic fact that we have a position of stalemate, of unrest, of a new type of uneasiness creeping into the general approach of the people.</P>

      <P>With respect to Deputy Cunningham and Deputy Rooney, if they will allow me to develop my argument they will have plenty of opportunity to answer it.  I have had such a volume of interruptions that I am getting impatient.  This Budget may be characterised as &ldquo;a Budget of no hope&rdquo;.  Last year the Minister made Victorian speeches in the economic sense; he paid service to doctrines of economy that I do not believe in; and this year he talks highfalutin nonsense about restoration in the body economic.  He has only to walk outside the gate of Leinster House and ask any person in any walk of life to find what a bludgeoning effect his whole economic system, as portrayed in the last Budget and as renewed in this one, has caused.</P>
      <P>You have increased emigration&mdash; there is no gainsaying that.  You have the worst possible type of emigration. You have people coming to you who are in employment who are getting what in normal circumstances would be a reasonable wage, who are anxious to evacuate this country complete with themselves, their wives and families and try somewhere else because they feel there is no future here.  You have the Taoiseach talking about the limit of taxation being reached and you have his particular penny-ante boys, whether they be the Minister for Local Government or the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs, making their contribution to increased taxation by calling it a charge for service.  You have this country in the grip of an economic system designed to give the maximum possible extraction of money from the public and the minimum possible return for it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have always believed in giving substantial Grants-in-Aid and help to the weaker sections of the community.  I have heard hardy old chestnuts bandied around the House about what Cumann na nGaedheal did in 1927 or 1929.  Whatever the motive that actuated decisions then, we all have <Col N="1873" /> made a general advance since then and realise our duty to less fortunate members of the community.  I have no hesitation in saying that I support all types of social welfare legislation to give sustenance and assistance to the people, as long as it is within the capacity of the country to pay for it. We have reached the stage where the Government, whenever it gets into difficulty, starts singing the song of all the social services they have given.  Every Deputy must realise, as I do, that a man in receipt of unemployment assistance would be infinitely more satisfied if the economic circumstances of this country made it possible for him instead to earn a decent wage to maintain himself and his family.  That is the object of most decent hardworking people of all classes in this country and it is no consolation to them to have people throwing largesse around this House, which they claim they have the giving of, in the form of social service benefits, when in fact the main duty of the Government is that of ensuring, to the best of its ability and within the State's financial capacity, employment and a decent standard of life for the people.</P>
    <P>We have come to a state where we must face realities.  There is uneasiness and unrest.  People talk glibly here about growing unemployment and it is virtually a tragedy to listen to the general trend of conversations all over the country and to see the ever-increasing number of vacant chairs in rural homes from which the people are going and going and we cannot bid them stay.</P>
    <P>I heard to-night scathing references to temporary schemes of relief which might have been provided under the Local Authorities (Works) Act as pouring money down the drain, but the sooner we realise that there is a vast field of permanent employment for a very considerable period in the cleaning and draining of our rivers and the removal of surplus water from our land, the better for us all.  We talk of schemes of capital development and of schemes of employment.  Surely there is no better way of spending money to greater advantage or more effectively than on bringing into better and fuller <Col N="1874" /> production more and more land, realising as we do that every rehabilitated fertile acre of good land is going to give a return that no bricks and mortar, no social service and no other type of service can give, because there and there alone lies the basic wealth of the country.</P>
    <P>We seem to have drifted away completely from reality in regard to what our economic policy should be.  This Budget shows no economic policy except a continuation of what I once described as the Fianna Fáil rampage for more taxation.  People throughout the length and breadth of the country who have laboured and groaned under the weight of taxation for the past 12 months were entitled to expect concessions and reliefs, were entitled to expect that at least, in the light of the experiences of last year, there would be a readjustment of the load.  There has been no such thing and we still have the pitiful spectacle of a continuation of the raid on the larders of the people for the money to run government.  No matter what songs may be sung about increases in old age pensions or any of the other benefits given to the weaker sections, they still face the stark reality that what was taken from them with one hand was greater than what was given with the other and they find themselves in the position of having infinitely less than they had before.</P>
    <P>We have reached a stage in this country where&mdash;whoever is the cause of it&mdash;recession has got a tremendous grip and in which all speculative initiative and effort seem to have died. People talk about industry and I often wonder whether we have really got down to planning sound economy at all for the country.  Some of our industries have achieved a standard which would make them the pride and joy of any nation and some of them have achieved a quality in production that entitles them to the complete and wholehearted commendation of the House, but we have undoubtedly too eager a seeking after what I might call mushroom industry as distinct from the planned industry which is germane to our main economy, agriculture.  We have in this little country become too rapidly city-minded and we have got <Col N="1875" /> too rapidly away from the fundamental truth that our real future and our real prosperity depends, in the ultimate analysis, on a substantial and ever-growing increase in the yield of our farms.</P>
    <P>I have heard people here talk about self-sufficiency and I have heard people recounting some of the old doctrinaire teachings of the Fianna Fáil Party, but I am prepared to let bygones be bygones, because the important problem in relation to the Budget of this year is the immediate present.  We have a country in the throes of depression, with people displaying a new uneasiness. We have a complete lack of confidence, and, even though some of the Fianna Fáil Deputies may laugh, it is only right to put on the records of the House that there is an insistent clamour from everybody one meets, whether in the street, on the playing field or on the country road, for a change and the question is constantly being asked: &ldquo;When are you going to get them out?  Can you not do something to get them out?&rdquo; This Government in its budgetary policy shows its complete lack of touch with the people.</P>
    <P>I have said here before that the whole structure of this Government is wrong.  The basis on which they came into office initially was wrong, but one might have some confidence in them if there was even a sprinkling of youth and new minds in the Cabinet.  Instead, all that the new Fianna Fáil Government has done is to bring into office again the same worn-out horses, with a change of the traces which some of them have to pull.  We have the inevitable result&mdash;&ldquo;Too long in office&rdquo;&mdash;stamped on every action of this Government. We have a complete lack of real touch with present-day problems.</P>
    <P>We are told glibly by the Minister that there is no restriction on credit, but we know, as everyone who can speak his true knowledge knows, that there is a vice-like grip on credit.  We know perfectly well that this tremendous trade recession and the falling off in employment are due to the fact that money is not flowing freely, that more and more money is being tied up in all <Col N="1876" /> kinds of savings or deposits and not being made available in reasonable quantities at reasonable rates to people who want to develop or expand. There are people at the moment who are afraid to expand, industrialists, many of whom are carrying too big a stock, afraid to go on.  Not only is there the problem of the unemployed but the rising problem of uneasiness on the part of people in employment and the coming difficulties of half-pay and short time.  Throughout the length and breadth of this city there is complete panic in the drapery trade.  The unfortunate assistants, male and female, do not know from week to week how long their jobs will last.</P>
    <P>Is that a situation a Government can boast of?  Will this Budget, that has the same bludgeoning, butchering effect as the 1952 Budget, hold forth any hope of a future to the people?  The people are not complete fools.  They can see right well the hesitancy of the Government to move writs for by-elections. They can see full well the general rising antipathy and positive, fierce indignation of people to this Government and its whole planning for the country.</P>
    <P>Fianna Fáil's cant is to cover all the effort of the inter-Party Government, all the impetus to employment, all the stimulation in industry, all the forward movement for three and a half years, by calling it a spree.  We have never yet heard any reference to specific sums of money that were in all that period profligately or improperly spent.</P>
    <P>It is the duty of a Government to govern its people.  This Government are not doing that because that duty carries with it the responsibility of ensuring stability in the economic structure.  Unfortunately for the people, we have reached the stage where the venom of political spleen and spite has made the very nation its plaything and, willy-nilly, with bludgeoning certainty, Fianna Fáil killed every scheme of the inter-Party Government that showed hope and promise for the country.</P>
    <P>We hear the glib expressions of Deputies in regard to unemployment. Employment must have been very temporary, <Col N="1877" /> says Deputy Brennan, if it has gone by now.  Let him contrast the figures for 1949, 1950, and 1951, of 1,000 to 1,500 persons per month going into permanent, insurable employment, with the present position, in which we are unable to calculate this month what the increase in the unemployment figures may be as a result of the general slump and laying-off of people in drapery houses throughout the city.</P>
    <P>What does the Government do?  It sits on its seat, stimulating no hope, giving the country no lead other than &ldquo;As you were.  We hit you so hard in 1952 that we do not think you are quite recovered yet and we will knock you out again while you are still staggering.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Then we have the continuous clamour about production.  We have veiled innuendo from the Government's tail, whether it be the gallant Deputy Captain Cowan or Deputy Dr. Browne, that the farmers are in some way evading their responsibility.  Deputy Dr. Noel Browne is not sure that he would leave their land with them. Deputy Cowan thinks they are not carrying their burden of taxation.  Then there are the two embryo Taoiseachs behind the Taoiseach.  We have the Minister for Finance, as quoted by Deputy Dillon, saying that taxation presses lightly on the land.  Presses lightly on the land&mdash;from whence all wealth in this country really springs. Who but those who make their living on the land carry the main burden of all the indirect taxation?  We cry for increased production while we hit the farmer, not only with the normal increased costs that have hit all sections of the community but, as a result of those increased costs, the cost of labour, the problem of labour itself has become more difficult, and every particular type of instrument, seed and everything else that the farmer uses has stepped up enormously in price.</P>
    <P>A Deputy in the Fianna Fáil Benches glibly said that they spent a lot of money in fertiliser aid.  That is a little ironic when one remembers that the fertilisers that were bought most advantageously by the previous Minister for Agriculture were, overnight, on the change of Government, skyrocketed <Col N="1878" /> in price and black-marketed by that Government to the farmers of Ireland, black-marketed to such an extent that some of the stores have been described as mines that have to be quarried to get out the fertiliser, on which expensive storage has been paid, and which was put out of the reach of the farmers by the simple act of a Government who, however they may try to justify it, increased the cost of fertilisers that were bought and delivered into store at less than £9 a ton to between £13 and £14 overnight by one administrative act of the Minister for Agriculture.</P>
    <P>In my opinion this Government does not know what it is doing, for the simple reason that it has too many masters.  They plan a Budget having to concede to the wishes of Deputy Browne and Deputy ffrench O'Carroll in one direction, to the wishes of Deputy Cowan in another direction and to play ball with Deputy Cogan in the other direction and at the same time to meet the rising criticism of its own Party who appreciate the difficulties they are making for themselves and the country.</P>
    <P>We have reached the stage when we must face the real problem.  Is over-taxation, is credit restriction, is increased depression the answer to our nation's problem?  That is what the Government has to offer.  In the height of a world war, in the throes of a diabolical war, the Premier of another nation had to exhort his people that he had nothing to give them but blood, sweat and tears.  We, who avoided the war, who have and could have one of the finest little countries in the world, have a Government that preaches, in the present situation, a dismal story of gloom and no hope.</P>
    <P>The people of this country were entitled to expect substantial relief from this Government and they got nothing.  Surely in the light of all that transpired in the last year the Government must realise, as every Fianna Fáil back bencher realises, the trouble they have brought upon the country.</P>
    <P>One Deputy suggested before he ran out of the House that Fianna Fáil had established a pay-as-you-go system. They have succeeded in doing this <Col N="1879" /> much: in this agricultural country they have practically denied to the ordinary people the right to eat their own butter because the price has gone beyond the reach of anybody earning even what we would consider a reasonable wage.  They have continued to keep tea at an unreasonable and unnecessary price, particularly for the poorer sections of the community.  Is that something to boast of?  If you go into any substantial retail merchant in this city or the City of Cork or any of the big towns he will tell you that he has had an immense increase in the sale of good margarine and that he has more butter on his shelves than he can dispose of.  That is a nice boast for a Government in a cattle-producing, milk-producing, butter-producing country.</P>
    <P>It is our duty as an Opposition to keep pointing out to this Government what in fact they are doing.  Is it a solution of our problem to make things more and more difficult for every section of the community?  Is there any encouragement to the people on whom this nation must ultimately depend, the rising generation throughout this country, to try and make a future or a home for themselves in the present situation?  Will uncertainty of employment and unprecedented heights of taxation encourage the young people to stay at home and play their part in the building up of this nation?  Too often we have had to say in this House that we will ultimately reach a stage in this country where the real scarcity will be in the age groups from 25 to 40.  We will only have the middle-aged, the old and the extreme young.  The sooner the Government realise that we cannot develop our economy or expand as a nation unless we can harness the energy and the effort of our people from 18 to 50 years to the plough of national development the better.  We cannot develop as a nation without the aid of the human element which represents the fundamental unit of production.</P>
    <P>What will this Budget do to dissuade people from making inquiries about prospects in Canada, Australia, New <Col N="1880" /> Zealand and the other developing countries of the world?  Are the Government hiding themselves behind some queer barrier of their own and not realising what is going on?  Do they realise that their economic policy is not only forcing out of employment more and more people but that there is an ever-increasing stream of our young people going to other countries to help to build them into greater nations when we should be more than anxious to encourage them to stay at home to participate, not only in the working and development of this nation but, as time goes on, in the consummation of the independence of Ireland from the Lagan to the Lee?</P>
    <P>This Budget is a disaster.  I am not talking in the political sense when I speak of it as a disaster.  I am talking of it from the point of view of the effect it will have on the general national position.  Can we do nothing for the rising generation except to issue visas and passports to other countries?  This nation wants a tremendous injection of stimuli into its economic life.  This country wants leadership and this Government cannot give it.  It wants direction that will give hope and courage to its people.  This country, small though it may be, has a practically unlimited potential.  There is room for a great development in agriculture which I do not think anybody really envisages. We hear lip-service being paid to the policy of growing six blades of grass for every one now grown.  That is not only something that is possible but it is something that is probable in the immediate future if some Government will lend their minds to the task of putting Irish money and Irish effort into what will show the best and most fruitful returns.</P>
    <P>The Government have a duty to the unemployed.  I do not think any Deputy will glibly make reference to putting this nation in pawn to anybody if this Government, using the credit resources and the money of this country, expend them in such a way as to ensure that future generations will have a country in which to live. We are in the lamentable position <Col N="1881" /> where, according to our recent census, the population shows an alarming decrease. In particular, there is a tremendous decrease in the marriage-rate. It is equally alarming that we have reached the stage where the marriage-rate is high only in relation to the middle age group.  That is particularly true of the rural areas and it is something that can be used as the yardstick of our economy.  What is wrong with the country?  Why is it that our economy does not permit those who are the very backbone of the nation, those who are the keystones of our economy, the small farmer and the agricultural worker, to marry at any reasonably youthful age?</P>
    <P>The Government is hoping to get away with this Budget.  They think that because we are asked to continue the policy of &ldquo;As you were,&rdquo; the policy of bludgeoning and butchering through the imposition of taxation, the people will gasp with relief merely because there are no new impositions. This Budget shows a characteristic lack of foresight and a characteristic lack of direction just as the 1952 Budget did.  This Budget shows no initiative on the part of the Government. There is no incentive in it to development.  Lip service is paid by the Taoiseach and the Minister for Finance to the people who are carrying the present burden of taxation. Had the Minister had the courage, I believe he could have modified taxation in such a manner as to render revenue more buoyant than it is at present or is likely to be in the future.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Finance, assisted by his colleagues, the Minister for Local Government and the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs, has successfully devised this year the perfect machine for extracting yet more money from the people.  Apparently Fianna Fáil still believes that they are able to spend the people's money better than the people can spend it themselves.  The situation continues in which our people have to deny themselves more and more.  Because of economic difficulties some of them have to go without the very essential of living.  Any increase that have been given to certain sections of the community <Col N="1882" /> have been swallowed up in the increased cost of living.  Every section of the community is to-day worse off than it was two years ago when the blighting hand of this Government took control again.  Remember, that control was taken not at the behest of the Irish people, not at the will of the Irish people but through the caprice of a few Independents, and it is by that caprice that the Government continues to hold office.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Finance, with his northern sense of humour and his glib, suave tongue, pays lip service to the restoration of economic stability. There is a very simple way of finding out what the reaction of the people is to the economic policy of the present Government.  We had a taste of that reaction in North-West Dublin following on the 1952 Budget.  We could test the reaction now in Wicklow and East Cork.  I am certain that in both places the Government would get the red light.  There is an extraordinary hesitancy about moving the writs.  The Government says this is a good Budget. The supporters of the Government say there is confidence in the Government, but I do not believe the Minister has any illusions on the matter.  He knows this is a bad Budget.  All the woeful prophecies of the Minister for Finance, the Tánaiste and other members of the Government will rapidly be brought to fulfilment unless we have recourse to our masters up and down the country.</P>
    <P>If this Government really believes this is a good Budget there is a very sensible jury to give them a verdict on the matter.  I think the people should be given an opportunity at the earliest possible moment of exercising their judgment.  How could anyone expect the nation to advance when all the Government has succeeded in doing during the past two years is to devise more and more methods of extracting money from the people, raiding the very larders of the people, not satisfied with hitting hard what one might describe as the simple luxuries of tobacco and the pint.</P>
    <P>When the Minister found himself in a tight corner he had to call for the <Col N="1883" /> assistance of the Minister for Local Government, and he decided, with his colleague, to hit the lorry owner, the private car owner, the taxi-owner and, indeed, all sections of the motoring community.  To complete the picture the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs in his pseudo-intellectual way informs us that he intends to extract a further £750,000 from the people.  The Minister says there is no increase in taxation despite the £1,000,000 extracted from the motoring community by the Minister for Local Government and the £750,000 extracted from the public by the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs.</P>
    <P>There are no reliefs.  The Minister says that we will borrow substantial moneys this year.  Far be it from me <Col N="1884" /> to damage by any suggestion of mine any effort the Minister may make to raise a loan, but I want to strike a note of warning.  I would ask the Minister to remember how damaging was the impact of the rate of interest of the last loan, particularly in relation to building.  The Minister must realise the fact that the way to get increased production and to stimulate development is not by making money scarcer and dearer and making credit facilities unobtainable.</P>
