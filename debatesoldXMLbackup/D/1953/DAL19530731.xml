      <NameTxt>An Tánaiste</NameTxt>
      <P>It is proposed to take business in the following order: Nos. 5, 7 (in No. 7 the Supplementary Estimate for Vote 57, Army Pensions) 4, 11, 8 and back to No. 7 for Vote 27 and Supplementary Vote 27.  It is proposed that public business be not interrupted for the taking of Private Deputies' business.  In view of the number of amendments foreshadowed to the Courts of Justice Bill, it is not proposed to proceed with the Committee Stage this session.  It is proposed that the Dáil should adjourn to-day until 20th October.  To ensure that the business ordered will be completed to-day, I propose to move to sit later than 2 p.m.  It is proposed that if Vote 27 is not reached by 4 p.m. it should be taken at 4 p.m.  I move that the Dáil sit later than 2 p.m. to-day and that the motion for the adjournment be taken not later than 12 o'clock midnight.</P>

      <P>The House will remember that during the week it was ordered that certain business would be taken and Deputies have made their arrangements on the understanding that the business which was intimated to us already would be fully discharged before the House rose.  They have made their arrangements on the understanding that the Dáil would meet next week.  The Tánaiste has now intimated that the Courts of Justice Bill will not be completed this session.  I should like to ask whether he has taken into consideration in connection with that the undertakings given by the Government very many months ago with regard to the remuneration of district justices which is involved in this Bill and whether there <Col N="1180" /> is any conceivable reason why Deputies should be misled by the Government into understanding that the House would continue to sit next week and that it would do the business in the way indicated.</P>

      <P>There was a suggestion on the conclusion of the debate on the Second Reading of the Courts of Justice Bill that it might be possible to dispose of the remaining stages of it next week.  We understand, however, that some 50 amendments are being tabled and, in these circumstances, we think it would be wrong to attempt to rush consideration of that Bill in that atmosphere.  In the circumstances, there seems to be no practical alternative, if proper consideration is to be given to the amendments, than the one proposed.  It would be foolish to hope that all the remaining stages of the Bill would be concluded next week.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>I must say I am astounded at the proposals which the Tánaiste has made this morning.  It is clear from what the Tánaiste said that we are to get the option of passing these Bills to-day.</P>

      <P>What Bills?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>The Workmen's Compensation Bill and the Comptroller and Auditor-General's Bill.  Is it suggested that we should take the Committee Stage, the Report Stage and the Final Stage of the Workmen's Compensation Bill to-day?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="An Tánaiste Seán F. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>An Tánaiste</NameTxt>
      <P>Only if the Dáil is willing to facilitate its passage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>The proposition means that this House is given this offer: to pass the Committee Stage, the Report Stage and the Final Stage of the Workmen's Compensation Bill to-day or put it off until the Dáil reassembles in October.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="An Tánaiste Seán F. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>An Tánaiste</NameTxt>
      <P>If the Dáil is desirous to have a protracted discussion on the Committee Stage of the Workmen's Compensation Bill, we think it would be better to withhold that discussion until next session.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>It is cynicism of the worst kind that injured workmen should have to wait for that Bill until then.  The House spent three days on a vote of confidence which, in fact, was never passed by the House, three days on a second Vote on Account, and on the last day on which Parliament sits this Bill, which is of vital importance to the workers, is to be thrown into an October session.  This Dáil, which was elected by the people to do the people's business, is to go on holidays for three months and injured workmen are to be left without the benefits of the legislation contemplated.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="An Tánaiste Seán F. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>An Tánaiste</NameTxt>
      <P>May I interrupt the Deputy?  The suggestion was made through the Whips to the Deputy's Party that the Workmen's Compensation Bill should be passed as it stands as an interim measure and that a Committee of the Dáil should be asked to consider the preparation of a comprehensive Bill dealing with workmen's compensation.  I understand that that suggestion was not accepted by the Deputy's Party.  So far as the Government are concerned, if the Deputy's Party are prepared to consider that course, we are prepared to adopt it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>I think that is nothing but a slick ruse to get this Dáil to adjourn.  Here we have a Workmen's Compensation Bill which has been on the Order Paper for a long time.  We were pressing for that Bill and we were promised it before last Easter. There was a long delay in introducing it and, when it got a First Reading, it was left on the Order Paper for a long time before we saw the Bill.  Now we are asked to pass three stages of it in a matter of a few hours or else leave it over until October.  It is a shabby trick with regard to a Workmen's Compensation Bill.  What you are trying to do is to make a political mangle out of this Assembly, which is a deliberative Assembly, a legislative Assembly.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="An Tánaiste Seán F. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>An Tánaiste</NameTxt>
      <P>That is why we refuse to rush the debate on what are regarded as very fundamental amendments. If the Deputy wants to have proposals for a comprehensive Bill seriously considered he can have that, but we refuse to consider them in a rushed atmosphere.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>The House is being given this test, to pass all these stages to-day in a panic without any examination. We want to put in amendments on the Report Stage as well as on the Committee Stage and we ought to get that opportunity.  Why cannot the House meet on Tuesday or Wednesday next week to deal with this Workmen's Compensation Bill?  In our view, it is much more important than some of the Bills on which we spent so much time. And now we are going to be prevented from meeting next week in order to finish the Workmen's Compensation Bill in an atmosphere that does some credit to Parliament.</P>

    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>I think it is much more important that the House should meet on Tuesday or Wednesday of next week&mdash;on both days if necessary&mdash;to deal with this Workmen's Compensation Bill and any other business that is necessary rather than that the Government should be showing itself off at Ballsbridge.  I do not want the Minister for Finance to be denied the pleasure of preening himself in that <Col N="1183" /> august gathering, but I do suggest that on the difference between whether the Minister for Finance is to go to Ballsbridge to show himself off next week, or that the House should concentrate on finishing the Workmen's Compensation Bill&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>The motion, Sir, is that the Dáil should sit until midnight to-night, and I want to protest against that because I think it is an outrage <Col N="1187" /> on parliamentary government that on the last day on which the Dáil sits we should be asked to pass three stages of a Bill in a matter of such importance while this Dáil at the Government's request proposes to go on holidays for three months.  Why will not the Government permit the House to sit on one or two days next week? We have business to do.  That is what the Government was elected to do. That is what this Government is paid for.  They are going to be paid for the next three months while they are on holidays, and this Parliament is going to be paid.  Why should not this Parliament meet for the purpose of dealing with legislation as essential as I think this is, legislation for the workmen which is vital to most of them because of the inadequate compensation they are receiving under the Workmen's Compensation Act to-day, especially having regard to the increase in prices during the past few years?  I think the Tánaiste in common decency should review the decision that the Government has come to in not permitting the Dáil to discuss this Workmen's Compensation Bill to-day.</P>

      <P>The Deputy knows that it is not a fair offer.  A number of amendments have been put down to this Bill which involve comprehensive changes in the law.  They could not be considered and should not be considered in 24 hours.  It will take some time&mdash;at least a fortnight&mdash;to give them full consideration, if they are to be adopted as necessary amendments in the proper form as drafted by the parliamentary draftsman.  Might I recall that we made a suggestion that this Workmen's Compensation Bill, which is described as an interim Bill, should be passed now and that these more comprehensive and fundamental changes in the law should be considered during the recess by a Dáil Committee with a view to having a comprehensive Bill later?  There is a course which will ensure that the benefits of the existing Bill will be secured to workers as soon as possible and ample time given for consideration of the more fundamental changes in the law which we might think are necessary in that law.</P>

      <NameTxt>Captain Cowan</NameTxt>
      <P>I cannot understand, then, why we should now have a discussion as to the Committee and Report Stages of Bills.  There is no motion that the Dáil adjourn until the autumn in the motion which is at present before the House.  I want, if I can, to approach this problem in a reasonable way.  I think the Tánaiste ought to order, as part of the business, all the Estimates that are on the Order Paper.  The Estimates, in my view, ought to be ordered to-day.  If we sit late to-night, and if there is a bit of reason on the part of the Assembly, I do not see why the Committee and all stages of the Workmen's Compensation <Col N="1193" /> Bill should not be passed&mdash;that is, provided there is a reasonable approach by everybody in regard to it. As Deputy Norton says, that Bill confers certain benefits and it is desirable that these benefits should be in operation right away.  It is the easiest thing in the world to say that the Dáil are going on holidays.  After all, there has to be consideration of the staff of this House and there has to be consideration of a number of other matters in relation to the business of the House. I think that, on the Orders of the day, the Tánaiste ought to order all the Estimates.  If they are not ordered to-day, and if we adjourn either this week or next week, they are going to hang over until the autumn and valuable and important parliamentary time is to be wasted in the autumn.</P>
      <P>I think that if Deputy Norton and Deputy Corish, as one of the Whips, and all the other Whips get together now and approach this matter in a reasonable frame of mind, we will be able to pass the Workmen's Compensation Bill to-day and confer the benefits which we are anxious should be conferred on the married workmen and their children.  On that basis, I think that the Labour Party would agree that the Order fixing the Courts of Justice Bill for next week be discharged and, by agreement of the House, to take that Bill as it stands, with the ministerial amendments, and pass it&mdash;deleting, as the Minister agreed, Section 12.  I think we can do that if a little bit of reason and common sense is applied to this whole matter. What we require is to do the work and not to talk about the work.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to be quite clear on this because I am not clear on it at the moment.  The Parliamentary Secretary to the Taoiseach will agree that at 10.30 or thereabouts last night, just after the adjournment of the House, I asked him what would be the business for to-day.  He gave me the number of items that have been read out.  I asked him if it was proposed to sit late, and he said that he could not at that stage tell me.  However, when we got the Order of Business in the ordinary way in the morning&mdash;which is <Col N="1194" /> sent through the courtesy of the Parliamentary Secretary's office&mdash;we have the same items as those which have been enumerated, but there is no mention at all on it of any motion to sit late.  I am not, even yet, clear as to what the terms of the motion are&mdash;and I want to be clear in that regard. Firstly, I understand that it is suggested that the House sit not later than midnight to-night.  Secondly, I understand that it is suggested that, when the Dáil is rising to-night, a second motion will be moved&mdash;a motion that the House adjourn until the 20th October next.  That much I have followed, but I am not clear as to the Tánaiste's suggestion in relation to 4 o'clock.  Am I correct in thinking that it concerns the Agricultural Estimate&mdash;that at 4 o'clock we will stop whatever we are doing and do the Agricultural Estimate?</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="An Tánaiste Seán F. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>An Tánaiste</NameTxt>
      <P>First of all, I should like to say that no discourtesy was intended. A suggestion was made by the Minister for Social Welfare to the Labour Party in regard to the Workmen's Compensation Bill, and that suggestion was under consideration by the Labour Party last evening.  I understand that they conveyed their view on the matter to the Minister at about 10.30 p.m.  It was not, therefore, possible to determine the procedure for to-day until after that.  The Workmen's Compensation Bill is being ordered for to-day in the hope that the suggestion of the Minister for Social Welfare will be acceptable to the House and that the Bill can be passed. If that does not prove to be so, then it cannot be done.  The purpose is to order that the Estimate for the Department of Agriculture be taken to-day but, in any event, that it will be taken at 4 p.m., and to go on from that.</P>

      <P>The difficulty does not seem to be the actual time <Col N="1195" /> that would be taken in debating any of the stages.  The Minister's difficulty seems to be in relation to an examination of the amendments by his departmental experts.  May I, therefore, suggest that we take the Committee Stage of the Workmen's Compensation Bill to-day and that we meet next Wednesday week to complete the Report and Fifth Stages in one day? That would give the Minister and his experts in the Department time to examine these amendments.</P>

      <P>As I explained to Deputy Corish last night, I could not even consider accepting these amendments&mdash; amendments which, it is admitted, would turn this interim measure into a comprehensive measure.  I am sure every Deputy realises that if the draftsman were asked to draft a comprehensive measure of workmen's compensation he would take at least a few months.  Some of these amendments go to the very root of the matter.  I could not possibly do anything except indicate that I agreed with the principle of one of these amendments.  I may say that that refers to going on a percentage rather than a lump sum.  I am told that the draftsman would require a few weeks before he could say what it would entail or what would be followed by it.  I hoped that the Labour Party would agree to let this Bill through, with amendments in line, as an interim measure.  Otherwise, we shall have to postpone the Bill for several weeks&mdash;the Committee Stage to be taken in two or three weeks' time and the Report Stage after that. The result would be that the Bill would not pass through this House until the end of August.  I do not know whether the Dáil thinks it is worth while to spend the month of August on that simple Bill.</P>

      <P>The Minister appears to be agreeable&mdash;very agreeable.  Let us have a little more reason on both sides of the House.  I do not want to go into the question of delay in regard to the introduction of the Bill: that is past history.  However, when we debated the Second Stage of the Bill this week, the Minister was quite well aware from the tenor of the debate on all sides of the House that it was certain that there would be an amendment bringing in a percentage principle.  It is in the Bill already: all we are trying to do is to remove the ceiling.  Yet, knowing that, he reached agreement with the House to take the Committee Stage to-day.  If we are serious about the Bill, what was the purpose in agreeing to take the Committee Stage to-day, knowing very well that we could not deal with these amendments which, quite properly, would come within the debate?  The Minister says that many of the amendments are fundamental to the Bill.  Most of the amendments have been struck out of order.</P>

      <P>All right.  I suggest that we should all be concerned in the matter as to whether we are going to get this interim measure through as quickly as possible in order to provide increased assistance to injured workmen. There may be a difference of opinion as to whether we should give the increase to single men or not, but <Col N="1197" /> we are entitled to examine that on this Bill and to have a reasonable time to do so.  Even though there may be a feeling that we should have regard for the staff of the House and for members of the Dáil and the Government, we are also entitled to have some regard for the injured workman.  If it means coming back even for another week or fortnight, why should we not do so?</P>

The principle is still in the Bill and I suggest that there is nothing unreasonable in the suggestion that we take the Committee Stage to-day, as the Minister reached agreement on it and as we facilitated him.  It is quite possible that these amendments will not be passed at all, but we are still entitled to look at the Bill as it comes out of Committee on Report Stage.  We should be facilitated and the people who stand to benefit should be facilitated by letting us meet again on one day next week to finish the Bill.</P>

      <P>The Parliamentary Secretary to the Taoiseach will agree that, on several occasions during recent weeks, I have complained that the manner in which the Estimate for the Department of Agriculture was being taken was unsatisfactory.  I know that the reason it was suspended at one time was the unfortunate illness of the Minister.  That could not be avoided, but, since then, it has been used to fill <Col N="1201" /> up tea intervals and so forth.  The motion, as I understand it, is that we should sit late to-night for the purpose, amongst other things, of finishing the main Estimate for the Department of Agriculture and the Supplementary Agriculture Estimate.  If the Government deem it necessary that these two Estimates should be properly disposed of this session, I cannot see why they cannot be taken next week.  I cannot see why, having regard to the manner in which the Agriculture Estimate has been chopped and changed for luncheon and tea intervals over past weeks, having regard to the manner in which it has been allotted bits and pieces of time, it should now suddenly be wound up like this between 4 p.m. and midnight on the last day of the session.</P>

I would be glad if the Minister would give sympathetic consideration to this case.</P>
      <P>Under the Bill, a widow of a captain with one child will not get the same pension as, but less than, the widow of a non-commissioned officer with one child.  I would like to see an amendment brought in by the Minister to rectify that situation, so that widows of commissioned officers and non-commissioned officers, with one child, will receive the same amount of pension. Perhaps the Minister could amend the Bill in that respect.  Then the widow of a captain killed on duty would have at least the same pension rights as the widow of a non-commissioned officer.</P>
      <P>The reason why the widow of a non-commissioned officer gets more is that she is entitled to pension under the Social Welfare Act in respect of the death of her husband, while the widow of a commissioned officer is not.

      <NameTxt>Minister for Defence (Mr. Traynor)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move:&mdash;</P>
      <P>That the Defence Forces (Pensions) (Amendment) Scheme, 1953, prepared by the Minister for Defence, with the consent of the Minister for Finance, under the terms of the Defence Forces (Pensions) Acts, 1932 to 1949, and laid before the House on 28th July, 1953, be confirmed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Defence Forces (Pensions) schemes relate to the retired pay and pensions of members of the Permanent Force, the Chaplaincy Service and the Army Nursing Service, and to the pensions of the widows and children of officers. The main purpose of the present scheme is to increase the retired pay and pensions of members of the Permanent Force retired or discharged after the service pay increases of the 1st September, 1949 and the 15th January, 1951 came into operation.  Officers and soldiers who, before leaving the Permanent Force, were eligible for the increased rates of pay are entitled to have the increases reflected to an appropriate extent in their retired pay and service pensions, and the scheme now before the House provides for that.  There is, of course, a number of other provisions in the scheme.  Some of these arise from the fact that the old system of regimental pay plus allowances such as lodging, fuel and light allowances and ration allowances came to an end as from the 1st April, 1950, and the officers now receive consolidated rates of pay which embody the former allowances.  The provisions <Col N="1209" /> to which I have referred are necessary, therefore, to bring the schemes into line with the new system.  There are certain other provisions which are selfexplanatory or which are sufficiently explained in the memorandum which accompanied the scheme.  I think, therefore, that I may confine my remarks to the increases proposed in retired pay and pensions following the September, 1949 and January, 1951 increases in service pay.</P>
    <P>I shall deal first with Article 4 of the scheme which provides for increases in retired pay granted under Articles 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 9A and 10 of the principal scheme.  Each of these articles of the principal scheme provides for the computation of retired pay by relation to the particular circumstances of an officer's case&mdash;the length of his service, whether he is retiring on age grounds or on medical grounds and so on.  By Article 14 of the amending scheme of 1947, retired pay calculated in accordance with the articles I have mentioned was increased by 30 per cent.  In the present Article 4, new percentages are being prescribed by which the original rates laid down in the principal scheme of 1937 are to be increased as a result of the pay increases of September, 1949, and January, 1951.  Thus, officers eligible for these new increases on the original rates of retired pay will receive them in lieu of the 30 per cent. increase provided for in the 1947 scheme.</P>
    <P>I may mention that married officers will benefit very substantially under this article.  Hitherto, married officers and single officers of the same rank and service received the same rate of retired pay, married officers being eligible, in addition, for a gratuity.  As a result of consolidation, married officers now receive higher rates of pay than single officers and, following upon this position, married officers to whom the present scheme applies will receive higher percentage increases on the original rates of retired pay than will single officers.</P>
    <P>Article 5 provides for increases in the gratuities payable to married officers eligible for retired pay, the <Col N="1210" /> percentage increases on the original rates being the same as those set out in Article 4.  Hitherto, widower officers without children under the prescribed ages were treated in the same way as single officers and did not qualify for married officers' gratuities.  All widower officers to whom the present scheme applies will, however, be treated as married officers for gratuity purposes.</P>
    <P>Article 20 of the principal scheme provided for pensions for the widows and children of deceased officers.  The original pensions for widows, which ranged from £45 a year in the case of the widow of a lieutenant to £100 a year in the case of a widow of a major-general or officer of higher rank, were increased by 50 per cent. in 1949.  The pensions for children&mdash;£15 a year for a child whose mother is alive and £22 a year where the mother is dead&mdash;were not increased, and it is now proposed, by Article 14 of the present scheme, to increase these children's pensions also by 50 per cent.</P>
    <P>The existing rates of pension for soldiers with 21 years' service range from 15/9 a week in the case of privates to 29/9 in the case of a sergeant-major. This pension may be increased by 1/- a week for each year of service exceeding 21 and up to 31.  In the case of married men, an additional pension of 7/- a week is payable.</P>
    <P>Following on the pay increases, it is proposed by Article 17 of this scheme to increase the service pensions, in the case of men discharged on or after the 1st September, 1949, and before the 15th January, 1951, by a flat 1/9 a week and the married pension from 7/- to 7/9 a week.  In the case of soldiers discharged on or after the 15th January, 1951, further increases in the service pension, ranging from 2/- a week in the case of privates to 5/- a week in the case of sergeant-majors are proposed, and the married pension will be further increased from 7/9 a week to 8/9 a week.</P>
    <P>Article 19 provides for increases in the short service gratuities payable to soldiers whose service does not qualify them for pension.  The rates set out in Table I will apply to soldiers discharged on or after the 1st September, <Col N="1211" /> 1949, and before the 15th January, 1951.  Those set out in Table II will apply to soldiers discharged on or after the 15th January, 1951.  For comparison purposes, I may mention that the rates shown in column (3) of Table I exceed the existing rates in each case by 5/- and that those in columns (4) and (5) exceed the existing ones by 10/- in each case.</P>
    <P>I have already referred to the gratuities payable to married officers on retirement in addition to their retired pay.  These are payable on the basis of an appropriate sum for each year of service according to retiring rank, up to a maximum of 20 years, and the appropriate sum at present prescribed for officers of the rank of major-general and upwards is £40 a year.  That amount, is of course, increasable by the percentages set out in Article 5, Article 25 now prescribes specific appropriate sums for lieutenant-generals and generals retiring after this scheme comes into force.  The appropriate sums of £80 and £90 a year take account of the percentage increases to which I referred.</P>
    <P>I think I have now covered all the articles on which it is necessary for me to comment specifically.  I should mention, however, that a further scheme will be necessary to increase retired pay and pensions for members of the permanent force who, before retirement or discharge, were eligible for the pay increases recently introduced with effect from the 1st April, 1953.  I hope to have this scheme ready at the commencement of the next session.</P>
    <P>The production of the scheme was unavoidably delayed owing to the work involved in the production of the Army Pensions Bill, and I am anxious that the former officers and men affected, who have already had to wait a long time for these increases, should not be deprived of them for a further four months while the Dáil might be in recess.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanCollins" hpid="Mr. S. Collins Mr. S. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>We find ourselves of necessity in a difficulty where this pensions scheme is concerned.  Like the Minister, we are more than anxious that any benefits to flow to officers, <Col N="1212" /> some of whom have waited a considerable period for these benefits, should not be delayed.  In so far as this pensions scheme is going to benefit that section of the community, we have no intention of delaying its passage in this House.  But this is the only opportunity we get of making a protest that it is very necessary to make.  The parliamentary device with regard to this Order is that we either pass the Order or refuse to pass it.  In those circumstances, we cannot make any move to improve or amend the scheme.</P>
      <P>Lest misrepresentations might flow from the observations I made in the course of the discussion on the Order of Business here, I want it to be quite clear that at no stage did we in the Fine Gael Party desire that the benefits that are within this scheme should be withheld from the sections that are going to benefit.  However, we take this opportunity of registering a significant protest, first of all, against the complete scheme and the complete basis of the scheme.  I know that the Minister has his difficulties.  I know that it will ultimately be the duty of some Government to face the reality of the problem in connection with Army pensions and that there will have to be a general raising of the level and a change of the whole basis of the calculations that are going to be made for pension purposes.  I do not think that is going to be done now but I think it serves a useful purpose to register the type of protest we must register in this House, first of all against the whole conception of the scheme of pensions. It is archaic and ill-conceived.</P>
      <P>If this scheme is going to confer improved emoluments on the section of people who left the Army since 1951, we say it is more than welcome.  The relief now being given is long overdue, and the Minister does deserve commendation to the extent that he brought this matter into the forum of the House for passing before the long recess takes place, thus enabling people who have entered into commitments on foot of this expectation or who may be anticipating having a holiday on foot of the expectation of these pensions to get the benefit of them during this recess period.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1213" /> There is one unfortunate feature in relation to this whole pensions scheme to which I must specifically advert, that is the number of people who gave their full service to the National Army and who for reasons best known to the then Government were encouraged and virtually induced, having completed their full period of service, to leave the Army.  Maybe it was the picture that was painted of prospects in civilian life that were not ultimately to materialise, but the fact remains that the Minister in answer to a question I asked yesterday indicated that 187 officers and 800 N.C.O.s and men retired having given full service in the Army, and they are excluded from the benefits that flow to other sections of the Army by virtue of the present pensions scheme.</P>
    <P>My feeling is apparent to all in this House where the National Army is concerned.  The time has come to show our pride in our own Army in effective consideration of their emoluments and pensions schemes in this House.  It is for that reason I say to the Minister that it is indeed regrettable that when designing this scheme it was not possible to do something for that section.</P>
    <P>There is another peculiar section of retired personnel in the Army on whose behalf I want to make a plea too.  Even though we find ourselves in the position that we will not be able to amend this scheme, there is another scheme in contemplation and there will ultimately have to be at Government level a full investigation of the general basis of Army pensions schemes.</P>
    <P>In that situation, I would impress on the Minister that he should not forgo from his consideration the very limited band of officers who served for a number of years in the Army, went on the Reserve and then served the whole period of the Emergency in the Army. There are some of these people who are getting on now and for whom some limited provision by way of an amended pensions scheme might properly be forthcoming.</P>
    <P>I want to say that it does not afford me any pleasure to have to make this <Col N="1214" /> type of protest on this scheme because I am conscious that the Minister himself, the present occupant of the office, anyway, has a good deal of sympathy with the point of view expressed by those of us who take a keen personal interest in the armed forces.  I do feel, however, that I would not be serving my function in this House if I did not take this opportunity of registering this type of protest.  We are in the cleft stick situation that the design of the parliamentary method of approval of this Order leaves us in the position that to oppose this Order would deny benefits that will flow from the Order to certain people.  I do not think any of us genuinely in sympathy with the case for improvements in the Army pensions scheme would do that.  I certainly would not, but one is still left in the position that one has to say &ldquo;Tá&rdquo; to this pensions scheme going through, when one knows, in fact, that it is a type of pensions scheme that is creating another source of grievance and complaint.  Therefore, I make my protest, but I make it, as the Minister will appreciate, for the purpose of the records of the discussion and for the purpose of keeping a way open for some future consideration by some future Government of the cases now specifically referred to.</P>
    <P>I want to say in general, not in any sense of acrimony, that the basis for the floor and the ceiling of these pensions is completely wrong.  It is pathetic to think of the differentiation between the pension payable to, we shall say, a retired officer of fairly senior rank while he is alive and the drastic fall that occurs in the pension payable to his widow and young children if he meets with an untimely death. As a matter of interest to Deputies who may not have heard the reply to a question asked by me yesterday, I might repeat the information given to me in respect to the case of a colonel who dies.  Some of these colonels, as Deputies are aware, may have married late in life and they may have young families at present.  We look upon a colonel as one of the king pins of our Army, his earning capacity being somewhere around £1,200 to £1,300 a year, but the pension available for his widow is £135 with £15 for each child.  In the <Col N="1215" /> case I put before the Minister the total payable was £180.  In the case of a lieutenant-colonel the maximum would be £157, in the case of a commandant £142 and in the case of a captain £127.</P>
    <P>I am not adverting to this in any spirit of criticism of the Minister; I am adverting to it rather in the spirit of criticism of the system on which Army pensions are basically designed. Having made that protest even though there are many technicalities and many matters to which one might refer, I think the better way, until we have some other opportunity of discussing the various facets of the pension scheme, is to agree to the scheme going through rather than delay any benefits that may accrue to people who I know are anxiously and eagerly awaiting even the limited benefits that flow from this scheme.  I do not propose to say anything further at this stage.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PeadarCowan" hpid="Captain Cowan Captain Cowan">
      <NameTxt>Captain Cowan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad that the scheme before us makes provision for an increase in the classes covered by this scheme.  I regret that the machinery under which this scheme is brought in gives no opportunity to the Dáil to amend the scheme.  When the Defence Forces Pension Bill was passed, it provided that pensions would be introduced by means of a scheme such as this, that the scheme would be drawn up by the Minister with the approval of the Minister for Finance, and that it became law when it was approved by both Houses of the Oireachtas.  I always feel that that type of legislation is not satisfactory but, however, the fact is that it is in existence, that the Minister is operating it and it is that type of scheme that is before us now.  I regret that the scheme makes no provision for an increase in the pensions of officers who retired prior to 1949.  There are quite a number of what one might call border line cases, a very small class excluded from the provisions of this scheme.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>No Deputy had an opportunity to consider the scheme until it was placed before the House as it is now by the Minister.  It is good, however, to know that the Minister does propose to introduce a further amending <Col N="1216" /> scheme in the autumn.  I hope when he is preparing that amending scheme, he will take into account the representations that will be made to him on behalf of the particular classes who retired from the Army, officers and soldiers, so that some provision may be made in the scheme which he proposes to introduce in the autumn.  I think the Minister was very wise to bring this scheme before the House now and have it approved rather than keep it until the autumn, when the other classes and other personnel that he has in mind will be covered.  I think it is wise to deal with it in this particular fashion because it will give him an opportunity of seeing what can be done to improve the pension provisions for Army personnel who retired prior to 1949.</P>
    <P>I was particularly interested in the section dealing with the Ordnance Survey.  I have been in communication with the Minister and his Department over a number of years in regard to the personnel in the Ordnance Survey section.  I understand it is the Minister's intention to deal with that particular class in the amendment which he will bring in in the autumn.  I understand further that the delay will not, in fact, prejudice this personnel.</P>
    <P>I am glad that the difficulties and the grievances which have existed for a number of years will now be removed and that the principle for which these people contended has been accepted. One can do nothing in a case such as this except welcome the scheme, be glad that the Minister has made provision for increases and express the hope that in the new scheme which he proposes to bring out in the autumn the classes not covered now will be provided for.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LiamCosgrave" hpid="Mr. Cosgrave Mr. Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to endorse all that has been said in relation to this scheme.  It is somewhat unsatisfactory but there are only two ways of dealing with this scheme&mdash;that is, either accepting it or rejecting it&mdash;and the nature of its submission precludes the possibility of proposing an amendment. This scheme was only circulated on Tuesday, with the result that it has not been possible to get particulars <Col N="1217" /> from those concerned as to how they are actually affected.  However, the fact that the Minister has announced that an amending scheme will be introduced in the autumn will enable him, between now and the autumn, to rectify some of the deficiencies in the scheme at present before the House.  I cannot understand how those officers and men who retired prior to 1949 were excluded from the first scheme and have been excluded from this scheme.  Deputies who are familiar with their circumstances recognise that a great number of officers and men had completed full service at that time.  In some cases, they had no option because they had reached the age limit.  In other cases they either had the option of retiring at their existing ranks or accepting a lower rank.  Those officers and men had given the best years of their lives to the service of the country and had formed, in many cases, the nucleus upon which the Army was founded. Most of them, if not all of them, had Old I.R.A. service and were obliged, having reached the age limit, to retire or to accept a reduction in rank.  The Minister's figures yesterday show that there were 187 officers and over 800 men so affected.  In most cases it was not possible for these persons to get civilian employment.  It is difficult at that age to become sufficiently trained to fill any other appointment. While some of them were fortunate enough to be employed in either civilian occupations or in semi-State concerns, the vast majority were obliged to live on whatever pensions they were entitled to.  The result is that those officers and men who had given loyal and faithful service to their country found themselves obliged to exist on a lower rate of pension than officers and men who retired subsequently.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is often argued here that no matter what date one takes difficult cases will arise.  Difficult cases probably confront the makers of any scheme of this kind, but the position in this case is that the officers and men who were in the Army from the beginning and who had completed service not only from 1922 to 1939 but also service during the emergency were <Col N="1218" /> retired, and they have since been obliged to live on a lower rate of pension than those men who retired subsequently. I do not think anyone can seriously suggest that a person who has completed full service and who retires on age limit, or on any other of the statutory grounds, should be asked to accept a lower rate of pension than a person who subsequently serves for a further period and who, because of an alteration in the pensions scheme, is happily in a better position either because he did not reach the age of retirement before the new scheme or an amending scheme came into existence or because he is entitled to serve for a longer period by reason of promotion in rank.</P>
    <P>When the Army was reduced after the emergency a number of officers because of the reduction in strength had to face the alternative of either retiring then or accepting a reduction in rank.  Similarly, in the case of non-commissioned officers or men who had completed their period of service; they either had to enlist for a further protracted period under which they would be outside the age limit or retire under the age limit then in operation. I believe that the fact that almost 1,000 officers and men were so affected &mdash;over 187 officers and over 800 men&mdash; should impress the Minister and the House that it is not merely an accident that these persons were and are obliged to live at a lower rate of pension, and I hope that the serious injustice which has been done to these persons who served their country will be remedied when the amending scheme is introduced in the autumn.</P>
    <P>In connection with this scheme it does appear to me that in the case of officers the two ranks that appear to come out worse are commandant and lieutenant and in the case of non-commissioned officers and men the private who has 21 years' service.  They appear to have got only a small increase. I have here the case of a man who had 21 years' service and who was awarded a pension of £41 1s. 3d. and a married pension of 7/- per week. Under the amending scheme his pension will be increased by £11 17s. a <Col N="1219" /> year to £52 2s. 10d. and the married pension from 7/- to 8/9.</P>
    <P>I do not think anyone can suggest, in view of the substantial rise which there has been in the cost of living, that the increase proposed here is adequate to meet it.  The fact that a man gets an increase of £11 1s. 7d. a year, plus 1/9 of a marriage pension, means that he is getting in or around 6/9 a week.  No one will suggest that is an adequate increase.  I would urge on the Minister that, when he is bringing forward the amending scheme in the autumn, he should take into account the substantial increase which there has been in the cost of living. While this scheme may be accepted as an interim measure, we must all hope that something better may be expected under the amending scheme.</P>
    <P>I should also like to urge on the Minister the desirability of remedying the injustice which affects so many persons who retired prior to 1949.  The bulk of them retired immediately after the emergency in 1946 or early in 1947. Some of them have been fortunate enough to get other employment, but a great number of them, because of the age at which they retired, have not been lucky enough to secure it.  That being the case, the responsibility devolves on this House, on the Government and on the country to see that those who served the country in the Defence Forces, and who gave loyal and in many cases distinguished service should not be obliged to eke out a miserable existence.  That is the position of many of them at the moment, due in many cases to the circumstances in which they retired and because of the fact that it is not possible for them to secure employment.  In that situation, they are obliged to live on their pensions.  I again suggest to the Minister that when the amending scheme is introduced account should be taken of the circumstances in which those personnel were obliged to retire.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. A. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to support the points which have been made by Deputy Cosgrave.  The sums which have been made available for those men are, in my opinion, utterly inadequate. <Col N="1220" /> In view of the fact that we have an overburdened market as far as getting employment is concerned, it will be impossible for any of those men to secure positions in private life.  The pensions which are being paid to them are quite inadequate.  Men who have given such valuable service to the country while serving in the Army should, I suggest, get more generous treatment.  That is necessary because of the high rents they have to pay, and the fact that so many of them are now beyond the age either to train for or take up any other business.  I join with Deputy Cosgrave in urging on the Minister that something better should be done for those men than what is contained in the proposals we have before us now.</P>

    <Speaker pid="OscarTraynor" hpid="Mr. Traynor Mr. Traynor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Traynor</NameTxt>
      <P>I must, at the outset, express my agreement with the remarks which some Deputies have made as to the difficulty they find in attempting to discuss a measure of this kind because, as Deputy Cosgrave has said, the House has either to accept or reject it.  It is, however, an old parliamentary device and not something new which has been recently introduced.  It is a device which appears to have weathered the storms of the years.  It is the method adopted of bringing a measure of this kind into the House and of having a decision registered on it.</P>
      <P>The main objection, as far as I could glean from the discussion, is on the matter of differentiation between various pensions.  Well, little can be done in that respect.  I have explained the situation on quite a number of occasions. There is nothing that I can do, or that the Department can do, to alter the situation in the matter of that differentiation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Pensions, as Deputies will realise, are based on pay.  The amount of the pension is in proportion to the pay which the recipient had before retirement. The persons to whom Deputies have been referring and who retired, say, in 1946, had a lower rate of pay than those who retired in 1949 and 1951.  I should say, however, that the persons who retired before September, 1946, were not completely ignored, <Col N="1221" /> because if Deputies will throw their minds back they will remember that there was an increase&mdash;a 30 per cent. flat rate for officers and varying rates for soldiers so that persons who retired before September, 1946, got the same increase as those who retired after but before September 1949.  Since then there have been two pay increases.  The person who retired before September, 1949, will, however, be on a lower rate of pension than the person who went out afterwards.</P>
    <P>That position will continue until some general action is taken by this or some other Government as regards giving some further increases to all pensioners.  Not only the Army but the Civic Guards, the civil servants and the teachers would be affected by any action that I would take, if it were possible for me to take such action, and naturally, there would be an outcry from these groups against an apparent differentiation between the pensions they were receiving and the pensions that I was enabling the Army to get.  Therefore, until such time as some form of general action may be taken to bring all pensions up, I do not think there is anything that I can do about those who retired before September, 1949.  I do not see how it would be possible for me to do anything in that respect.  I am saying that now because I do not want to make any promise as regards the scheme which will be introduced in the autumn.</P>
    <P>I do not think there is anything else I can say.  I imagine that will be the main theme of the discussion, but I want to make that clear to the House. In regard to the difficulties which Deputies see&mdash;and I know that a number of them are being interviewed on this by ex-Army officers and soldiers who are naturally making an effort to get the benefit of the increases which will arise out of this particular scheme &mdash;there is nothing that either they or I can do to include them in the present increases, which will apply only to personnel who retired after 1st September, 1949.  As I say, the increases are based on pay increases, and it is on that level that we will have to deal with the situation.</P>

      <P>I move that the Bill be now read a Second Time.  This Bill is necessitated by reason of the special and peculiar position which one member of the Civil Service bears in relation to Dáil Éireann.  The Comptroller and Auditor-General, as the House knows, is an officer of Dáil Éireann, appointed by the Dáil, but in order that he may be completely independent in the exercise of his functions of ministerial or other pressure, his salary, unlike that of the ordinary Civil Service, is not carried on the Vote for any Department but is charged to the Central Fund.  On account of that and because any increase in his salary requires legislation, this officer has been placed at a serious disadvantage compared with his colleagues in the Civil Service by reason of the fact that it has not been possible to give him the benefit of the two recent arbitration awards.  Consequently, while all the other members of the Civil Service and while his subordinates in this very important office have had their salaries increased substantially since 1951, he has not been granted any commensurate increase.</P>
      <P>The position, in fact, has now been reached, as Deputies will see from Vote No. 5 of the Estimates, that a subordinate in the office is being paid a higher salary than that which the head of the office himself is entitled to under the existing law.</P>
      <P>If this Bill is accepted by Dáil Éireann and passed, the effect of it will be, as I have said, to give to the Comptroller and Auditor-General the benefits which the rest of the Civil Service have derived as a result of the arbitrations of 1951 and of 1952.</P>

      <P>I, on behalf of the Party, want to oppose this Bill, not with regard to the present occupant of the position but simply because I maintain that the Government's action is inconsistent.  No wonder it is said outside that it is the rich man's friend; the more you have, the more you will receive.  During the week we discussed the question of granting increases of £400 and £500 to persons in high positions who, in my opinion, pending the readjustment of salaries of lower paid men, could very well afford to wait.  I see nothing different in opposing this Bill from opposing the increases for these others.  We must try to satisfy the people outside by removing the impression that we are concerned only with the wealthy people, which is causing discontent.  People will take advantage of the action of this House during the week in all Parties, with the exception of the Labour Party, voting for substantial increases of salaries while forgetting that we are granting only a very small percentage to the weaker sections of the community.  Lower paid persons and men in certain jobs are at present unable to get any increase owing to the depression.  The responsibility rests upon the Government for that action.  They are solely responsible for what is taking place at present.</P>
      <P>The Minister pointed out that the occupant of this position did not receive any increase in 1951.  I do not think he was in that position then.  I think it was in 1951 that he was appointed.  However, I am not concerned with this matter from a personal point of view.  I believe the present occupant is a worthy official. I am sure, as Deputies, we are all very pleased to know that he is independent of the Government and independent of this House.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sorry that Deputy Everett has seen fit to play politics in this matter&mdash;very sorry&mdash;in view of the Deputy's past record as a member of the Coalition Government. The Deputy has alleged that he is going to oppose this because the person who is affected by this Bill is a person who occupies what is one of the key positions in the State from the point of view of protecting the taxpayer and, accordingly, his salary is commensurate with his responsibilities.  The Deputy cannot, like Pontius Pilate, wash his hands of the proceedings of the Coalition Government who, in May, 1951, when they were already trembling on the tight rope, just preparatory to their fall, granted the restoration of the super cut to the higher civil servants under which secretaries of some Departments, without any question of arbitration or anything else, were granted increases of salaries amounting, I think, to about £60 a year.  That was not done by the Fianna Fáil Opposition. That was done by the Government of which Deputy Everett was then a member, in which he was then Minister for Posts and Telegraphs, and we did not hear from the Deputy any protest against that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When the Arbitration Act, 1951, was being considered, the fruits of that arbitration were applied to everybody, even to men who carry higher salaries than the Comptroller and Auditor-General carries and I did not hear the Deputy say that he was opposed to giving general effect to the arbitration award.  When the Government came to consider the question of giving effect to the arbitration award of 1952, the Deputy did not get up to protest and say: &ldquo;You should not apply this principle <Col N="1225" /> to the higher-paid officers in the service.&rdquo;  On the contrary, the Deputy then attacked us because we were not giving the civil servants in general, including the most highly paid civil servants, enough.  He wanted us to distribute another £1,000,000 among the public officers.</P>
    <P>Now a Deputy with a record like that should at least not try to do an injustice, because that is what it would be, to an officer who, as I have said, performs very important functions, whose duty it is to see that the moneys voted by Dáil Éireann for carrying on the public services are expended in accordance with the wishes of Dáil Éireann for the purposes for which they were granted, and who in that way exercises a very important control over the actions of the Executive of the day.</P>
    <P>I think that the Deputy has not enhanced his public reputation by the line which he has taken to-day.  I know that he can go down and try to make some political capital on the platform. But I warn the Deputy that he and the members of the Labour Party who were members of the late Coalition <Col N="1226" /> Government have to carry responsibility for the very substantial increases in remuneration which were granted by that Coalition to the higher civil servants, so that the position is now that the higher civil servants are drawing salaries&mdash;and have security of tenure and pensionable rights&mdash;which are far in excess of the salaries which Ministers enjoy during the period that they hold the confidence of Dáil Éireann.</P>
    <P>I do not wish in saying that to detract from the merits of the highest civil servants.  I think that as they work hard and carry important responsibilities on behalf of the people of this country and help us to carry on the day-to-day administration of this State, their remuneration is not higher than that which they would earn, and readily earn, outside if they were in private employment.  I only wish to stress the inconsistency which exists between the Deputy's past actions, private actions if you like, and his public utterances to-day.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesLarkin1943" hpid="Mr. Larkin Mr. Larkin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Larkin</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 1:&mdash;</P>
      <P>Before Section 3, to insert a new section as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>On and after the appointed day, any policy of insurance held by an employer to indemnify him against his liability under the Act of 1934 as extended by the Act of 1948 shall be extended as to indemnify him against such liability for increased payments by the employer to workmen in his employment until such policy of insurance is varied by agreement between the parties thereto.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The purpose in putting forward this amendment is to deal with the situation which can arise because of the basis on which the workmen's compensation code is operated.  Nominally the statutory liability is laid on the employer but in practice, of course, <Col N="1232" /> the ability of the employer to meet his liability is largely determined by the contractual relationship between himself and his insurance company.  As matters would stand under existing policies it could quite conceivably happen that, although in passing this Act we would make provision for the increase of payments to injured workmen, if there was not the necessary clause in the insurance policies while the legal liability would be placed on the employer he would not be protected by the existing policy in respect of the additional payments.</P>
    <P>This is a matter that probably in the majority of cases might not give rise to any difficulties, but where we would be dealing with a small employer against whom there might be an order made in respect of weekly payments possibly he might be affected, in so far as the composition of these weekly payments for a lump sum is concerned. We might have the difficulty then arising that the individual employer would not be in a position to meet his statutory obligations.  Therefore the amendment proposes that arising out of the changes which may be made by the passing of this Bill until such time as the agreement between employer and insurance company is varied with the increased liability, in so far as the employer is concerned it would be met under the existing contract in respect of his insurance policy.  I think it is a very reasonable amendment, and it is not merely designed to protect injured workmen who are the subject of the Bill, it is also to protect particularly small employers who might find themselves in this difficult position.  In so far as insurance companies are concerned, they will be in a position to subsequently cover any increased commitments that might fall upon them in the very short period that might possibly arise between the coming into operation of the Act and the drafting and the honouring of any new agreement in respect of insurance cover.  The very fact that in the earlier section, Section 2, the Minister is taking power to appoint a day, will give notice to the employers and the insurance companies and will provide them with a reasonable period in which <Col N="1233" /> to face up to this new position, but lest through any inadvertence on the part of the insurance companies or the employers there might be a gap, we do feel that in the interest of the workmen and the employer this amendment is one which should commend itself to the Minister and to the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickODonnell" hpid="Mr. O'Donnell Mr. O'Donnell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donnell</NameTxt>
      <P>I am in full agreement in supporting this amendment.  If my recollection serves me right I think it is embodied in most policies that the company will pay compensation at the legal rate, but there might be a loophole in certain policies where maybe unscrupulous brokers have left themselves in a position in which they may opt out, and I think, as Deputy Larkin says, that the amendment should be put into the Bill and should be accepted by the Minister pending the coming into operation of a new agreement between employer and employee. This is merely a safeguard both to the employer and to the employee, because very often the employer does not read his policy of insurance.  He merely accepts the fact that he is covered, and I think it is an amendment which should be acceptable to the Minister.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not know what the point of view of the Minister is on this amendment, but I think I heard him stating on a previous stage that the companies had given an undertaking that they would not charge any more premium even if they had to give more cover.  I think that Deputy O'Donnell is right in that they do undertake to pay at the legal rate.  In that event, I do not see that this amendment is necessary if the Minister is satisfied that the insurance companies will honour that undertaking.</P>

    <Speaker pid="EamonnRooney" hpid="Mr. Rooney Mr. Rooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Rooney</NameTxt>
      <P>I think this is a most important amendment.  I was surprised that it was necessary for Deputy Larkin to introduce it because it should be a routine matter and it should have been included in the Bill.  The position is that the workmen's compensation policy usually specifies the Acts in respect of which the employer is indemnified. The Employers' Liability Act and the various Workmen's Compensation <Col N="1234" /> Acts are specified.  I should say that it would be necessary for policies to be amended by an endorsement indicating that the employer will be indemnified in the future as a result of the new Workmen's Compensation Act, 1953.  That would not have been mentioned in the policies already issued but it would be specified in the policies to be issued from now on.  In their own interests, the insurance companies do not provide indemnity in respect of liability which has not already been provided for by way of legislation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>There have been many Acts of this kind.  The last one was in 1948.  The Acts all lay down the same principle as we have here, namely, that increased benefits have to be paid to those who are in receipt of payments under the Workmen's Compensation Acts.  They all went through smoothly. There was no complaint.  I do not see why any difficulties should be anticipated now any more than in 1948 or any other time when such a Bill was going through.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Accident Offices Association, which is an organisation which includes most of the insurance companies of this country, have actually given an assurance that the increased amounts will be paid up to the time the insurance will be renewed and then the necessary stipulation will be put into the new policy but, in the meantime, these increased benefits will be paid.  I think that this is the sort of thing that can be done only by agreement.  I do not know much about the law but I should be surprised to learn that we could compel anybody to depart from his contract by our passing a Bill through this House and through this Oireachtas.  I think, in fact, that it would be unfair to do it.  If they enter into a contract to pay a certain premium for a certain benefit, I think it would be unfair that the Dáil could compel them to accept terms which were quite different from what they contracted for.  In the past, they agreed to do it.  This time, they agree to do it.  I think that is the most we can get.  There may be certain insurance offices not included in the Accident Offices Association, as they call it.  If <Col N="1235" /> there are any such offices operating in this country, they have not given us any undertaking to do it.  In the past they did.  I do not think this clause will alter the situation in the least.  I do not know if it would be operative. I have no objection to the clause except that I do not think it would be effective.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickODonnell" hpid="Mr. O'Donnell Mr. O'Donnell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donnell</NameTxt>
      <P>There is a tendency at the moment on the part of non-tariff companies, in particular, to use every possible method they can to evade their liability.  In particular, I refer to motor insurance.  Under the 1933 Act, it is compulsory to insure your car if you put it on the road.  We find now, in a number of cases, endorsement on the policies, excluding passengers.  I am not referring to farepaying passengers.  I know of two cases in Dublin which happened recently.  One was of a young lady who was very seriously injured in a collision between two cars.  The driver of the car in which she was travelling was absolutely to blame.  He was convinced that he was fully insured, but when his policy was examined it was found that he was not entitled to carry passengers.  That is one of the methods now adopted by insurance companies to evade their liability.  It is surprising how unscrupulous insurance companies can become.  I am not referring to tariff companies now. Unfortunately, there is a liking for the cheaper class of policy.  I am afraid we are all attracted towards the cheaper class of policy, but it is the dearer policy in the long run.  I think that this clause would be equally advantageous to both employer and employee and, if the Minister has no <Col N="1236" /> serious objection to the amendment, I think he should accept it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister has indicated that discussions took place between his Department and representatives of the Accident Offices Association. That association covers the great majority of the tariff offices and these discussions have resulted in an undertaking being given by all the tariff offices.  The tariff offices are quite satisfied to meet the additional liability that may devolve upon them and to make adjustments in respect of new policies.  Apparently the non-tariff offices are not prepared to accept this undertaking.  The fact that the tariff offices accepted this as a decent gesture shows that they will accept this obligation, whatever it may be, as set out in the amendment.</P>
      <P>I think, therefore, there is nothing unreasonable in asking the non-tariff offices to accept the obligations imposed on them by this Bill in view of the fact that the tariff offices have already agreed to give the policy-holders the benefits which will flow to them by reason of the agreement to meet whatever additional liability devolves on the company through this Bill.  I think the Minister must agree that to accept this amendment would not impose any hardship on anybody. After all, the tariff offices have agreed. That, therefore, ought to be a pattern worthy of emulation by the non-tariff offices.  If they are not prepared, voluntarily, to do so, I do not think it is unreasonable for the House to say that we are merely asking them to conform in the same way as the tariff offices so far as this piece of legislation is concerned.</P>

As I have already said, the tariff offices have agreed to do it but if other people <Col N="1237" />&mdash;because they want to take advantage of the existing policies&mdash;are not agreeable, then I do not think it is unreasonable for the State to say, in the interests of the policy-holder and the insured worker: &ldquo;You must take this liability and meet your obligations.&rdquo;</P>

      <P>The Minister negotiated with the tariff group.  I should like to say, in fairness to many insurance offices, that it is because of certain circumstances that passenger liability is excluded from policies.  The Road Traffic Act does not require passenger liability to be covered when they are issuing these policies.  In fact, passenger liability is not covered in respect of commercial vehicles except by special extension.  It is covered in respect of private motor vehicles because they are used to carry passengers, and it is done without any extra charge.  In the case of commercial vehicles, it is much better for the passenger liability to be covered by way of extra charge.  In fairness to the tariff offices and to the non-tariff offices who exclude liability cover in respect of passengers, it should be understood that passenger liability restriction is applied only because of certain circumstances such as a novice driver, a dangerous driver, an habitual drunkard, and so forth.  Has the Minister made the inquiry from the non-tariff offices which he has made from the Accident Offices Association, which represents the tariff offices?</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesLarkin1943" hpid="Mr. Larkin Mr. Larkin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Larkin</NameTxt>
      <P>I have not got the same reluctance as Deputy Norton to discuss the affairs of insurance companies in the House, for one very good reason, <Col N="1238" /> that this amendment is put down because we were legally advised in my organisation that it would be desirable to have it.  That happened since the passing of the previous amending Acts and it is possible that the experience in respect of giving effect to this has given rise to the background of this legal advice.  I might put the other point of view, that those of us who have to deal through the trade union organisation with workmen's compensation cases are well aware that immediately a case comes to be dealt with and we contact the legal advisers, almost the first question that arises is the type of company we are going to have to deal with.  Very often, knowing the type of company, we know what are going to be the difficulties.</P>
      <P>With regard to this amendment, I was advised personally to put it down, and the advice was given by members of the legal profession because of a feeling that there was a possibility to be guarded against.  Inasmuch as the Minister has not expressed any great opposition to it, I ask him to accept it.  I can quite understand that he might have some doubts as to the effectiveness of the amendment in its present form, but if we could agree on the desirability of having some clause like this, the Minister could look at the wording and see if it met the purposes of the House because we are all agreed that, if there is this danger, it should be guarded against.</P>
      <P>We have an undertaking so far as the accident offices are concerned, but that undertaking does not and cannot apply to the insurance companies who are not represented by that accident office, and it is quite clear that we have nothing in the way of a cast-iron undertaking which we would readily accept from the offices represented by that collective organisation.  We cannot expect other people to be bound by an undertaking which they have not given.  That is the difficulty we are up against.  There does appear to be some apprehension in the minds of those who have to deal with the matter, and it was from them the suggestion came that we should put down the amendment.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>There is the difficulty that the Accident Offices Association will be agreeable to carry the increased liability, but it will be on the understanding that, when the policies are renewed, there may be an increased premium.  One man may have only a month to run, while another man may have 11 months to run.  The companies will probably take some sort of average and decide on some increase after a period of six months. If the Accident Offices Association are agreeable to do that, you are putting an obligation on them, as well as on the non-tariff companies, by this agreement to carry any policy which is in operation now for the remainder of the period without any increased premium.  The amendment says: &ldquo;... until such policy of insurance is varied by agreement,&rdquo; but the holder may say that he will not agree.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickODonnell" hpid="Mr. O'Donnell Mr. O'Donnell">

      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am arguing on behalf of the insurance companies at the moment.  An insurance company under this amendment would have to carry the increased risk for, say, the following ten months and the insured person could say: &ldquo;You will have to carry it and I will not agree to any change&rdquo;. Is there any way out of that?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>I understood on the previous occasion that, for current policies, the companies decided they would carry the liability and whatever adjustments were made would be made in respect of future policies.  There was no tie-back associated with the then running policy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>They will probably take some sort of average time, because it would be obviously unfair to do otherwise. Suppose they say they must charge an increased premium of a certain percentage.  I have no idea what the percentage may be, but let us say it is 10 per cent. for purposes of illustration. A man whose premium becomes due in a month's time must commence paying the 10 per cent. from that date, while the man whose <Col N="1240" /> premium is not due for another 11 months would not commence paying it until then.  Instead of that, the companies will probably decide to average it and say that, whether the policy expires or not, the increased premium for everybody will start in six months' time, so that the person whose premium did not fall due until some time more than six months ahead would have a certain amount of arrears to pay.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donnell</NameTxt>
      <P>That is what we are trying to ensure, that they must.  Is that not the purpose of the amendment? It is essential that we should have an amendment of this kind.  I can see the Minister's point of view quite clearly, but surely mutual agreement gives the parties the right to adjust.  Suppose the insured says: &ldquo;I will not pay the increased premium&rdquo;. The company, then, unless this amendment is inserted, may have the option of saying that they will not carry the additional risk.  This amendment will ensure that they will carry it.</P>

      <P>The position in this regard is that when the scale of compensation on the last occasion was increased, it became operative as from a certain date.  The insurance offices sent out notices to their policy-holders stating that, as from such a date, the increased benefits would be payable and that, from that date, the premium would be increased by 12½ per cent. In some cases, there were four months and seven months to run, as well as policies which had a month to run, and in that notice the holders were informed that, if they did not notify the insurance company that these terms were unacceptable, it would be taken that it was in order to keep the policy in force.  I think that is the way the insurance companies will deal with it on this occasion also.  It is obvious that the premiums will be increased in <Col N="1241" /> consequence of these increased benefits and that probably a notification will be issued to all policy-holders that they have the option of refusing to pay the increased charge in respect of the remaining period until renewal did and thereafter or accepting the new terms.</P>

      <P>There is a clause which provides for a return of wages and subsequent adjustment of the premium up or down, with retrospective effect, so from that point of view the insurance companies are quite adequately protected, to the extent that they deal with the matter in good faith.  The other point which we should bear in mind, from the point of view of the merits of the principle of the amendment, is that the amendment in the previous amending Act of 1948 and also that made by the Emergency Powers Order was a straightforward increase in the rate of payments.  In the present case, whether we finally dispose of the Bill on the basis of the Minister's amendment or the other amendments on the Order Paper, there would be a fairly radical change in the system of payments.</P>
      <P>The amendment is on the basis of the percentage.  There is some apprehension that there might be reluctance on the part of some insurance companies to cover these increased liabilities, especially where the liabilities are of a new character as is envisaged in the present Bill.  I would again press upon the Minister, since he has no opposition in principle, to accept the amendment.  We will certainly be glad to be guided by him as to the most suitable words which could be considered on Report Stage.</P>

    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 2:&mdash;</P>
      <P>Before Section 3, to insert a new section as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>Where a workman is entitled to a weekly payment by way of compensation under the Acts of 1897 and 1900, the Act of 1906, the Act of 1934 or the Act of 1948, in respect of any week commencing on or after the appointed day, then, notwithstanding any statutory provision to the contrary, he shall, whether the accident giving rise to the compensation happened before, on or after the appointed day, be entitled in respect of that week to 75 per cent. of his pre-accident average weekly earnings.</P>
      <P>The subject matter of this amendment was discussed at considerable length on the Second Reading of the Bill. The purpose of this Bill is to provide for an increase in workmen's compensation for the married man with a wife and one child and the married man with a wife and two children.  If he meets with an accident and suffers total incapacity he will receive a basic payment of 50/- a week, 12/- for his wife, 7/- for each of two children, making a total of 76/-.  That will be paid to him provided it does not exceed 75 per cent. of his average weekly earnings. So far as the single man or single woman is concerned this Bill provides no increase in compensation whatever and as the existing maximum rate of compensation, 50/- per week, was fixed as long ago as 1948 and has not been increased since, we feel very strongly that if you recognise the necessity for an increase so far as the married man is concerned, you must in some respect at least recognise that a rate of compensation which was fixed in 1948 cannot be regarded as an equitable rate in 1953 in view of the fact that the cost of living has increased by 25 per cent. since the 50/- rate was fixed in 1948.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This amendment seeks quite frankly to make a new approach to the whole question of assessing the compensation of injured workmen.  The practice under the 1934 Act and prior to the 1934 Act, continued by the 1943 Emergency <Col N="1243" /> Powers Order and the 1948 amending Act, was to fix a ceiling which was ultimately raised to 50/-  The Acts provided that a person could get compensation, if he met with an accident, to the extent of 75 per cent. of his average weekly earnings subject, however, to a maximum of 50/- per week. Where the injured workman was in receipt of a very low rate of pay he could get 75 per cent. of his earnings as compensation if he met with an accident because he still could operate within this 50/- ceiling.</P>
    <P>Where the injured workman was in receipt of £8 per week, let us say, or received as weekly compensation only 50/- weekly, 75 per cent. of his average weekly earnings would entitle him to £6 per week.  If he had £6 per week he would, if getting 75 per cent. of his earnings, be entitled to compensation at the rate of £4 10s. per week; but because of the ceiling of 50/- he could never get more than 50/-.</P>
    <P>We had this anomaly, therefore, that the Bill declared a man to be entitled to 75 per cent. of his weekly pay&mdash;we feel that was a desirable percentage to pay him&mdash;but then imposed a ceiling of 50/- which, in fact, meant that, while the State pretended to give him an entitlement of 75 per cent. of his pay, by the device of fixing a ceiling of 50/- it prevented him getting the 75 per cent. of his pay, and in many cases he got less than 33? per cent. while ill as the result of an accident.</P>
    <P>This amendment, therefore, seeks to make a new approach to the problem. We think it is not unreasonable, particularly as this matter is on an insurance basis, that an employer should be required to pay 75 per cent. of the wages of the injured workman during his incapacity.  It is a risk which can be foreseen.  It is a risk which can be measured.  I think nobody will attempt to say that in a reasonable and humanitarian approach to the problem of workmen's compensation we are acting extravagantly in giving an injured workman 75 per cent. of his pay during injury.  In fact, a strong case could be made not only on moral and ethical grounds but also on <Col N="1244" /> economic grounds for the payment of full wages to a workman while he is injured.</P>
    <P>This amendment does not make such a radical break with the past.  It seeks to ensure that in the future the injured workman will be able to get 75 per cent. of his wages if he sustains an injury in the course of or arising out of his employment.  The benefits which will flow from the acceptance of this amendment in this Bill will be of considerable advantage not only to married men, their wives and children, but to single men as well.</P>
    <P>In this Bill we are proposing to do nothing whatever to increase the compensation for a single man or woman. I do not know how the Minister can justify introducing an amending Bill of this kind which leaves completely untouched the scale of compensation provided for five years ago when the cost of living was substantially lower than it is to-day.  Since then there have been three rounds of wage increases so far as outside workers are concerned. In 1948 you had the first round.  In 1950-51 you had the second and in 1952-53 you had the third.  On an average, these adjustments of wages meant increases of from 33/- to 40/- per week.</P>
    <P>Although all these things have happened since 1948, we propose to leave untouched the scale of compensation under the Workmen's Compensation Act fixed in 1948 in relation to the cost of living operative at that time.  I think it is not fair to leave the single man or woman in that position nor do I think, viewing the problem from the humanitarian and social point of view, that it is fair for us to continue any longer the ceiling which is imposed on compensation payable under the Act.</P>
    <P>I think, therefore, that without distinction of Party and basing our approach on an examination of the plight of the injured workman, we ought now to recognise that there is no justification whatever for the continuance of the practice of imposing a low ceiling so far as workmen's compensation is concerned.  This amendment, therefore, seeks to establish the principle that, as a matter of legal right, the injured workman will be entitled <Col N="1245" /> to compensation at the rate of not less than 75 per cent. of his average pre-accident earnings.  I think the amendment is a reasonable one and it is offered to the House on its own merits. I think it should be accepted without any reference to the different political distinctions in the House.</P>

I have a lot of sympathy with it, but find it difficult to give it my wholehearted support.  In the past, workmen were very much victimised by the Legislature.

      <P>I am glad to know that.  This amendment refers to permanent incapacity.  If the pre-accident earnings were £6 a week he was living at a certain social standard, which will deteriorate very much if we put him on the 50/- basis.  It would not deteriorate to the same extent if he received <Col N="1246" /> compensation at the rate of 75 per cent. of his average weekly earnings&mdash;but I wonder what would be the impact on the premiums?

    <Speaker pid="JamesLarkin1943" hpid="Mr. Larkin Mr. Larkin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Larkin</NameTxt>
      <P>It is very easy to be led into the belief that this amendment would be more appropriate to a Bill which would completely recast, on a comprehensive basis, the workmen's compensation code.  That might be the most ready argument one could make against the amendment.  Right through the Workmen's Compensation Acts there has been this reference to the percentage of earnings.  We know the background that existed in the earlier years of the century to the conception of employer's liability in respect of accidents sustained by his workmen and also the general social concept in sustaining the members of the community who through natural illness or accident were not able to fend for themselves.  That led to the imposition of the ceiling, so as to limit the effect of the percentage calculation for compensation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1247" /> Even in that respect, the rate of compensation was varied.  In the case of earnings below £1, the ceiling was 80 per cent.; where they were over £1, the ceiling was reduced to 75 per cent.  The setting down of the ceiling applying to the percentage calculation showed very clearly in the code the general social concept towards the claims of sick or injured workmen on the community as a whole.  The immediate background to that approach was the earlier concept that an employer had no obligation to his workmen except where actual negligence had been proved.  When the original ceiling was proposed at 35/&mdash;it was reduced to 30/- in the 1934 Act&mdash;it reflected the social outlook at the time and the approach of the Legislature to it.  That background has now altered. In the Second Reading debate on the present Bill, there was general acceptance that there is greater responsibility on the employer now for injured workmen than would have been accepted 30 years ago.  It was unanimously agreed that the effect on insurance companies should be excluded from the argument altogether.  In proposing the amendment and basing the weekly payments on the 75 per cent., we are merely translating into legal form the general conception that would be held by all sides in the House.</P>
    <P>The Minister might still argue that that matter should be left over for discussion on a more comprehensive Bill. In the Second Reading debate we have referred to the change in money values.  It has been indicated that in 1934 a payment of 30/- represented a certain standard and to sustain that standard in present-day money values a certain figure, roughly 69/-, should replace that 30/-.</P>
    <P>There is the other aspect, too.  In the period 1934 to 1938 we had certain wage levels operating.  For the general unskilled workers in the larger towns and cities the average wage in good employment was 50/- to 60/- per week.</P>
    <P>Therefore when an injured workman came to depend upon the maximum weekly payment which he could <Col N="1248" /> receive under the Act, 30/- at that time, if he was in receipt of a wage of 50/- the weekly payment represented 60 per cent. of his wages.  If we go to the other end of the wage scale so far as labour is concerned, say, 60/- or 65/-, they were still receiving not less than half of their normal wages.  In the case of skilled workmen whose wages ran to £4 or £4 10s. per week they also received in or about half of their normal wages.</P>
    <P>The position is altered to-day.  The old rates of 50/- to 60/- are now running from about 90/-, taking the lowest scale for road workers and farm labourers; but in the better paid employments a rate of 140/- is paid. Therefore, if we relate the present ceiling to this figure we find there has been a marked drop.  In the case of the better paid labourer, on the basis of the figure of 50/&mdash;I am excluding the question of supplemental payments as suggested for the wife and children&mdash; he would be receiving something in the neighbourhood of 35 per cent.  As regards the skilled workman whose wages were £4 5s. before the war and who is now in receipt of about 168/-, if he meets with an accident now and has to depend upon the present ceiling of 50/- as a single man, we will in fact be asking him to maintain himself on a payment representing less than 30 per cent. of his normal wages.</P>
    <P>These are aspects of the matter that require consideration irrespective of any change in our basic approach.  In so far as the case of the lower paid workman is concerned the difference between adopting the principle of the 75 per cent. without any ceiling and pursuing the matter on the basis of the amendment set down by the Minister, is very small.  We are left largely with the question as to the justification for employing the 75 per cent. calculation without a ceiling in respect of workmen who enjoy high rates of wages, better paid labourers and the craftsmen.</P>
    <P>Quite clearly it is difficult to argue that where the workman does meet with an accident there can be found any justification for expecting him in that period of sickness&mdash;because sickness in itself, as we all know, always imposes certain additional burdens&mdash;<Col N="1249" /> to sustain himself on less than one-third of what he normally receives.  It is from that point of view that the strongest argument lies to remove the ceiling and allow the Act to operate on the basis of the percentage that has been in the Act over many years.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesLarkin1943" hpid="Mr. Larkin Mr. Larkin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Larkin</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes.  One other aspect I would mention is that at the moment social service payments in respect of sickness in the case of a single man provide him with a sum of 24/- per week.  In many employments to-day, provision is already made in the form of sick pay schemes whereby there is anything from half to full wages paid in the form of sick pay with a deduction in respect of social service payments. The average would be probably around 60 per cent. to 70 per cent. of normal wages.  We now find ourselves in the difficulty that workmen who meet with accidents are very reluctant now to come and claim under the Act because of the penalty placed upon them of having to depend on the 50/- ceiling under the Act as against the much higher payments they receive if they merely report sick in the ordinary way.  We should have regard to that aspect of the matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Recently I personally had the experience of dealing with such a case and of trying to advise a workman who had met with a fairly minor accident and who possibly would recover in the course of a few weeks.  He was going to suffer the loss of 26/- per week depending on whether he would claim compensation or merely report sick.  It was very hard to convince him that he should bear in mind that, once he gave up his claim, if he suffered any permanent ill-effects from the accident he had forfeited his legal rights.  It is particularly difficult in the case of the working man who suffers a minor injury to get him to appreciate that there is no guarantee that the minor <Col N="1250" /> injury might not have very long term effects.</P>
    <P>From the point of view of the House we are not merely concerned with providing reasonable compensation for the workman.  It is also important that we do it in such a way that the workman will desire to take it and not feel that he would be better off if he forgoes his claim under the Act and tries to meet his expenses in regard to sickness arising out of an accident by claiming as an ordinary employee of a company where there are sick pay schemes.</P>
    <P>This has become a very difficult problem particularly in the larger employments where there are fair conditions and where the rightful claims of workmen against employers in a period of sickness, are being met within reason.  We have now got this conflict as between our conception of what a workman should receive when he meets with an accident and what a private employer concedes so far as ordinary sickness is concerned.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PeadarCowan" hpid="Captain Cowan Captain Cowan">
      <NameTxt>Captain Cowan</NameTxt>
      <P>I think it will be agreed by everybody that what has been said here by Deputy Norton and Deputy Larkin would be the approach of every Deputy in the House and of every well-meaning individual in the country.  There are, however, some difficulties which I think it is just as well that we should realise.  As I read this amendment it provides that where the accident occurred before or after the appointed day the person would be entitled to have his compensation fixed at 75 per cent. of his pre-accident average weekly earnings.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Here is the difficulty I see in this regard.  We know about insurance companies but the law of this country does not recognise them.  Every case of workmen's compensation is between the particular workman and the particular employer.  Everybody knows that in the majority of cases there is an insurance company at the back of the employer but in law it is two individuals, two citizens.  Where under the legislation an employer who is an ordinary citizen is obliged to pay a sum of, say, 50/- a week to a workman no law we can pass in this House can oblige <Col N="1251" /> that employer to pay 60/-.  If it was passed into law in this House it would be considered by the Supreme Court to be unconstitutional and an interference with the rights of an individual. I think Deputy Norton and Deputy Larkin will agree.</P>

No law passed by this Dáil can oblige that individual to pay 60/-, 66/- or 70/- a week.

      <P>The law may provide for it but the matter may not have been tested.  It is a very serious position, I think, that where your law says an employer must pay 30/- a week compensation, you come along later with a sub-section saying that he must pay 50/- a week.

Payments are inadequate at present but if we are going to increase them we shall have to increase them by means of a State fund that would subsidise these payments.  If I am an employer who employed one workman 20 years ago and that workman was injured and I was bound by law to pay him 20/- a week, any law that would be passed now to make me pay that man 60/- a week would, in my view, be an unconstitutional interference with my position.</P>

      <NameTxt>Captain Cowan</NameTxt>
      <P>I think we should face that situation but we shall have to face it in this way.  I thoroughly agree with the case Deputy Larkin and Deputy Norton made but if we are going to provide increases for people who have had already their compensation fixed by law, we shall have to do it by means of a State fund or some other fund that the Minister will have to establish.  That is one of the difficulties as I see it.  So far as future payments are concerned for accidents that occur after the <Col N="1253" /> appointed day, I think it is reasonable that the workmen concerned should be paid 75 per cent. of their earnings. That is right but all these things drive one to the conclusion that, before a satisfactory solution can be arrived at, there will have to be some form of compulsory insurance or there will have to be a State scheme&mdash;one or the other.  We have got to face that fact.</P>
      <P>I should like the House seriously to consider the implications that can arise for a small trader away in the country who is obliged by law to pay 30/- a week to a former workman and who is paying it.  Is it just that we should come along now and say to that trader: &ldquo;You must pay double the amount?&rdquo;  I do not think any Deputy would say it is.  I do not say that the injured man should not get an increase but if he gets an increase we, as the Dáil, should take the responsibility to provide for this increase out of some fund.</P>
      <P>I think Deputy Norton will appreciate that point because he has given a considerable amount of consideration to these problems.  I should hate to see going out of this Dáil a Bill providing benefits for workmen which the courts might hold was not constitutional or within the powers of the House in regard to some particular section.  I think that would create a state of chaos that would be undesirable and wrong.  That is the trouble with the amendment because the amendment provides for two things, one for injuries that occurred prior to the appointed day and the other for injuries that occur subsequent to the appointed day.  I should like to hear the Minister's views on this matter. I am perfectly certain that the Minister must have been advised on this aspect and I should like to know what he has to say in regard to it.  So far as I am concerned, I am doubtful about our power to do it, although I am anxious we should do it.</P>

      <P>Take the case of a man who was injured two years ago and who is still drawing 50/- per week compensation. During those two years, there has been a considerable increase in wages.  Am I to understand from <Col N="1254" /> Deputy Cowan that we are not entitled, notwithstanding the fact that wages have gone up by, say, £1 per week since, to legislate to increase the amount of compensation payable to that man from 50/- to £3?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. A. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>Cases in point will occur to most of us where an injured workman has been continuously in receipt of 50/- per week for some years past.  I thought that by some form of legislation we might be able to provide for an increase in his compensation. It appears now that, although the payment is entirely inadequate, having regard to the manner in which the cost of living has increased, we cannot provide for any increase at all. The cost of living has gone up, some people say, by 30, 40 or 50 per cent. since the rate of compensation was fixed, with the result that these people are suffering very considerable hardship.</P>
      <P>One does not like to mention names in this House but I am practically certain that every Deputy has been approached or has had some complaint made to him about particular cases from time to time.  I happen to know the case of a man&mdash;I think he was a carpenter&mdash;who has a couple of children and I understand that for the last two years he has been in receipt of 50/- a week compensation.  Now we are told that he cannot get 6d. extra even if we agree to increase the compensation under this Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>

      <NameTxt>Mr. A. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister help us to do something to provide for such cases even if, as Deputy Cowan says, it involved a subsidy from some State funds?  We are now told that the very large number of people in Dublin City who are trying to exist on inadequate payments of 50/- a week cannot get as much as 6d. of an <Col N="1255" /> increase to meet the cost of living, no matter what we do in this Bill.  I think the Minister would get the wholehearted support of every Deputy in the House for any proposal that would give an immediate increase in compensation to the victims of accidents who are admittedly being paid inadequate amounts at the moment.  It is all very fine to ask the Minister to be sympathetic but Deputy Cowan has made the point that in law we cannot compel employers to pay these increased amounts.  The Minister might be able to subsidise them out of some other funds.  We could all mention half a dozen cases of people with inadequate pay who will not get any other form of assistance other than unemployment assistance.  I heard of a case where an individual received £150 by way of compensation for injuries received in an accident and no national health benefits were paid to the individual until the £150 had been exhausted.  I do not know whether I am right or wrong in that.</P>

    <Speaker pid="EamonnRooney" hpid="Mr. Rooney Mr. Rooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Rooney</NameTxt>
      <P>With relation to the proposed retrospective effect of this amendment, I think we should look at this matter from the point of view that under the existing law if a man has a contract of employment with an employee he is liable under existing legislation for the payment of compensation to that employee should an accident happen.  If we increase the compensation paid weekly at this stage any such increase should be paid out of general taxation rather than by any other method.  If an accident happened some years back and the employer was liable, then he has been paying compensation <Col N="1256" /> for some considerable time at so much per week.  The liability was quite clear under the existing legislation at the time.  It would be very unfair now to come along and say to that employer that he must pay increased benefits, or even possibly less than he has been paying up to the present.  Indeed, it would be even more unfair to reduce it because the workman had a contract and certain legislation applied.  Therefore, it would be unfair to either increase or reduce the scale of benefits payable at the time of the accident unless that increase is met by way of general taxation and not out of the pocket of the employer.</P>
      <P>We must disregard the fact that many employers are insured, but until about ten years ago the vast majority had not taken out an insurance policy for their workmen.  That is particularly true of the employer who employs one man or casual labour.  Retrospective effect in relation to this amendment would be very unfair.  I think it would be unconstitutional and any individual who might find himself affected would have a right of appeal against it because he would find imposed upon him a liability that did not exist under the legislation then extant at the time the accident happened when there was a definite contract between him and his employee.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickODonnell" hpid="Mr. O'Donnell Mr. O'Donnell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donnell</NameTxt>
      <P>There are two fundamental principles involved in this amendment.  The first is the putting of married and single men on a par and the second is the wiping out of a ceiling other than 75 per cent. of the pre-accident earnings.  I think it is really a minor matter as to whether the compensation should be in respect of accidents which occurred prior to this Bill becoming law.  I think that is a minor issue.  The principal issue is the putting of married and single men on a par and, secondly, the fixing of a ceiling.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have a very open mind in this matter and I think there is a considerable amount to be said for the amendment in so far as it puts married and single men and married and single women on a par.  Section 3, as it stands, is a bar against an <Col N="1257" /> injured man ever entering into the contract of matrimony.  An injured man, no matter what his pre-accident earnings may be, is merely entitled to 75 per cent. and, if he marries after the accident and if he has a family of ten children, as the section stands, he can obtain no increase in his 50/- compensation. In other words, there is no inducement to a young man in receipt of compensation to marry.  That is the fault I find with Section 3 as it stands.</P>
    <P>Secondly, take the case of a married man, permanently disabled, with a family.  No provision is made under Section 3 for compensation in respect of any child born later than nine months after the date of the accident. Should there be ten more children, that man will receive no further compensation in respect of any of those ten children.  I think that is a very bad principle.  As I said on the Second Reading, it does nothing to encourage families.  There is no doubt about that.  I strongly recommend the section in so far as it puts married and single men on a par because that will be an encouragement to single men, who are injured, to marry and have families.  From that point of view there is a considerable amount to be said for the amendment.</P>
    <P>With regard to the ceiling, I would certainly favour 75 per cent. of the pre-accident earnings, subject to a ceiling, and I think that ceiling should be fixed irrespective of whether the applicant is married or not.  I think the Labour Party tabled a motion here to increase compensation to £4 10s. a week.  If there could be agreement on a ceiling such as that, then there is a lot to be said for the amendment.  As to the point raised by Deputy Cowan as to whether it is constitutional to legislate for pre-Bill accidents, I think we did that under the 1948 Act.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">

      <P>The point was raised by Deputy Hickey and Deputy A. Byrne that this Bill purports to give increased benefits to married men who are drawing benefit at the moment; that is, it will deal with cases where the accident occurred before the appointed day.</P>
      <P>As I say, the Bill purports to do that, but whether there is anything in the point raised by Deputy Cowan I do not know, although I think there is a lot in it, and that it would be considered very unfair, especially in the case of a man in poor circumstances, that he should be compelled to increase benefit to a person who was already drawing benefit.  If a case like that went to the court, I do not know what might happen. The same type of amendment was brought in several times before and no case ever went to the court.  All we can hope for is that no case will go to court and that the man will be paid. There is a new principle suggested now and it is that the State should pay the difference.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not know.  This is a constitutional question and I do not know whether Deputy Cowan is right or not.  It was never tested.  Deputy Hickey raised a point about a person who, let us say, eight or ten years ago got compensation on his pre-accident wage.  The Deputy's point was that if that man were working now he would be getting a higher wage and maybe better compensation.  Well, if wages go up the court has power to take that into account and make an adjustment on that plea.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy O'Donnell is against the differentiation between single and married men.  When we passed the Social Welfare Act we extended that principle. Previous to the passing of that Act, those who were drawing national benefit got no allowance whatever for a wife or children, but the principle was extended under that Act. Although the principle was there for unemployed, the position was improved for a man with dependents.  I <Col N="1259" /> do not think anyone raised an objection to that in the discussions on the Social Welfare Act.  I think everyone was agreeable to the principle of giving more to the man with dependents than to the man without dependents. I was rather surprised to find Deputy O'Donnell saying that he was against that principle.  There is, of course, as Deputy O'Donnell says, in this Bill a bar, if you like, put on the man, who marries after an accident, getting benefit for his wife and for his children. This is an interim measure and it was impossible to do anything else. I think we can allow the provision that is there to remain.  I am not defending it or saying that it should be there for all time.  When we are dealing with the comprehensive measure we can decide whether we should, or should not, carry on that bar against a person who marries getting benefit for his wife and the children that may be born afterwards.</P>
    <P>As far as the principle of this amendment is concerned, I would not be against it, perhaps, if I were asked to consider it in detail.  I might perhaps offer certain qualifications. Deputy O'Donnell says that there should be some ceiling.  I think myself there should be.  Take, for example, the case of a manual worker who might be earning £20 a week.  He is working for a small employer as a plasterer, or in some other capacity, and meets with an accident.  I am sure no Deputy would seriously suggest that this small employer should have to pay him £14 or £15 a week for the rest of his life.  The employer could not possibly do it.  If we had to consider the 75 per cent. we would have to consider a ceiling, and that would not be departing from the principle already there. It is, however, a new principle to have this 75 per cent. without any ceiling.  I am not against the principle of 75 per cent., as such, but as I say there are arguments against an unqualified 75 per cent.</P>
    <P>Let us take some salary that we can all agree on, say £1,000.  Nobody has suggested that a man with that salary should come into the Workmen's Compensation Act.  The reason is that such a man should be able to provide <Col N="1260" /> for himself.  He can do that either through savings, insurance or by some other method.  If we go down the line a bit and take the man with a salary of £800, he, too, should be able to provide for himself.  The Labour Party say no&mdash;that he should come in.  Well, that is not a serious point and is one that could be considered.  We could go down the line still further.  There should be some grading.  What I mean is that the obligation on a person to provide for himself should be on a graded scale.  Take the man with £500 a year.  If this Bill goes through, he is going to get, in present circumstances, 50/- a week, for his wife another 12/- and for children two more 7/-.  Deputies may say that is not enough.  Well, he can supplement it by paying a small premium to an insurance company.</P>
    <P>Judging by some insurance policies that I have seen, and the premiums that are charged by companies to employers, he should be able to supplement these payments by paying a premium of £5 or £6 a year.  Are we going to follow the principle that we should legislate for those who cannot possibly provide for themselves, and to the extent to which they cannot do so, and for those who can provide partially for themselves?  I think the latter should be encouraged to do that. As regards those who can fully provide for themselves, I think we should leave them alone.</P>
    <P>I think there are arguments which could be put up to say that this unqualified 75 per cent. is not necessary, or, in fact, not advisable.  As I have said, as long as we have present conditions, it might ruin a small employer to the extent that he could never pay it.  In fact it could not be done unless we had a nationalised scheme or a compulsory insurance scheme.  That brings me to the point, which I argued earlier, that a big principle like this should be left aside for the comprehensive Bill.  There is no reason why we should not wait until we get it.</P>
    <P>If we are going to set up a Dáil Committee or commission to prepare a comprehensive Bill we might leave this question over until we get that Bill.  To do so is not going to make any great difference.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1261" /> I presume, in fact, I think I could say, that if I were to go to the draftsman and say I want a clause like the one contained in this comprehensive amendment in the Bill he would certainly take a fair length of time to draft it and, if I asked him why he would take so long, I am sure his answer would be that he would have to examine all the Acts that were passed and see to what extent they would have to be amended in order to bring this in and it might mean several clauses before the final draft would reach here.</P>
    <P>So, for the mere mechanical reason of drafting, I would say that the amendment could not be accepted and if Deputies say to me: &ldquo;If you agree with it in principle and let us withdraw it and have a draft submitted here to a meeting of the Dáil&rdquo;, I am afraid I would have to say, in that case, that the Report Stage of this Bill would probably have to be put back for at least two or three weeks before it could be dealt with.</P>
    <P>I am not inclined to agree to that because I think a big principle like this is certainly a matter for the comprehensive legislation.  It is a matter not alone of drafting, not alone of cost, but of a great deal of consideration from every point of view and, if we are going to set up a committee to consider a comprehensive Bill, surely this is one of the biggest questions that could be put to them.  If we set up a committee, I take it the very first question they will consider is: are we going to nationalise workmen's compensation, bring it into the social welfare code or are we going to carry on on the same system as we have at the moment?  Suppose they decide that it will be nationalised, then I think that any committee would be inclined to keep the same pattern as we have for the social welfare legislation, that is, a stated amount per week for the person concerned, for his dependents, if you like, or not for his dependents, as the case may be.  But, as I said, in our social welfare we have followed that pattern of so much for the person concerned and so much for dependents and outside this country the nearest example we have is the British scheme <Col N="1262" /> which is nationalised.  They have so much for the working man, so much for his dependents and it is a set amount.  It does not matter what the man is earning, it is a set amount. They, I suppose for good reasons, have adopted that system.  There may have been arguments against it.  The arguments against it may appeal more to us here.  I do not know.  There must be good arguments for it or they would not adopt it.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>My answer to that, then, is, if there is a good case&mdash;Deputies can make a good case, I suppose, that the man who has a higher wage finds it harder to go to 50/- from £10 than the man who goes from £5&mdash;the same argument applies to sickness benefit and to unemployment.  How can we make a different argument?  If you are going to do that, the next thing you will have to do is to reconsider the whole social welfare scheme and say that if a man gets sick who is earning £10 a week and has a family on a certain standard, it is not fair to say to him: &ldquo;You must live on 50/-&rdquo;.  We must give him more.  What different argument could be used for the man who meets with an industrial accident, or the man who gets sick working in the industry?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As I said before, it is all a question of need.  The man who gets sick has the same need as the man who meets with an accident and the man who becomes unemployed, of course, has the same need.  I cannot see the case for <Col N="1263" /> differentiation but, if Deputies argue that the same should be done all round, then at least it would be logical but it would be an extremely hard thing to do.</P>
    <P>The drafting, of course, would be a very big matter, but it is not an insurmountable difficulty.  If I were very much in favour of this scheme and of doing it immediately I quite admit we could get over the drafting difficulty by saying: &ldquo;Give me a week or two and I will get this done&rdquo;.  I think it is really a matter for a comprehensive scheme.  Deputies have not expressed their opinions very decisively on whether or not we should set up a committee to consider that scheme.  I am quite prepared to set up a committee if it is considered a good thing to do.</P>
    <P>Of course, there is the increased cost which always has to be taken into account, naturally.  The increased cost of living will, I suppose, make it more difficult for even the man with the higher wage to meet his ordinary needs and it might be argued that the man with the higher wage, if he is a little bit better off, by leaving the cost of living as it is, is able to insure himself against these unforeseen accidents.</P>
    <P>There are many arguments that can be put for and against, so many arguments that it is a thing that could not be accepted on the Committee Stage of a small Bill of this kind and certainly should be put back for a comprehensive measure.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>One or two points have been raised in the course of this discussion that should be cleared up. Deputy Cowan took the line that this Bill might be declared to be unconstitutional if we impose on an employer a responsibility for paying a higher rate of benefit than that for which he was liable before this Bill became law. I have pointed out already&mdash;I certainly pointed out during the course of his speech by way of interjection&mdash;that in 1943, by an Emergency Powers Order, we directed an employer to accept liability for paying to an injured workman the sum of 37/6 per week although under the existing legislation his <Col N="1264" /> liability was 30/- per week.  So that, in 1943, with our eyes wide open, we said: &ldquo;Although your contractual obligation is to meet liability not exceeding 30/- per week, by this Order and because of the increased cost of living, you must pay 37/6.&rdquo;  That continued from 1943 to 1948.  In the 1948 Act we provided that, notwithstanding the terms of the policy or the terms of the legislation up to then existing, in the middle of the policy and during the currency of the policy, the employer was liable to lift that ceiling from 37/6 to 50/- per week.  So that, since 1943, on two occasions, we have in fact put on the employer an obligation to pay a higher rate of benefit than that for which he was contractually liable and, even in this Bill, the Minister has admitted that an injured workman, if he is married, who is now receiving compensation at a maximum rate of 50/- per week, awarded in respect of an accident prior to the introduction of this Bill, will have that compensation increased to a maximum of 76/- a week.  So that, under this very Bill, the Minister tells us that a person who sustained an accident prior to the introduction of the Bill and who was awarded compensation before this Bill was printed, will have that compensation jerked up to a maximum of 76/- a week even though the employer's contractual liability to the workman is assessed at a maximum of 50/- a week.</P>
      <P>What is the position?  So far as Deputy Cowan's fears are concerned, the Minister has said that this Bill will in fact create a situation in which the injured workman, the person who sustained that accident prior to the Bill, will have his compensation increased and the obligation to increase it will be imposed on the employer of the injured workman.  So that, so far as Deputy Cowan's fears in that respect are concerned, I do not think there is any justification for them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickODonnell" hpid="Mr. O'Donnell Mr. O'Donnell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donnell</NameTxt>
      <P>That evidently wipes them out.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>We have two well beaten tracks trod in 1943 and again in 1948 and now an assurance from the Minister that the same practice will be followed so far as this Bill is <Col N="1265" /> concerned.  Quite clearly any injured workman with a wife and two children who met with an accident in July, 1952, and who has been getting 50/- per week, when this Bill passes and the appointed date operates, will be entitled to compensation at the rate of 76/-.  Therefore I think these contentions effectually dispose of Deputy Cowan's fear.</P>
      <P>The Minister spent quite a while in trying to create bogey men so far as the amendment was concerned and trying to play on our legislative fears by telling us of the difficulties which will arise.  I cannot see these difficulties from the point of view of operating a 75 per cent. arrangement so far as the workman is concerned.  After the passing of this Bill, an injured workman with a wife and two children who had a wage of £5 per week and who is now receiving compensation at the rate of 50/- per week will automatically get 75 per cent. of his pre-accident earnings. But if his wages amounted to more than £5, whether they were £6, £7 or £8, he will be denied the 75 per cent. compensation which he would get if he had £5 per week.</P>
      <P>If we can operate the 75 per cent. arrangement so far as a man with a wife and two children and a wage of £5 is concerned, where is the difficulty in applying that to a man in receipt of £6, £7 or £8 per week?  There is no difficulty whatever.  The effect of the Minister's amendment, in fact, is to apply, so far as the mechanics of payment are concerned, the 75 per cent. scheme to those in receipt of a wage not exceeding £5 per week, provided they have a wife and two children.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister talked about a plasterer earning £20 per week when working for a small employer.  The small employer who can employ a plasterer at £20 ought to be brought into this House so that we might have a look at the exhibit.  What a plasterer with £20 a week would be doing with a small employer without the other trappings and fittings of the building industry, I do not know.  It is a long time since I saw a small employer employing a £20 a week carpenter, and I bet that phenomenon has not been <Col N="1266" /> with us for a very long time.  I bet that very few Deputies, even those in the building trade, have been privileged to see a £20 a week carpenter employed by a small employer.  You may take it, in any case, that a builder employing a £20 per week carpenter has a pretty decent profit on that £20 per week carpenter, judging by the prices going for houses when carpenters could get £20 per week.</P>
    <P>There is one point on which the Minister has been singularly silent.  We have been asked not to try to amend the Bill radically, to be satisfied with it as just an interim measure to keep things going for 12 months when we will get a comprehensive Bill.  Frankly, I do not believe we will get a comprehensive Bill in 12 months.  I would wager that we will not see it in 12 months.  In the meantime, what is to happen to the single man and the single woman?  We gave them the maximum rate of benefit of 50/- in 1948.  Five years have gone by and the cost of living has increased by 25 per cent. in that period.  Are we not going to do anything for them in this Bill?  The Minister has not indicated what he proposes to do, whether he has any sympathy with the proposition to increase the 50/-.</P>
    <P>So far as he is concerned, they get the maximum rate of compensation of 50/- fixed five years ago.  Although the cost of living has increased by 25 per cent. since then, he does not propose to give them one penny per week additional compensation.  How can the Minister justify that?  The suggestion is that, whatever their prospects may be in the future, they have to wait for a comprehensive Bill.  If the Minister maintains this differentiation between single and married persons so far as industrial acidents are concerned, I imagine the outlook for a single man who meets with an accident in the future will be even more grim than it is to-day.</P>
    <P>I want to know what is the Government's answer to this.  A man who had £4 a week in 1948 was, under the 1948 Act, given compensation at the rate of 50/- per week when he met with an accident.  If we take it that a wage of £4 per week in 1948 has gone up by <Col N="1267" /> approximately £2&mdash;it may not be that, but let us take that for the purpose of easy calculation&mdash;then to-day we are still giving him the 50/- which he got as compensation when his wages were £4.  If we thought 50/- was reasonable compensation for him when his wage was £4 surely he ought to get more compensation when his wage is £6.  I do not think anyone will attempt to question the ethics or the economics of that contention.  If his wages have gone up by one-third, surely the compensation ought to go up, too.  The Minister is not providing for any increase, nor has he indicated in his reply that he is any way sympathetically disposed towards increasing the weekly compensation in respect of the person who was given the maximum compensation of 50/- in 1948 and is still in receipt of that maximum sum.  Does the Minister intend to say anything on that aspect of the matter?</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesLarkin1943" hpid="Mr. Larkin Mr. Larkin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Larkin</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister has raised a number of general matters upon which we should touch.  Should we not try to get rid of the trappings and face up to what is actually involved in respect of the acceptance or rejection of the amendment?  So far as the real issue is concerned, it is purely a question of whether or not we think it right and proper to give an injured workman a maximum payment based on 75 per cent. of his wages, irrespective of what the amount is.  That is really what it boils down to.  In reply to the argument, the Minister has stressed very strongly that so far he has not been given any argument to show what difference there should be in our approach to the payment to a person who becomes sick in the ordinary way as against our approach to the payment of compensation to an injured worker.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think there is a fundamental difference.  We are dealing here with two separate types of incapacity.  In the case of the injured workman we are dealing with a man employed by another person and he is not employed for any love, but because the employer can get some money out of him in one way or another.  We know that.  We <Col N="1268" /> know there are exceptions where a man is given a job in circumstances of charity and so on, but that is not our workaday work, and we have only got to look at the Minister's labour exchanges to find that if there is not money to be made out of the employment of a person, that person is not employed.  That is the first case. Secondly, when we deal with ordinary sickness there are a number of other factors involved.  A man can become ill, not merely through providence, or lack of providence, but also through his own neglect or indulgence or carelessness. But in respect of men meeting with accidents through their employment there can be the factor of carelessness, but it is very unlikely that a man is going to put his foot under a machine or his hand under a knife or deliberately step off a scaffold, merely to collect a few shillings.  In that regard, so far as he is engaged in another person's employment, and is required to work on the premises on occasions and in conditions determined by his employer, he is not a free agent so far as protecting himself against accidents is concerned.</P>
    <P>Take the docker working aboard a ship.  He cannot walk around the ship or the quayside or examine all the gear to ensure before he starts working that there are not going to be any accidents &mdash;and I am not even thinking of any accident arising from neglect on the part of the employer&mdash;and he is required to work in the place, and underconditions that can only be determined by the employer.</P>
    <P>He is going to be employed because the employer hopes to make something out of the employment of that worker. That puts the matter in an entirely different situation as compared with the ordinary citizen who, like any other member of the community, is subject to the ills of the flesh and the hardships of Providence and, considering the economic standards in our community, the level generally of our standard of life, he is not, as an individual, able to make proper provision for the time when he meets with these natural difficulties.</P>
    <P>The Minister himself, in putting through the Social Welfare Act, puts <Col N="1269" /> that principle before the House and gets acceptance of that principle&mdash;that the community should assist the individual to meet those natural hazards. When we come to deal with the question as to why there should be a difference in the rate of payment of a man who is sick under the Social Welfare Act and the man who meets with an accident, it is not really social principles that are involved in assisting the man who is sick and unemployed. Quite rightly&mdash;and every party has to face this problem&mdash;there is also the question of taxing the community to provide certain benefits, and that has to be measured.  But in the case of the injured worker, he has been engaged at a rate of wages by his employer.  He is employed to earn that rate of wages because of his physical and mental health, and when he meets with an accident in his employment as a private individual, it is his earning capacity that is immediately affected and it is from the point of view of restoring to him some level of standard of life which accrued to him because of his earning capacity that we provide workmen's compensation.  The query there is not as between the man who meets with an accident and the man who is sick but between the man and his claim on the man who employs him when he meets with the accident.</P>
    <P>We are not introducing any new principles in the amendment.  On the basis of the Act as it stands at present the first approach is that where a man meets with an accident and we have to determine his weekly pay, we do it on the basis of 75 per cent.  We accept that.  That is the relation established. We then desire to consider the question of cost and we consider, as I pointed out earlier with regard to the background around earlier approaches in the early years of the century to this question of compensation, that the whole social outlook of the community has changed and we step in and find that having decided in principle that a man is entitled to 75 per cent. of his average earnings we are now going to slice that across the top and say no matter what the 75 per cent. is going to provide you are not going to get more than a certain sum.  We fix that, <Col N="1270" /> and we do not fix it in relation to the capacity of an insurance company, or an employer to pay, but purely on an arbitrary line.  That line that we have drawn has passed away so far as the general social outlook in the country is concerned.  Quite clearly if to-morrow morning the Minister felt that the general economic condition of the State, of national finances, were such as, say, to permit him to increase the payments from 24/- to £2&mdash;and in the case of a married man with a wife and two children from 50/- to £3 10s.&mdash;I have no doubt that the Minister would do so because he recognises himself that to ask a family to maintain themselves in sickness on 50/- a week or a single man to maintain himself on 24/- is not meeting our outlook on these matters.  But, quite properly from his point of view&mdash;we may have differences as to what the present economic position can afford&mdash;but we recognise that is one of the limiting factors, and quite clearly, to-morrow morning if the Minister found he had greater liberty, I am sure he would be one of the first to adjust those figures.</P>
    <P>When we come to the other sphere, the sphere of workman's compensation, we have not got that limiting factor where it is a question of determining a figure that is equitable in relation between a man's pre-accident earnings and what he should receive in his incapacity.  Why should we apply principles in this limited field which are only properly applied in the field of social welfare?  I said earlier that the Minister would be entitled to do that if we were dealing with a comprehensive State insurance scheme because the community would then be taking over the whole liability but we are not entitled to do it where we are proceeding on the old code and merely providing for a private individual that there should be reasonable provision in compensation in any particular case.</P>
    <P>The Minister also made a point in regard to a kind of an exaggerated figure he mentioned of a man earning £20 a week and leaving a continued liability on a small employer to pay him £10, £12 or £14 a week.  There is the other point that the whole basis of our compensation code even though <Col N="1271" /> Captain Cowan says we are dealing, so far as the law is concerned, as between citizen and citizen, that the whole background is the acceptance of the fact that these liabilities are met by the employers through insurance. Every member of the House will have very little sympathy with the employer who deliberately neglects to insure himself against that kind of liability and who when an accident is met with by one of his workmen finds himself in the position of not being able to meet his statutory obligations under the Act.</P>
    <P>That is not the type of case with which we have sympathy.  We know that the small employer possibly through ignorance might make that mistake, but where it is done deliberately then we would agree that that man should be pressed to the full limit to meet his obligations.  So when we talk about placing a burden on the small employer of having to pay £6, £8 or £10 a week we are not placing it on the small employer in that form. The only obligation we are placing on him is that he will have to take out a suitable policy of insurance and having done that if he has then got to compensate his workman it will be his insurance company that will bear the burden, and quite properly, whether it be to continue payment of weekly sums at the rate of 75 per cent. of the wages over a period or whether it is to make a composition and settle by a lump sum.  That is a matter that the insurance company could provide for both in the drawing up of their policy and their calculation of agreements. The Minister would be quite logical to stress that we should have some regard to the effect upon the premium that might be imposed upon employers by adopting this amendment, but on the previous occasions when we increased the weekly payments I do not recall that we paid very much attention to the resulting effect upon the premiums.  All we were concerned with, I think, was to ensure that having decided on the increased weekly payments they would be paid out by the insurance companies and that suitable arrangements would be <Col N="1272" /> made as between insurance companies and employers.</P>
    <P>Even if we deal with the question of possible increases, again I do not think we are placing any great burden on any employer, because if you take the average rates of premiums charged for various categories of workers in respect of the Minister's provision in the Bill that would provide the same sum so far as the lower paid worker is concerned the calculation of 75 per cent. proposed in the amendment will not require any greater payment of premiums than will be required by the Minister's proposals.  I take it that the Minister is, in the main, concerned with the smaller employer, let us say, farmers, and in their cases, if the Minister's proposals are adopted it will cost the farmer exactly as much, I am sure, to secure insurance cover as it will in regard to the amendment.  The only type of employers who might be more radically affected by the amendment than by the Minister's proposals are large employers and large companies and, again, if you check up on the cost of employers' liability and workmen's compensation insurance in large-scale employment you will find that that particular item is not among the heavier items that go into working costs.  Even if it does impose, not a heavy burden but a somewhat increased burden, as compared with what they have to bear now, is there any reason why they should not have to meet it?  We are not dealing with individual workers but with families dependent on those workers.  Those of us who have to meet those men as I do know the position.  I met one the other day, a man who stopped me and asked: &ldquo;How long am I to try to keep my family on 50/- a week?&rdquo;&mdash;and we know there are cases of men getting payments of 30/-, 37/6 and 50/- for a long period of years.  I have known a man getting 30/- a week for nine years. During those nine years he had to rear his family from the point where the eldest was somewhere about six or seven years of age, and during that whole agony of nine years he was trying to exist on 30/- a week.</P>
    <P>Then when the insurance company in <Col N="1273" /> their graciousness finally decided to settle the case by payment of a lump sum that man got the lump sum, but by the time he had paid his debts he was completely without a penny in his pocket.  That is the human side of it. As I say we are not dealing here with the employer.  We are dealing with the commercial insurance companies, and the actual additional charge we might impose on the individual employer by the adoption of the amendment would be no greater in the case of a large number of small employers in the country, especially the farming community, than will arise in respect of the Minister's proposals.  It is only a question, therefore, of whether we are prepared to measure our concern and regard for the injured workman as against the position of the large employer, the large company and individual.  I think that the Minister should take the same view as we do, and I would press him to take another view on this amendment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ColmGallagher" hpid="Mr. Gallagher Mr. Gallagher">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gallagher</NameTxt>
      <P>The more one listens to the debate on this amendment the more one gets convinced that there is a very urgent need for a comprehensive Act.  I think that would be agreed.  I think that the Minister should, if at all possible, try to meet the Labour Party on the question of placing the single man on a par with the married man, because, as Deputy Larkin pointed out, in most cases he is, I take it like myself, dealing with his experience in Dublin and elsewhere that these insurance companies who have, in the long run, to pay the compensation, when they are fixing their premium, fix it on the amount of the wages that are paid.  They do not ask whether a man is married or single. They take it on the question of risk. I would like to see compensation related to a man's earnings, but that is a very big question, as the Minister said, and I agree that it is one that should be dealt with under a comprehensive Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>What I would like to see, if it were possible, to get over this is that the Minister would meet the Labour Party on the question of placing the single man on a par with the married man and that the Labour Party on the <Col N="1274" /> other hand might agree to leave over this question of the ceiling until a comprehensive Bill was brought before the House.  I think that could be done, as was suggested by some Deputy, by setting up a commission or committee of some sort to go into this whole question of bringing in a comprehensive Bill.  If that were possible the Minister might meet the Labour Party on this single man-married man question and they, in turn, should leave this question of the ceiling over until this commission or committee meets and brings in this comprehensive Bill. I would say that that should be done right away and that the Bill should be brought in as soon as possible because, as we were told, although Deputy Byrne was not aware of it apparently, this Bill will give benefits to a man who has a wife and two children.  If he is being paid 50/- in July he will now get 76/- when this Bill is passed.  I think we all want that to happen right away and any hold up, to my mind, would be a bad move. Therefore, I think we should try to give these benefits to the injured workmen. Like Deputy Byrne I know many a man who would be looking forward to getting these increases.  I think this is a step in the right direction in giving those increases.  I am altogether with the Labour Party in this question that compensation should be related to a man's earnings, but I feel that it is a very big problem and one that we could not do in a very short time. I would appeal to the Labour Party to give my suggestion some consideration because it is a thing that I feel keenly about and that I would like to see debated at some length in this House with a view to giving an injured workman much higher compensation than he is getting at the moment and to bring it into relation with his earnings. I think that that would be something worth while.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesHickey" hpid="Mr. Hickey Mr. Hickey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hickey</NameTxt>
      <P>I think that the Minister might bear in mind, too, that there is no differentiation between a single man and a married man in the premium.  There are men drawing 50/- a week who will draw it for goodness knows how long if we do not put them on a par with the married men.  There <Col N="1275" /> are a number of employers paying 50/- and they do not mind how long it will continue because it is so little concern to them provided they do not have to pay a lump sum.  I would appeal to the Minister to look on this in the spirit in which we are asking him to look on it.</P>

If I bring in a Bill here giving more to the man with dependents it is just brushed aside and we have nothing but the single man, the single man, the single man.  If I brought in a Bill leaving aside dependents, and I said 65/-, I would have Deputy Hickey, Deputy Larkin and Deputy Norton asking me to tell them how a married man with a wife and two children could live on that amount. The married man and the wife and children would be dished up to us all the time.  Can we not be reasonable instead of taking up all the time talking about the single man?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not the specialist in imagination that the Minister is. The Minister is indebted to his imagination on many occasions for his facts and his knowledge of things here.  The Minister gets hot and bothered because we talk about the position of the single man under this legislation. In 1897&mdash;56 years ago&mdash;this legislation was first introduced in the British House of Commons and, since then, the basis has been that an injured workman got compensation irrespective of whether he was single or married.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>Under our own legislation, that has run for 31 years.  For 31 years under an Irish Parliament a single man and a married man got the same.  That has been the basis of compensation if they met with an accident in the course of their employment. Then, suddenly, after 31 years, the Minister decides to make a change and puts the compensation on a basis which relates to whether a person is single or married.  Then the Minister wonders why there should be any comment, even from his own Party.  The change which the Minister is making is not one which operates fairly in the case of a single man.  We were quite satisfied to leave this whole question on the basis that a workman got a percentage of his income without regard to whether he was married or single.  I think, in all the circumstances, that is a good scheme from the point of view of regulating the relations between the workman and his employer.  It is not a State scheme. What we are doing here is that we are coming in and putting our fingers on the scales in favour of the employer and against the workman.  The Minister spoke as if these burdens were going to be borne by the Exchequer.</P>
      <P>The Minister is fixing a ceiling in this Bill and saying to the most rapacious employer in this country: &ldquo;No matter what your profits, dividends or the rates of pay which you give your workers may be, I will impose, in your interest, a ceiling in respect of workmen's compensation and I will not allow you, so far as the law is concerned, to pay more than that if you do not want to.&rdquo;  Is it any wonder that even Deputy Gallagher should get annoyed with the Minister's proposals or that they should not be received with enthusiasm?  The Minister is putting his thumb on the scales against the injured workman, and he knows it no matter what he may say.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As Deputy Larkin pointed out, a workman who was earning £5 a week and who has a wife and two children will get 75 per cent. of his salary under this Bill.  That represents the generality of workers in the rural areas.  Over and above that, there is the case of the employer in the large <Col N="1277" /> cities and towns who employs his workers at high rates of wages. Generally, they are employers in industries that are well capitalised and they are employers that are not found in the bankruptcy courts.  They usually manage to pay good dividends and to enjoy a good standard of living. They are the people the Minister is fighting for when he fights this amendment because the workers employed by that type of employer are the only people who will not get 75 per cent. of their wages under this Bill if they are married and have a wife and two children.  Take, for instance, the farmer who employs a man who has a wife and two children and pays him £5 a week.  If that man is injured during the course of his employment he will get 75 per cent. of his salary under this Bill.  Take, by way of contrast, a workman employed in Dublin by a wealthy firm.  Suppose he is a craftsman.  If he is earning more than £5 a week and if he is injured during the course of his employment he will be denied 75 per cent. of his wages.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesHickey" hpid="Mr. Hickey Mr. Hickey">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>That is the position of anybody getting over £5 a week.  If he is a married man with a wife and two children he will be denied 75 per cent. of his salary.  That is the class of employer who can well afford to pay the 75 per cent. and yet that is the class of employer whom the Minister is protecting in his opposition to this amendment.  An ordinary farmer will pay the 75 per cent. but the Minister will not allow the big joint stock company owner in Dublin, Cork, Limerick or elsewhere to pay the 75 per cent. by removing the ceiling&mdash;the 50/- or 76/-, as the case may be&mdash;under the Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think we ought to think twice about departing from the pattern which we have followed in respect of worker's compensation in the past.  I know that the British have done it but that is no reason why we should do it.  Many continental countries did not follow the British pattern in this respect.  In these countries, the scale and the basis of compensation is far better than ours or Britain's.  I hope we will think again before we jump willy nilly to follow the <Col N="1278" /> British plan of national insurance so far as our people are concerned. A clear and obvious basis was here for us&mdash;75 per cent. of the man's earnings and take out the ceiling.  There is no ceiling for the small farmer and there is no ceiling for the small employer in the country.  The ceiling has gone for them so far as married men are concerned under this Bill.  We are only keeping a ceiling now for a man who is in a position to employ better paid workers.  We protect him while the lid is off for the small farmer in respect of the 75 per cent. compensation.  Somebody on the Government Benches ought to tell us why that is so.  If a farmer in County Kildare or in any other part of Ireland employs a man with a wife and two children, and if that man subsequently meets with an accident in the course of his employment, the farmer has to pay 75 per cent. of the man's earnings.  On the other hand, the big industrialist in Dublin City or elsewhere is not compelled to pay the same proportion. Why should the Minister come in here and put his finger on the scales to prevent the big industrialists in Dublin, Limerick, Cork; Waterford or elsewhere&mdash;some of them foreigners&mdash;from paying the same percentage of wages under this Bill as, say, the Kildare farmer?  We ought to be told why the Minister is interfering in this way against the possibility of an injured workman in the city getting the same proportion of his wages as his agricultural colleague.  Why should we leave the rate of compensation at 50/-  per week for a single man or a single woman?  We thought that was good enough in 1948 when the wages were £4 a week.  Why not increase that sum now, seeing that prices have gone up and that there have been three rounds of wage increases since the 50/- was fixed in 1948?  The Minister is acting most unreasonably in this matter.</P>

      <P>And Deputy Norton has got up three times to speak about something he would not do when he was Minister.  He talks about me protecting the big joint stock companies and the rapacious employer on the very same principle that Deputy Norton maintained when he was Minister. Since he lost his job as Minister, the Deputy has become a real Labour man.  He is out for real Labour principles and we cannot keep up with him at all, since he went back into opposition.  Not satisfied with that, he attacks me for not doing the things he was afraid to do or would not do when he was a Minister.  If members of the other Parties were anxious to do something for the injured man and not so anxious to make propaganda like Deputy Norton, about the rapacious employers, the joint stock company, my protection of them and so on, we might make more progress.  I think Deputy Norton should have a little more regard for the injured man and not so much regard for his own reputation and for proposals which he thinks may go out to the country.  That is all he is concerned about, so far as I can see.</P>
      <P>Could we not take a reasonable view and agree that this is a very big principle?  Deputy Norton has said that I am departing from a principle which has been there for 55 years by giving something to dependents.  This is a bigger principle still which has been there for 55 years.  Could we not put it aside for consideration by some sort of expert committee and get on with giving something at the moment to the injured man with a wife and children?</P>

      <P>What was good enough 56 years ago is good enough for Deputy Norton to-day, if I am to believe what he said a moment ago. I cannot understand the attitude of the Labour Party, especially Deputy Larkin, on this Bill, when we remember what Deputy Larkin said on 9th December, 1948.  At column 1236 of the Dáil Debates of that date, he said:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;It is quite clear, and it can be argued, that there are many defects in the system and that this Bill could be utilised as an opportunity to deal with them, but there are so many defects to be dealt with that I feel it would be a physical impossibility to deal with them in the form of an amending Bill, no matter how voluminous that Bill might be.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>Think of his attitude to-day towards this amending Bill.  Later, at column 1240, he said:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;If the Minister is going to consider some of the amendments that it is suggested will be brought in on the Committee Stage, I feel that he is going to create a problem for himself.  If he undertakes to consider favourably some of these amendments, I fail to see how it will be possible to ensure that the immediate purpose of the Bill, namely, to increase the benefit, is not defeated.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>Further on, at column 1242, he said:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;These are all major questions that will need to be dealt with later. At the moment it is urgent that an injured workman should receive some improvement in the existing miserable amount.  That is so urgent that I suggest to those Deputies who have already spoken urging an amplification of this measure that we should concentrate on the single objective of the Bill and at a later stage try and deal with the bigger problems that are involved in the question of compensation.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1281" /> Further on, Deputy Larkin said:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;I hope the Minister will find it possible to get this Bill through the House rapidly and so make the appointed day as early as possible, thereby making the benefits under it available to those concerned at the earliest possible moment.  I hope that he will soon be able to bring before the House a Bill formulated on a completely new approach to this problem.&rdquo;</P>

      <P>From then until June of 1951, Deputy Larkin was quite content to sit down and let the workers carry on on what was brought in for them, an increase of 12/6 which they got in 1948.  He never put down a motion to increase workmen's compensation during all that time.  Neither did his Minister for Social Welfare make any attempt during that period to bring in any increase.  I would ask the Labour people to remember that the workers of the country are not as stupid as some of them would imagine. They can see through all these things; they can see through what happened to-day, when the Labour Party objected to an increase for the Comptroller and Auditor General, when they realise that, when there were two Labour Ministers in the Cabinet, it was decided to give Mr. Browne of the E.S.B. £1,000 a year increase.</P>

      <P>I say to the Labour people that it is a good thing for a working man with a wife and two children to get this increase.  A sum of 26/- per week may not be much to some of the Deputies on the Labour Benches, but from my knowledge of the workers, the dock workers in Cork and elsewhere, 26/- per week will be some little help to them.  I agree that 50/- per week is not proper compensation, but I ask Deputy Larkin to approach this in the same spirit as that in which he approached it when there was a Labour Minister in charge.  He was asking everybody to be satisfied at that time, but apparently, now that he is in opposition, it is not good enough at all that we should wait, though the Minister and the Tánaiste promised that a new Bill would be brought in.</P>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. O'Higgins Mr. O'Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>I rise to protest against the manner in which Deputy McGrath stated his opposition to this amendment.  We find in this House in recent months the suggestion constantly being made from Government Benches that half a loaf is better than no bread and that if we were to press an amendment from this side of the House we would be threatened with no loaf at all.  I think it is appalling for any Deputy to approach a matter of this kind in that manner.  There is nothing to prevent the House sitting at length to consider this amendment. Why should it be suggested that if this amendment is pressed, as I am sure it will be, the rights of injured workmen to get compensation will be in danger?  That is an argument which I conceive to be illogical and unreasonable.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is a great deal to be said for the amendment proposed by Deputy Norton and if it is to be argued against it should be argued against on its <Col N="1284" /> merits and not in the way in which Deputy McGrath proposes, that any further discussion on this Bill will prevent it from becoming law.  I think that Section 3 of the Bill, which is affected, falls far short of the compensation that injured workmen should get now.  We should not forget that when social legislation such as the Social Welfare Act and other Acts of that kind is introduced here and becomes law it begins to get out of date and with rapidly rising costs, such as the people have experienced in recent years, we cannot be complacent about the limit of social reliefs given by our legislation.  I should like to hear this amendment discussed from that point of view and not from the point of view of putting a pistol to the heads of Deputies and telling them if they do not withdraw the amendment injured workmen will get nothing.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesEverett" hpid="Mr. Everett Mr. Everett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Everett</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to ask the Parliamentary Secretary his opinion in regard to one point involving the single man.  Deputy McGrath is in favour of married men having a greater allowance than the 50/-.  A case came to my notice, through the trade union movement, of a tradesman who worked for a foreign company.  The standstill Order was in operation at the time. The tradesman met with an accident and his allowance was only 50/- per week.  He married after the accident although he was permanently incapacitated. Under this Bill he will not receive one penny of an increase.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. O'Higgins Mr. O'Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>Not one penny.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesEverett" hpid="Mr. Everett Mr. Everett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Everett</NameTxt>
      <P>Should not that man's case be considered?  I can give the Minister the name of the person involved and the name of the foreign company by which he was employed. That man had not the £14 or £20 a week the Minister stated, owing to the standstill Order.  He was a tradesman who married 12 months after being permanently incapacitated.  He is still married and his wife is alive.  Yet he is only in receipt of 50/- a week.  There is no hope that he will receive any increase under this Bill.  I would ask the Parliamentary Secretary to consider that and we can put an amendment down on the Report Stage.</P>

      <P>I am not making any point that we should not accept the Bill.  I want the present Bill through in a hurry.  I made that point on Second Reading.  A number of questions were raised.  I hope the Minister will bring in a comprehensive Bill soon but we should concentrate on this Bill because of the urgent necessity to give increases to people in need.</P>
      <P>Deputy McGrath referred to 1948. In 1948 we gave, with the support of the House, an increase of one-third on the payment then being made to every one, married and single, who had met with an accident and who was in receipt of this weekly compensation. Although the cost of living has gone up some 25 per cent. since that last increase, we are only going to give a 50 per cent. increase to a married man with a wife and children.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGrath" hpid="Mr. McGrath Mr. McGrath">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGrath</NameTxt>
      <P>Fifty per cent.?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesLarkin1943" hpid="Mr. Larkin Mr. Larkin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Larkin</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy McGrath and myself will agree that a man with a wife and two children requires a 50 per cent. increase on the 50/-.  He will also agree that it is necessary to give single men something on the 50/that we originally gave them in 1948 and in respect of which the cost of living has gone up at least 20 per cent. In addition to that, there are many single people who have got dependents and who have a greater responsibility than married people.  We are not making any allowance for those.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>So far as any efforts by the Labour Party to amend the present Bill are <Col N="1286" /> concerned, if Deputy McGrath reads the amendments he will find that there is only a total of nine amendments put down.  Of that, a number did not raise issues which would normally have to be considered under a comprehensive measure.  They were confined to difficulties which have made themselves apparent in regard to the legal procedure under the present Bill, difficulties which everyone was anxious to amend.  Some of these amendments were ruled out of order.  We are left with five out of the original nine amendments.  Of those five the only one on which there is any sharp division of opinion is the one we are discussing. All that amendment suggests is that the principle embodied in the Workmen's Compensation Acts over the last 50 years be accepted, namely, to relate the determination of compensation to a percentage of the wage without putting a ceiling on it.</P>
    <P>We want to get the same results as Deputy McGrath.  We want to get a reasonable amount of weekly compensation for those who need it.  Would the Minister indicate even now that he would endeavour, not only in response to the appeal of the Labour Party but to that made by Deputies McGrath and Gallagher, to do something for the single man and woman?  If that is done, perhaps, we can get away from this point.  Instead, however, of doing that, the Minister, as happens to Deputy McGrath sometimes, got a little bit irritated and we do not seem to have made any progress.  If Deputy McGrath were to speak to the Minister outside we might make a little progress.</P>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. O'Higgins Mr. O'Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>On behalf of Deputy Declan Costello I move amendment No. 3:&mdash;</P>
      <P>In sub-section (1), paragraph (a), page 2, lines 32 and 33, to delete &ldquo;who was married to him at the time of the accident&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>The purpose of this amendment is to deal with the type of case mentioned by Deputy Everett a few moments ago. It is to provide that the wife in respect of whom an allowance is to be paid will be the workman's wife no matter when he was married.  As the section stands at the moment it does appear to me that it is full of defects.  A number of questions arise in it which are the subject of other amendments but certainly this question does arise that as it is proposed under the section to compensate workmen, only a workman married at the time of the accident will receive any compensation. If at that time he is a single man and he subsequently decides to marry neither in respect of his wife nor any children will he receive any increase or allowance.  I do not think that is correct or fair.  Even though the Minister may be insistent that the single man shall not get any increase, at least he should concede that where a single workman marries he should be entitled to the same allowance in respect of his wife as if he had been married before the accident. That is the purpose of this amendment. It seeks to bring single men subsequently marrying into the same category as a married man at the time of the accident.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Might I also mention to the House and to the Minister that the section as it stands in relation to payment to the wife also has a defect in the case of a workman married at the time of the accident&mdash;possibly a young married man with a small family&mdash;who is injured and whose wife subsequently dies; if he remarries, apparently under the section as the new wife would not be the wife married to him at the time <Col N="1292" /> of the accident no payment can be made to her.  This amendment would cure that defect in the Act and I commend it to the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickODonnell" hpid="Mr. O'Donnell Mr. O'Donnell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donnell</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to support this amendment.  As I said previously the section as it stands encourages celibacy.  I can visualise the case which Deputy O'Higgins has mentioned but there is another very important case, that of the widower with a very large family who becomes a recipient of workmen's compensation. He may find it an absolute necessity to remarry for the purpose of finding some person or other to look after his children.  As the section stands at the moment, no provision whatever is made for the payment of compensation to the second wife.</P>
      <P>Again we can think of the case of a single man who is engaged to be married.  He meets with an accident but no provision is made for his future wife under the Bill as it stands.  He is left with the option of marrying on a single man's compensation or of facing an action for a breach of promise&mdash;one or the other.  I say it is un-Christian and un-Catholic to make no provision for a workman who may marry or may remarry, or to make no provision for a widower with a large family who may find it a necessity to marry.  He cannot afford to keep a housekeeper and there may be no female person in the house to look after his small children.  I think that this is an amendment which should commend itself to the Minister and to the House generally.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>That is not an easy matter to deal with in present circumstances. I have had to mention over and over again in respect to many provisions in this Bill that many amendments could and would be willingly accepted if the Bill provided for a nationalised or a compulsory insurance scheme.  We have neither at the moment but I quite agree with the two Deputies who have <Col N="1293" /> spoken that from either point of view an amendment like this should be accepted.  I want, however, to put the case of the small employer who has to pay compensation to a single man and who might find it difficult enough to pay that compensation.  He should, I think, at least know what his liabilities are and the future should not be uncertain so far as he is concerned. For that reason, I am afraid we cannot accept this amendment until some comprehensive measure is brought in which will be either a nationalised scheme or a compulsory insurance scheme.  If a comprehensive scheme were to continue these dependent's allowances, I doubt if either of the Deputies who have spoken would be in favour of continuing these allowances. Under a comprehensive scheme I think they would be provided for but in present circumstances I am afraid I could not accept the amendment.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister is giving that small man, whoever he is, an unduly important position in this whole question.  I do not think that the small employer is as ubiquitous as the Minister thinks.  Apparently, not only is he a small employer but he must be a bad employer because he has never taken out an insurance policy to cover his employees.  Should we deny others, who are covered by policies taken out by their employers, the benefits which they could get under this section because a few small employers refuse to take out policies? I think the Minister should look into the matter between this and Wednesday next to see if he could meet the point.  I do not travel the whole way <Col N="1294" /> with Deputy O'Donnell's argument but there is something in the point of view that if a man meets with an accident before he marries he should not be handicapped by having to exist on a single man's allowance after he gets married.  If we had a compulsory insurance scheme we would certainly accept this risk but we have not as yet got such a scheme.  As a Deputy truly said earlier to-day, we have operated for 53 years on a certain principle. We have gone on the principle that an injured man gets the same amount of compensation whether he is married or not up to this.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. O'Higgins Mr. O'Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>The basis of the Minister's opposition to the amendment, as I understand it, is that an employer is entitled to know his risk.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. O'Higgins Mr. O'Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>That is quite understandable but surely the whole Bill is the antithesis of that.  You provide in the Bill for a workman who is injured. Up to that he is merely a name on a roll.  He becomes injured and then it is discovered that he is married and that he has seven or eight children. The employer must then pay him 50/- per week plus 12/- for his wife, plus 7/- in respect of each child.  Up to the actual accident, the employer was unaware of the extent of his liability.  If the Minister's argument were to be carried to its logical conclusion, the employer would be entitled, first of all, to carry out an examination of the household of the workman he was employing.</P>
      <P>I frankly cannot see where there is an objection in principle to the proposition that a workman who is injured and then marries should be regarded for what he is&mdash;a man with all the difficulties of a married man&mdash;and that he should be compensated on that basis.  I do not think that the suggestion that because some small employer does not insure, he may not be in the position to pay the extra 12/-, can be advanced as an argument.  In fact, getting down to reality, no employer from the passing of this Bill can afford to be uninsured in relation to workmen's compensation.  If he is uninsured then he is a fool and he does not deserve any sympathy at all.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>I think, while we have not got compulsory insurance and while it is not an offence not to be insured, the same position is going to be arrived at by the passing of this Bill and, indeed, I think, was arrived at some years ago when the compensation went up to 50/- a week.  No employer now, for the sake of the small outlay involved, contemplates the employment even of a domestic servant without ensuring that he is covered for the risks involved both for the payment of accident compensation and death compensation. I would press the Minister to accept the amendment.  I think it is an amendment that we should all insist on because I can see from the passing of this Bill into law a considerable number of cases of injustice arising.  I do not think that where a little effort on our part can avoid an injustice we should not take that effort in the manner in which the Minister suggests.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>I think there is a danger in this whole business.  What we are doing now is not without immense possibilities for exploitation by the insurance companies.  I do not know in what way they will assess their premiums in future.  The present position is that one gives the number of staff employed, and the total wages bill and compensation is assessed on that basis because there is no discrimination between married and single men. I do not know what the companies will do in future, but clearly the wages bill plus the number employed will not be sufficient if there is to be a varying rate for single men, for a man and his wife, for a man, his wife and one child and for a man, his wife and two children.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Whether insurance companies will allow that human light and shadow to play any part in the calculation of premiums, I do not know, but I expect they will not.  They will decide on a flat rate for maximum liability on the basis that every insured person is a man with a wife and two children.  One justification for that would be that one never knows when a single man may <Col N="1296" /> get married.  He may get married a month after being insured, and if premium is calculated on the basis that he is a single man on the 1st January and he gets married in the month of February, when he becomes liable for compensation he may have a child as well as a wife, and the company might have to pay 50/- for himself, 12/-  for his wife and 7/- for the first child. One cannot keep tabs on the situation from day to day, observing how the love affairs of one's staff are progressing and, therefore, the best thing to do is to assume that every man is a married man for the purposes of premium.</P>
    <P>The insurance companies will not take steps to find out if John Murphy is married or single, if he has one or two children.  They will not worry their heads as to the prospect of his getting married.  They will look for some easy way out, and the easiest way out will be to fix the premium on the basis that their liability will be to cover the risk of a man with a wife and two children. If they do that, why should they not be asked to take this liability because the premium will be based on the assumption that the man will make a demand on the basis of a wife and two children?  They will not worry their heads as to whether a man is married, is likely to remain single or to get married.  I think there is a very good case for this and the insurance companies ought to be asked on what basis they will calculate the premiums.  It would be a proper mess if premiums were assessed on liability to pay a married man with a wife and two children while, in actual fact, they would only be paying on the basis of what a single man had.  We will have the Report Stage next week and the Minister can find out between to-day and next Wednesday from the insurance companies whether, in fact, that will happen.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>This matter is being discussed with the companies at the moment.  They never ask any employer for the names of his employees. They do not ask whether they are married or single.  What they asked my Department to do was to give them some rough estimate of the number of <Col N="1297" /> married people in social insurance and the number who have one or two children. We were not able to give them a very accurate figure on that.  We had samples taken out and we were able to give them some figures and it is on that figure that the premium is based.  Suppose half the employees in a concern are single and the other half married; suppose that of that half 16 per cent. have one child and 32 per cent. have two children; assume there are 100 people employed; on that average the claims will be increased by so much.  It is on that the insurance companies are basing their premium. They will not inquire as to whether or not a man is married. They will take the average.  One employer who has all single men in his employment may be wrong to some extent vis-à-vis the employer who has nothing but married men because the man with the single employees should have a lower premium to meet, but he will not have a lower premium because the premium will be the same all round.  The companies are simply bulking it all together and facing the liability.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>My point was not adverted to by Deputy Norton.  If everybody was insured I would not have so much objection to the amendment. Unfortunately, everybody is not insured and that may mean that the small employer may be uncertain about his liability.  As Deputy O'Higgins says, he is uncertain of his liability until a man meets with an accident. Perhaps it is not until then that the employer discovers his employee is a married man.  When the accident occurs and the employer discovers what his liability is, at least we can say now that he knows his liability. If he finds his employee is a single man and he settles to pay him so much per week, I think it would be unfair that in five or six years' time this man should come back and say: &ldquo;I am married now and you will have to give me another 12/- per week.&rdquo;  That is the point.  If we arrive at a comprehensive <Col N="1298" /> scheme, we will either have a nationalised scheme or compulsory insurance and when that time arrives this could be included.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>So far as this small man, who has got into the discussion somehow or other, is concerned, he is a person who wants to avoid his social obligations.  Why should we not give all the others the benefit of getting this increased compensation?  If the small man chooses, in face of the warnings conveyed by this Bill and the six weeks' interregnum which he will have in the form of notice before the appointed day why should we not make him carry the obligation even if he cannot discharge it?  Should we not, in any case, protect the other people? Would the Minister not put the obligation on him and, if he cannot meet it, he cannot meet it, but there are a lot of others who may not meet it, either.</P>

      <P>The Minister has no knowledge how many exceptions there are, but, because there may be an exception, we will do two things. Firstly, because there may be an exception we will discriminate against the man who meets with an accident and who is not married at the time, and, secondly, something else will happen arising out of the exception as to how the insurance companies will see the position.  The Minister says <Col N="1299" /> they will find out the relative percentage of married and single people in employment and strike a flat rate.  I have no doubt that that rate will be struck on the supposition that not merely are there a number of married people in employment but that all the single people will eventually get married.</P>

      <P>If there are 100 men in a particular job and 60 are married and 40 are not, at some stage a great many of the 40 will get married.  It is not just on a theoretical calculation of so many employees married and so many unmarried that insurance companies will base their premiums.  They will allow for men becoming married and charge accordingly.</P>
      <P>So far as the section stands at the moment in the case of a man who is unfortunate enough to meet with an accident just before he gets married he is out of luck unless his employer has paid on the basis that he will get married.  Why should we let the insurance company get away with that?  On the supposition that we have these mythical Robinson Crusoes, they do not even know they can get cover against this kind of liability.  Even from the point of view of protecting the worker, is it not important that we should get the smallest employer to have insurance cover?  We will only do that by educating them.  That is long overdue when we think of some of the cases we ourselves have come across. It is not fair that we should have these theoretical individuals, departmental officials, always thinking that we should discriminate against the worker who has a legitimate claim and a legitimate right to get married, and for whom the employer is going to pay.  This is just because you may have somewhere in the far end of the country some individual who does not know about these matters.</P>

      <P>The Minister has pointed out to us the desirability of bearing in mind the present social welfare code.  In every other form of State insurance, the age limit in respect of children is 16.  The Minister has taken over the age of 15 from the Workmen's Compensation Act in respect of the Schedule dealing with the calculation of means of juvenile dependents.  The matter is a small one, and I think it would be only proper to keep the age of the child in this respect at 16 so as to be in line with other State insurance.</P>

      <P>The Minister has explained to me that while his attitude to this amendment is sympathetic enough, he does not think that the change should be made in this Bill, because if it were made a substantial number of consequential changes <Col N="1301" /> would be necessary in the Act of 1934, in order to avoid anomalies.  The age limit of 15 was put into this Bill for the reason that it is the age fixed in the Workmen's Compensation Act of 1934 to distinguish juvenile from adult dependents in fatal cases.  The adoption of the amendment would give rise to anomalies.  If a person between 15 and 16 was treated as a juvenile in a non-fatal case, he would be treated as an adult if the case ultimately became a fatal one if this amendment was to be made.  To avoid these anomalies and to be logical, it would be necessary to alter the Schedule of the 1934 Act, which deals with the calculation of compensation in fatal cases.</P>
      <P>Deputies who remember that Act will know that the Schedule is a fairly long and complicated one, and that it would be impossible to prepare the consequential amendments within reasonable time.  The Minister is urging, therefore, that this is a change which should be considered in connection with the comprehensive review of the workmen's compensation code which it is intended to bring in later.</P>

      <P>In sub-section (8), paragraph (a), page 4, line 34, to delete all words after &ldquo;him&rdquo; to the end of the paragraph.</P>
      <P>This is a matter that was discussed on the Second Reading of the Bill.  It largely revolves around the question of children born to a man who meets with an accident.  It confines his claim, as far as supplemental allowances are concerned, to children born not later than nine months after the accident.  Why should it not apply to children born after a longer period than nine months?  We had much the same kind of argument in regard to the supplemental allowances in the case of the wife where the marriage took place after the husband's accident. Why should this be confined to a period of nine months?  Quite clearly there can be cases in which a birth can take place quite normally after the expiration of a period greater than nine months.  The fact that the section is so worded will deny a man any claim in respect of that child.  We feel that, in the case of supplemental allowances in respect of a child, they should be effective in respect of children born after the accident takes place and of children born before it. Why have this line of demarcation by saying that no claim can arise in respect of a child born in any period preceding the nine months?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. O'Higgins Mr. O'Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>The principle in the Bill seems to be that there is now going to be a differentiation between a single man and a married man.  The married man who is insured is compensated <Col N="1303" /> in accordance with his family.  If he has a wife, and no children, he gets certain compensation. If he has a family he gets compensation under Section 3.  The whole principle is to compensate the married man, as such.  That seems to me to involve the consideration that the family will increase in the ordinary natural way and may be expected to increase.</P>
      <P>As the section now stands, the Minister, having decided to compensate the family man as such, seeks to differentiate between pre-accident and postaccident children.  I cannot see where that differentiation could arise as a matter of principle.  There are other aspects of this question.  From the point of view of public policy, it is quite objectionable for us to legislate in this way, to legislate that a man who is married and has a family should not be entitled to be compensated in respect of any new arrivals in the family.  That is contrary to public policy and is also introducing a very unfair discrimination between different classes of married men who are injured. It also appears to be repugnant to the principle underlying the Bill.</P>
      <P>I adopt the other arguments mentioned by Deputy Larkin which are very much in accordance with what we urged on the earlier amendment, No. 3.  There is a matter of principle involved here which I would urge on the Tánaiste to consider carefully between now and Report Stage.</P>

      <P>If the legislation is based on a situation in which an employer is not compelled to insure, one must assume that the employer may exercise his right not to insure and it is necessary to have regard to the position that may be created for such employer.  It is always the small employer, of course, who is most likely to be affected by a claim of this kind.  It is always the small employer who would be wise to insure.  Many large employers do not.  They carry their own risk and build up a reserve fund against risk.  The small employer cannot afford to do that and therefore it is in relation to the small employer who employs only one or two workers that one has to consider the effect of the legislation.</P>

      <P>May I put this point of view?  When we are passing legislation which will impose charges on State funds, what we do is our responsibility.

We should be more certain that we are doing justice than when the financial consequence of our decision is one that has to be borne on public funds.</P>

    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister bear this in mind?  As I said earlier, I have a suspicion that the insurance companies, in fixing the premium, will advert to the fact that this particular man has a wife&mdash;he has to have a wife; otherwise he does not come under this section&mdash;and in all probability he will have a child during the year in the <Col N="1305" /> family, and the premium which is being imposed on that man's employer will take notice of the fact that he has a wife and, as a fair probability, will have a child.  The premium having been fixed on the basis that he has a wife and is likely to have a child, if he discovers that he cannot get compensation for the child although the employer paid on that risk, it is simply lining the pockets of the insurance company.  I want to make sure that they do not get away with anything to the detriment of the injured worker. They could easily carry this risk.</P>
      <P>As to that mythical small man whom we have not seen yet, that person is capable of warping our whole approach to this problem.  Why should not an ordinary person who is employed by a wealthy corporation be entitled to compensation in respect of the child born nine months after he meets with the accident?  By trying to protect this mythical man we really, consciously or unconsciously, are doing great harm to people who are not employees of this poor small man, as he was described. We should be fair to others even if we want to protect that fellow.</P>

      <P>  In line 44 to delete &ldquo;six&rdquo; and substitute &ldquo;eight&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The purpose of the amendment is to fix the income limit in the practical application of the Act in so far as the non-manual worker is concerned at £800 per annum instead of £600.  This is a matter on which there can be different viewpoints.  Presumably, in arriving at £600 the Minister has again been guided by the figures in the Social Welfare Act.  I would again press the view that until such time as we are dealing with the workmen's <Col N="1306" /> compensation code on a comprehensive basis and, perhaps, treat it either under a system of State insurance or some other system radically different from the present code, it is not fair to determine our attitude in all these matters purely on the basis of what is in the social welfare code, because we have no guarantee at all at the moment that if we come to deal with the code in a comprehensive way we will follow the existing social welfare pattern in any close degree.  We may take an entirely different line.  So that I would appeal that in determining what should be the income limit so far as non-manual workers are concerned it should be a fairly pragmatic approach as to where is the point at which we should draw the line in respect of non-manual workers in so far as they do require protection in respect of accident sustained in their employment in the same way as manual workers.</P>
    <P>My submission in that regard is that, because of the changes that have taken place in respect of clerical salaries in the years since 1938, the position has markedly changed, and the suggestion that we will fix the income limit at £800 to-day is not unwarranted, for this reason: I take it that in fixing the limit of £250 in the original Act in respect of non-manual workers regard was had to the fact that the intention was to bring within the scope of the Act non-manual workers who would at the same time be closely aligned in the nature of their duties to the general run of manual workers.  In other words, we were dealing with the ordinary type of clerks, dispatch clerks, checkers, and so on.</P>
    <P>Now, with the changes which have taken place in clerical employees' salaries and the reorganisation of their gradings and salary scale, a large number of employees whose salaries are at the maximum reach to nearly £800.  It is from that point of view of merely keeping within the income limit the non-manual workers who were originally intended to be covered by the Act that I think we should raise the scale a little higher than £600.  In most large firms to-day the <Col N="1307" /> junior salary scale begins around £190 or £200 and runs automatically to £600.  We may find also that within the next year or so there may be a further adjustment of these salary scales which would put the maximum for these non-manual workers well above £600 per annum.  That is why I think that merely as a precaution we should fix it in respect of this Bill at £800.  We will not be bringing under the Bill a large number of persons who are not under the Act under the old £250 limit or bringing in the type of employees whom it was never intended to cover.  The £600 is tied in regard to non-manual workers now and I think the argument is in favour of raising it above £600.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I would urge strongly against this change.  All the social welfare legislation which has been enacted is based on that figure of a £600 income limit for non-manual workers.  Even the Health Bill which has been passed this week has that limit also.  If we were to depart from it in one instance, it is certain pressure would come for departing from it in all instances.  As the Minister for Health mentioned, the question will have to be considered at some stage, whether workmen's compensation will be incorporated into the State insurance scheme against sickness, or whether some other basis for it should be maintained.  I think that if we are going to consider the possibility of incorporating workmen's compensation in the sickness insurance scheme we should leave the limit as it is, because to change it now would be an embarrassing precedent when we come to consider that question.  I urge that we should maintain the limit which was generally understood as applying to all these schemes at present until the wider question has to be decided.</P>

      <P>In page 5, lines 12 to 14, to delete &ldquo;provided that the proceedings are instituted within 12 months from the occurrence of the accident,&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>The position prior to the introduction of the Workmen's Compensation Acts was that there was a right at common law to institute proceedings against an employer for negligence and the period within which these proceedings could be brought was regulated by the Statute of Limitations and was four years in the case of negligence.  When the Workmen's Compensation Acts were introduced, if a workman accepted compensation he immediately forfeited his right to introduce proceedings at common law no matter how gross the negligence on the part of his employer.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We all have had experience of cases <Col N="1309" /> where an unfortunate worker, through ignorance or through inability to appreciate his position, accepted compensation, thereby forfeiting his chances of receiving perhaps substantial damages for the negligence of his employer.</P>
    <P>We are going to remedy that in this Bill, but the section says that he must bring the proceedings at common law within 12 months of the date of the accident.  Why should we limit the period to 12 months?  One can visualise the case of a workman who was seriously injured possibly spending eight or ten months in hospital and very glad indeed to obtain compensation to keep the wolf from the door of his wife and family.  It is only after he is up and out again and consults a solicitor that he discovers he has a right at common law to introduce proceedings for damages for negligence.</P>
    <P>The statute law has protected the employer in that it has fixed the period in which proceedings must be instituted, namely, four years.  Why should we amend the Statute of Limitations by fixing 12 months?  I respectfully suggest that no great hardship would be thrown on the employer by this amendment.  If by any chance the unfortunate worker succeeds in his action at common law, so far as I recollect the law is that any compensation paid will be set off against the damages obtained.  If he has been drawing compensation for four years and obtains a lump sum for damages at common law, then the amount of compensation paid will be set off against the damages obtained. I think we should not fix a limit, that we should leave the employee his rights under the old Statute of Limitations.  I think the amendment should be accepted.</P>

The doctor certified that he was suffering from poisoning contracted in the industry in which he was engaged.  I also know of a case of a man who worked in a lime-kiln who was ill for quite a long time, and it was over two years when one doctor certified he was suffering from a certain <Col N="1310" /> disease which I mentioned&mdash; pneumoconiosis.  But the trouble there was that it was not a scheduled disease.  We took it to court and there the legal adviser told us that the case would be thrown out because the disease was not a scheduled disease. Studying the different articles written about this disease, I find that in England some of those miners and other workers who went into the army or the navy discovered that this disease did not show itself until after two or two and a half years, and I think the Minister will be well-advised not to have any limitation at all except that the sickness did arise out of the occupation.

      <P>This provision in this Act is designed to remedy a grievance that has been there for a long time.  That is the clause which gives a workman the right to bring in a claim for damages in common law even though he has accepted workmen's compensation. I think every Deputy was anxious that that should be put in, but I think it should be fairly obvious that some limit had to be put in at the same time.  I think it would be very unfair if a man were to draw workmen's compensation for a protracted period and then make up his mind that he would resort to common law.  A Bill was brought in by the Labour Party some time ago, and what they suggested was that the man should be allowed to go to common law if he was not aware of his rights before that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I thought there might be some discussion in the courts about whether he was aware of them, and I wanted to cut that out, and give the man 12 months to make up his mind and that is fair enough.  I cannot imagine more being needed.  As a matter of fact, I was doubtful whether the period should be six months or 12 months.  In most cases it should be six months, but maybe in a very bad accident, a man might take three or four months to recover his senses, so to speak, or be in a position to consider his position <Col N="1311" /> and in that case six months might be a bit short.  I do not think anybody could say that 12 months is not reasonable from a security point of view.  I do not think Deputies could argue that if a man is drawing workmen's compensation for five or seven or ten years, he could come along and take this action.</P>

      <P>No.  Amendment No. 18 merely deals with compensation. It does not deal with damages at common law.  What I am trying to get at, is to try to put the workman's rights to sue for damages at common law on a par with his rights to sue for compensation under the Workmen's Compensation Acts.  In other words, no matter when his injuries become apparent, at common law, as the Section now stands, if 12 months have elapsed he has no rights, but he has the right of action under the Workmen's Compensation Act if it becomes apparent after a longer period then 12 months.  I think we should put them on a par.</P>

      <P>Would the Minister consider leaving the position of the man as it is at common law?  The position at the moment is that if a man meets with an injury in the course of his employment, he has met with an injury and everybody knows that he has met with an accident and he is given compensation under the Workmen's Compensation Acts.  The question arises that we are now giving him the right in 12 months to go after his employer from the date of the accident, if negligence attaches to the employer. But we are saying in this particular case you can only sue within 12 months. That might meet most cases because at that stage it is not a question of whether he met with an injury or not. The only point is the way in which he met with the injury, whether it was an accident or whether you could establish negligence against the employer. But there does seem to be a good case for saying: &ldquo;You have the right against the employer under common law and there is no restriction with regard to time&rdquo; and whatever his rights against the employer are in this respect leave them open to him.  There is not much occasion for interfering with those rights.  You can say: &ldquo;You are getting workmen's compensation but that does not interfere with your rights in common law&rdquo;.  Would the Minister look into that matter?</P>

      <P>Deputies must realise in ordinary cases of common law, say, where a man is injured in a motoring accident, he is sort of forced to take action because if he is badly injured he has nothing else to keep him, and he must get damages as soon as possible. But here he can draw workmen's compensation and make up his mind next year or the year after about what he is going to do.  I think it is a different case.  I think it is reasonable to say to him: &ldquo;You must make up your mind as to what you are going to do within 12 months.&rdquo;  Of course, if he does not draw compensation, then he can take as long as he likes.</P>

      <P>Will the Minister consider the suggestion I made, because I think that in 99 cases out of 100, 12 months would be sufficient?  I am quite certain that 99 per cent. of the cases would be taken within the 12 months, but there might be an odd case like that mentioned by Deputy Hickey and other cases where for unusual reasons the person might not be in a position to take the action for over 12 months.  It might be possible then to provide that such an action should be taken within 12 months unless just and reasonable cause is shown to the court why such action was not taken before then.</P>

      <P>There is another point which the Minister should really consider.  Take the poor worker, the very poor man.  Now, he may be advised by legal advisers: &ldquo;Look, you have a good sporting chance, a fifty-fifty chance.  It is a High Court action. You must employ medical experts. You must employ engineers.  Counsel have got to be employed.&rdquo;  Now the worker will think very carefully before he takes a chance.  It may be that he may wish to accumulate a certain amount of financial assistance before he embarks on this very costly legal gamble, if I might use the expression.</P>

      <P>You are not gambling on the lawyers.  We are gambling on the decision of a judge and, possibly, a Supreme Court, and very often we might find a divided Supreme Court.  When you have a divided Supreme Court it is a gamble, no matter how you look at it.  I do not think that any person is being prejudiced by extending the time.  I cannot visualise any person being prejudiced if you are giving that unfortunate workman who may find himself in that position more time.  As Deputy Flanagan says, in 99 cases out of 100 he knows his position within 12 months, but better let us make provision for the other 1 per cent. of cases.  We all know that in going into a legal action a man might find the outlay involved run into hundreds of pounds.  Models may have to be made&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesLarkin1943" hpid="Mr. Larkin Mr. Larkin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Larkin</NameTxt>
      <P>On Section 6 there is a point I would like to put to the Minister, but I am in some difficulty because I am not a lawyer.  I understand that within the past two or three weeks a case actually came before the courts in which a point has arisen which might require clarification.  I understand that in a recent case where a workman took proceedings under the Compensation Act and simultaneously took proceedings under common law the common law proceedings were lost and subsequently it was not clear to his legal advisers as to his position regarding whether the compensation case then could be heard in the Circuit Court or the High Court and because of some difficulty the decision now is in this particular case that the man has lost all possibility of pursuing even his compensation case.</P>
      <P>I find myself frankly at somewhat of a loss because it is a very technical matter, and only members of the legal profession would be clear about the argument and have knowledge of the case.  Perhaps the Minister might consult his legal advisers and consider whether it would not be necessary on the Report Stage to try to deal with this point, which has only arisen as far as I know in the last two or three weeks.  There is also difficulty in that respect, that in this particular matter there seems to be a difference between the English Act and the law dealing with that particular code here.  It is purely a question, as I understand it, of where this procedure is pursued, where a person first pursues his compensation case, in which court his case will be proceeded with after the failure of a common law action.  I think that case occurred recently.  It is the case of Curran v. Pye.  Perhaps the Minister might have his advisers check on it and see whether from a legal point of view we could do something to clarify it.</P>

      <P>(ii)  if the proceedings are so instituted and it is determined therein, or on appeal, that the injury is one for which the defendant is liable in the proceedings, the court in which the proceedings are heard, or if the determination is the determination (on appeal by either party) of an appellate tribunal then such appellate tribunal shall deduct from the damages, costs and expenses any such compensation or sum which the workman has received and, where there have been proceedings for the recovery of compensation under this Act or such scheme, any costs and expenses therein of the respondent in those proceedings and any costs and expenses therein of the workman which have been borne by such respondent,</P>

His widow has taken, during her sorrow, through the Workmen's Compensation Act, £150 for herself and £150 for the children. What I want to know is will the Minister under the Bill and this amendment say if she is in a position to take further action in the other courts by a claim for damages.</P>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Byrne Mr. Byrne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think that has been proved.  There is a point arising in that it is stated that the horse was out on grass for three or four weeks and the man was ordered to take out the van, so the horse took fright and in going through the city after being three weeks away from the traffic it ran away.  There is no negligence proved in the case but I would like in cases like that to give an opportunity of doing something, if it is possible, for the widow and children.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>On the general question, that is different.  If the man had a right then there is no doubt about it his widow or representative would have the same right to pursue it if he died, whatever his right might be.  That is already covered under the Acts.  But <Col N="1319" /> in the particular case the Deputy has mentioned I am afraid that there is no hope there because the action has already occurred.</P>

In so far as the present Bill is concerned we have been dealing with the question of weekly payments.  The point here is that, on review by a court of weekly payment and incapacity is taken to have ceased, even if incapacity arises at a subsequent date the workman is debarred from having his incapacity reconsidered and having the compensation re-awarded.  A very great hardship can be imposed in that respect.</P>

    <P>The provision of £3,880 under sub-head E (1), is for Technical and Advisory Work in Agriculture.  This sum is required to meet estimated expenditure in 1953-54 in connection with a scheme for the propagation of pedigree seed wheat. For some years past the quality of the ordinary commercial seed wheats available to wheat growers has not been satisfactory, owing to natural deterioration and to the mixture of seeds of different varieties of wheat and of other cereals.  In fact the quality of the seed in this respect was the subject of unfavourable comment by officials of OEEC who visited this country last year.  It is considered that an official seed certification scheme is necessary in order to ensure that wheat growers will have available to them adequate supplies of high quality seed wheat suited to Irish conditions.  Following discussions with representatives of the Flour Millers' Irish Wheat Association, agreement has been reached on the outlines of a scheme for the propagation and distribution of pedigree seed wheat.</P>
    <P>The main features of the scheme are:&mdash;</P>
    <P>(1)  The Department will produce foundation stocks and sell these to the Flour Millers' Irish Wheat Association (or large seed merchants) each year;</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1322" /> (2)  The allottees will arrange for the propagation of the foundation stocks through two seasons under the supervision of the Department. The produce of this seed will eventually be officially certified and sealed.</P>
    <P>With regard to (1), the production of foundation stocks by the Department will involve the selection or production of varieties suitable to this country and their propagation under the supervision of the Plant Breeding Division from the single plant stage to the stage at which only three further years of multiplication will be required to provide the full seed requirements of the country.</P>
    <P>As the Department has not, as yet, any suitable foundation stock, a small quantity, approximately 30 barrels, of Original Swedish Atle seed imported by Messrs.  Irish Grain, Limited, is being used as a nucleus stock for propagation at Grange Farm and Warrenstown Agricultural College.  It is also proposed, in 1953-54, to establish one seed certification unit in association with Messrs.  Irish Grain, Limited, who have arranged for the growing by selected farmers of the balance of the Original Swedish Atle seed imported by them.</P>
    <P>A provision of £375 under sub-head E (4) is for Reseach Grants to University College, Dublin.  This additional provision is required for research into the ravages caused by the wheat midge.</P>
    <P>In 1951 very extensive damage was done to wheat crops, particularly in the southern counties, by wheat midge. The damage in 1952 was much less.</P>
    <P>In dealing with these outbreaks, the Department was handicapped by the lack of adequate data concerning the incidence, emergence period and biology of the midge in this country and by lack of reliable information as to the efficacy of the various control measures.  Much was learned about wheat midge during and since the outbreaks referred to, but much remains to be learned before the Department will be in a position to fulfil effectively its function of adviser to the farming community in this matter.</P>
    <P>As attacks of wheat midge may be <Col N="1323" /> expected to recur, it is considered advisable to arrange for the carrying out of a detailed investigation into the matters mentioned.  The Department has no officer on its staff with the required qualifications in entomology and arrangements have been made with the authorities of University College, Dublin, for the carrying out of the investigation by the agricultural zoology department of the college.  The investigation will involve up to about ten weeks' field work during the summer, as well as experimental work.</P>
    <P>The grant payable in respect of the investigation will depend on the actual expenditure, but it is not expected to exceed £375.  The arrangement is similar to those already in operation in connection with investigations by the university authorities on potato root and strawberry eel worm.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>Could the Minister at this point state whether the research already carried out into the midge problem has indicated whether any particular varieties of wheat are more susceptible than others?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Walsh Mr. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>No, not yet.  We have not been able to identify any wheat that is immune.</P>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Walsh Mr. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>There is a sum of £29,200 under sub-head H&mdash;Grants to County Committees of Agriculture&mdash; and £5,800 under sub-head I&mdash;Special Agricultural, etc., Schemes&mdash;and these provisions are made to finance a scheme to encourage the use of fertilisers throughout the country.  The fertility status of much of the land of this country is very low, and field experiments have demonstrated that striking results in the matter of increased yield can be obtained by proper manurial treatment.  Cobalt deficiency is a serious problem in many parts of the congested districts, and also in the poor areas of certain other counties, notably Wicklow, Waterford, Carlow and North Wexford.  This deficiency results in considerable losses in live stock, particularly in <Col N="1324" /> sheep.  Experimental work shows that in affected areas the use of cobalt will result in reduced stock mortality and in much greater thriftiness.  It is considered that a system of large-scale demonstration plots would be the most potent means of promoting greater use of fertilisers, the consumption of which in this country is abnormally low compared with other European countries.</P>
      <P>It would not be possible to have the proposed scheme of demonstration plots financed by the county committees of agriculture.  Some of them could not afford it, and the others would not be prepared to seek the additional income necessary to enable them to bear the cost.  It has, accordingly, been decided to have the necessary funds made available from the Exchequer.</P>
      <P>The provision of £29,200 under sub-head H is intended: (1) to enable 20 manurial demonstration plots with tillage crops and 20 such plots on grassland to be established in his district by each instructor in agriculture in the country, the necessary manures to be provided free of charge to the plotholder by the committee of agriculture whose expenditure, subject to a fixed maximum, will be recouped by the Department: and (2), to enable 200 special demonstration plots to be established by the instructors in agriculture in cobalt-deficient districts, each plot to be dressed free of charge to the farmer with Semsol containing cobalt at a cost of £2 10s. per plot.</P>
      <P>The provision of £5,800 under sub-head I is intended (1), to enable ten manurial plots with tillage crops to be established by each of the parish agricultural advisory agents employed by the Department in the congested districts, the necessary manures to be supplied direct by the Department free of charge to the plotholder; and (2), to enable 500 special demonstration plots dressed with Semsol containing cobalt (at a cost of £2 10s. per plot) to be established by the parish agricultural advisory agents in their districts.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The provision of £400 in sub-head N (1)&mdash;Diseases of Animal Acts, 1894 to 1949&mdash;is required for the purpose of making a contribution towards abnormal <Col N="1325" /> quarantine charges incurred by private importers of pedigree live stock as a result of the detention of their animals in Glasgow quarantine station for the period May to October, 1952, under the precautionary measures necessary to prevent the spread of foot and mouth disease to this country.</P>

      <P>I am moving that the Supplementary Estimate be referred back for the purpose of discussing this matter and I should like to remind the House that, on 16th June and on a previous occasion, I put down questions to the Minister asking for information concerning butter and the various items of cost which made up the total retail price of 4/2 to the consumer. Unfortunately, the Minister refused to reply to that question and said he would deal with the matter in the course of the debate on the Estimate for his Department.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Walsh Mr. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Walsh</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="EamonnRooney" hpid="Mr. Rooney Mr. Rooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Rooney</NameTxt>
      <P>I feel that this is an undesirable practice.  It began two years ago when his big brother, the Minister for Industry and Commerce, refused to answer questions put down here.  I propose to read the question to indicate to the Minister the information I require and which I hope he will give on this occasion.  At column 1260 of the Dáil Debates, Volume 139, of the 16th June last, I asked the Minister:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;If he will name the main items included in the £162,000 provided under sub-head P of Vote 27 for winter storage and loss on sale of <Col N="1326" /> imported butter and state how this amount is calculated?&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The Minister's reply was that he would deal with the matter on the Estimate for his Department.  I should like to know from the Minister now why he could not answer the question on the 16th June and why he delayed replying to that question until to-day.</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Walsh Mr. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>I did not say you were going to get the answer even now.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonnRooney" hpid="Mr. Rooney Mr. Rooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Rooney</NameTxt>
      <P>That is what I am afraid of.  I followed that up with a further question, asking the Minister:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;If he will ascertain from the Butter Marketing Committee or whatever body is responsible (a) the names and number of firms which have contracted to wrap imported butter in 1 lb. packets; (b) the sum per cwt. allowed in respect of such contracts; (c) the total sum paid to such firms since 13th June, 1951, and (d) how many tons of imported butter were wrapped?&rdquo;</P>
      <P>To that question, the Minister replied:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;As I informed the Deputy on Wednesday last, 10th June, the information he requires is not available in my Department.  The Butter Marketing Committee has no control over this trade either, and I know of nobody in a position to furnish the information sought.&rdquo;</P>

I would have been more than pleased to get the information he was seeking because I think that we will all need it on this side of the House during the coming three weeks.

    <Speaker pid="JosephBlowick" hpid="Mr. Blowick Mr. Blowick">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blowick</NameTxt>
      <P>I was delighted to hear that the Minister was embarking on the cobalt experimental plots.  I want to pay a compliment to the officials of the Department who are concerned with that.  I think I am correct in saying that this matter of deficiency in trace elements was responsible for a lot of disease in crops and stock.  Without going too deeply into medical terms, I feel that these same deficiencies in crops and stock are responsible for a good deal of ill-health and may be responsible for diseases in human beings.  I was more than glad to see that the Minister's Department is keeping pace with world advances in science along these lines.  As far as I and my Party are concerned&mdash;I am sure the same applies to everyone in the House&mdash;we will be behind the Department in any research they carry out in that field.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Whilst speaking, the Minister outlined a scheme of small plots and gave <Col N="1330" /> us the cost as being £2 per acre.  Lack of cobalt, particularly in mountainous areas, is playing the very devil with black-faced sheep.  Instead of taking a particular plot, why not restrict the number of plots and take a particular typical farm in an area where sheep rearing is carried on, dress half the farm, whatever the cost, and leave the other half undressed?  The farmer could be asked to co-operate by having half the plot undressed and the other portion dressed.  By that means the Department would accumulate some very useful information.  If he dresses a plot of grazing land I do not see how the results will be fully appreciated.</P>
    <P>In the United States and other countries pretty advanced research has been made along these lines.  I am glad to see that our Department of Agriculture are up and doing and keeping pace with the foremost scientists of the world in this regard.  In carrying out this work they not only do a good job for the prosperity of the country but they contribute very appreciably to the health of the people, the crops and the stock.</P>
    <P>I crossed swords with the Minister before on the subject of the strawberry eel worm.  Could the Minister tell us what is happening in that regard?  The money used in this particular sub-head appears to be devoted entirely to the wheat midge.  Fortunately, we have not yet seen in the West of Ireland this infamous midge.  I have the greatest sympathy for the Department and for the farmers who are trying to conquer this pest in the particular areas it ravages.  In connection with the strawberry eel worm, I believe that the particular section of the Minister's Department which looks after this matter are doing very fine work which I appreciate.  I think a few words of praise and gratitude from somebody in the House for the officials would not be out of place.  As a matter of fact, it is only right to give credit where credit is due.  What hope is there for establishing an eel worm free foundation stock of strawberries?</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickCogan" hpid="Mr. Cogan Mr. Cogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cogan</NameTxt>
      <P>I think it is right that the Minister should be complimented on introducing this Supplementary <Col N="1331" /> Estimate and upon the purposes for which it is required.  There is in the first place a substantial grant for the improvement of seed wheat.  There is nothing more urgently necessary at the present time.  In every tillage county there is considerable complaint coming from farmers that it is very difficult to secure seed that is reliable as to both variety and germination, but particularly in regard to purity of variety.  In practically every field of wheat at the present time or in a very large proportion of wheat fields at the present time we notice a considerable admixture of various varieties.  The time has come when strong and vigorous action must be taken to eliminate that situation and to ensure that the farmer who buys seed wheat can be practically certain of getting the variety that he wants in its purity.</P>
      <P>It is essential that if this scheme is to be carried out it ought to be carried out very thoroughly.  In the first place you must get the pure foundation of seed and then in the selection of growers the greatest care must be taken.  In addition to that there must be an inspection of the growing crop to ensure that no admixture will be allowed to enter into the grain.  Of course, in addition to that adequate measures must be taken to protect the seed in the threshing and subsequent operations, so that once we secure a pure variety of seed the purity of that variety will be maintained right through.  The certificate of the Department will be one upon which the ordinary farmer can rely with absolute security.  That is a very important step, and it is one upon which the Minister must be congratulated on taking.</P>

    <P>We may take it from this Supplementary Estimate that it is the fixed policy of the Government to continue to guarantee prices and a secure market for wheat because farmers are coming to realise that the guaranteed price for wheat offers them one measure of security in their difficult farming operations for which they are very thankful.  The more wheat that is grown under State guarantee the more farmers will have a secure income.  In <Col N="1332" /> addition to that, the growing of wheat under a State guarantee will ensure that a market will be available for the other grain crops, because every 1,000 acres of wheat grown will mean that that much less will not be competing with the growers of oats and the growers of feeding barley.  For that reason we should welcome this particular Estimate and this particular grant in respect of the improvement of seed wheat.</P>
    <P>It is also satisfactory to note that a scheme has been in operation as we all know through the county committees of agriculture for experimentation and demonstration in regard to the use of fertilisers.  This scheme was introduced by the Minister some months ago and I think the county committees are cooperating as far as possible in carrying it through.  They have good reason to co-operate since they are getting a grant from the Department covering the cost of the fertilisers.</P>
    <P>The fact that the consumption of fertilisers is exceptionally low in this country as compared with other tillage countries is a justification for this forward step, and it is by practical demonstration that the value of fertilisers will be brought home to every individual farmer.  Prices have been reduced during the past year and I hope they will continue to fall and that as a result of the visual demonstration in every parish farmers will realise the value of using fertilisers and the increased output that can be secured from the land by adequately dressing the soil.</P>
    <P>In this connection I hope the Minister will ensure that the county committees will carry out these demonstrations in the most effective way possible. First of all, it is desirable that the experimental plots should, wherever possible, be convenient to the public road so that they can be seen. It is also desirable that they should be clearly marked and that there should be controlled plots that is, plots not treated with the fertiliser so that everybody passing can see the difference between the plots that are treated and the plots that are not. In that way we will ensure that the best possible value is secured from this expenditure.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1333" /> With regard to disease in live stock, I am particularly interested in the prevalence of disease in pigs.  I do not know whether the Minister can utilise portion of this money for that purpose. Disease is even more widespread among pigs than is generally known because, naturally, people engaged in the breeding of pigs are not very much inclined to give widespread publicity to the fact that there may be infectious disease among them.  I think the Department should investigate this matter thoroughly.  There are various diseases such as swine erysipelas in which the pigs die at various ages even up to the time when they are fit for the market.  There is also another form of disease, a type of pneumonia which attacks the very small pigs even in the suckling or weaning stages and while they may recover, and in many cases do recover, their lungs are affected and they become unprofitable pigs afterwards.  The fact that there is a considerable amount of disease, the fact that it is infectious and that it is difficult to eradicate does constitute a serious source of loss in the pig raising industry here.</P>

      <P>I am trying to stretch this Estimate a little further to enable the Minister to utilise the money for this purpose.  It may be that this disease may have come in from across the water.  I read in a farm journal a short time ago that nearly 50 per cent. of the pigs in great Britain are affected with this disease&mdash;I think it is described as pig influenza&mdash;from which they do not die but recover and afterwards become bad thrivers and carriers of the disease.  It may be possible that some of this disease may be brought into the country from outside.</P>

      <P>Before the Minister concludes, I should like to call his attention to the fact that, in the Partry-Ballinrobe area, there has been <Col N="1334" /> a complete failure of the potato crop grown from seed supplied by the Department.  If the Minister has any information in regard to that matter, if he cannot supply it to me now, perhaps he would drop me a line in the course of the next few days and let me know what is the cause of it and whether any compensation will be paid to people who have suffered the loss of their crop, the loss of the ground devoted to the crop and the fertilisers spread on the crops.</P>

      <P>I do not think that I have been guilty at any time of telling the Deputy an untruth.  No matter what it is, I shall always tell the Deputy the truth, but the trouble is that it is converted into an untruth by the time the Deputy deals with it.  Regarding the £162,000 which we had to find as a result of the importation of New Zealand butter last year, the increase in the price from 3/10 to 4/2 enabled us to save that money.  If that windfall, as the Deputy described it, did not come from New Zealand butter it would have meant that we would have to get that money through the Exchequer in the form of new taxes. Does Deputy Rooney want further taxation?</P>

      <P>Does Deputy Rooney subscribe to further taxation?  If it was not found by increased taxation, it would have involved a reduction in the price of milk because the creameries would have to make a contribution to pay for the cold storage.  The windfall <Col N="1335" /> came our way and we are utilising it to save the taxpayer and to give a price for milk to which we feel the farmer is legitimately entitled.</P>

      <P>Deputy Blowick raised the question of cobalt deficiency and complimented the officers of the Department on what they had been doing to supply cobalt deficiencies in certain areas.  I should also like to pay a tribute to the officers of the Department for the work they have done in that regard.  They have certainly done a wonderful piece of work for the country in discovering what was the cause of it.  I attribute the loss of wool, and the incidence of bad wool in mountainous districts, to a deficiency of cobalt.  I am also informed that losses at weaning time may be attributed to a deficiency of cobalt.</P>
      <P>It is not necessary to cover the whole of the ground in an effort to correct cobalt deficiencies.  You can pick a patch in a field, give it a dressing and that is sufficient.  The animals, by going there and eating the grass there, are able to supply their want of cobalt. We are merely carrying out experiments at the moment but I hope that, as a result of the experiments and the demonstrations that have been carried out, farmers in these mountainous districts will utilise the information which we are placing at their disposal as a result of these demonstrations and have the necessary dressings applied to their land.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As regards strawberry eel worm, investigations <Col N="1336" /> are still going on.  Investigations are also being carried out in regard to potato root worm and are making satisfactory progress.</P>
    <P>Deputy Cogan wisely remarked that the quality of seed wheat in the country has deteriorated to a considerable extent.  One need only go through the country and see different crops of wheat and oats to realise the admixtures that are taking place.  If we are to have the full return that we should expect from our wheat crops, it will be necessary, first of all, to provide good seed, then to have good cultivation and, thirdly, to see that adequate fertilisers are applied.  We have good cultivation in most parts of the country and it is our intention to provide good seed for the farmers so as to enable them to obtain higher yields from the acreage under production.  Of course, it is also essential to apply a sufficient quantity of fertilisers to ensure the best results.  As a result of the wheat scheme worked in conjunction with the millers, we hope to be able to supply in the next few years a sufficient quantity of pure line or pedigree seed.</P>
    <P>As regards demonstration plots, I think everybody will agree that demonstration plots are an excellent means of educating our farmers in the use of better methods in agriculture. As a result of a general survey which has been made it has been discovered that the country is badly in need of lime and fertilisers.  Our use of fertilisers was abnormally low as compared with the continental countries. The purpose behind these demonstration plots is, as I say, to educate our farmers in the necessity of using more lime and fertilisers.  Experiments have been carried out in various parts of the country, in Johnstown Castle, for instance, and in many other counties, to demonstrate the use of different types of manurial dressings.</P>
    <P>We are making an all-out drive to educate our farmers in the use of lime and fertilisers and to show them the benefits that are derived from this practice.  Our lecturers and agricultural instructors in the various counties have lost no opportunity of impressing on farmers the importance of using more lime and fertilisers.  If <Col N="1337" /> we are to have greater efficiency in agriculture we must have greater yields and more production from the land.  During the past year we have by advertisement in the provincial and daily Press, and by the issue of pamphlets urged farmers to use greater quantities of lime and fertilisers. Any Deputy who wishes to see results of a greater use of fertilisers and lime where farmers have carried out the wishes of the Department in that respect and have used the knowledge that was placed at their disposal, need only visit various areas of the country to see the crops that have been produced there.</P>
    <P>In my opinion this harvest may possibly be one of the best we have had in this country for a long number of years, particularly where proper use has been made of lime and fertilisers. That is the purpose behind these demonstration plots.  It is our intention to have 20 such plots per agricultural instructor all over the country.  We are also anxious to have some small pilot farms in the counties outside the congested districts.  We also have our schemes for the congested districts.  It can be said, therefore, that this is a widespread national scheme for the purpose of educating our farmers in the use and value of lime and fertilisers.</P>
    <P>Deputy Cogan referred to pig diseases.  At the moment research work is being carried out on pig diseases in the veterinary research station in Thorndale.  Had I been permitted by the Fine Gael Opposition to conclude my speech I would have referred to the question of live-stock diseases.  I have that matter under very active consideration at the moment.  Diseases in live stock present one of the major problems.  Substantial losses have been experienced.  It is horrifying to think that we lose practically one-fifth of the calf population each year through disease.  We must seek to find a remedy for that situation in order to avoid these losses in future.</P>
    <P>With the help of Providence, when we come back in October, and when Fine Gael Deputies agree to let me <Col N="1338" /> talk and not muzzle me any longer, I will be able to tell the people what we are doing in relation to the schemes I have in mind for the benefit of the farmers.  Of course, Fine Gael is afraid to let me talk.</P>
