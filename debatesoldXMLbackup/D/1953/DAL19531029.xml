      <P>Might I inquire, in this connection, from the Taoiseach whether he has received a copy of a communication addressed by the Irish Hierarchy to the Minister for Health and whether it is a fact that he has given a verbal assurance to the Irish Hierarchy that the Bill will not be put into operation and that it will be shelved indefinitely?</P>

In the same period there were imported 19 road motor vehicle chassis with engines mounted valued at £9,709.  It is not possible to state the number of motor vehicles equivalent to the imports of body and chassis aggregates, bodies assembled and parts imported, but their value was £5,551,648 in the 12 months in question.

    <Speaker pid="AnthonyCEsmonde" hpid="Dr. Esmonde Dr. Esmonde">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Esmonde</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Industry and Commerce if he is aware that considerable dissatisfaction is felt by passengers who embark on Aer Lingus planes from British airports due to the surcharge of 5/- which is imposed on them by the British Ministry of Civil Aviation and which is collected by Aer Lingus officials; and, if so, if he will have representations made to the British authorities to have this levy abolished; and, further, if he will make a statement on the matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. Lemass) Seán F. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. Lemass)</NameTxt>
      <P>The passenger service charge of 5/- is imposed by the British authorities and is payable in respect of each passenger embarking at a British State airport and applies to all international air services as well as those of Aer Lingus.  It is payable by the airlines in addition to the fees for aircraft landings and it is for that reason that airline officials collect the charge from their passengers.  I have already considered this matter fully, and I do not feel that I would be justified in making representations to the British authorities.  It has been announced by the British authorities that it is proposed to withdraw the passenger service charge next spring and to raise compensatory revenue by means of increases in landing fees.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="AnthonyCEsmonde" hpid="Dr. Esmonde Dr. Esmonde">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Esmonde</NameTxt>
      <P>I think that if the Minister would look into the matter again he will find that Aer Lingus was the first company on which it was imposed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy is misinformed. Aer Lingus does not impose the charge.  The British authorities impose it on all international air services.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AnthonyCEsmonde" hpid="Dr. Esmonde Dr. Esmonde">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Esmonde</NameTxt>
      <P>Aer Lingus were asked to impose it.  I know that Aer Lingus do not impose the charge.  It is the British Ministry for Civil Aviation which does so.  Aer Lingus was the first company in Ireland which was asked to impose the charge.  Subsequently France imposed the charge but not before.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>These tours are arranged by Fógra Fáilte in discharge of their function of publicising Irish tourist attractions and I do not intervene in matters of this kind.</P>
      <P>I understand, however, that in the past 12 months 16 travel agents have visited County Donegal on tours organised by Fógra Fáilte.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not aware that there is any shortage of rubber tyres for motor vehicles existing at the moment but there may, due to an unexpected demand from motor assemblers, be a certain delay in the delivery of some sizes.  I am satisfied that the home production, together with the import facilities already being granted, is sufficient to meet the current demand.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="JamesHickey" hpid="Mr. Hickey Mr. Hickey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hickey</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="AnthonyCEsmonde" hpid="Dr. Esmonde Dr. Esmonde">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Esmonde</NameTxt>
      <P>If there is such a heavy demand for tyres, would the Minister consider the opening of a factory somewhere else than in Dublin?</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGrath</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware that this firm had to get a store in which to store tyres because of the fact that they had so many in stock some time ago?  In fact, the firm is working overtime.  I can assure Deputy Esmonde and everybody else that we in Cork will make all the tyres that they want.</P>

      <P>It is proposed to transfer to Áras Mhic Dhiarmada approximately 850 such officers.  In this connection it is desirable to point out that the staffing requirements of my Department are kept constantly under review with the object of achieving economies in administration by decreasing staff numbers, through reorganisation and the introduction of improved methods and procedures. Accordingly, it is not possible to state precisely the number of officers which it will be finally necessary to transfer to Áras Mhic Dhiarmada.  The number of officers already transferred is 632. The buildings or offices available for other use as a result of the transfer and the number of officers of my Department who were accommodated therein on 31st January last are as follows:&mdash;</P>

      <P>Was not this Act intended for injured workmen, to help them and their dependents?  I should like to know from the Parliamentary Secretary if he is conscious of the fact that there are cases of men who were injured in 1947 and were out for six, seven or eight months?  They resumed their usual occupation after six, seven or eight months and were working at their normal occupation for 18 or 20 months.  During the period that they were normally employed, they got married.  I can refer to the position of one man as a case in point. He had to give up work in November, 1919, after being 18 months engaged at his normal work and drawing the usual rate of wages.</P>

      <P>I have read the statement made at a meeting of the County Galway Vocational Education Committee on the 15th September, 1953, that there is a shortage of teachers of commerce, metalwork, woodwork, rural science and art.</P>
      <P>The supply of woodwork, metalwork and rural science teachers does not quite meet the demand at present, but the numbers now in training should be sufficient to remedy the position, and arrangements are in operation which will ensure that sufficient numbers will be available in future to provide for wastage through retirements and for reasonable expansion in the service.</P>
      <P>So far as I am aware, there are sufficient applicants for posts as teachers of commerce and of art.  It may happen, however, that no candidate possesses the full qualifications laid down for a particular post, in which event a person without the full qualifications may be appointed on a temporary basis.</P>

      <P>The Department of Industry and Commerce may be described as one of the most important Departments of State, as it covers such a very wide field and has so many branches.  Consequently, the Estimate for this Department, when it comes before the House, certainly deserves the closest possible examination; and it is only right that it should be given a close and thorough examination.  The Minister for Industry and Commerce, having charge of both industry and commerce may shoulder the responsibility for the cost of living.  The cost of living in this country may, without fear of contradiction, be described as the highest in the world to-day.  As a result of the present Government's policy, it has gone completely out of the reach of not alone the poor sections of the community but the middle-class and even the well-to-do sections, which are now feeling that, month after month, they become poorer and poorer.  There seems to be a continuous strain on the pockets of all sections of the people in their endeavours to exist.</P>

    <Speaker pid="OliverJFlanagan" hpid="Mr. O. Flanagan Mr. O. Flanagan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>Very well, Sir. On the question of the cost of living, one can hardly help protesting in the strongest possible manner against the carelessness and the lack of interest displayed by the Government regarding price control.  This House knows quite well that the prices of bread and flour have gone up to such an alarming extent that it is impossible for the poorer sections of the community to purchase bread.  In our large towns and cities bread is the main item of diet, and in the working class homes it is consumed three times a day.  In the country one may have recourse to vegetables and other items of diet, but in the cities you have flour and bread and in the large towns it is certainly the main item of our people's food.  In 1951 flour was 2/8 per stone; now in 1953 it is 4/9.  The cost of flour has certainly brought about a shortage of bread in many homes and there are housewives who are forced, owing to the increase in price, to cut down the amounts of bread and flour made available to members of their household for their meals.  The Minister must know that there are in parts of rural Ireland to-day people who are hungry because of the price of bread and flour.  He must also realise&mdash;and take the responsibility for the fact&mdash;that school children, turf workers and forestry workers who have to bring a lunch of bread with them are forced, owing to the cost of bread and flour, to eat less.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With regard to the cost of tea, I cannot understand why the Department will not permit licences to be issued to anyone who desires to import tea.  We are told from a very reliable source that tea can be imported <Col N="941" /> by private concerns at a much cheaper rate than it is being imported at the present time.  When it can be imported at the cheapest possible price and when the cost of living has gone to the extent that poor sections of the people are put to the pin of their collar to eke out an existence; when we have certain people prepared to put tea more cheaply on the market with the assistance of the Department and when it is in the interests of the consumer that that should be done I fail to see why the Department will not allow tea to be imported and sold at lower rates than at present.</P>
    <P>Some time last February we were faced with a further increase in the price of sugar.  Disgraceful tactics were used by the Government in that respect.  The Budget had passed over and people were feeling they were freed from any further tax imposition on foodstuffs.  Then they were immediately stunned to find that a further increase of something like ½d. a pound was imposed on sugar.  The cost of foodstuffs in this country has certainly gone sky-high.</P>
    <P>It is only right for one to ask whether the Prices Advisory Body is functioning at all at present.  I do not know if the Minister has at his disposal a list of the items which the Prices Advisory Body have under consideration for increases.  I do not know whether he has records of the number of commodities on which requests were made to that body to permit increases.  It would be interesting for Deputies to know in how many cases that body recommended increases that the Minister has not approved of.  It should be well understood&mdash;I think it is well understood by the House and it would be well if it were understood by the people&mdash;that the Prices Advisory Body was established only with the intention of advising.  I do not know in how many cases the Minister has refused to accept their advice when they advised increases.  The cost of living has certainly gone to such an extent that people can no longer endeavour to exist here.  The general complaint is coming not alone from the housewife <Col N="942" /> but from every section of the people.</P>
    <P>The Department of Industry and Commerce is, in the main, responsible for the administratin of Bord na Móna. I want to take this opportunity of saying, from my experience, that quite a good deal of useful work has been undertaken by Bord na Móna.  I think the Minister would be well advised to instruct that body to give more consideration to the question of increased rates of pay for its employees.  Bord na Móna displays advertisements in all labour exchanges and Garda stations asking people to come forward and take part in its turf development schemes.  Now, the rates of pay are not attractive.  In my constituency we have Bord na Móna hostels and some consideration should be given to the high charges for food and lodging that the bog workers availing of these hostels are asked to pay.  I think these workers are being charged too much for their food and lodging.  In my opinion, as many more men could be employed by Bord na Móna as are being employed at the present time but labour is not coming forward because the pay is not attractive.  The Minister and Bord na Móna are asking these workers to engage in work of national importance and, for that reason, they should set a headline in relation to the payment of proper rates of wages for the work.  A good deal of dissatisfaction exists in that respect at the present moment.</P>
    <P>This is the first opportunity we have had of debating the Department of Industry and Commerce since last year.  When he is replying, I hope the Minister will make some statement in connection with the sale of the Tramore Hydro.  This House has been made aware of the grave dissatisfaction that exists as a result of the Minister failing to keep his promise.  The Minister gave an assurance to the town commissioners&mdash;the chairman of that body is a supporter of the present Government&mdash;that the hydro, the casino, the pitch and putt course and the boys' club would not be disposed of by An Bord Fáilte except by public auction, thereby giving to public-spirited citizens interested an opportunity of purchasing this establishment <Col N="943" /> and its amenities.  Yet, approximately 60 acres of land, together with the buildings and amenities thereon, were sold privately to three gentlemen in County Waterford for a sum of £22,500. The erection of this hydro cost £67,000. Does the Minister not consider it very bad business to sell that building privately for £22,500 and to throw in the boys' club, the pitch and putt course and the casino?  I want to protest as strongly now as I did two days ago against public property being sold by private treaty.  I think it is wrong that the Minister in this particular instance should have denied the public an opportunity of purchasing, particularly when an undertaking had been given that, if the property was changing hands, it would be sold by public auction.  A number of people were anxious to purchase the property and proof has been forthcoming that they were willing to pay more than £22,500 for it.  I suggest it was not in the interests of the development of this particular tourist resort that this property was bought.  It was bought for the purpose of swelling the purses of private individuals and the Minister had no right either to permit or allow that to happen.  The Minister and the House in common decency should have permitted the holding of a public inquiry into the whole transaction. There is still a distasteful odour emanating from that transaction and the citizens of Waterford and the adjoining counties view the whole transaction with a certain amount of suspicion.  The Minister's name has not been too clean in this respect.  He gave an undertaking to the Tramore Town Commissioners and he ought to tell us now why he did not keep that undertaking to ensure that the sale would be carried out by public auction.  Public property of this kind should never be permitted to change hands except through the medium of public auction.</P>
    <P>With regard to An Tóstal, this is the greatest farce and the greatest cod ever inflicted on this country.  I regard it as a huge joke and a waste of public money.  We have many thousands of people unemployed.  We have many <Col N="944" /> people who have to cut down on their three meals per day because of rising prices.  Yet here we have public money spent on a so-called festival&mdash; An Tóstal.  An Tóstal this year was a complete flop.  Indeed, it was a disaster.  The Minister told us that the purpose for which An Tóstal was inaugurated was to attract more visitors, to provide them with more amusements and with a certain variety of entertainment throughout the country.  What do we find?  We find that there are no figures available as to the number of visitors who came here for An Tóstal.  We have been given certain information as to the number of people who travelled by sea and air during the month of April, 1952, and the month of April, 1953. An Tóstal took place on the 4th April, 1953, to the 26th April, 1953.  I am told that huge sums of money were spent advertising An Tóstal in the United States of America, in South America, in Canada, in England and on the Continent. The Department of Industry and Commerce was expecting people to flock into the country from the 4th to 26th April, 1953.  What happened? In 1952 we had 49,780 people coming into this country by sea and air.  This year during the same period we had 48,448 people coming into this country by sea and air during the month of April&mdash;approximately 1,000 fewer people.  In April, 1952, 37,400 passengers came by rail from the Six Counties. Only 34,587 passengers arrived for An Tóstal.  Despite all the money that was spent in the Six Counties, England and America in an effort to bring people to this country, a fewer number of people came than came the year before.  An Bord Fáilte and the Department of Industry and Commerce almost sent free air and rail tickets. An invitation was sent all over the world to Ireland of the Welcomes. Despite the fact that thousands of pounds were spent on advertising, fewer people came than came the year before.</P>
    <P>Posters were displayed advertising An Tóstal.  Country printers estimate the cost of a poster as being £1 to 30/-. It was a disgrace, a scandal and a waste of public money.  Certain job <Col N="945" /> hunters were given jobs by An Bord Fáilte for the purpose of fostering An Tóstal&mdash;fostering nothing.</P>
    <P>In April of this year there were 4,168 fewer passengers than in April of the year before.  We can judge the benefits that An Tóstal brought to the country by studying the returns of passengers leaving the State in April, 1952, and in April, 1953.  In April, 1952, 50,200 passengers left by sea and air.  In April, 1953, 50,533 left by the same routes.</P>
    <P>It is quite clear that the Tóstal of last year was a complete flop.  The energies of those who were engaged in publicising An Tóstal should be devoted to something else, such as price control or the provision of employment or some other scheme that would be of national benefit.</P>
    <P>No figures are available that would indicate the total expenditure incurred by local authorities, such as Cork, Dublin, Limerick and Waterford Corporations, in respect of An Tóstal. There are no records whatever of the amount of money that State corporations, such as the E.S.B. and private local Tóstal committees, spent on this project.</P>
    <P>The Tánaiste, in reply to a question in this House some time ago, gave particulars of the moneys spent by An Bord Fáilte, Fógra Fáilte, the I.T.A. and the Board of Works.  An Bord Fáilte spent £30,000.  On top of that, Fógra Fáilte spent £47,000.  The I.T.A. and the Board of Works also provided moneys for this purpose.  The total was £79,700.  That money was spent on the greatest codology this country has ever experienced.  While all this money was spent last year in respect of An Tóstal, the Department of Industry and Commerce tell us that there were additional moneys spent by other Government Departments.  The Department of Defence provided large sums of money for the purposes of An Tóstal.</P>
    <P>The Government should give up that codology.  We all want to attract tourists.  We want to care for and foster the tourist industry.  But you cannot fool the people.  It is a waste of time and energy to have a Tóstal <Col N="946" /> and the Department of Industry and Commerce would be very well advised to cut out this sort of rot.</P>
    <P>Instead of having a Tóstal it might be better to encourage by way of financial assistance small hotels in the country to carry out improvements. The Minister has in mind schemes of loans and grants for hotels.  If that £80,000 of public money that we are told was spent on An Tóstal last year were devoted to grants to various country hotels it would be much better employed.</P>
    <P>The E.S.B., Bord na Móna, An Bord Fáilte, Fógra Fáilte and C.I.E. all come within the Minister's Department. Each of these concerns has its own publicity manager and its own method of publicity.  Would it not be wise to have one section of the Department of Industry and Commerce for publicity which would carry out publicity for Aer Lingus, An Bord Fáilte, Fógra Fáilte, Bord na Móna and C.I.E.?  A fabulous amount of taxpayers money is spent on publicity by all these concerns.  If there were one section of the Department dealing with publicity there could be wiser administration and a better system of organisation.  Very little publicity is carried out by Bord na Móna, despite the fact that a very big sum is provided for that purpose.  We do see posters displaying sleans and healthy bog workers cutting turf.  We see the Aer Lingus advertisements and those of An Bord Fáilte.  We see the Irish tourist bulletin issued by An Bord Fáilte.  We see other advertisements issued by the Tourist Board.  We see the C.I.E. advertisements.  There should be a director of publicity in the Department of Industry and Commerce who would be responsible for publicity for all the concerns that come under the Department of Industry and Commerce.</P>
    <P>I do not give very much for the publicity carried out by An Bord Fáilte. It is not very attractive.  The most attractive publicity that we have is that of Aer Lingus.  Aer Lingus publicity is good.  That is indisputable. That is so because the publicity director of Aer Lingus is a man who <Col N="947" /> knows his job, a man who has ideas, and who employs the proper methods.</P>
    <P>I would suggest that the Minister should call a conference of the publicity managers of C.I.E., Bord na Móna and all the other concerns under his Department under the chairmanship of the director of publicity for Aer Lingus who seems to have a thorough knowledge of his job and, consequently, the publicity campaign undertaken by Aer Lingus has brought benefits to the company.</P>
    <P>I have seen the booklet issued by Aer Lingus under the title <i>Let Us Go to Ireland.</i>  It is most attractive and in very simple language.  It contains very elaborate scenes of Collinstown Airport, a map giving details of Dublin Airport, historical places and tourist centres, such as Glendalough, Cashel, Blarney, the Vale of Avoca, Kells, the Giant's Causeway, the Cliffs of Moher, Killarney, Glengarriff and other places.  Surely to goodness if the publicity manager of Aer Lingus was for two years in charge of An Bord Fáilte, the I.T.A. or C.I.E., an endless amount of beneficial publicity could be given, and I recommend very seriously to the Minister for Industry and Commerce that he should reorganise or advise to be reorganised the whole system of publicity, as far as the companies of a semi-State nature for which he has any responsibility are concerned; and if the same publicity was given in the same manner and under the same wise administration to C.I.E. as it is given to Aer Lingus I venture to say that it would be a considerable asset to C.I.E.  Again, if you had the same publicity given to An Bord Fáilte as we have for Aer Lingus I believe it would be of considerable benefit and very great advantage.  There is one interesting booklet, published recently by An Bord Fáilte, of plans to encourage local effort and enterprise in the development of the tourist industry. That is a very short and simple booklet and, in my opinion, has been the best of the publicity produced that we have seen for An Bord Fáilte.  In the interests of proper publicity some <Col N="948" /> steps should be taken towards bringing the publicity of all the companies under the Department of Industry and Commerce under the direction of one director.</P>
    <P>I fail entirely to see why, when I raised recently, by way of parliamentary question, the opening by the Minister of the Córas Tráchtála Teoranta offices in Montreal, there was so much secrecy about the staffing of that place and the cost of it.  I am completely dissatisfied with all the explanations the Minister for Industry and Commerce gave me on the 26th October here in the House when I asked some questions relating to the cost of the new office and why this office was really necessary.  Have we not our legation or our embassy in that country?  Why should we have numerous different offices in those countries?  If our embassies or our legations are doing their job well and properly, there is no necessity for other offices to be established there.  When this House voted funds for Córas Tráchtála Teoranta, and when it is under the responsibility of the Minister, it was only right and proper that this House should be given some idea of the cost of the erection and construction and the furnishing of that building.  I also inquired recently, in connection with the Montreal office, the total number of the staff that was employed there.  I further inquired as to who was in charge and the rates of pay to each of the employees who are employed in that office, and I asked who made the appointments.  I further asked what qualifications were required. I got two lines of a reply when the Minister said that he had no information about the day-to-day administration of Córas Tráchtála Teoranta, and that the information sought was not available in his Department. But there was something in his Department when he was going to open it.  There was something in his Department about the office when he used it for the purpose of an enjoyable tour at the taxpayers' expense in Montreal.  He knew about the office in Montreal when he wanted to visit Montreal; and I respectfully say this, that there have been certain appointments made in connection with the Montreal <Col N="949" /> office which were not in accordance with public decency.</P>
    <P>I cannot for the life of me see why the Minister for Industry and Commerce is refusing to give this House or to give the taxpayers of this country the information concerning the expenditure on this office in Montreal.  I further fail to see why he should fail to tell us who is in charge of the Montreal office and what are the qualifications of the gentleman for its administration and full charge.  The Minister should know that all this information can be got and will be obtained through other channels but he tells this House that he has no information at his disposal concerning the day-to-day administration of this office in Montreal.  He should have information at his disposal and for this Córas Tráchtála office in Montreal there should be weekly returns to his Department of its activities and a diary kept giving an account of the day-to-day administration of that office.  Have we any idea of what money is going to be spent?  Have we any idea of what benefits this office in Montreal is going to bring?  Have we any idea of the qualifications of the personnel of that office, and are we satisfied that our money is being spent on the employment of the right and proper type of citizen to be employed in Montreal in that office?  I think they are reasonable questions.  I cannot see for the life of me why the Minister fails to give the House that information.  I think that the House is entitled to that information and I think, further, that the Minister has good and sound reasons for refusing to give the House the information concerning the Montreal office, and for that purpose I can say that there are people in this country who view with very great alarm the manner in which the Montreal office has been surrounded with great secrecy.</P>
    <P>Again in connection with the Montreal office, why was it necessary for the Minister himself to go to open it? Could no representative in Montreal of the Irish Government, either a high-ranking officer or some member of the staff of the embassy in Canada, <Col N="950" /> not have performed the official opening? Could the office not have opened without this ceremony, with the Minister's speech that was published in all the daily papers and from Radio Eireann before he made his speech at all, a speech that was given full publicity? If my memory serves me right the office was opened on the 29th and the Minister's speech was published on 28th, both from Radio Éireann and on all the papers.  How do we know he made that speech?  The Minister's explanation for the publication of his speech in Montreal before he made the speech at all has not been satisfactory. I think that this office in Montreal is a waste of time, and it will be interesting to know as years will go on what benefits this office is likely to bring.</P>
    <P>As a matter of information I would be very interested to hear from the Department the amount of dollars spent by the Government for the purchase of prunes and raisins form California. I am told that prunes and raisins from California have been purchased this year.  During the term of the inter-Party Government raisins and currants and other dried fruit were secured from the sterling areas.  They were secured from Greece, Turkey and the Middle East.  But since Fianna Fáil took office the raisins from the Middle East or from Turkey or from Greece would not be up to the standard of Fianna Fáil. They want seedless prunes and raisins from California; and whilst we see dollars being spent on prunes and raisins from California, we see the police having to control the queues for unemployment benefit in the City of Dublin.  Is it not a fact that during the years 1948, 1949 and 1950 no dollars were spent on prunes and raisins from California, and it was only after 1951 that they were so spent?</P>
    <P>We are told that great discretion has to be used in the allocation of dollars.  We are told that there is a shortage of dollars for the purchase of excavators and other types of machinery that are required both by the Department of Agriculture and by the Board of Works.  We are told that there is a shortage of dollars for essentials that have to be imported <Col N="951" /> from the dollar market.  Yet here we see that dollars were allocated for the purchase of prunes, raisins and dried fruit from California, while at the same time, ample supplies of the same types of fruit can freely be obtained from the Middle East for sterling and without having to expend as much as one dollar on their purchase.  But no: the raisins and dried fruit had to be purchased from California by the Fianna Fáil Government.  I want to stress that these supplies were secured from the Middle East for sterling by the inter-Party Government and that since Fianna Fáil resumed office it would appear that the fruit from the Middle East is not good enough and that it must be obtained seedless from California.</P>
    <P>It was interesting to hear Deputy Dr. Esmonde to-day raise the matter of the price of pigs in relation to the price of bacon.  I understand that the Lower Prices Council have petitioned the Minister for Industry and Commerce to have an inquiry into the price of bacon.  I wonder if that inquiry will be held.  It is extraordinary that the price of bacon should be so high. Certainly, the price of rashers, ham and bacon merits close investigation and a full inquiry.  I hope and trust that the question that has been raised by the Lower Prices Council will be given the closest possible consideration and that the inquiry will be held.</P>

      <P>I want to join now in the protest which Deputy Dr. ffrench-O'Carroll made in this House this time 12 months ago, and again since then, against the rise in the price of bacon.  I hope that now that Deputy Dr. ffrench-O'Carroll is in a position to do so, he will use his efforts to effect a reduction in the price of bacon&mdash;a reduction which he advocated very strongly and in respect of which he stated he would use his influence and his good offices to bring about.  I hope that, now that he has the opportunity, he will use his influence and his good offices towards seeing that there will be a proper and rigid price control.  I think that these were the very words he used when he was speaking about the matter.  As I have said, Deputy Dr. ffrench-O'Carroll is now in a position to do so and I hope that we shall hear more <Col N="953" /> about it from him on this Estimate, as we heard about it last year.</P>
      <P>The Minister for Industry and Commerce made a promise some time ago that a biscuit factory would be established in Ballina.  On more than one occasion he made that promise to the people of that district.  To his knowledge, a list of all the unemployed and the semi-unemployed in the area was taken with a view to securing jobs in the proposed Ballina biscuit factory.  Numerous applications for the management of the factory were received.  Local people were canvassed in connection with the sale of the Ballina biscuits.  The people in the area were told that the Ballina biscuits would be superior quality biscuits and that they would be sold at a reasonable price.  Everybody in the West of Ireland was smacking his lips with great longing and desire to taste the Ballina biscuits.  What happened? Not even a dog biscuit was made in Ballina.</P>

      <P>The present Tánaiste and Minister for Industry and Commerce has the extraordinary knack of being able to promise this, that and the other and then to go away after having left his hearers under the impression that these promises would be carried out.  That knack is a great gift which very few politicians have but the present Tánaiste and Minister for Industry and Commerce has it to a very marked degree. He can promise a thing and actually make his hearers believe that they have it.  Only when they come to their true senses and give the matter calm consideration, on an occasion which is not graced by the Tánaiste's presence, do they discover that it was only just another mere promise by the Tánaiste which was made in his very highly persuasive manner.  They then sadly realise that it was no more than just another wild dream and promise.  Is the Minister not ashamed of himself and this type of behaviour?  Is he not ashamed to promise industries which he knows will not be established and which he knows there is no intention <Col N="954" /> of establishing?  Is he not ashamed to make these promises when he knows that his Department have no intention whatever of implementing them?</P>
      <P>In connection with the Minister's administration of his Department during the past year I want to take this opportunity of saying that I protest vigorously against the behaviour of the Minister in going into his Department and getting a certain file and withdrawing from that file a certain letter and reading the contents of that letter at a public meeting.  I want to condemn the disgraceful tactics of the Minister for Industry and Commerce at Avoca.  He stayed in his office until the sun was rising in the morning, delving through the various files in connection with the Avoca mines and, with the aid of a full office staff working during the hours of the night, he successfully placed his finger on a document that was addressed to his predecessor in office.  With the greatest pleasure and delight the Minister proceeded to Avoca the next morning and addressed an assembly there and read out the contents of that personal letter that was addressed to his predecessor in office&mdash;a letter in connection with the Avoca mines.</P>

      <P>It was despicable, disgraceful, unbecoming and unworthy of any decent Minister of State, and I advise the Minister to dissociate himself in the future from the disgraceful tactics in which he has partaken in disclosing the contents of private documents addressed to him or to his predecessor by reading them in public at the church gates and seeking to capture a miserable vote by misrepresenting the contents of the private letter addressed to his Department. These tactics did not, and will not work, and it is a nice thing to know that there is a little self-respect and decency left in some people in public life.  It gives those of us who are in public life some encouragement to follow the path of honesty, dignity <Col N="955" /> and straightforwardness.  When one sees the mean, cheap and low tactics of the second in command in this country, it makes one ask oneself what depths the country has fallen into when it entrusts the destinies of the country to these people.</P>

      <P>All the correspondence in connection with the Avoca mines was not read by the Minister when he visited Avoca.  He wanted only a particular letter, and, having secured it, he went on to quote paragraphs from it with a view to creating ill-feeling and discontent between good neighbours in a friendly and what is probably the most beautiful spot in the Garden of Ireland.  The Minister would be well advised to examine his conscience in this respect and realise that he failed to defeat the people, that he failed as the sponsor of the revival of bitterness in that area, particularly amongst the workers engaged in the Avoca development.  That has been proved beyond yea or nay by the result of the election in Wicklow.</P>
      <P>The Minister took great pride yesterday in announcing that a number of new factories are to be established.  I hope he will bear in mind the growing demand, and the ever-increasing determination behind that demand, for decentralisation of industries.  Only to-day a question was asked in connection with the shortage of tyres and the delay in procuring them.  I had the impression that Messrs. Dunlop were in a position to cope with all the demands for rubber and tyres and the Lord Mayor of Cork has very graciously said that there is room for will.  I believe that there is room for development in the rubber industry and that no one firm should have a monopoly of supply.  Encouragement should be given to the establishment of an alternative tyre manufacturing company.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>If they can, I do not see the necessity for Deputy Esmonde's question.  I am very reliably informed that there is a shortage of tyres and rubber at present, and, if that is the case, there is room in the City of Cork for further development of the industry. I hope the Industrial Development Authority are actively engaged with regard to the decentralisation of industry. We have all the industries together here in the City of Dublin but, while that is so and while there may be records of some few more being employed in industry in the city, it is quite evident that there is a huge unemployment problem to be tackled. What is the use of endeavouring to solve that problem on the lines or solving it in Dublin and encouraging hundreds of people to come up from the country to the city immediately after?  You are really robbing the country of its manpower, and I say that the Government would be well advised to insist that future industries be established in rural Ireland.</P>
      <P>My own town of Mountmellick was the first town in Ireland to engage in the sugar and beet industry.  It was once known as the Manchester of Ireland&mdash;there were a beet factory, a distillery, a candle and soap factory and numerous other factories there. To-day the buildings which once housed humming machinery are rookeries for crows.  The last industry in that town was the Mountmellick Maltings, an industry which was closed down under the administration of Fianna Fáil.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The one industry in the town now is the Mountmellick Products, which is liver oil, extract of malt and malt tablets.  I suggest that the Department should provide the necessary facilities to make a market available in this country for the products of that factory and that imports of commodities similar to those being manufactured <Col N="957" /> in that factory should be cut down.  I suggest also that further development be undertaken with regard to the sugar and beet industry because in that industry we have the raw materials coming from the land of Ireland for the benefit of the farmers. If we encourage the production of beet and pay attractive prices for the crop I feel sure that there is room for further development of it.</P>
    <P>It would be well that we should hear what improvement has taken place in the Tuam area in connection with supplies of beet to the beet factory for conversion into sugar.  Everybody who has any idea at all with regard to the establishment of an industry to suit a particular area, the raw materials being at the door of the industry, knows that the town of Tuam was no place for a beet factory in the first instance.  We do not object to the factory being in Tuam but these factories should be established in the areas where the beet is grown.  The Mallow factory is in the right area; the Carlow factory is in the right area, as is the Thurles factory, but when we see beet having to be brought from Stradbally and Portarlington, in the County of Laois, only 18 miles from Carlow, to keep the Tuam factory going, it suggests there is something radically wrong somewhere.</P>
    <P>The people in the immediate vicinity of Tuam will not grow beet to give employment in the local beet factory, and, irrespective of any representation any Deputy may make, the Minister should take it on himself to go down to that district and say: &ldquo;If beet is not grown, we are going to close the factory&rdquo; and make the people grow the necessary beet.  Let them be well paid for it and, if necessary, encourage the growing of beet in the area by an increased price compared with the price in other areas, the difference being made up by not having to pay the cost of transport of beet from the Carlow area to the Tuam area.</P>
    <P>I am glad Deputy Davin is here at the moment because he knows, from his very long and valuable experience <Col N="958" /> as a representative of the constituency &mdash;I think he represented the constituency in the year I was born&mdash;the amount of propaganda being carried on at present in connection with the worsted mills at Portlaoise and Salts (Ireland) Limited, at Tullamore.  Some time ago, there appeared in the papers a note that 500 mill workers employed by Salts (Ireland), Limited, were on short time and all the blame for that situation was thrown on the inter-Party Government.  Now the Minister goes down there and tells the local people that it is as a result of his efforts, and his efforts alone, that the industries are going in these districts. The Minister deserves no credit whatever for bringing Salts (Ireland) Limited, to Portlaoise.</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Brennan Mr. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>Is that what Salts (Ireland) say?</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="OliverJFlanagan" hpid="Mr. O. Flanagan Mr. O. Flanagan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>I say it.  Deputy Davin is the man responsible for it, in the first instance. and that is well known and appreciated locally.  If the Minister were interested, he should be examining the possibilities of giving greater and further encouragement to extensions of both the Portlaoise and Tullamore mills, so that a greater amount of employment would be given.  If he were really interested, he would have used his influence to have the carding and combing factory erected convenient to the Salts (Ireland), Limited, concern at Tullamore and the Irish Worsted Mills at Portlaoise, but that combing factory was erected elsewhere, in Dublin.  If Fianna Fáil wanted to show that they were definitely interested in the promotion of the textile industries in Laois-Offaly, they would have given additional facilities to the promoters of the industry for the establishment in that area of the carding and combing factory which would have served the Portlaoise and Tullamore factories and I recommend that the Industrial Development Authority give consideration to the establishment in the not too distant future of the necessary <Col N="959" /> carding and combing industry convenient to the two factories in that part of my constituency.</P>
      <P>In connection with the production of Irish coal, there has been a good deal of dissatisfaction in Irish coal mines and we have had no very clear statement from the Minister with regard to the matter.  Coal is produced at the mines at Wolfhill, in my constituency, and it is not very many weeks ago that a meeting was called of all the workers to ascertain who was responsible for the short time and slackness of work in these coal mines.  If serious consideration is to be given to the development of our mineral resources, very special consideration should be given to the development, to a fuller and greater extent, of our coal mines. We got no satisfactory reply whatever as to why the men at Wolfhill coal mines were put on short time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We were told that no market was available for the coal already mined&mdash; that was one excuse.  We were told, and the Minister has it on his records, that the services of quite a large number of experienced miners at Wolfhill were dispensed with.  They were put on two and three days a week work and told to go to Athy Employment Exchange and sign on for unemployment benefit for the remaining two or three days, while, at the same time, English and Welsh coal mines had advertisements in all the daily papers asking for experienced miners to apply for employment, with very attractive rates of pay and a guarantee of fulltime and permanent employment.  In addition to the attractiveness of the rates of pay and the guarantee of fulltime employment, housing facilities convenient to the mines were made available for these workers, and from coal-mining districts of County Laois, the coal-mining areas of Arigna and of Castlecomer, there embarked into the emigrant ship numbers of workers for the purpose of working in Welsh or British coal mines to produce coal for British industries, or to produce coal to be sent back here to be burned in the ranges and fireplaces of the wellto-do snobs who would not burn turf and who looked on it with disgust.  We <Col N="960" /> see the best of our Irish miners, the hardest and toughest of those engaged in that work, men with long experience of mining&mdash;and it takes years to qualify as a properly skilled miner who knows his job&mdash;leaving the country to work in these British and Welsh coal mines.  We are told that no consideration whatever was given to keeping those skilled miners or the best apprentices at home to help in the coal mines of Laois, Kilkenny and Roscommon.</P>
    <P>To-day we have the best of these miners engaged in the production of coal in the coal mines of Great Britain, while here at home we have a market for our anthracite.  A good deal of the coal produced in the Wolfhill colliery could and should be used in the beet factories and in various branches of industry.  A certain amount of it could be used in our hospitals and in industries where there are extensive boilers.  I am sure that a substantial order could be obtained for some of that Irish anthracite from C.I.E.  If the Irish market is not there for that coal, the man in charge of this Department has the remedy.  The remedy that he has was very vivid in his mind in 1932 when he was travelling over the whole country shouting: &ldquo;Burn everything English but their coal.&rdquo; Of course the days when he was shouting that are gone.  Those days served their useful purpose; they laid the foundations of the happy 17 or 18 years that he has occupied the office of Minister.</P>
    <P>There is no question now of giving a guarantee of employment to the Irish coal miner.  Instead of that we see the coal miners in the Wolfhill area working only three days per week and the majority of our skilled miners sending home money from England in order to keep the lifeblood flowing in the veins of their wives and families and relatives, while at the doors of these people we have the mines and the coal. We have a market for that coal if it were properly provided for.  The Minister has not given the serious attention to this problem that should have been given to it.</P>
    <P>I feel that I am entitled to be told why the men are working short time <Col N="961" /> in the coal mines in my constituency. I feel bound to ask why there are fewer workers employed there than there were two and a half or three years ago.  I think I have a right to ask why unlimited supplies of coal are allowed into the turf areas by the Department of Industry and Commerce while no encouragement has been given either to the production on a large scale or the consumption on a large scale of turf in the Midlands. The Minister knows quite well, Deputy Davin knows quite well, and I am sure Deputy Larkin, who is associated with turf production in another capacity in every part of the country, must know that there is no employment given to-day by the private producers of turf and that turf is not produced on a large scale except by Bord na Móna.</P>
    <P>In order to develop our bogs to the fullest possible extent and to give employment during the emergency large sums of money were spent usefully in producing turf.  The bogs of Ireland were alive with industry, the men of Ireland had work at their own doors on their own bogs developing what God gave them to develop, their own bogs.</P>
    <P>If the Department of Industry and Commerce has a scheme to develop the hotel industry and the tourist industry by loans and grants to hotel owners, why can they not try to develop the turf industry by grants and loans to private turf producers? Private turf producers should have a market provided for their turf and an organisation should be established whereby either loans would be advanced to them for the cutting and saving of turf and the payment of employees to produce the season's crop or grants paid on the tonnage of turf produced and on the record of employment given.  Does the Minister not think that that would be a scheme worthy of consideration?</P>
    <P>In areas where we have the power stations, such as Allenwood and Portarlington and the power station under construction in another part of my constituency at Boorha, would it not be wise that a certain amount of turf should be bought from the local <Col N="962" /> people each year for consumption in these power stations?  I think the private turf producer during the emergency was the best and the most generous employer that the Irish worker had during the emergency. Some consideration should be given to encouraging work in rural Ireland and to keep our people there.  In areas where there is no industrial employment work should be provided by encouraging private producers to produce turf.  It is the Minister's job to get a market for that turf and not ours.</P>
    <P>If the Minister is anxious to cooperate in the development of our bogs some consideration should be given to the encouragement of the private producers in the parish of Rhode, near Edenderry, or Raha and other districts where there is no other source of employment, where there is no land suitable for tillage and cultivation, where there are the finest and best bogs in Ireland, and where the people are setting an example by producing turf and giving employment but find that there is no contract for them and that the surplus turf is left on their hands.  The Department of Industry and Commerce should interest themselves actively in the provision of a market for all this turf.</P>
    <P>The Minister tells us that he is going ahead with the transatlantic air service, again at the expense of the taxpayer.  We all knew that the Government were going to revive that matter, because the transatlantic air service is the twin brother of Dublin Castle.  Who will benefit by this service? Is this the right time to go ahead with it when there are 80,000 people unemployed in the country, when we have wages kept down, and when we have an intolerable cost of living?  There is something else worry air service.  They are more concerned ing the people besides a transatlantic with where they are going to get a day's work, where the next meal is going to come from and the price of essential commodities in order to keep body and soul together, than they are with seeing that film stars, American bankers and continental businessmen are provided with air liners and airtivation <Col N="963" /> craft to take them from New York to Shannon for the purpose of having a meal at Shannon and then leaving for London, Paris or the Continent.  I think this is no time for us to develop the transatlantic air service.  If we have money to spend on such a service, rather should it be spent on restoring the subsidies on bread, butter, tea and sugar.  It should not be put into the clouds for the purpose of bringing film stars, bankers and others who would avail of the transatlantic air service.</P>
    <P>Is there even a small percentage of our people ever going to sit in one of those liners?  Has not a very small percentage of our people ever seen Shannon Airport?  We are not against the transatlantic air service but we believe in putting first things first.  I would be the first man in this country to recommend the transatlantic air service if we had full-time employment, a decent standard of living and if the cost of living was at least some points below some countries and not eight points ahead of them.</P>
    <P>The present Government are more concerned with living in the clouds than they are with living in the country.  They are more concerned with putting thousands of the taxpayers' money into the clouds over the Atlantic between Shannon and the United States than they are with providing work in Dublin and giving employment and a decent standard of living to our people at home.  I protest strongly and in a most determined manner against the expenditure of public money on a transatlantic air service while we have 80,000 unemployed and while we have the highest cost of living in the world.  I think it is uncalled for and unnecessary.</P>
    <P>What good is the transatlantic air service to the thousands who are unemployed to-day?  What good is it going to be to the mother of a large hungry family?  I think that the Government has at last reached the committal stages of insanity in this respect and that it is time to call a halt.  It is time that some determined protest came from the people, and the only protest that can come must come <Col N="964" /> from the elected representatives of the people in this House.</P>
    <P>If the truth were known the majority of the members of this House believe that instead of spending thousands on a transatlantic air service to provide speed for millionaires and film stars it should be utilised to give decent employment to our own people at home.</P>
    <P>The question of an airfield for Cork has been spoken of here on very many occasions.  We were told that it was decided to provide an airfield for Cork but that the site was not definitely decided upon.  Is it not late in the day that the Government, after their long years of administration, decided to establish an airfield for Cork?  Was there not always a case for an airfield for Cork?  I hope and trust that no time will be lost in providing the airfield for Cork.</P>
    <P>In addition to that, it would be of very great benefit if some of the funds which are about to be spent on the transatlantic air service were spent on providing the most suitable and the best-equipped airfield that can possibly be provided for Cork.</P>

We would not be waiting until now to arrive at the question of the site for Cork airfield. It would have been done.  Perhaps, Deputy Fanning is looking for an airport in Newport?</P>

      <P>Since the Ceann Comhairle has given me permission to raise the question of the Russian timber on this Estimate, I will now deal with that.  I want to take this opportunity of protesting in the strongest possible manner against any trading whatever between this country and Russia.  On the one hand, we see the Department of External Affairs sending messages to the Head of the Catholic Church and to the Irish <Col N="966" /> Hierarchy expressing the Government's sympathy and regret at the persecution of the Bishops and Hierarchy in countries under Russian jurisdiction; and, on the other hand. the Department of Industry and Commerce permit Russian timber to be brought into this country.  I think that is wrong.  I think that it should be stopped, and if the Government were sincere in their protests against Communistic activities, they would not permit a Russian ship to enter any of our ports.  They would not permit the entry of any Russian timber.  Our trade unions should take steps to boycott the handling of Russian timber.</P>
      <P>The customs authorities should take steps to have a complete boycott of Russian ships and should not take hand, act or part in the handling of Russian timber.  What is the use of Ireland posing as one of the greatest countries in the world in the upholding of the flag of Christianity and saying how determined we are to see that Christianity must live, survive and prosper, while, at the same time, she is taking in timber from Russia?</P>
      <P>The timber that was procured for this country by the inter-Party Government was sold to Belfast by the present Government.  It was procured to build houses for the people in Dublin and the country generally, but to-day it is being economically used for the building of houses in Belfast, thanks to the Fianna Fáil Government. The Fianna Fáil Government have done more to provide cheap timber for housebuilding and shipbuilding and for other essential purposes in Belfast and in the North than anybody else. and by the North I mean the Six Counties which are so much the subject of criticism when it suits the Government.  At the same time, when it suits them they find a market there for timber that was brought here by the inter-Party Government to provide houses for our own people.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We find that we have now reached the stage when the Department of Industry and Commerce stands for Irish citizens trading with the Russians.  The Minister stated in the House yesterday that he would not <Col N="967" /> stop the importation of Russian timber, but if he was doing his duty he would stop it.  It should be stopped and no apology should be offered to anyone for stopping its import.  The names of the companies and dealers purchasing Russian timber should be published so that we might know the use to which this Russian timber is being put.  I think it is a terrible disgrace that in a country like Ireland, which is sending its young men and young women to the four corners of the world to preach and to teach Christianity, an Irish Government should give its support to the purchase of timber, hides and skins from Russia.</P>

They will condemn the Soviet Administraiton and will denounce the persecution of the Church, but at the same time Fianna Fáil say that they will buy their timber&mdash;£85,000 worth of Russian timber.

We know very well that it is going to be very hard to beat the old dog off his track.

      <NameTxt>Mr. O. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>I think it is high time that steps were taken by the Government to cancel all future and outstanding orders and negotiations between this country and Russia.  Further, steps should be taken by the responsible Department to inform those merchants and dealers who are trading with Russia that they should find alternative markets for the purchase of their timber.  I do not think that anyone in this House, or in the country, would object to that.  I think everyone would commend it as the action that a Catholic Government would be expected to take.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Constitution says that the recognised faith of this country is the faith of the Roman Catholic Church. Yet, despite that Article, here we are trading with the greatest enemy of the Church.  I think it is scandalous and disgraceful.  I think that every possible step should be taken to bring pressure on the responsible Minister to see that trading between this country and Russia should be immediately brought to a standstill.  If we are sincere in our protest, we should prevent the landing of a Russian ship at any of our ports, dissociate ourselves in every way by cancelling orders and thus fulfil our obligations as a Christian country apart from a Catholic <Col N="969" /> country, and end all our dealings and communications with Russia.</P>
    <P>I want to deal with one other branch of industry, that is, the manufacture of clay drainage pipes.  On the 27th October last, a statement appeared in the <i>Irish Press</i> that the production of clay pipes is far below the demand and that until home production is considerably stepped up the Department are importing these pipes from Holland and also receiving quantities from the Six Counties.  When it suits the Government to skin and fleece the Six Counties they do it, but what do we find?  They are importing from the Six Counties clay drainage pipes for work under the land rehabilitation scheme, the land drainage scheme and for sewerage schemes.  The <i>Irish Press</i> gave full publicity to the fact that these pipes are coming from Holland, that we cannot produce sufficient to meet our requirements, and that because the production of pipes has fallen so low they must be secured from either the Six Counties or Holland.</P>
    <P>We in the inter-Party Government who were responsible, and still are responsible, for the employment given under the land rehabilitation project, rightly boast of our achievements in that regard.  Under that scheme, thousands upon thousands of clay drainage pipes are being used, which means that that scheme is providing employment indirectly for workers in the Six Counties.  It is doing more than that.  It is providing employment for workers in Holland while, at the same time, in the Twenty-Six Counties there is unemployment in the same industry.</P>
    <P>The statement in the <i>Irish Press</i> has been denied completely by the Slane Brick Company, Limited, no truth whatever in it.  What steps are the Government going to take, not in the future, but this very evening, to see that the import of clay drainage pipes from the Six Counties is stopped?  We have the unemployed men in the Twenty-Six Counties singing the &ldquo;Soldier's Song,&rdquo; while we are keeping the lads in the Six counties in employment to sing &ldquo;God Save the Queen.&rdquo;</P>

    <Speaker pid="OliverJFlanagan" hpid="Mr. O. Flanagan Mr. O. Flanagan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>It cannot be denied that they are the subjects of a foreign power and that they have often stated that they do not want to have anything to do with us.  Even though the Six Counties would be our nearest friends for trade relationship, why in the first instance do we have to go even further than the Six Counties and import drainage pipes from Holland? Is there not an avenue wide open for the Minister for Industry and Commerce, first of all, to explore the possibilities of extending and developing the clay pipe manufacturing industry in this country, of giving increased employment to the existing industries that are engaged in manufacture of pipes for drainage schemes and secondly, to see that when the Irish farmer is going to drain his land by the assistance of funds provided by an Irish Government, at least they have pipes draining that land made and manufactured by Irishmen in their own country?  When I say that, I mean under the jurisdiction of Dáil Éireann and not in the Six Counties.  I would the Six Counties if we could make it at home in the Twenty-Six Counties. Our own people are nearer and dearer to us than those under another flag. They are the responsibility of another Government, and if our Government were alive to their responsibility in regard to the clay pipe industry they would see to it that the occasion would never have arisen for these imports.</P>
      <P>That is not the worst of it.  In connection with the clay drainage pipe industry the <i>Irish Press</i> states that production is far short of requirements. Not alone is that a falsehood but it is a brazen lie that has been denied publicly by the Slane Brick Company, Limited, who state that not alone have they sufficient pipes ready for the home market, but they have 1,000,000 pipes ready for immediate delivery. Surely this is something that warrants at least meritorious consideration from a responsible Minister.</P>

      <P>Appreciating that very fully and realising the accuracy that is alleged to come from the columns of the <i>Irish Press</i> and the closeness of the <i>Irish Press</i> to the heart of the Minister and his associates, one would expect at least that the <i>Irish Press</i> would have published a report in accordance with facts.  The Minister knows well that the Slane Brick Company, Limited, can supply 1,000,000 clay pipes for land drainage, and whilst they have them in stock millions of pipes are coming from Holland and the Six Counties.  All I ask is that those pipes be stopped from coming in and that the 1,000,000 pipes in the hands of the Slane Brick Company be used immediately.  One would imagine that to be a reasonable request to make to an Irish Minister for Industry and Commerce.</P>
      <P>The position is a little more serious than that.  The attention of the Government has not been directed to the question of the development of the clay pipe industry yesterday or the day before, but the Irish taxpayers' money to the extent of £434,987 was spent on pipes imported from the Continent lately for land drainage schemes and £20,000 was spent on pipes imported from the Six Counties. Frequent representations have been made over a long period, particularly since 1951.</P>

I want to know what vested interests and what influence certain manufacturers in the Six Counties have on the Department to see that the pipes are brought in and that £20,000 of the taxpayers' money should go into the Six Counties instead of being spent in the Twenty-Six Counties.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>Frequent representations were made to the Minister on the subject, and he was informed that the clay goods manufacturers in the country are capable of supplying all the land drainage pipes needed each year.  The Minister got that guarantee on more than one occasion from concerns similar to, and in addition to, the Slane Brick Company, but steps were not taken to cancel the continental orders and Six-County orders and give them to the development of industry in the Twenty-Six Counties.  I have known from my personal contacts that in the clay manufacturing business here there is both short time and unemployment.  When we have unemployment associated with the manufacture of clay drainage pipes, is it any wonder that the unemployment problem is becoming a more and more serious problem day by day?  This is an industry that should be fostered and encouraged rather than allowed to die an angry death through imports from Holland and the Six Counties.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I want to demand the immediate stoppage of the import of clay pipes from Holland and the Six Counties. I want to see that the pipes manufactured by the Slane Brick Company, Limited, are taken off their hands so that more and more men may be employed <Col N="973" /> in that industry producing those land drainage pipes that the company is capable of producing to comply with each year's requirements under the land drainage scheme.</P>

    <Speaker pid="OliverJFlanagan" hpid="Mr. O. Flanagan Mr. O. Flanagan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to go further and say that, in addition to stopping the import of the clay drainage pipes, I would recommend to the Department the encouragement of another branch of the same industry-the stoneware pipe.  In my constituency a very valuable and flourishing industry prevails in the manufacture of glazed stoneware pipes which are suitable for all sewerage schemes throughout the country.  In 1912, when a Royal Commission was set up in Sydney to investigate the failure of some thousands of miles of a sewerage scheme, that commission decided that stoneware glazed pipes were the most suitable that could be used in sewerage schemes because of the fact that the glazing protected the pipe against deterioration by the acid contents.  I respectfully recommend that steps be taken to see that in all sewerage schemes throughout the country stoneware pipes are used for a lasting job and for the promotion of the stoneware pipe industry.  The industry we have in the manufacture of stoneware pipes, glazed specially and suitable for sewerage schemes, is an industry that we are very proud of and that gives great employment in part of my constituency. I hope and trust that that industry will not meet the same fate as the Slane Brick Company has met.  I do not want to see imported every year from Holland or Denmark or the Six Counties, or anywhere else, stoneware glazed pipes for sewerage schemes, as we have an industry in that part of Laois which is competent and capable of supplying such requirements for very many sewerage schemes.  I hope and trust that the stoneware pipe industry will be given more and more encouragement.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not know what steps will be <Col N="974" /> taken towards the provision by the Department of Industry and Commerce of more Irish ships.  The Department would be well advised to develop and expand Irish shipping and some steps should be taken to increase our tonnage for the purpose of trading, etc.</P>
    <P>I am interested in the provision of an additional power station at Mountlucas near Daingean in Offaly. In the opinion of the local people this would be a suitable area in which to erect a power station.  I understand that matter is under consideration at the moment.</P>

That was akin to bringing steel to Sheffield or turf into a bog.  I ask that every step be taken to expedite the arrangements for the erection of this additional power station at Mountlucas</P>
      <P>I protest strongly against the outrageous and unreasonable E.S.B. charges.  On every occasion on which this body makes a request to the Minister for increased charges, that request is acceded to by the Minister without cognisance being taken of the capacity of the consumer to pay.

      <P>The point made by Deputy Hickey may or may not be correct.  I maintain that if electricity was available to a greater extent at a more reasonable price there would be much greater consumption.  The greater the consumption the cheaper the commodity consumed should be. Apparently that is not the case where electricity is concerned.  If a local authority decides that in the interests of the proper administration of public lighting in its area additional public lighting services are required the charges for that will be assessed by the E.S.B. at a wholly outrageous figure.  If the Minister intends to inquire into excessive prices of essential commodities, may I say that there is nothing more essential than lighting and heating?</P>

    <Speaker pid="OliverJFlanagan" hpid="Mr. O. Flanagan Mr. O. Flanagan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>And power.  Our people are becoming more electrically minded, as it were.  More electricity is being used in the home.  More electricity is being used on the land. Rural electrification was supposed to brighten up rural Ireland.  Despite the increased consumption of electricity there is not in contemplation by the E.S.B. any reduction of its present outrageous charges.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesHickey" hpid="Mr. Hickey Mr. Hickey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hickey</NameTxt>
      <P>They cannot help that. It is this House that should do something.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="OliverJFlanagan" hpid="Mr. O. Flanagan Mr. O. Flanagan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>The lead in that matter should come from the Minister for Industry and Commerce.  I appeal to the Minister to inquire into these outrageous E.S.B. charges and to ascertain at the same time what the increased consumption would be if these charges were reduced.  People would take advantage of rural electrification and avail of the services supplied, but they have no guarantee that the price they are charged will be a guaranteed price and that the Minister will not approve of an Order to increase charges which will mean the dismantling of fittings, the removal of facilities and the consequent expenditure involved <Col N="976" /> in such an operation.  Would the Minister give a guarantee now that the existing E.S.B. charges will not be further increased?  If he examines the position, he will find that if charges were reduced there would be a far greater consumption of electricity and we would have none of the numerous cancellations that have taken place in the past in connection with rural electrification in different areas throughout the country.</P>
      <P>There is an even more serious cause for complaint in relation to the overhead charges of the E.S.B.  These overhead charges are daylight robbery. What steps have been taken to investigate these charges?  What steps have been taken to investigate the cost of fittings, the cost of equipment?  These charges have been paid 20 times over by consumers.  Yet the overhead charges remain.  These overhead charges prevent people from availing of the facilities provided by the board. If they were to disappear, or be substantially reduced after a period of years, the consumer would have some consolation.  I would ask the Minister carefully to consider the position of the big industrial consumer and that of a tenant of a two-roomed cottage. There is a continuous burden represented by the payment of overhead charges.  In my opinion, these charges should be wiped out when the cost of the equipment that has been installed has been met.</P>
      <P>In recent years the E.S.B. have brought great benefits to the country. I want to take this opportunity of paying a very high tribute to the chairman, engineering staff and skilled workers of the E.S.B. and to those who have been engaged in the development of power stations and rural electrification.  The chairman of the E.S.B. is a man of very wide experience, knowledge and common sense.  The engineering staff is composed of men of a similar make-up. If there is any section under the Minister's Department staffed by men who know their job, it is the E.S.B. The engineering staff deserve appreciation and gratitude for the valuable work they have done.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The E.S.B. has served a very useful purpose.  It has made progress <Col N="977" /> possible in rural Ireland.  Country churches, parish halls and farms all have a supply of electricity.  The engineering staff endeavour as far as possible to meet the reasonable wishes of the local people.  That is something that deserves a word of appreciation in this House.  I am only sorry that the same business-like methods have not been adopted by other concerns and other branches of industry and commerce as have been so widely adopted by the chairman and board of the E.S.B.  I hope that during the next few years this House will make funds available for further schemes of rural electrification.  There is no necessity to spur a willing horse such as we have in the case of the E.S.B. If further rural electrification schemes are carried out I am sure it will be possible for the E.S.B. in consultation with the senior officers of the Department of Industry and Commerce to arrive at a scheme for the provision of light, heat and power at a more reasonable cost than obtains at present.</P>
    <P>New power stations have been built. Allenwood and the Portarlington stations are in full production.  Other stations are contemplated which will be in production by the end of 1955. When there is sufficient output of electricity I hope it will be possible to give the consumer substantial relief. When that happens the demand for electricity will increase.</P>
    <P>I wish to comment very briefly, if I may, on the administration of Bord na Móna.  Bord na Móna could provide more employment and extend its work. If, with the consent of this House, greater schemes were undertaken in parts of the Midlands, the energies of Bord na Móna could be directed to the development of some hundreds of acres of virgin bog.  I am glad that, after years of persuasion, influence, requests and recommendations and on considerations of merit, Bord na Móna have decided to undertake the development of Garryhinch Bog, which is situated between the towns of Portlaoise and Mountmellick.  To some extent that scheme will help to relieve unemployment in those areas.</P>
    <P>I want to impress upon the Minister <Col N="978" /> the need for the establishment of additional turf camps.  When the turf camp at Boorha, Offaly, closed down&mdash;the local people protested very determinedly against its closing&mdash;we expected that a guarantee would be given by the board that the workers in that camp would be retained in the service and would be transferred to the production of milled peat.  That has not been done to the extent expected locally.</P>
    <P>With all respect to the presence in the House of Deputy Lahiffe, I want to say that I visited Attymon turf scheme quite recently and thought the camp dreary and lonely-looking and not half as attractive as camps sponsored by Bord na Móna elsewhere, even though these could be improved considerably. To me the turf history or the turf development that is in progress in the Attymon district of the Deputy's constituency falls far short of expectations of Bord na Móna in the West.  Its appearance is dreary, very little encouragement could be given to remain there, and Bord na Móna should certainly take steps towards making that area a little more attractive than it is.  It is hardly necessary for me to recommend that the Deputy would actively interest himself in that, because I presume he has already done so, but I only mention for the purposes of the record, that there is room for plenty more improvement in this particular area than in the other areas that I have had the pleasure of visiting.  I would say, though, that in the case of the expenditure of money by Bord na Móna I do not feel satisfied that we get a really clear and detailed account of the spending.  The report submitted by Bord na Móna could be far clearer and the expenditure by Bord na Móna could certainly be given in greater and better detail. After all, public representatives are entitled to see how public money is spent, and the Minister would be well advised to consult with the secretarial staff of Bord na Móna and see that more elaborate and detailed accounts of the expenditure would be given in the report</P>
    <P>I think that I have covered the main points that I had intended to raise <Col N="979" /> here, and I want to conclude on the note of dissatisfaction with the whole administration of the Minister's policy, particularly referring to the cost of living.  He has gone completely off the track and the Government, having regard to the cost of living at the present time, is certainly on the very verge of insanity in that respect.  I would certainly say that the cost of living to-day has the condemnation of every citizen of all classes and creeds and that the only method by which we can return to better times and cheaper prices, particularly concerning cheaper prices of foodstuffs, will be the removal from office of the present Government. The sooner that takes place the better for everyone concerned.  One would imagine that, having regard to the high prices, the cost of living and the Minister's failure even to attempt to reduce the cost of living, shame would be sufficient to encourage the Minister to say that he did his best, his best was appreciated but it was a bad job, he could do no better and that he would pack up and get out.</P>

      <P>Having listened to Deputy Flanagan so long it might be worth while to go back to a few statements he has made.  I would like first to tackle his statement with regard to the clay pipes.  One wonders what efforts were made for the establishment of a clay pipe industry to meet the needs of this country up to 1951.  Since then the Minister whom Deputy Flanagan has been abusing for the last two hours established one clay pipe factory in County Clare, one in Arklow and one in County Wexford.</P>

    <P>Next, I was very glad to hear his very fine comment on the turf workers <Col N="980" /> and the way he appreciated the hard work they did during the emergency If Deputy Flanagan gave ten minutes of the hour that he devoted here to praising them&mdash;if he gave that ten minutes in 1948, when the turf workers for publication, that we are only getting the high road and the wattle from Deputy Morrissey, they would appreciate it far more.</P>

      <P>In column 181, on the 21st October, 1953, I asked the Minister for Industry and Commerce if he would not make an announcement on the provision of airport facilities for Cork at Ahenesk, Midleton; and, if not, when he expected to do so.  The Minister replied:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;An inspection of possible sites of Cork airport has been made.  A report is at present being prepared for submission to the Government. Until the Government have considered the report, I will not be in a position to make any statement in the matter.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>I then asked the Minister for Industry and Commerce if he would state whether the same meteorological tests were being carried out on other proposed sites for Cork airport as had already been carried out at Farmers' Cross and Ahenesk; and, if so, if he would give the locations of the proposed sites.  The Minister replied:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Meteorological tests were carried out at Ballygarvan and at Ahenesk. It has not been found necessary to have tests carried out at other sites.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>Therefore, Midleton is fixed up and finished.</P>

      <P>Speaking in this House on that matter on the 16th July, 1952, as reported in the Official Report, Volume 133, No. 8, column 1047, the present Minister for Industry and Commerce stated:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;During the war the question of an airport in Cork, as a post-war development project, was again taken up and in 1944 we carried out an investigation of possible sites in the vicinity of Cork.  That inquiry revealed that there were two possible sites.  One was near Midleton and the other was adjacent to the place where the present private airport <Col N="983" /> exists.  Supplementary to that investigation of the terrain and its suitability for the construction of an airport, meteorological investigations over a number of years were carried out and, on the basis of those investigations, the location of the present airport was ruled out and Midleton was deemed more suitable.  The report to me was that not more than 80 per cent. regularity could be ensured at the Ballygarvan site because of the incidence of fog.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>That opinion was come to as a result of meteorological tests carried out on both sites over a number of years.  If there is any other site in the Minister's mind now, or any other site proposed, I am entitled, in my capacity as a Deputy representing East Cork, to demand that the same tests will be carried out on any new site over the same number of years as were devoted to the Midleton and Farmers' Cross sites so that we can arrive at a definite result.  However, I take it that the Minister's reply to me last week, as reported in column 181 of the Official Report, Volume 142, No. 2, in which he said that there was no occasion for carrying out any tests at any other site, means that Midleton has now been chosen.</P>

    <P>&ldquo;Supplementary to that investigation of the terrain and its <Col N="984" /> suitability for the construction of an airport, meteorological investigations over a number of years were carried out and, on the basis of those investigations, the location of the present airport was ruled out and Midleton was deemed more suitable.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The Minister said that the inquiry revealed that there were two possible sites&mdash;the one near Midleton and another site which was adjacent to the place where the present private airport exists.  That means that Farmers' Cross was turned down.</P>

      <P>&ldquo;...the location of the present airport was ruled out and Midleton was deemed more suitable.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>As I have already said, these are the Minister's own words and the reference is column 1047 of the Official Report of Wednesday, 16th July, 1952.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Corry</NameTxt>
      <P>To come back again to the Minister's speech on the 16th July, 1952, I again quote from column 1047 this statement by the Minister:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;The report to me was that not more than 80 per cent. regularity could be ensured at the Ballygarvan site because of the incidence of fog.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>That is Farmers' Cross, and Midleton was contemplated as being more suitable. Deputy Hickey is amazed.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Corry</NameTxt>
      <P>I suggest that if the Minister intends to consider any further the ideas of those citizens of Cork who can never see beyond the boundary of their own parish, he <Col N="985" /> should consider putting up an airport at the Coal Quay in Cork.  I think it would be a most suitable site for the project.</P>
      <P>However, we have heard the decision of the Department and I am sure that it is a decision which cost the State a pretty considerable amount of money.  You do not get experts to come down to Farmers' Cross and Midleton and stay there for a number of years, making tests, without some expenditure of State money.  There is the decision of the experts.  If the Minister has decided on providing an airport for Cork, I expect him to carry out the advice of his experts and I see no other way out of it.</P>

      <P>I will deal with all these things in turn.  I am glad to see that Deputy McGrath, who is the Lord Mayor of Cork, has now come into the House and is consulting Deputy Hickey.  I am glad to see that he is keeping Deputy Hickey quiet over there.  I am sure that Deputy McGrath has not such a narrow and parochial outlook that, when he finds that the site nearer to Cork is unsuitable, according to the departmental experts, he will not throw in his lot and assist us in getting a site in Midleton&mdash;and we want no further delay in the matter.  I do not wish to go any further now than to say that the Minister's experts carried out these tests and their decision has only coincided with that of other experts who went that way before.  When the Americans wanted to put down an airbase, round the time of the 1914-18 War, they came down to within a few miles of that site at Midleton, and established their base there and a further one at Ahenesk.  These two places are on either side of the present airport.</P>

      <P>Do not draw me on that. It only remains for me now to congratulate the Minister on his common <Col N="986" /> sense in coming to a decision to establish an airport in Cork which will have scheduled air services from that city.  I should like to point out to him that the line of service would be far closer to Ahenesk than it would be to Cork City.  The distance between Cobh and Ahenesk is only a few miles. Therefore, I hope there will be no delay.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MartinJohnCorry" hpid="Mr. Corry Mr. Corry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corry</NameTxt>
      <P>I also wish to point out, for publication that we are only getting what we are entitled to get, after tests on other sites have been carried out and have been found wanting.</P>
      <P>On the same day, when I asked these questions in the Dáil.  I received another reply from the Minister in connection with the oil bunkering facilities at Haulbowline.  I should like to congratulate the Minister and the Minister for Defence on bringing to an end the scandal that existed. during the inter-Party régime, in connection with the naval base at Haulbowline. If one of our corvettes wanted to get a gallon of oil to travel anywhere, it had to go to Dublin to get that oil.  That was about as big a joke as ever I have seen perpetrated in the Irish Department of Defence.  If a ship wanted fuel, it had to come to Dublin to get that fuel.  I am glad to see that that scandal has been brought to an end and that our corvettes can now be supplied on the island of Haulbow line.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is a further matter which I should like to urge on the Minister in that connection.  We have had several proposals there in regard to the extension of the pier.  Now it has been discovered, I am very glad to say, that there is no occasion for the extension of the pier, and that it will be sufficient to dredge the anchorage outside. I would suggest that that dredging should be proceeded with immediately <Col N="987" /> without any further delay.  Surely with all the oil firms that are operating in this country at present, it should not be impossible to get one of these firms as a commercial transaction to take over the oil bunkering facilities in Haulbowline.  The present position entails a loss of revenue to the port and there is a lack of facilities which, in my opinion, should be provided in what is the first port in this country. It should not take too much, anyway, to dredge the anchorage.</P>
    <P>Another question I raised with the Minister on the same day was the position with regard to Cobh pier. The Minister informed me that the Harbours Act imposes on harbour authorities the duty of maintaining the harbour works under their control. I hope that the next time we shall have the pleasure of having the Minister in Cobh he will take a look for himself at the condition of the pier. I should also like to inform him that any statement that he got that the pier was not condemned as dangerous in 1937 by the harbour board's engineer is not correct.  I hope to be able to give him the report of the harbour board engineer on that pier. I should like to remind him also that the pier is being used by some hundreds of men every day on their way to work in Haulbowline.  To think that that pier which was reported as being in a dangerous condition in 1937 is still in the same condition is appalling.  That is largely due to the fact that proper representation from the harbour and town of Cobh is not allowed on the Cork Harbour Board. That is a matter that I hope will be rectified in the near future.</P>
    <P>The next matter with which I should like to deal is the position of Irish Steel, Limited.  I have spent five or nearly six years constantly asking questions as to the extension of that industry.  I admit freely that the establishment of the so-called Industrial Development Authority has held it up and that that authority has evidently been used as something to which the buck could be passed.  A large portion of the machinery necessary for the establishment of a sheet <Col N="988" /> mill in Haulbowline is there on the ground.  In Cobh and in the surrounding district you have an industrial population dating back for generations. You have a line of skilled workers there who are second to none in this country and there is an opportunity there to provide a very large increase in employment.  It would not alone mean a large increase in employment but would save a big expenditure in bringing in from foreign countries goods that can be produced here. I would, therefore, urge on the Minister to speed up the starting of that sheet mill.  This is an industry which is absolutely essential to the town of Cobh.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesHickey" hpid="Mr. Hickey Mr. Hickey">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MartinJohnCorry" hpid="Mr. Corry Mr. Corry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corry</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to take a step further and urge the Minister also to start immediately tin plate mills on the same site.  These joint industries were envisaged in the first articles of association when the project was started.  During the past 12 months, we paid something over £2,000,000 for foreign tin cans and tin plates.  Unless I am very much mistaken, a pretty considerable amount of the machinery for that industry is also in Haulbowline already.  If these industries were brought into being in Cobh, they would not alone relieve unemployment in the Cobh area but in the area across the water, in Passage as well.  I think it is essential that these industries should be brought into operation immediately and I, for one, cannot understand the reason for any further delay. I spent long enough here when the inter-Party Government was in office making representations to that effect. Now that we have a Minister back in office who has done so much for Irish industry, I expect him to make every effort to push that industry ahead and to finish the job he so very ably undertook in 1939 when he first opened the factory.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should like to pay the tribute to him that I do not think any other Minister for Industry and Commerce in this or any other country would have done as much for Irish Steel as the present Minister has done.  As one who had to go through the mill with him, and who <Col N="989" /> had to come up here repeatedly on appeals to him to resurrect the industry when it had gone bankrupt and was threatened with extinction, I must admit that he met the case put to him always sympathetically and well.  I ask him now to put the coping stone on his good work by getting the industry going fully.</P>
    <P>I admit that there has, undoubtedly, been an improvement in the condition of affairs in my constituency, as a whole, during the past 12 months, but there are still evidently delays in some directions that I cannot understand.  I cannot understand why these delays have been so long.  For that reason, I put down a question last week in connection with the Fermoy project.  I received a reply stating that it was hoped that production would commence by August of this year, but a delay had been caused by circumstances unforeseen by the promoters and outside the Minister's control.  Let us hope that the reasons for this delay no longer exist.  I should like to point out to the Minister the claims that Fermoy has on any national Government in this country.  Fermoy was a prosperous garrison town during the British régime, but the people of Fermoy, and the young men of Fermoy in particular, did their part nobly during the national struggle, even though by their action, they, so to speak, deprived themselves of their own bread in getting rid of the British.  They did their part, as I say, nobly and well.  The town has been left almost derelict for the last 30 years.  We are looking forward now to the establishment of an industry in that town that will give employment to the people there so that the unfortunate citizen of Fermoy will no longer find himself in the position that he has to look at his family growing up around him in the full knowledge that when they reach school-leaving age they will have to go somewhere else to seek employment.  The opportunities are there and the industry is there. If, as the Minister stated, the machinery is now ready for shipment, it should not take so long to put it into position and so put the people of Fermoy in the happy position of being <Col N="990" /> able fully to provide for those who are seeking employment in their midst.</P>
    <P>The next matter to which I should like to refer is the position at Clondulane Flour Mills.  We have seen, with dismay, the closing down of these mills and we have seen something further.  I have seen recently stores taken over by that firm in other towns in my constituency and being used for the storage of corn.  I have seen barley held up when the mills in Cork could not take it in, not having storage room, whilst the large flour mills and the stores in Clondulane are left there idle.  I say, speaking for the agricultural community, that we are not prepared to be informed that there is no room for our barley and that our barley cannot be accepted at the mills because they have not storage capacity whilst other stores, the property of the millers, are lying there idle.  Surely if they are not going to be used for flour milling they should take barley in there and give some employment in the handling of barley.</P>
    <P>Another matter with which I should like to deal is the position of Rushbrooke Dockyard.  I would say to the Minister in that respect that there is too much centralisation in Dublin as regards dockyard work.  I cannot see any just reason for moving ships to Dublin for repairs, ships that are deriving most of their trade from Cork Port.  I am aware of the business associations existing between the managers of the B. &amp; I. Line and the Dublin Dockyard Company.  I should like to point out to the Minister that, apparently with his consent, certain reductions in port dues have been given by the Cork Harbour Commissioners to these shipping companies. If reductions in dues amounting to a couple of thousand pounds a year are given to certain shipping companies trading in the port of Cork, we at least are entitled to expect that any necessary repairs to these ships will be carried out in the dockyard attached to Cobh.  That is not asking for too much.</P>
    <P>I happened to be one of a deputation which some years ago waited on the managing director of that steamship <Col N="991" /> line in Cork and which got from him certain guarantees as to the amount of business that would be given to Rushbrooke Dockyard.  I can also say that no guarantee that he gave to that deputation was afterwards carried out. I think it is high time that the shipping company either fulfil these guarantees or else that they be no longer treated as the petted friend of the Cork Harbour Commissioners.  If they are relieved to the extent of a couple of thousand pounds of harbour dues legally due, somebody else has to pay for it.  These are matters which I should like to bring to the Minister's immediate notice.</P>
    <P>I should like to congratulate the Minister on the activity that he has shown since 1951.  The establishment in this country of some 187 new industries since he came back again as Minister is an achievement that any Government could be proud of.  He will pardon me if, in my anxiety, I want to see a fair crack of the whip given to the constituency I represent.  If it is not given, then it is my duty as its representative to come here and fight for it.</P>
    <P>I should like to deal with a few other matters that in my opinion need attention. I should like to know from the Minister whether there will be any subsidy needed for C.I.E. this year. In view of the manner in which transport is restricted in this country and of the fact that an ordinary lorry owner, despite all the restrictions, can still make sufficient to make ends meet and that the smaller companies here and there round the country have succeeded in holding their own although charging a lower price than is charged by C.I.E. for transport, I cannot see any sane reason for imposing any burden on the taxpayers in order to keep C.I.E. going.  I think there is no justification for it.</P>
    <P>There must be something wrong with a company which, having all the facilities at their disposal, cannot pay their way.  They are so conservative that they are 50 years behind the times.  It is all very well to put on diesel trains and all the rest of it, but, as representing those who supply something <Col N="992" /> like 60 per cent of the total freight trade carried by C.I.E., namely the Beet Growers' Association, I think there should be some move by C.I.E. in the way of providing us with facilities.</P>
    <P>Some five years have passed since we received guarantees from the management of C.I.E. in regard to mechanical loaders at railway stations and pick-up points.  At that time we used the horse for opening the drill for the beet and for setting the beet.  We used manual labour for singling, weeding, pulling and crowning the beet.  Since then, the sugar company, at great inconvenience to themselves and after a lot of mechanical research, have relieved the agricultural community of a lot of the slave labour attached to the growing of beet.  The only people who have not advanced since that time are the C.I.E. They are still back in the donkey stage in dealing with an industry which supplies something like 60 per cent. of their total revenue as far as freight is concerned.</P>
    <P>Surely the beet growers are entitled to a fair crack of the whip from C.I.E. Those mechanical loaders have now been turned out by the sugar company. They are at the disposal of C.I.E. if they are prepared to take them and use them.  They would save the company at least 25 per cent. of the present loading time on lorries and wagons. I can see no justification for having a lorry waiting for an hour at a pick-up point to be loaded when it can be done with a mechanical loader in a quarter of an hour far more efficiently.  Why are those in charge of C.I.E. so blind that they cannot see that for themselves? I suggest that the Minister should bring it home to them.</P>
    <P>I do not think there is any other matter I wish to deal with except to apologise for not being here in time to resume the debate to-day.  Unfortunately I thought the Dáil was meeting as usual at 3 o'clock, and I thank you, Sir, for your kindness in allowing me to finish my speech.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJamesOGorman" hpid="Mr. O'Gorman Mr. O'Gorman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Gorman</NameTxt>
      <P>After the Department of Agriculture, I would say that the Department of Industry and Commerce is the most important Ministry <Col N="993" /> we have.  I do not intend to go over the field of industrial activity in the country after listening to the various speakers both last evening and this afternoon and I shall confine myself to a few points.  As I say, this is a most important Ministry and the Minister in charge, I have no doubt, will pay heed to the few requests I propose to make to him.</P>
      <P>I shall first take the E.S.B. rural electrification scheme.  That undoubtedly is spreading over a considerable portion of the country and is in great demand in many parts of the constituency I represent.  I suggest to the Minister that where the current is installed in country villages and people are prepared to take it there should also be a public lighting system.  I have a few villages in mind in East Cork where the electricity has been installed for the last eight or 12 months and yet they have no public lighting.  The only light in the streets comes from inside the various houses. I ask the Minister, as the E.S.B. comes directly under his control, to bring that matter to their notice.  We all realise that rural life in Ireland, which is talked about here so often, requires to be brightened up, and certainly where electricity is installed in the villages the streets should also be lighted.  When you drive into one of these villages at night you find all the houses lighted by electricity, but the streets outside are as dark as a dungeon. I ask the Minister to bring that to the notice of the E.S.B.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Within the past few weeks in my own town of Youghal I spoke at a meeting of the local urban council, of which I am a member, and I referred to Youghal as being one of the worstlighted towns in the country.  It is, too.  In my travels around the constituency of East Cork I can safely say that every other town I visited is better illuminated and the luminosity of the lamps is far greater than it is in the town of Youghal.  I protested on numerous occasions at the urban council and to the E.S.B. authorities. The lamps in the public lighting system of Youghal at the moment are the very same lamps that were there during the war.  I will not say that <Col N="994" /> the bulbs are the same.  All the lamps are cowled just the same now as they were during the war period.</P>
    <P>We have made repeated requests to the E.S.B. authorities to have these cowls removed and so radiate the light of the lamps over a wider area. Being cowled, the lamps shed their light over a restricted area, say, within a circumference of 30 or 40 feet.  From that to the next lamp one has to travel through a dark, black pocket. The last time the matter was mentioned we received a reply from the E.S.B. authorities that they proposed installing a new lighting system in the town.</P>
    <P>At the moment the urban council pay £500 per year for public lighting. They are amazed that the E.S.B. propose to give them extra and better lights and charge them £300 per annum extra.  We do not want any further lamps.  I think we have sufficient.  We certainly do not feel in the humour to pay £300 per annum extra for what the E.S.B. authorities propose to give us and what we did not ask.  I would ask the Minister or the Parliamentary Secretary, who is deputising for him at the moment, to bring that to the notice of the E.S.B.</P>
    <P>Personally, I think nothing earns more favourable comment from people passing through the countryside than well-lighted towns and villages.  All the cities are well lighted.  They are all right, but I want to see the smaller towns and villages lighted.  Some of those villages at the present time are more like the Black Hole of Calcutta. The gas lighting system is a thing of the past.  Electricity has replaced it, but when you go to the E.S.B. you find that they will not do anything for you. I feel very aggrieved with the E.S.B. about this.  It seems farcical that cowls put over the bulbs during the war are still there and will not be taken down in deference to the numerous requests made to the E.S.B. by the local authorities.</P>
    <P>My colleague, Deputy Corry, prefaced his speech by appealing that the proposed airport for Cork should be at Ahenesk, Midleton.  Being the senior Deputy for the constituency, he was <Col N="995" /> entitled to speak before me.  He reported progress last night.  Most of the points that I intend to cover will have to be over somewhat the same ground. It is definitely about time, however, that we had an airport in Cork.  The world of to-day is a world of speed, speed on the roads and speed everywhere. That may not be a good thing from the point of view of human life, but speed counts in the world nowadays more than ever before.</P>
    <P>I should like to place my humble view before the Minister on behalf of Ahenesk.  We have Cork Deputies advocating the claims of Farmers' Cross and you have the East Cork Deputies&mdash;Deputies Corry, Barry and myself&mdash;advocating the cause of Ahenesk.  During the Summer Recess I made it my business to visit both areas.  I went to Ahenesk, accompanied by friends of mine.  They showed me the whole layout of the place.  Not being a meteorological expert, I cannot offer any opinion in that respect, but Ahenesk seemed to be exceptionally suitable, far more suitable than the one we hear the most talk about from the Cork Deputies, Farmers' Cross.  I know that in the last analysis this is a matter for the Minister to decide.</P>
    <P>Some years back&mdash;in pre-war years&mdash; experts visited that locality and made a report.  I have the report here and I will read an extract for the benefit of Deputies.  The Minister, no doubt, got the report.  It states:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Ahenesk has the advantage of being comparatively close to a railway station but not bounded by a railway line.  Similarly, it has easy access from a main road but is not bounded by such a road.  The surrounding country is open and there are no high hills.  A certain portion of the ground will require drainage and a small rectification of the contours on the higher portion of the ground will be necessary.  Removal of the banks which cut up the site and the diversion of a road are also entailed.</P>
    <P>We are quite satisfied that in this site Cork has an airport adequate for <Col N="996" /> both present and, as far as can be foreseen, future requirements in suitable surroundings and within easy reach of the city.  We believe this to be the only site on which a practicable and entirely satisfactory aerodrome could be made at a moderate expenditure and within a reasonable period of time.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickHogan" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Patrick (Clare) Hogan">

    <Speaker pid="PatrickJamesOGorman" hpid="Mr. O'Gorman Mr. O'Gorman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Gorman</NameTxt>
      <P>It is a report passed on to me by Midleton Urban Council.  I trust that the Minister will bear that in mind.  It comes from a very well-known meteorological expert. I do not blame the Cork Deputies fighting for Farmers' Cross.  I think that owing to the incidence of fog the Farmers' Cross airfield site is not suitable.</P>
      <P>After all, we in East Cork have the gateway to Ireland in the town of Cobh which is only ten or 11 miles from this proposed airport which, I hope, will materialise.  Every liner which comes to Ireland drops its passengers at Cobh before proceeding to Liverpool or Southampton, so that having an airport there would, in my opinion, be the most suitable arrangement.  As I have said, it is not for me to judge but a few points made by the other Deputies for the constituency, and by myself, should impress on the Minister that Midleton is, to use racing parlance, &ldquo;sticking out a mile&rdquo; for the proposed airport.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are just a few little matters in regard to the question of tea.  Tea is a very imporant item in the diet of most Irish people.  The Irish people are the greatest connoisseurs of tea in the world.  I think that is pretty well known.  I have received repeated complaints from various householders that the quality of the tea we are getting at the moment is not suitable for the Irish palate and the sooner businessmen revert to the system of one buying tea from one particular firm and another from another, the better it will be in the interests of everyone.  I know that, for many reasons, it may have been necessary to control tea during the war, for example, to stop black <Col N="997" /> marketing and other activities which most people deprecate but which take place at a time like that.  I think, however, that after six years from the end of the war the time has arrived to throw the market open and allow customers to buy from the people best able to supply them, the people who will be able to supply retailers and customers with what they want.</P>
    <P>We have heard a lot of talk in this House on this and other occasions about An Tóstal festivities.  Personally I think An Tóstal is a good idea, but that it is becoming a bit of a joke, if I may put it that way, with many people in the country at the moment. It is no joke, however, for the Irish taxpayers who have to foot the bill for the Tóstal festivities which took place last year.  My sole reason for mentioning this is that I feel quite certain that the date fixed by the Tóstal authorities in Dublin for these festivities is at the wrong time of the year.  Every Irishman, irrespective of where he comes from, wants to see An Tóstal develop and flourish.</P>
    <P>A few years ago, when speaking on this Estimate, I suggested, I think, to the present Minister for Industry and Commerce, that holidays should be staggered, that they should start earlier in the year and finish later than they do.  I had in mind then the month which I consider the best holiday month in the year, and that is May. Last year, An Tóstal was held for three weeks during the month of April, when we had blizzards blowing in from the North and the Arctic regions.  In fact, the weather at the time was appalling, and it was really a joke to invite people to come here at that time of the year when people needed to be wearing their crombies and heavy underwear to keep out the cold.</P>
    <P>I want to see An Tóstal develop.  It is a national festival, and we all want to see people attracted to it from America, England and elsewhere.  I was given some cards last year by the local An Tóstal committee to send to friends of mine in England, France and other countries.  I did not need to send any to America.  People did not come and I do not blame them.  If they did come they would get their noses bitten off with the cold.  That, <Col N="998" /> in my opinion, is the reason why An Tóstal is being regarded as a joke. There has been considerable discussion about the date of it at meetings of An Tóstal committees throughout the country and there seems to be unanimity amongst them that the month selected for the festivities is the wrong one.  We all know that the weather in the month of April can be as cold as it usually is in January.  Let us not blind ourselves to the facts, and these are that people are not going to come to Ireland in the month of April when we have howling gales, and when the weather is in its worst behaviour.</P>
    <P>All sections of the people are anxious to see An Tóstal developed.  I come from a tourist resort myself&mdash;from Youghal.  The local committee there work very energetically, all of them being imbued with the desire to see the festival do the greatest possible amount of good for the town.  I can truthfully say that not one solitary person came to Youghal last year for An Tóstal, and Youghal, as I have said, is a tourist town.  When the public are asked to subscribe to festivities of this kind they do so generously, and I suggest that their wishes should receive attention.</P>
    <P>This year, at the initial meeting of the local committee, very severe criticism was passed by the members, one of their complaints being that they had never been even consulted about the date.  May I respectfully suggest that next year the Minister should ask those running An Tóstal in Dublin to pay heed to the views expressed by people down the country?  After all, Dublin is not Ireland.  It may be in many respects, but when a national effort is being made to do something for the country the views of the people in the little towns and villages throughout the country deserve to get as much consideration as those of people who reside in the metropolis.</P>
    <P>There is another matter on which I propose to speak with a certain amount of hesitancy.  It is not one that appeals to me, but I feel that I should mention it, and that is the importation of timber from Russia into this country. The idea that such a thing should take <Col N="999" /> place is nauseating to many people.  I think I am speaking for every -ism in Ireland&mdash;Catholicism, Protestantism and every other -ism&mdash;when I say that every one of them resent very much that Catholic Ireland, or, perhaps, I should say Christian Ireland, should have had any dealings with Russia or should get in timber from that country. Surely, there are other countries from which timber could have been imported, countries that are on far more friendly terms with us than the U.S.S.R.  I do not like it, and, speaking as an Irish Catholic, I think that the importation of this timber should not have been allowed, in view of the treatment that is being meted out to people of all faiths, Catholic, Protestant and others, behind the Iron Curtain, and in those countries which are under Soviet control.  Many of us in pre-war days visited Czechoslokavia and many other countries in middle Europe that are now behind the Iron Curtain.  It seems a terrible thing that to-day the people there are not allowed to give expression to their religious beliefs.  I do not want to prolong a discussion on this.  Every Deputy present realises as I do that it is a horrible thing that the importation of this timber should have taken place.  I hope it is the last time that anything of the kind will occur.</P>
    <P>There are some other matters that I should like to refer to.  Lately, I attended a meeting in the town of Cobh where, I regret to say, there is considerable unemployment at the moment.  I said earlier that Cobh is the gateway to Ireland.  When I visited the town within the last month, I was horrified to find that there are approximately 250 men unemployed there at the moment.  There are from 130 to 140 fewer people employed there than there were at this time last year.</P>
    <P>I suggest to the Minister that there has been a lot of talk here as to who started Irish Steel and all the rest of it.  It was the money of the people of this country which put Irish Steel on its feet.  Irish Steel went wallop twice &mdash;that is away back in 1930.  I do not care who gets the credit for Irish <Col N="1000" /> Steel, it meant a lot to Cobh.  I am not going to say that it was Fianna Fáil, Fine Gael or any other Party. What started the Irish Steel industry in Cobh was the money that came out of the pockets of the taxpayers.  I do not want any Deputy to be taking credit he does not deserve.  Any industries that have been started in Ireland were started by the people who had the courage, the foresight and the business acumen to put their money into them, that is, the Irish people, and nobody should come along and take credit that belongs only to the Irish people.  It does not matter what Minister is in power, it is the people whose money goes into a concern that deserve credit.</P>
    <P>I would ask the Minister, if he intends going on with the erection of the sheet mill in Cobh, to get it into production at the earliest opportunity because that town wants it badly to relieve an unemployment situation that is becoming rather serious.  Cobh is a town like many others that, when occupied by the British garrison in days gone by, experienced affluent times.  That has changed and now were it not for the liners which call to the port and give a considerable amount of employment periodically and were it not for the work provided by Irish Steel, there is no great industry there.  I do trust the Minister will expedite the erection of the sheet mill.</P>
    <P>The same applies to Rushbrooke Dockyard.  I was amazed to learn when I visited there with my colleagues, Deputies Barry and Corry, that no local ship calls to Rushbrooke for repairs.  They may have, I have been informed, one or two ships in the year and that has to pay for all who are working there, the many ship-wrights, carpenters, fitters, glaziers and plumbers.  They are all highly skilled professions; they are professions just the same as those of doctors, solicitors, and so on.  It is rather disheartening to hear these men telling you that unless something is done to provide work for them they will have to emigrate across the Channel where they can earn very high wages.  However, most people would prefer to earn <Col N="1001" /> their living in the town where they were born and reared.  Why should ships that are using the dock at Cork and passing down through the town of Cobh&mdash;one of the grandest towns in Ireland commanding an excellent view of the Atlantic and having a splendid dockyard&mdash;come up to the Dublin Dockyard to be renovated, fitted out or have other minor repairs done?  I appeal with confidence to the Minister to see that there is no recurrence of that.</P>
    <P>There are many other matters I would like to touch on, but on an Estimate like this, one could keep talking for hours and I see a general desire on the part of both Deputies and others in the House that speeches should be short and to the point.  I have tried to act in accordance with that but when I mention points in this House I do like to have them attended to.  I think those I have mentioned to the Minister are worthy of his consideration and I would ask him to give a gee-up as regards the points I have made.  I must say the Minister is amenable at all times when you make a reasonable request.  Any requests I make in this House are, I hope, always reasonable.  I speak for my constituents on matters with which I am conversant. That is all I have done in the ten or 15 minutes I have been speaking and I trust the Minister will pay attention to them.</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Brennan Mr. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>I shall take my cue from the previous speaker and be brief. I think Deputy O'Gorman has made what is a reasonable and balanced speech coming from the Opposition, a speech with which nobody could find fault or on which nobody could have any desire to recriminate or retaliate. The only thing to which I would take exception&mdash;and I only take that in reference to other speeches&mdash;is his reference to the Steel Company in Cork regarding which he said it was the taxpayers' money that was to be thanked for any success achieved in that direction and not Fine Gael, Fianna Fáil or any other Party.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am not disputing the logic of that statement except to the extent that many of the previous speakers from <Col N="1002" /> the Opposition side who contributed so far to this debate were loud in their condemnation of the Minister accusing him of not having started an industry here or an industry there or in their own immediate village or town.  Therefore, it would seem that so far as the Opposition are concerned, when an industry is not started in a town the Minister must be blamed but when an industry is started the taxpayer is the only man who must be thanked as responsible for it.</P>
    <P>There is a great deal of muddled thinking in regard to this particular Department and its function as far as industry is concerned.  We are sometimes inclined to forget that private enterprise is the system by which we hope and are endeavouring to build up industry.  Only on those rare occasions when private enterprise is not getting on with the job has the State stepped in to assist an industry such as the E.S.B., Bord na Móna, the Sugar Company and such companies as were sponsored by the State originally and subsidised afterwards by them if necessary.</P>
    <P>The policy of the Department of Industry and Commerce, which has been given particularly strong impetus and careful guidance by the present Minister, is to sponsor industry through private enterprise by giving every possible encouragement to private enterprise to play its part.  Any speaker in this House who does not pay due tribute to the present Minister for Industry and Commerce for the part he has played in fostering, expanding and developing the industrial resources of this country is failing in his duty.  We have talked time and again about unemployment and the ways and means of solving the problem and I think we must all agree that the only solution to it is to find employment for our people of the type that is permanent and that holds out hope of future success, and employment of a type to which people can turn and find themselves a future in which they can settle down in a degree of comfort.</P>
    <P>All kinds of temporary employment schemes are very good in themselves. They are good in so far as at certain times of the year they provide the <Col N="1003" /> small farmer with a little supplement to his income when he has nothing else to turn his hand to.  However useful they may be in the work they accomplish or however useful they may be in the employment they provide, these schemes can never be looked on as a means of solving the unemployment question.  Everything possible should be done to give full and permanent employment to the people, by putting them into industry to develop all our resources, so that we may be able to employ all our surplus agricultural population.  If that surplus, which must come from the farming community, is to be absorbed permanently, it can be done only by the full development of our industrial resources.</P>
    <P>There are many ways and means by which the Minister can assist the development of industry even through private enterprise.  All the encouragement that can be given is being given by the present Minister.  He cannot just take by the scruff of the neck people with money to invest and compel them to put it into industry, nor is it advisable that the State should step in and organise industry in competition with private enterprise, except, as I said at the outset, where private enterprise cannot undertake that particular type of industry or is unwilling to do so.</P>
    <P>During the last few years the decentralisation of industry became a popular theme with all Deputies and for the first time in the history of a native Government a serious attempt was made to decentralise industry when the Undeveloped Areas Act was passed.  That Act is not in operation for very long, but it has already shown that its trend is in the right direction. As time goes on, more and more industrialists will realise the generous provisions under that Act and will avail themselves of them.  It will eventually succeed in having many of those industries, which otherwise would be set up in Dublin or Cork or along the eastern coast, moved to the western coast from which the people are fleeing.  As I said here on a previous Estimate, that Act in itself will not solve the problem <Col N="1004" /> of the lack of industries in the congested areas, nor was it intended to solve that problem.  The best one can hope for under that Act is to secure the setting up of new industries in some of the larger towns within the undeveloped areas.  As for those areas in the backward distant parts on our sea-coast and for the Gaeltacht areas, people who have money to invest in a large undertaking do not desire to move back into the mountains or to those villages on the outposts of the Gaeltacht.</P>
    <P>In this respect, I would like to make an earnest appeal to the Minister for Industry and Commerce to proceed on the lines indicated by him when he spoke in the closing debate on the Second Reading of the Undeveloped Areas Bill.  He pointed out then that further effort would have to be made by the Government to sponsor industries in those congested areas.  Gaeltacht Services is already doing a good job, but we wonder whether it should not go faster and do more.  I would appeal to the Minister, who is primarily responsible for the development of industry, to look into that problem immediately, in order to ensure that a further effort is made to establish industries in those areas, either through the existing organisation in Gaeltacht Services or directly from his own office.  If he does that, he will be going a long way towards putting an end to all this talk about emigration and unemployment in the Gaeltacht.  I do not believe that we should compel people to stay at home, but at least we should reach the position where we can offer a job to every man who wishes to stay at home and earn a living in this country.</P>
    <P>Taking the broad view of industry as a whole, there is one thing for which we must be grateful to the present Minister, that is for the high prestige which Irish manufacturing industry has attained, as compared with the time when the first all-out effort was made in 1932.</P>
    <P>Far too many people in this country and in this House were prepared then to cast aspersions on the attempt being made to manufacture Irish goods.  Whether it was due to an inferiority <Col N="1005" /> complex on their part or for the purpose of discrediting for political reasons the all-out attempt that was being made at the time, there was far too much talk about &ldquo;incompetency,&rdquo; about &ldquo;industries sheltered behind tariff walls,&rdquo; about &ldquo;exploitation of Irish industry,&rdquo; about &ldquo;back-lane factories&rdquo; and &ldquo;factories in stables.&rdquo; Any other Minister for Industry and Commerce might well have thrown up his hands in disgust, but he carried on with determination.  He applied to that important task which was allotted to him all the ability, all the tact and all the energy that any man could ever apply in the important duties of a Minister for Industry and Commerce. To his great efforts and energy down through those years, to his work alone, is attributable the high precision and the high respect in which Irish manufactured goods are held to-day.  If in those days when Irish industry was cutting its teeth, if in its infancy there were cases where the articles produced were not up to the standard of the world market, that was to be expected. We could not start producing world competitive goods overnight.  Many of the industries which then found it difficult enough to produce satisfactory goods are to-day producing goods that are not merely equal to but better than those produced elsewhere.  Having achieved that stage in Irish industry we have possibly accomplished more than many of us realise. We have shaken off our complacency. We have got rid of any inferiority complex we may have had and we are producing goods to-day not merely for our own requirements but for other world markets.</P>
    <P>Listening to Deputy O. Flanagan one would think that the Minister was not alone failing in his job but was deliberately trying to kill Irish industry. I am sure nobody will take the Deputy's statements seriously.  I am sure he himself realises that they will not be regarded by responsible people as an accurate representation of the position here.</P>
    <P>I was interested in Deputy Flanagan's statements in regard to turf.  He condemned the Minister for not having done more for hand-won <Col N="1006" /> turf or privately produced turf.  He referred in glowing terms to the boom in hand-won turf during the emergency period.  He said it was a great industry that provided work for many people.  In my short memory I can recall the years when we in Donegal and the people in the turf producing areas throughout the country were doing their best to provide the nation's fuel.  I can remember that Deputies like Deputy O. Flanagan did nothing but sneer at that effort, make slighting references to the poor turf sent into Dublin and bemoan the fate of the people who were compelled to burn that turf.  To-day they bewail the fact that more are not employed in the hand-won turf industry. Deputy O. Flanagan forgot to remind the House that the Minister has announced the establishment of four new, turf-fired, generating electricity stations in which privately produced hand-won turf will be utilised.  In that way a market has been provided for all the hand-won turf that can be produced in the four counties in which these stations will be situated.  I shall not make any reference to the stations that were planned a few years ago but I think the present Minister deserves at least a few words of commendation, even from the Opposition, for the action he has taken to provide an almost unlimited market for hand-won turf.  As one who comes from a turf producing area, I congratulate him on that.  We are proud of the efforts he has made and of the hopes he has raised for the future.</P>
    <P>Deputy Flanagan also referred to the importation of pipes in connection with land drainage.  I would like to tell the House a story about that. During the inter-Party régime a number of representatives were sent to America to study the most suitable type of machinery for the production of land drainage pipes.  Having travelled a number of States and inspected a number of machines they came back and reported that the most suitable and economical for use here was a little machine called &ldquo;the Champion&rdquo;. The cost of that machine was well under £1,000, but in certain circumstances even that can be a lot of money.  Many people were encouraged, <Col N="1007" /> if not in some cases directly requested, to import these machines.  The machines were here for only one month when it was found that owing to the prevalence of an acid in the soil concrete pipes were liable to disintegrate after a very short time.  Therefore, the concrete pipes produced by the &ldquo;Champion&rdquo; machine were useless, particularly in the congested counties along the western seaboard, where the soil is peaty and acid.  I know some of the people who imported these machines.  They have approached the Department of Agriculture and the Department of Industry and Commerce in an endeavour to find out if they would be compensated for these machines which are now lying idle on their hands.  No attention has been paid to them, good, bad or indifferent.</P>
    <P>As a result of investigation, it was discovered that clay pipes would have to be used.  At that time there were scarcely any clay pipes of the kind required being produced here.  To-day, home production is meeting a large part of our requirements.  Huge quantities of these pipes are being used and in every case preference is given to the home-manufactured article.  I question the statement made by Deputy Flanagan that any Irish firm is as yet capable of supplying the needs of the home market in so far as clay pipes are concerned, although production has been stepped up ten hundredfold in the last two years.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>It took them a long time to get into their stride and for that reason it is ridiculous for Deputy Flanagan to blame us for importing pipes.  Pipes had to be procured and we could not wait until they could be produced at home.  No doubt in time the home producers will be able to manufacture all our requirements.  I hope that day is very near.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In conclusion, let me repeat what I said with reference to the void left by the Undeveloped Areas Act in so far <Col N="1008" /> as the undeveloped areas are concerned. I would again impress upon the Minister the absolute necessity of examining immediately the question of providing industries in those areas which will never be served by private enterprise mainly due to the fact that local capital is not available and outside capital, when it is encouraged to move into those areas, naturally selects the more suitable centres, the larger towns.</P>
    <P>I am satisfied that the Undeveloped Areas Act in so far as it relates to the towns that I refer to, has proved a success.  I am satisfied that many of the proposals at present under consideration, some of which relate to my own constituency, will bear fruit in the near future and that we shall see the benefits of that Act applied to the areas where unemployment is prevalent and the areas that the Act was originally intended to benefit.</P>
    <P>I congratulate the Minister on the many achievements for which he has been responsible in this important office.  In any effort he makes to give an impetus to the fostering, establishment, development and expansion of industry, he will be assured of the full co-operation of the people who so anxiously await the development of industry and the solution of the unemployment problem.</P>

      <P>Deputy Brennan seems to feel that a number of us are not giving sufficient credit to the Minister for his efforts over the past 20 years in securing development of Irish industry.  There is no difference of opinion in regard to the efforts or the achievements or the desirability of those efforts.  Nobody quarrels with any and every attempt made to expand our industrial economy.  Generally, differences of viewpoint arise in regard to the methods.  Deputy Brennan should bear in mind that, great as is the importance of the debate on the Estimate for Industry and Commerce and great as is the responsibility of the Minister, it is not solely the Minister's responsibility; it is the responsibility of us all.  We have all an equal concern although the Minister of necessity must carry the greater <Col N="1009" /> responsibility.  Many of the criticisms made in respect of various aspects of the industrial expansion and the industrial activity in this country are to be heard not merely from Opposition speakers; they are to be heard from the Minister himself.  It is the Minister himself and the Government that he represents that have found it necessary to take certain precautionary steps to deal with many of the difficulties.</P>
      <P>The common concern that we all have to secure the proper and rapid expansion of Irish industry should not allow us to close our eyes to defects or abuses lest abuses become so great as to interfere with future progress. Therefore, when we refer to various aspects of Irish industrial development our words should not be twisted into an attempt to oppose that line or to suggest that we want to take away from the Minister the credit to which he is duly entitled.</P>
      <P>Whether it is because the debate is taking place at this time of the year or not, the Minister appeared to be suffering yesterday from a sense of complacency or perhaps from staleness.  I do not think his speech was up to his usual standard.  It is interesting that, whatever members of the House may lack in paying tribute to the Minister, the organ of his own Party thought his speech was of such importance that they put it on the back page and spread the whole front page with a report of an event that we had known had taken place some time ago.  That is the relative value of news.  The Minister has added three Deputies to his Party.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Larkin</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister, in a fairly extensive report, dealt with a large number of heads.  There is a possibility <Col N="1010" /> that not only the Minister but many of us are suffering from a certain complacency in regard to the whole problem of industrial development.  I do not think that either we, as individuals, or Parties or the public have yet measured the size and the difficulties of the problems facing us.</P>
      <P>I was reading a short article by the Minister in a journal early this evening in which he set out the achievements secured since 1932 in the creation of some 200,000 additional jobs in the country.  Again, as I say, nobody would quarrel with the fact that these jobs have been created but where I see the complacency, at least in our debates here, is in the failure to recall and bear in mind and keep in the forefront of the debate some very important figures that have also become available of recent date.  While there has been success in creating those additional jobs, the over-all and net gain is not of the order of 200,000 jobs but a much smaller figure.  I do not intend to blame the Minister for that but it is important that we measure the progress made not merely against the starting point but against the objective we are trying to reach.</P>
      <P>In the period from 1926 to 1951 our net gain of jobs created, that is, jobs created in industry generally as against jobs lost in agriculture, has been 12,000.  It becomes of great significance when we get the figure given by the Taoiseach the other day that last year there was a drop, not of 10,000 or 15,000 in the number of male workers employed in agriculture, but of 22,000. Therefore, when serious economists tell us that the measure of our efforts must be something of the order of placing some 25,000 additional persons in employment each year in order to absorb the numbers of boys and girls leaving school and the numbers coming from agriculture, we have to think in that term.  When we find that in one year, instead of the surplus from agriculture being of the order of 10,000 or 15,000, it has jumped to 22,000, we start to realise that the problem is very great.  Any suggestions, therefore, that can be made require very careful consideration.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1011" /> Frankly, while Deputy Brennan pays great tribute to the Minister, I feel that the least satisfied person in this House is the Minister himself, because he has probably greater realisation than many of us because of being nearer to the problem of how great the problem still is and how much remains to be done.</P>
    <P>The Minister mentioned in the course of his speech that in the last 12 months there had been 68 new industrial concerns established here and a further 200 proposals were before his Department, many of which he expected would result in actual establishment of new concerns.  He did not, I think, give the actual figures for the new employment involved. It may be very considerable but again, as I say, it has to be measured against the needs that are facing us now&mdash;not merely the fact that we have at the present moment some 52,000 unemployed but that that figure represents not an increase of 1,500 over last year but, more important still, an increase of four or five thousand over two years ago.  Those are the figures we should keep in mind; and in order to ease this unemployment problem which is not merely bad in so far as it affects the people actually unemployed but represents an economic weight dragging on the whole community we have got to provide some 20,000 or 25,000 jobs to bring that figure of unemployment down to a reasonable percentage of the total number insured; and even if we achieve the reduction by 25,000, say in the next 12 months, we are then facing the necessity to provide a further 25,000 jobs in the following year.  This is a tremendous problem, which is not the problem of the Minister either in his ministerial or his political capacity or of the Fianna Fáil Government or of any political Party.  It is a problem on which a great many minds have to do a great deal of serious thinking.</P>
    <P>I was somewhat perturbed when I listened to a Deputy like Deputy Brennan, who was serious in the matter, and deeply concerned, being completely illogical in his approach. On the one hand he emphasised that <Col N="1012" /> the whole basis on which the economic and industrial policy of Fianna Fáil is formulated is the furtherance and the encouragement of private enterprise, and he kind of criticised in a backhand way anybody who departs from that very rigid path.  There are different viewpoints on the value of private enterprise and its ability to do the job. But we had only to wait five minutes till we found Deputy Brennan advocating the opposite of private enterprise in regard to the western seaboard. I think that Deputy Brennan was correct, and the Minister thinks he is correct because he has followed the same course as Deputy Brennan advocated. Deputy Brennan like, I think, most Deputies in the House, understands that in regard to industrial development and the provision of employment in the congested areas it is most unlikely that we are going to induce private enterprise at least by any measures within our power, to undertake that task of establishing the industries and providing the employment. When Deputy Brennan accepts that as a reasonable assumption in respect to the congested districts, why then does he object to others of us formulating the same type of approach to problems in regard to the big industrial centres, and, possibly erroneously, coming to the same kind of conclusion, that private enterprise is not going to do this job even in relation to large centres like Dublin?  There are no fundamental differences.</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Brennan Mr. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>Capital is not available in one case and it is in the other.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesLarkin1943" hpid="Mr. Larkin Mr. Larkin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Larkin</NameTxt>
      <P>The capital is not available in many instances in Dublin for the job of industrial development and expansion that is necessary if we are to continue expanding; but I do not have to argue that.  The best advocate of that is sitting over on his bench there, the Minister himself, who has been told, I think on a very famous occasion, that the Fianna Fáil Government in fact has given more socialism to this country than the Labour Government did to England.  The only difference is that they have not got the advantages of calling it by its proper name and that they have gone through all the difficulties of trying to <Col N="1013" /> carry on what is in fact a system of public and socialist economic policy arising out of necessity under the guise of a system of private enterprise, which is in regard to this country very limited in its capabilities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Brennan Mr. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>He only stepped in where private enterprise could not undertake the job.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesLarkin1943" hpid="Mr. Larkin Mr. Larkin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Larkin</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, Deputy Brennan, at the moment anyway even I do not quarrel with that, and maybe I have even more advanced views than that. Nobody has come forward with the proposition that private enterprise, because of some belief in formulated socialist policy, has to be completely substituted by socialism.  Nobody has gone that far, but what has been suggested is that in our circumstances private enterprise is not capable of tackling the job as quickly and as radically in this country.  That does not mean that it is the fault of private enterprise, but of the conditions in which private enterprise has to operate. Certainly even if we fear that in certain industrial spheres private enterprise cannot undertake these tasks I think there is criticism to be made.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If the Department of Industry and Commerce takes as its main objective the making available, if you like to put it in that way, of the conditions for private enterprise to enter into and establish or extend industrial activities in this country, and provides various forms of encouragement devised to see that this is done, clearly it should be done in such forms as to make that encouragement effective.  I have not got very many contacts with businessmen that would give me very deep information about their private concerns, but I have had enough to know that one of their greatest complaints is that when they go to the Department with projects based on the principle of private enterprise it is almost as if they were trying to break into a besieged fortress, breaking through the red tape and the delay and the endless inquiries.  I have met a number of them who have taken the attitude that it would be a whole lot easier not to bother their heads any more about it and let somebody else take on the problem.  I recall one <Col N="1014" /> instance of a matter that Deputy Brennan is interested in with regard to the West, of an individual, not a native of this country, who was coming forward with a proposal and I had the pleasure&mdash;I do not know whether I should call it a pleasure&mdash;of sitting listening to him explaining to representatives of the Department what he had gone through up to that point.  I finally said that if it was my case I would have given up long ago.  He was trying to establish a small factory in Mayo.</P>
    <P>Even if we should now proceed on the assumption that private enterprise is to be afforded the main responsibility of bringing about further industrial expansion, further industrial uplift, and the absorption of our unemployed and surplus population, it still means that we have to examine in very great detail the manner in which we deal with that problem and the machinery available.</P>
    <P>I still frankly feel, though the word is very largely discredited in this House, that even if the Department of Industry and Commerce and the Minister are going to place the greatest emphasis on the activities of private enterprise there still could be a good deal more &ldquo;planned approach&rdquo; as to the manner in which private enterprise can take advantage of the conditions available here.  I frankly think that the system in the Department itself could be very much overhauled.  If we are trying to deal with business problems there must be some relaxation of the ordinary Civil Service procedure. This morning I was talking to a small businessman who was interested in a particular project.  He made inquiries from the Department and I do not know whether he is going any further in the matter, because, he said, &ldquo;after I wrote to the Department I got a letter back asking me for reams of staff statistics which will take me days, and possibly weeks, to collect in support of my submission, and then at the end I might get turned down.&rdquo;  Granted that a businessman has to make his case, all those statistics he was asked to collect are readily available to the Department and the Central Statistics Office and if a businessman has a proposition that has any merit that <Col N="1015" /> would justify consideration surely there is no reason why our civil servants should not get out the figures and see that they will sustain and support the case.</P>
    <P>My understanding is that while the I.D.A. give a great deal of assistance in regard to projects coming before the Department, in many instances where it is not a question of the establishment of new projects but probably of the alteration of existing provisions in regard to tariffs, quotas and so forth, a great deal of the statistical preparation has to be done by the individual businessman in order to secure any attention by the Department.</P>
    <P>I mentioned the I.D.A.  On a previous debate on this Estimate I said I thought the present Minister was correct when he changed the basis on which the authority was operating when he went back into office and relieved it of a great volume of routine work, which could more properly be discharged by the Department's officials themselves, and brought the I.D.A. back nearer to the original project of being both an advisory body and a body to study projects as a basis of formulating advice and guidance to the Minister.</P>
    <P>I do not know any more about the I.D.A. than any other member of the public.  The other day I asked the Minister if it would not be possible to publish something in the way of an annual report.  Granting that most of the matters coming before the I.D.A. are confidential, as between the authority and the particular individuals putting the matters before it, I think that at the end of 12 months it would be possible, with a due sense of discretion, to issue something in the way of an informative report.  That report would give information as to the general activities of the I.D.A. and, more important still, it would build up public confidence in the I.D.A.  I do not think that this country can expect one man to do the whole job.  Granted that the Minister is the type of genius that Deputy Brennan says he is, nevertheless he is still only one man.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1016" /> The study of modern industrial developments and the establishment of modern industrial concerns involve a whole wide range of technical knowledge and a special type of ability.  I think that the members of the I.D.A. have, on the whole, given satisfactory service, but for many reasons I think they have not been given the public credit they are due and that sufficient public confidence has not been built up in the I.D.A. to give it that status of authority which could make it of even greater help and assistance to the Minister.  I have attended certain meetings and I have heard ordinary workers complain and ask what the I.D.A. are doing about their particular problem, and it was a very proper question. I had to explain that the I.D.A. could not take any steps unless their organisation or the Minister asked them to do so.  Clearly, if we have this tremendous problem of trying to carry forward the impetus of industrial development and extend it to meet the figures I have mentioned earlier, it requires that there shall be a more planned approach to the problem and that bodies such as the I.D.A. will be made full use of and given all the facilities and assistance they may require.</P>
    <P>In connection with the I.D.A., we have another institute&mdash;the Institute of Industrial Research.  I notice that the Minister says that it is proposed to seek an increased grant over and above the £15,000 per annum at present provided.  Nobody would think that the Institute of Industrial Research could even open letters on a grant of £15,000 per year.  In this country we lack many of the resources of material that have been the basis of industrial development in other countries.  We are starting late in the race and we are suffering from many great handicaps.  Probably there can be no more important factor in our efforts to achieve industrial expansion than an institute such as the Institute of Industrial Research.  If we are to achieve industrial expansion, we have to find not merely gaps in this wall through which we can walk and find scope for development, but we have to find a new &ldquo;know-how&rdquo; and maybe a new technique and development.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1017" /> At the present time, we are spending less on this basic type of research than many small individual industrial companies in Britain and America are spending in relation to their purely industrial problems.  Even in Britain, where the amount spent on industrial research does not compare with what is spent in America, there are industrial concerns which are spending more than 100 times what this country is spending on industrial research and they are spending that money on their own specialised industry.  There are individual firms in Britain spending that much more than we are spending on our industrial research which is so important to the economy of the country.  The Minister should take his courage in his hands and go and look for a very much greater sum for that institute than that which he has in mind at present; I think he will have the support of the majority of the members of this House in that regard.  If the Minister or the I.D.A. approach the Institute of Industrial Research for technical advice on a particular problem, it is a physical impossibility for them to give that advice &mdash;and yet, the giving of that advice, and all that goes with it, may quite well mean the difference between the establishment of some industrial unit or the expansion of some existing unit.  Therefore, any sums we may spend on industrial research will immediately have benefits in so far as the employment of our people is concerned.</P>
    <P>Lately, there has been a growing emphasis on the importance of the export market.  It is interesting to note that the high hopes held out in regard to the dollar market have been somewhat douched by cold water during the past few weeks.  Nevertheless, there is still the emphasis and the statement has been made by the Minister and by spokesmen of various industries that many of our Irish industries can hope to maintain their present position, and improve it, only on the basis of their ability to enter the export market.  Exports in themselves, from the technical point of view of industry, may be desirable. Exports are desirable but there is another factor which we should not <Col N="1018" /> lose sight of.  I do not know of any Irish industry producing consumer goods in which our own people find their own needs being fully satisfied. In other words, our people could use more of these goods if they could buy them.  Take, for example, the boot and shoe industry.</P>
    <P>At the moment, we are exporting footwear to Britain and France.  We are doing that, not because all our people have got their full requirements in footwear, but because some of our people are going without footwear they could use if they could buy them. Therefore, there is the other problem of seeing whether our home market, which is protected for these industries, can be expanded in such a manner as to provide, if not the complete market for the product, at least a greatly increased market compared with that which is available at the moment. That revolves around the question of the purchasing power of our people. We have 52,000 persons unemployed at the moment.  We have unemployed single men trying to exist on a rate of benefit which, at the present value of money, represents a smaller sum than we provided for them in 1939. That shows that quite a large number of our people have practically no purchasing power at all.  In fact, it is a wonder how they live.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Larkin</NameTxt>
      <P>In 1939, we thought that a single man required 15/- per week when he was unemployed.  Now, in 1953, we think he is able to manage&mdash; in terms of 1939 money&mdash;on 10/3 per week.  Apparently, we have decided that his stomach has got a little smaller.  That, I may say in passing, is a reflection on our whole conception of social welfare and social security. Every man and woman out of work is another unit substracted from the real effective purchasing power in the country.  The great mass of men and women working for wages and salaries who find that their weekly or monthly income is not sufficient to meet their full domestic needs represent another section of the potential purchasing power in the country which is not at present available to our Irish industries.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1019" /> If we are to see an expansion of the Irish economy, we require both demand, that is, expanding demand, expanding purchasing power in the hands of the people, and additional capital to provide the additional productive forces.  From that point of view, we in the Labour Party find it difficult to follow the Minister's attitude on this question of the cost of living and the control of prices.  The Prices Advisory Body, so far as I understand, has practically been dormant, at least since January of this year.  I do not think it has even had a meeting, but I should be very glad to learn if it has.  There have been many suggestions made to it with regard to investigation into various prices and in many cases, beyond a formal acknowledgment, nothing further has been heard.  I know very well that the Minister does not like the Prices Advisory Body.  He has been quite frank about that and he mentioned in his speech that he is facing the problem, in line with other Ministers, of deciding by March next year whether to abolish our present temporary system of control and to substitute a more permanent form of legislation; but, in the meantime, there is a great mass of people facing the ordinary everyday problems of the cost of living, of how much it costs to live.</P>
    <P>The Minister says it is very satisfactory that the index figure has more or less remained stationary for some period, and has in fact dropped by one point, but it has remained stationary at a high figure, a figure which expresses in terms of living difficulties a growing problem for a great mass of people.  While all of us welcome the fact that the index figure has halted in its upward movement&mdash;we hope that it can start to move backwards&mdash;we should not lose sight of the fact that the recent increase in the figure, which to some extent was the outcome of political decisions by the Government which we need not argue out here again and also the result of ordinary changes in the price structure, took place not merely because there were increases in the prices given to Irish farmers for Irish products but also in regard to quite a large number of manufactured products.  The indices for food, clothing, <Col N="1020" /> fuel and light all moved up.  They moved up in a period when wholesale and import prices had fallen.</P>
    <P>I was reading to-day a statement wherein an Irish industrialist said that &ldquo;the only kind of control everybody in this country seems to want is control of profits and we hear stupid people&rdquo;&mdash;I do not know whether he was referring to me or not&mdash;&ldquo;saying that if we only wiped out profits, we could reduce prices tremendously.&rdquo;  I may be stupid, but I am not quite so stupid as that. I am also not so stupid as not to realise that there is something to look at there.  I do not propose to give the name of the firm because I do not want to pillory them, but the figures are taken from official sources and we find that this firm engaged in the distribution of essential building materials had a capital, actually subscribed, in 1936 of £50,000 and, from 1945 to 1952, its net profits totalled £351,000, that is, the actual investment was repaid seven times over in eight years.</P>
    <P>There is something to be looked at there even if we never dealt with prices and even if we still believe or accept that private enterprise is going to be the basis of our industrial structure. There is something to be inquired into, whether it be in the field of profits or prices, because I do not think one can be separated from the other. Prices, profits, wages and the various other categories that go to make up industrial costings are all matters that require consideration; but I am making the submission that, in relation to the price structure in this country, there is a need for the activities of the Prices Advisory Body and it is regrettable that it has not been much more active than it has.  We have stressed this point continually in the House.</P>
    <P>I have quoted one case.  Let me now quote a few more.  We have often mentioned the question of the issue of bonus shares and we are told that there is nothing immoral about it, that it is quite a normal feature of the finances of private concerns and that we should not make too great a hullabaloo about it.  We find, however, that, in the case of one firm, a capitalised bonus of 166? per cent. was paid in October, 1947, out of reserve for contingencies, <Col N="1021" /> which means that that company managed, not merely to pay its ordinary dividends but to put aside certain moneys into reserve for contingencies, which reserve, in 1947, had accumulated to such an extent that a total sum equal to 166 per cent. of the original capital was paid out to the shareholders, without any demand being made on the shareholders for the shares given to them.  In the case of another company, a capitalised bonus of 100 per cent. was paid out of reserves in May, 1952; in another, a capitalised bonus of 100 per cent. was paid in June, 1950; and in the case of a further company, a capitalised bonus of 300 per cent. was paid in 1938, of 125 per cent. in 1948 and of 27¾ per cent. in 1950.  These instances do not apply to every company, but they are significant, and they are becoming more numerous.</P>
    <P>When we look at the table of company profits, more and more we see a symbol set down referring to a note at the bottom, and more and more of these symbols turn out to be an explanation that a capitalised bonus was paid out.  In practically every case, there has been little or no diminution in the rate of dividend paid.  If a company pays 10 per cent. this year on £100,000 and, by an issue of bonus shares, makes that £100,000 £200,000, and next year earns the same net profit and pays 5 per cent., one may possibly not like it, but there is no basic change there that would immediately merit an inquiry, but when we find a company giving a capitalised bonus to the extent of 100 per cent. of its existing capital, having paid 10 per cent. last year, and paying 10 per cent. this year, there are then grounds for inquiry, without in any way suggesting that, in respect of Irish industry as a whole, there is profiteering or undue profit taking.</P>
    <P>We must emphasise, however, and I think Irish industrialists should be told it, that when they cry out against the subsidisation of food for the ordinary people, and particularly the provision of measures for social security for those who are unable to maintain themselves by reason of unemployment, sickness and so on, when <Col N="1022" /> they object to the State subsidising these individuals, they should be very sharply reminded that on the whole the most subsidised section of our community is the Irish industrialist. Granted that the Irish worker in these subsidised industries gets the benefits, too&mdash;nobody is quarrelling with that&mdash; but we should remember that we are each making our contribution, through our system of protective tariffs, for the benefit of these industries and that the benefit of our system of protective tariffs is being secured by those who have invested their money in Irish industry.  Therefore, Irish industry is not a complete system of private enterprise.</P>
    <P>I grant you that individuals have invested their money in the shares and in debenture stocks of these industries, but every single citizen of this country has also got an interest in every Irish industry operating behind a tariff wall and enjoying a protective duty.  They are paying for that interest every time they buy the products of that industry. Therefore, it is not unfair when we get instances of companies engaged in the production of essential products, such as those required in the building trade, or engaged in making consumer products, distributing these large blocks of bonus shares and maintaining their old rate of dividend, to ask that there should be an inquiry.  The Minister says that there is a continuous review of the profits of such companies by the Department.  I am not doubting that but it is not sufficient.  It is the public who are paying these duties and it is the public who should be assured, and to whom it should be made known whether in fact there is anything open to objection or anything to be corrected in the operation of these industries.</P>
    <P>The Prices Advisory Body could quite well of its own initiative not merely hold inquiries to see whether prices should be reduced&mdash;that may not always be the outcome of such inquiries&mdash;but they should hold inquiries to educate the public and to ascertain whether there is a good and satisfactory reason why these bonus shares have been distributed, why rates of dividend are being maintained on the <Col N="1023" /> increased capital and whether it can be shown that the company concerned is doing a good job, working under good conditions, paying proper rates of wages, making a good product and not securing an undue rate of profit. That is what the public ought to know and I doubt if the public will ever get that through the medium of a private inquiry conducted by the prices branch of the Department.</P>
    <P>That is why I think it is regrettable that a body such as the Prices Advisory Body is not made more use of. In 1947 the Minister had a Bill before the House which provided for a combination of price control and an inquiry into protected industries.  It was not a bad Bill in that sense although somewhat limited in its scope.  It is quite clear that there is something of that nature required if we are going to maintain public confidence not so much in Irish industry, because that has been established, but in the policy of continuing to operate such a system of industrial protection and support as requires every single citizen to share to some extent in the cost of maintaining and providing that system of protection. The members of the public, every man and woman from the youngest to the oldest, whether they be workers or employers, farmers or those engaged in industries, are entitled as of right, because they are all indirectly interested in Irish industry, to have these matters inquired into and to be satisfied that everything is fair as between the industrialist and consumer and that the system is operated to assist the future development of Irish industries generally.</P>
    <P>There are one or two other matters to which I should like to refer before I finish.  On and off during the year, I have asked the Minister by parliamentary question what has been the progress in regard to the building of a graving dock at the Port of Dublin. He has indicated, of course, that he has no direct responsibility, but inquiries made to the Port and Docks Board have not secured very much more information.  This graving dock is of such great importance, both to the Port of Dublin and to the Irish ship-building <Col N="1024" /> industry in general, that greater attention should be paid to the rate of progress in the erection of that dock.  From recollection, it seems to me that we must be now very near the completion date laid down in the contract. I frankly doubt very much if the completion date will be met, and I would ask the Minister, now that we have got so much unemployment in the City of Dublin, if it would not be possible to increase the labour force engaged on that dock.  I know myself from practical experience that on occasions, in the erection of this dock, the cost of which is something over £2,000,000, there have been less than 60 men working and nobody is able satisfactorily to explain why more men are not employed.  The port authority apparently is satisfied that they have no authority to intervene until a crisis arises, and if a crisis should arise it will mean that we shall have to take emergency measures to deal with the problem.</P>
    <P>The Minister referred to Irish Shipping. I do not want to broach this subject at the moment further than to say that I do not see the justification of one branch of Irish industrial development, which has been brought into being directly by the State through the generous support given it by industrial policy, itself refusing to give the same kind of support to another branch of Irish industry.  The attitude of Irish Shipping to Irish ship-building is not commendable.  We have a small shipyard in Dublin, and we have another one mainly for repairs in Rushbrooke.  They have to compete under tremendous difficulties with cross-Channel yards.  First of all, they are providing wage levels which are higher than those granted by their cross-Channel competitors, and they generally give better conditions to their workers.  They have to import all the materials for their work.  Yet they are able to keep within competing distances, as far as prices are concerned, with the cross-Channel yards.</P>
    <P>So far as workmanship is concerned I am satisfied that the workmanship on boats built in the Irish shipyards has proved far superior to that found on boats built across Channel.  Irish <Col N="1025" /> Shipping, while they expect to be given encouragement and support by Irish importers and Irish industrial interests generally, seem too prone to apply the rigid competitive yardstick to everybody else.  I do not want to go into its history but I do think that such an attitude of one native concern, especially a semi-State concern, to another similar concern is wrong and that in fact they should bend the twig the opposite way.  If there is a difference of £5,000, £10,000 or £12,000 in a tender for the building of an Irish merchant vessel, I frankly do not see why ways and means could not be found to make it possible for the Irish yard to secure that work.  A great many of our industries are subsidised. You cannot very well subsidise the building of a ship by putting on a protective tariff but you can recognise that the Irish ship-building industry is an essential industry struggling against many difficulties.  It is an old industry in Dublin and there are many young boys apprenticed to it who would like to continue in that industry. They naturally are anxious to see that there is some future for them in it.  It has got an excellent record in regard to ship-building from the standpoint of workmanship but you cannot maintain indefinitely a ship-building centre if there is no new work coming in and you are going to have only casual employment. The men engaged in the industry will not put up with that continually. You will have a continual rise and fall in the number in employment and, eventually, at some point when there is a big demand for repair work the men will not be there. They have not been there on occasions when certain work was available recently because of the lack of security for them in recent years.  Those two shipyards are very important as repair centres, but the workers in them are entitled to look forward to some continuity of employment, and continuity of employment in a shipyard can only be provided by new construction.</P>
    <P>I have no hesitation in saying that Irish Shipping, a semi-State concern, is not entitled to apply the same rigid competitive standard to the Irish ship-building industry as would normally be <Col N="1026" /> employed in the industrial world outside. I think the Minister should bear that in mind and convey it in a very strong manner to them.  Certain ships have been allocated to the Dublin yards in the present building programme of Irish Shipping, but things happened in the past which should not happen, and I hope they will not happen in future.</P>
    <P>I hope Irish Shipping will continue to develop its building programme and concentrate a bit more on the building of the smaller coastal type of vessels which can in time take over a greater share of our coastal traffic.  We have a very small share of it carried at present in Irish bottoms.  There is a field there for exploitation by Irish ships, particularly vessels of a tonnage which can get in and out of the small harbours in the West and South.  These vessels can not only be readily built by Dublin yards and by the yard in Rushbrooke if it is extended and equipped, but could be built at a cost which will not be prohibitive as against the cross-Channel prices, and they would certainly be built, I am satisfied, with a higher standard of workmanship and at least would be built by Irishmen and Irish yards.</P>
    <P>There is one matter which possibly the Minister might touch upon in his reply, although I am not clear whether it comes within his province, and that is in regard to the dead meat trade. Granted that it comes more directly under Agriculture, but it is a form of industrial activity, and the workers engaged in it are industrial workers.  I understand that there have been some 40 packing plants operating in the export of dead meat.  As far as I know, I may be wrong, practically all except one are shut at the moment.</P>
    <P>Around Dublin none of them are working, and the biggest development in that field, the new plant in Grand Canal Street, has had its domestic difficulties, but I think it has also had other difficulties like the other plants. That is an industry of immense importance to the whole economy. One Deputy referred to the importance of developing industries which had a direct link with agriculture, but no industry could have a more direct contact with agriculture than that <Col N="1027" /> engaged in the exportation of dead meat as it carries on the work of killing and dressing cattle.  That work is carried on here by Irish workers, all the by-products and the offals being handled in Ireland, and dead meat is shipped instead of meat on the hoof.  Some of these plants are very modern.  The latest one in Dublin is up to the standard of anything in any other country.  They are all at a standstill and it looks as if one more effort to establish and develop the dead meat trade in this country is running very close to a failure.  I hope it is not.</P>
    <P>Granted that the problem does not find its origin within the immediate field of the Minister or the remedy lie in his hands, being largely due to the price of cattle.  But the Minister is not only Minister for Industry and Commerce but also Tánaiste, and because he is Minister for Industry and Commerce he probably carries a greater responsibility in regard to these matters than any other Minister. I urge that he and the Minister for Agriculture and the Government should give immediate and special attention to this problem of securing the reopening and the restarting of activities in the plants engaged in this trade.</P>
    <P>It is a most serious matter.  A great number of workers, I imagine something in the region of 4,000, must have been earning a good livelihood in these 40 plants.  They were earning on the whole not only good wages but high wages.  It would be regrettable not merely if these workers should not find employment again at this period but, even more important still, if this one further effort to establish this type of export trade should again meet with failure.  As I say, the price of cattle is not a matter that we can discuss and settle, but this is a matter which we can ask to be considered by the Minister in particular.</P>
    <P>Finally, the Labour Court comes within the purview of this Estimate.  It has been rather quiet of late because probably we have not given it too much work.  But I want to touch on this point because it is a matter personal <Col N="1028" /> to the Minister.  When the legislation establishing the court was going through the House, the question was raised as to the extension of a similar type of machinery to the employees of local authorities.  There was a definite undertaking given by the Minister that when we had experience of the operations of the Labour Court and how it functioned and found it was a success the problem of applying in principle a similar type of machinery to local authorities would be studied.  I am not raising a question of Party politics in this, but that statement was made in 1946 and there have been Ministers of various Parties sitting on the Front Bench since but that undertaking has not yet been given effect to.  The result is that we have a large body of employees of local authorities who are denied the ordinary elementary rights of having acceptable arbitration and conciliation machinery made available. I ask the Minister to look over the reports of the debates at the time we were establishing this court to see if my recollection is not correct and he may feel that not only has he got a personal responsibility but that there has been one devolving on Deputies since 1946 which has not yet been discharged.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RichardBarry" hpid="Mr. Barry Mr. Barry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>Much has been said during the course of this debate on the Estimate of the Minister for Industry and Commerce on international and national economy.  I am going to ask your indulgence and the indulgence of the House for a few moments to touch on what I will describe as a local economy.  Since I became a member of this House a short while ago I have made on one occasion a special and particular plea for the town which I have the honour to represent in Dáil Eireann and I am going to reiterate now, in the presence of the Minister for Industry and Commerce, the plea that I made then.  I was sent here from a constituency, and from a town called Fermoy which was famous at one time, and its fame dimmed owing to something which should make the Minister for Industry and Commerce think about it now.  It was famous then because it was a garrison town.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1029" /> Strange as it may seem, even though it was a garrison town, the pockets of the business people were full then.  In many cases these people are not there at all now.  Even though Fermoy was a garrison town and did well out of the headquartering of the British military there, Fermoy took its place in the fight for Irish freedom.  It was in the vanguard of the fight for Irish freedom. I respectfully suggest to the Minister that this town has been sadly neglected by successive Governments since the going out of the British military. If I am the first Deputy to come into Dáil Eireann from Fermoy for 27 years I think I would be remiss in my duties if I did not make a claim here, especially when the Vote for the Department of Industry and Commerce comes before the House, for the town of Fermoy which did so much for Ireland and for the liberties which we all enjoy now.</P>
    <P>When the Minister made his opening statement a few days ago, he said&mdash; and I was glad to hear him say it&mdash; that there was in contemplation the establishment of factories throughout Ireland.  I seriously and conscientiously suggest to him now to give special consideration to the plight of the people of the town of Fermoy which is a town he knows and which he knows is sadly neglected.  Not one factory has been established in the town of Fermoy for the past 25 years.  I know it is true to say, as the Minister said, in reply to a question asked in the Dáil a few days ago, that there is a factory being erected there now.  So there is.  That factory will, in my opinion, as chairman of the Fermoy Urban Council, employ about 20 people most of whom will be females.  I still do not think that is proper treatment for a town that did so much and lost so much by the departure of the British.</P>
    <P>I know the Minister for Industry and Commerce&mdash;and I will say this as a member of the Opposition&mdash;to be a man who will, if he can, help provincial towns which have done something to make Ireland what young men like myself know it to be to-day.  I heard Deputy Corry, for whom I have some regard, say this evening that Fermoy <Col N="1030" /> was neglected.  I know, too, that Deputy Corry was very lax about his fight for Fermoy until Deputy Barry came into the Dail.</P>
    <P>Without going into personalities, I know that during the past 18 or 20 years something over 200 factories were doled out by the Fianna Fáil Government and I still fail to see why there was not one substantial industry established in the town of Fermoy or why one person was not put into gainful employment as a result of any activity on the part of the then Government.</P>
    <P>Before I ever became a member of this House, I had reason, as a member of the Fermoy Development Association, to approach the I.D.A. in Stephen's Green.  I think it was a good thing that the I.D.A. was set up but I now suggest to the Minister that its activities are too limited.  I came up on two or three different occasions with other people from Fermoy seeking information in regard to the establishment of industries.  We discussed with higher officials of that authority the possibilities of starting industries in towns like Fermoy.  We were satisfied with the talks we had and we thought the officials were sympathetic towards our case.  When we left, however, we found that nothing happened.</P>
    <P>Instead of those people staying inside the premises of the I.D.A. at Stephen's Green, Dublin, they ought to be sent to provincial towns like Fermoy, Mitchelstown, Cobh, Youghal and other towns to find out the needs of those towns in regard to factories and the type of factories suitable.  I think the scope of the I.D.A. is too limited.  I know the Minister will tell me that it is up to the people themselves to start factories in the different towns.  There are many influential people in those towns who would take heed of the officials coming out and explaining to them the possibilities of factories being established.  They would take more heed of them than they would of people like me and other Deputies.</P>
    <P>While I agree that the setting up of the I.D.A. was for the betterment of Irish industry, I suggest that by sitting <Col N="1031" /> inside the premises in Stephen's Green they are doing very little to promote Irish industrial activity.  Whatever scheme is devised by the Minister, I think the people in the I.D.A. should be sent out to establish contact with the people in the different provincial towns.  Every one of us knows that most provincial towns are struggling for existence at the present time.</P>
    <P>In the course of the debate this evening someone mentioned the question of decentralisation.  Everyone in the country is aware of the problem of decentralisation. Might I suggest to the Minister that henceforward no industry be started in the City of Dublin? Everyone admits and agrees that it is top-heavy.  Enter Dublin from any direction and you are met by factories. At the same time we, who come up to Dublin, try to make a case for the provincial towns.  I rose especially to suggest to the Minister that henceforward, until he is satisfied at least that the provincial towns are kept on their feet by the establishment of industries, no factories of any kind be added to this abominable and abnormal list of factories we have in Dublin.  I have already made a special plea for Fermoy.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>Many towns, as well as Fermoy, that were garrison towns in the old days have suffered much from the freedom we have achieved.  I make a special plea for those provincial towns which have lost by our freedom. With regard to the town of Fermoy, there is at the moment an unemployment problem there.  I have never seen it as bad for the past 25 years.  Whatever the Minister may say about the recession and depression in trade being improved, I personally cannot see it in the town of Fermoy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>During the past month, four old-established premises were advertised for sale.  If the recession and the depression in trade has improved, that would not be the case.  I am not particularly <Col N="1032" /> referring to Fermoy in this connection.  I know the same position obtains in other towns, especially in East Cork.</P>
    <P>I hope the Minister will take special cognisance of the fact that Fermoy is sadly lacking in industries.  He has already mentioned in his opening statement that a number of factories were to be started in the near future. It was amusing but disappointing for a Corkman to listen to Deputies Corry and Hickey talk to one another across the floor of the House about the establishment of an airport in Cork.  It was more amusing still, to me in any case, to see another Corkman, Deputy Jack Lynch, who was deputising for the Minister, listening to them.  Before ever I became a member of this House, I believed that everything was done by the members of the Cork County Council and by the local representatives of the different Parties for the establishment of an airport in Cork. Now, whether it be Midleton or Farmers' Cross that was thought of long before now, we had a statement from the Minister during the week, in reply to a question, that the report was before him and that he was giving it his consideration.  It is too late now for Deputy Corry or Deputy Hickey to be talking as to whether the airport should be in Fermoy, Midleton or Farmers' Cross.  The report is there, and I believe the Minister will give it his favourable consideration.  He will decide which is the more advisable site.  Speaking as an East Cork man and without any meteorological experience, I believe, personally, that Ahenesk, Midleton, would be the ideal solution of this problem.  I hope that the Minister, in spite of the controversies that we have seen in this House between Deputy Corry and Deputy Hickey, will give Midleton at least a fair trial in this regard.</P>
    <P>I agree with Deputy Brennan when he said that Deputies, no matter on what side of the House they sat, should congratulate the Minister on his efforts to foster industry here.  I definitely do so.  The only fault I have to find with him is in regard to this problem of centralisation in Dublin. There is no doubt whatever but that <Col N="1033" /> many industries have been started over a number of years.  I give the Minister for Industry and Commerce all the credit that is due to him for that.  I think that any Minister, no matter what Party he belonged to, is justly entitled to the credit due to him for work of that kind.  I have done my best to make a case for the provincial towns, and for Fermoy in particular.</P>
    <P>I should like to remind Deputies of the speech I made here on the 22nd July last, in the course of which I made a plea for brevity in speeches. I am glad to note that in some cases my plea met with a good response, but I am disappointed to know that in many cases it did not.  If some Deputies continue to make ridiculously long speeches, I propose to ask them, through the Chair, to be more brief in what they have to say.  In conclusion, I would ask the Minister's special consideration for the points which I have mentioned.  If the Minister does that, I believe that as a Minister in the Republic of Ireland, and no matter what Party he represents his efforts will be justly appreciated.</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Major de Valera Major de Valera">
      <NameTxt>Major de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>We are already familiar with the general pattern which might be summarised in this way, that in a period of 20 years there has been a revival of industrial activity in this country which must be regarded as satisfactory, and that after the depression of the war years, because it did amount to a depression in that sense, there came a recovery which enables one to make the statement that I have made, that industrial development heretofore must be regarded as reasonably satisfactory.</P>
      <P>In addition to that, not only has there been a rise in industrial output but, corresponding to it, there has been a marked increase in the numbers engaged in employment and industry. Therefore, from two points of view the picture is creditable, and I think everybody will admit that a very large part of the credit indeed for that achievement must go to the Minister who is the present Minister for Industry and Commerce as it was he who initiated the drive and piloted it through very difficult years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1034" /> It would be tedious to delay by going through figures in that regard, but whether you take gross output, net output or employment content, there has been a substantial advance made in this sphere.  It does make one, however, ask: what is the future for industrial development in this country, and there, I think, there is room for thought.  Twenty years ago, when Deputy Lemass assumed office as Minister for Industry and Commerce, there was a certain field available for immediate attack, and through the efforts that have been made these particular gaps have been largely filled.</P>
    <P>The question is, how far we can, and on what lines, we should go ahead for the future.  Now, in the first instance, in regard to what has been done and what can be done, you have this problem that we are&mdash;I think the phrase was used by Deputy Larkin&mdash; starting rather late in the race.  The competition for exports and export markets is already exceedingly keen in the world in regard to manufactured goods, particularly manufactured goods which are most commonly in demand and which are consumed in the greatest quantities in the world.  The competition is so great that the handicap imposed on us by starting late in the race is likely to tell, and, in fact, has been telling.  The resources of nations and peoples who started earlier in the race are very often greater than ours, and were marshalled earlier.  Consequently, in this intense competition, in the organisation of the world as we know it to-day, the big industrial powers, with all their equipment and capacity, have an advantage.  There is one thing, in particular, that will be difficult for us in industrial expansion and we had better realise it&mdash;I think it is realised &mdash;and it is this, that the more we can market and the bigger the output within certain limits the more favourably we are placed because within these limits overhead costs do not rise in proportion.  Whether an industry is economic or not may depend on this factor.</P>
    <P>That problem is there and it seems to me that it is going to impose a limit; in other words, you cannot hope <Col N="1035" /> to go in for big manufacturing industries that will be able to live on very considerable exports.  Then, there is the question whether the quantity that can be consumed at home will suffice for economic operation.  When you are going to be denied the chance or when you have not very much hope of exporting in a number of lines on a competitive basis, you will not easily get a basis for industry in these lines on consumer capacity at home.</P>
    <P>What Deputy Larkin said in that regard may go very well for a number of commodities, but it will not go for quite a number of others.  As regards the production of a lot of the commodities we consume here, take clothing and footwear, we have largely filled the gap which was there.  That has been a real contribution and a really important thing in our industrial life, but we have come more or less to the limit of possible expansion along those lines. We are virtually denied the possibility of going into big industries such as that of motor cars for export or similar industries such as the bigger countries depend on.  The problem then is to see what is the future and what is the outlook for our industrial development.</P>
    <P>In order to do that I think we must get right back to the basis.  Fundamentally we must regard the problem as one of developing our agriculture and our agricultural economy.  Mere indiscriminate industrialisation is not going to be a workable answer.  It is a question of tying in our industrial development with our main source of wealth, our real basic industry, agriculture, and the development of agricultural production.  In the world as it is to-day in regard to trade, the real basis of our export trade must be agricultural production.  By all means, if there are other lines&mdash;and there will be other lines&mdash;let us develop them. Let me not be construed as decrying industrialisation that can foster these other lines and bring profits.  What I am trying to do is to bring things into perspective.  There will be other lines; we have Waterford glass being produced again, and I am sure other such enterprises will be developed.  We <Col N="1036" /> have Irish whiskey which possibly could be developed into a useful export, but the main export must be, has been and probably will be, agricultural produce.</P>
    <P>The future for agricultural production seems reasonably good in so far as one can judge from current and recent reports about food production in the world.  Our industrial development should go on with a view to that basic set-up.  If that is so, industries connected with agriculture&mdash;to service the farmers' agricultural machinery, to make available materials like fertilisers which the agriculturist needs &mdash;or on the other hand, industries such as the canning industry which is processing products of the farmer or the condensed milk industry, all these things fit very naturally into the picture and are extremely important.  Our future development will lie more naturally along these lines than on those of building industries of another type.  As I have said already, our potentialities in regard to producing goods consumed at home, such as footwear and clothing, have been already exploited almost to the full.</P>
    <P>With that background there are, of course, some gaps to be filled still.  In order to balance things up they should be attended to ; we should try as far as possible to relate them to our main purpose.  Two of the gaps that are there are: an industry approximating to a heavy engineering or semi-heavy engineering enterprise; and an industry producing the chemicals required, and certain other raw materials, too, for agriculture.</P>
    <P>In regard to this second requirement, it is very welcome news to hear that this question is again being actively considered, that after the good work done by Bord na Móna, the Sugar Company and so on, we are more actively thinking of industry in relation to agriculture and to the possible production of fertilisers.  I know there are many problems involved in that, and that we have only had the announcement that the matter is being actively considered.  However, it was being considered back in 1948 and was then in abeyance for a number of <Col N="1037" /> years.  It is good to hear of this project again.  This is one of the ways in which to step up agricultural production, to make agriculture self-supporting so that you are not relying on imports as the basis of agriculture. That is a move in the right direction and I mention it now as something very commendable and also conducive to industrial expansion.  From it will flow other industrial activities in the satisfaction of the demand for other industrial goods as sidelines arising more or less naturally in contradistinction to setting up industries without relating them to the economy of the country as a whole.  Of course that is for more detailed discussion on another occasion when the Minister is in a position to give us more information. It is sufficient to say that it is very gratifying to hear that news.  The idea is fundamentally sound and the Minister is to be congratulated on taking that line.</P>
    <P>The other matter is a sore point.  It is a pity that in connection with our railway problem, and so on, one opportunity has been let slip in the past which could have provided an approach towards this difficult problem of a heavy industry.  Again the arguments against the heavy industries are the ones I mentioned earlier in regard to our consumer capacity at home and the impossibility of securing an export outlet for an industry of that nature.  Two aspects of the problem are that, <i>per se</i>, such an industry would be uneconomic but fortunately, as in the case of the chemical industry, relating it to the economy as a whole. an approximation to the solution of the problem could be found.</P>
    <P>Some approximation could have been got by developing our railway workshops, but unfortunately the Inchicore chassis factory was abandoned and the machinery sold.  There is a gap there to be filled, a lot of water has flowed under the bridge, time has passed and the nature of that problem will probably change and the desirable solution will change with the times.  Let us hope that some time in the future that and similar other gaps will be filled.</P>
    <P>Over all, the position is that we have now reached a stage in our industrial <Col N="1038" /> development where there is natural expansion in certain lines, in certain types of goods such as clothing and footwear, but where already the need has been more or less met and it is a question of keeping those industries going and keeping them economic. That has happened in a large number of spheres in the years that have passed.  The opportunities for that type of development naturally and spontaneously are passing as the demand or opportunity for them is saturated.  That seems to bring us to direct State intervention for the setting up of the bigger type of industry and the fundamental type of industry that still has to be supplied here.  We should recollect that much of the industrial development that has gone on has been to a certain extent secondary.  We have developed industries here but very often they would be classed more or less as secondary&mdash; either secondary in importance from the point of view of relating the product to other products consumed by the community or secondary in the sense that they are dependent on other products which are not processed here or on raw materials which are not produced here by the community.</P>
    <P>We still have largely the question of producing basic requirements. Fertilisers are a typical example.  In the past is has been easy to stimulate private enterprise to put up the capital for industries and they have been successful as the record shows and they continue to be successful.  If you take even the last years on the record, you will find that their gross output, employment content and net output are increasing in spite of the talk that has been going on here&mdash;and which must frighten anybody who has any capital to invest in industry. Incidentally, that is one of the dangers of talking indiscriminately or irresponsibly about private enterprise and the funds going into it.  You are putting the load right back on the State and rather frightening off people who might be prepared to invest, if you press that line too far.  These industries were founded largely by private enterprise. Some of them had certain tariff protection, some of them had encouragement from the Department and had <Col N="1039" /> certain advice, but basically most of them were private enterprises.  They have been successful and have flourished, they have given services to the community, they have given employment and have contributed very largely to redressing a position where this country was too dependent on outsiders.</P>
    <P>As I have said, a cursory glance at the present situation seems to suggest that that particular form of development is likely to slow down rather than increase in the future&mdash;either because of saturation or because the projects that still remain to be tackled economically are too big.  It is there we will have to face, before we can go any further, such things as power expansion.  If you can expand your power supply and particularly if you can cheapen the power output, in other words, make cheap power available, you will do an awful lot to help the smaller type of industry, the type that private enterprise is likely to undertake, and you go a long way towards making it economic.  That development can be undertaken only with State aid, as in the case of the E.S.B. and Bord na Móna.  The development of Bord na Móna along the lines it is going is another example.  If we come to the bigger things I have mentioned, like fertilisers, there is no option but to proceed on somewhat similar lines.  It is going to be futile to hope for development of that nature carried out by private enterprise alone.</P>
    <P>On the other hand, as the Minister said here, the fact is that private enterprise will always be more efficient &mdash;efficient in the sense that the return for the output in expenditure will be greater.  That seems to be the universal experience.  A firm run on private or semi-private lines will show profits more regularly and will become economic more readily than the public institution.  Nationalisation has this unfortunate drawback that it tends to be uneconomic.  Let us face that fact, no matter what our views may be on nationalisation or socialisation.  The experience in Britain and our experience here is very definite&mdash;that private enterprises, or at least organisations <Col N="1040" /> which are run on the lines of private enterprise companies, are likely to be more economic and more efficient than public ones.  Whether you take an example at home or an example from Britain, where there have been some recent experiments, I think that conclusion is valid.  If that is so, the prospect and the policy for the future seems to be that in certain major regards, such as continuing power expansion, the developments that could be summed up in the words, &ldquo;Bord na Móna&rdquo;, the developments that are being sponsored by the Irish Sugar Company in some respects, the developments which are envisaged in regard to fertilisers, the manufacture of basic chemicals for fertilisers, such projects will have to be initiated and stimulated and given continued attention by the State.  I think we have no choice, as we are placed, about taking that view and operating that view, as we have done heretofore, or else going without.</P>
    <P>After that, the emphasis and the effort should be on the off-shoots, wherever possible, of a particular industry, whether they are off-shoots, derivatives or are subsidiaries; and they should be, as far as possible, on the private enterprise basis.  That is likely to give the best return to the community and nationalisation is to be avoided as far as possible.  In certain cases, where some form of it is required, it is better that it should be done in even an indirect way, as it has been done in some cases, rather than through direct running by the State.</P>
    <P>We have certainly developed industry in a creditable way in 20 years, notwithstanding the war and all the setbacks it involved, particularly for industry.  There is a future for industry, but we have reached the point on the road where the picture has to be looked on as a whole, where we have to orient the new projects in relation to our basic economy, which is largely agricultural.  Thereafter, the more we achieve, the more of necessity must come a limit to the potentialities of industrial expansion, and we shall then have to look towards agricultural expansion and mobilise the resources of industry to agriculture as far as possible <Col N="1041" /> in order to safeguard our economic future.</P>
    <P>Several Deputies have stressed the employment problem.  That, again, has to be related to facts.  Industrialisation has given us a certain blottingpad, so to speak, for unemployment, and the numbers engaged in industrial activities have certainly increased. The numbers engaged in production have increased.  There has, however, been a decline in the numbers employed on the land&mdash;that has already been pointed out&mdash;but there we are up against the fact that the mechanisation of agriculture must of necessity tend in that direction.</P>
    <P>The situation in the building trade must give us some cause for thought because our present rate of building cannot go on for ever.  At some stage we shall complete the programme. There is still work to be done, but it is not too soon to start thinking of the future in that direction and to examine the position from the point of view of the transfer of that labour force into some other activity.  We have all talked about this employment problem and it is not easy to see where one can absorb that force as things are.  One thing that has been attempted here in Dublin to some extent is an effort to stimulate local work.</P>
    <P>That can be done but that is only a palliative.  So far as the building industry is concerned it must, in the last analysis, be a question of deciding ultimately in what work one can absorb the present labour force all over the country.  I am not quite so sure whether on that basis certain long term development projects might not be considered.  The main difficulty is that we have already reached the stage where we seem to be expanding beyond saving capacity; in other words, we will have to work a little harder and get a lot more out of ourselves to achieve the development we desire.</P>
    <P>The Minister mentioned, and I am not quite clear on the point, the proposal to make available for C.I.E. a sum of £10,000,000.  If I understood him correctly, he said that the result of this allocation would be roughly <Col N="1042" /> to wipe out the existing deficit.  I am not altogether satisfied that a proposal of that nature at this stage is entirely economic.  If one makes available £10,000,000 now merely to wipe out an annual loss for a certain foreseeable future it seems to me to be capitalising the debt without any great guarantee of financial stability for the future.  I am afraid we must face the fact here that one of the chief difficulties in regard to C.I.E and public transport generally has been the cost of the undertaking itself and the cost involved in its organisation. I see very little hope of rationalising the position unless we face up to that problem.  What are the costs and what rate of overheads does it carry for the earnable return? If these overheads cannot be covered by that return, then there is only one answer.  We may adopt some artificial device such as the diversion of traffic unnaturally&mdash;there may be natural and workable arrangements&mdash;into the railway system.  But that will not bring the results we want to achieve.  That merely introduces further and greater complications.  It is very difficult to know what is the best thing to do</P>
    <P>There has been one move after another in regard to this transport system.  We were told four or five years ago that the answer had been found.  A new arrangement was formulated and the former chairman went.  We were assured we would have a new era of profit, stability and efficiency.  That has not come and frankly I am pessimistic about the outlook in regard to that organisation unless we are prepared to face the fundamental problems.  Those problems are so many and so varied that a onesided approach to their solution will not be enough.  I must confess I cannot see what the solution is.</P>
    <P>Deputy Larkin, as usual, made a reasoned and interesting contribution to the debate but I am in some difficulty in dealing with one particular point raised by him because our fundamental approach is different.  Deputy Larkin's approach is frankly socialistic; the State should control and intervene actively in practically every phase of our economic life.  I differ from him in that and, from that point <Col N="1043" /> of view, it is somewhat difficult to join issue with him.  In relation to his comments on industry, he quoted cases of Irish industries which had issued bonus shares.  From his point of view, that is the socialistic point of view, he made a sustainable case.  He cited a firm that had so much capital so many years ago.  It issued bonus shares.  It has in effect doubled its capital but it still pays the same rate of interest. Having made that statement, he left it to us to conclude that this was a shocking state of affairs and should not be allowed to continue.  It may be a shocking state of affairs from a socialistic point of view but let us look at it from another point of view.  I am trying to look at it fairly.  I do not suggest that there was any element of unfairness in the way in which Deputy Larkin formulated his case but I want to be fair on the basis of what happened in that transaction.  Supposing you go back to 1939 or 1938 and take somebody who put £100 into a business and the business prospers.  Omission No. 1 in Deputy Larkin's argument is that the whole increase in the value of that business and in profits when reckoned in money is not completely due to the output of employees which he seemed to have in mind.  It is also directly related to the change in money values.  Take that particular business at the present time in its value, assuming that it has maintained its real actual value, as in 1939 and no more, it has in terms of money value doubled because of the relative change in money values over that period.  On that basis alone it is equitable and very correct to say that the capital value of that concern has doubled.  If the capital value of that concern has doubled, what is wrong with issuing a bonus share to its equivalent?</P>
    <P>Now let me come to the earning side. Supposing a man put £100 into that business as capital in 1939 and was earning 10 per cent., he got £10 dividend a year.  If it remained £100 and the firm was in the same way to-day he would still get £10, but that £10 is now worth only half what it was worth. It would be very fair to leave it that way if the pattern was the same all over.  I have already shown the appreciation <Col N="1044" /> in connection with the value of the firm merely on the basis that things remained static, but let us recollect that during that period wages of employees and of everybody else deriving profit from that firm have gone up.</P>

      <P>I know the Deputy and others would try to represent me as a friend of the capitalist, but I may be talking for the widow who had a few stocks and shares or for many orphanages and convents and other people who have money invested in this country which went a long way towards helping industrial expansion. The point I want to make is, if values have changed and wages have gone up, what is wrong with the man who had £100 in 1940 or before and put it into a business on the basis that he was getting 10 per cent., getting £20 now? Would it not be only keeping him in level with the other increases that the wage earners in the industry and elsewhere have got?</P>
      <P>I am stressing that point out of fairness, because I know a lot of us are very shy to defend justice in these quarters when it is necessary.  We should not be.  It is a question of elementary justice, that is, of course, if you accept the system.</P>
      <P>I know that there are other problems involved in the long-term view of money and capital.  They are of a different nature altogether.  But, to suggest that because the value in money of profits has doubled in that particular period, and to leave that by itself, without pointing to the fact that the value of output and wages has approximately doubled, is, to say the least of it, giving an incomplete picture. Provided we have the complete picture, I am prepared to argue with other people about other factors in the situation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In regard to profits, also, this much must be borne in mind: there is a lot of talk about the profits of industry and the profits to the investor but, in <Col N="1045" /> fact, is there a number of people in this State who are getting away with murder, as some people would suggest, and what murder are they getting away with?  To draw that conclusion from the balances as shown in company balance sheets is a very hasty thing to do because, first, the profits shown are practically invariably in the main applied one way or the other back into the community.  First of all, any firm, under the system as it is, needs to make substantial profit to live and to continue living.  That is elementary. The putting of money back in reserve one way or another is a necessity for continuity in most businesses.  The actual profits distributed, overall, will not be found to go far out of relation with the change in the wage picture. Secondly, if certain people do earn more than others, that is going back to the community.  Here again, of course, we have to face the socialist approach.  If the socialist wants to level everybody, there is no answer to that but, if you have a gradation, that gradation is not without its advantages. Remember that the money that is earned is largely money spent.  The people who get that money put it back, even if they only put it back to maintaining people in employment in the semi-luxury class of trade.  We hear a lot of talk here about big motor cars, about the hotels, and so forth.  A lot of it cannot be substantiated.  Even if it could be substantiated, a fact should be taken into account which frequently is not taken into account, that that very activity is providing employment and is a means of circulating money. The people who have been talking about motor cars or other things like that, would be the most shocked in the world if something were to happen on the lines that they have been suggesting and they found that so many people were out of employment in the motor trade or some trade like that.</P>
    <P>Let us not forget that this whole system is not without its advantages. As far as I can see, there are no grounds for the innuendo, and sometimes the direct statement that the profits earned in industry are excessive. In any event, the revenue <Col N="1046" /> authorities take their share of these, and most of that money is finding its way back into industry or commerce in some form or other and is doing its job.</P>
    <P>I feel compelled to make these remarks in view of the picture given by Deputy Larkin here to-night.  It is difficult to argue because, if I were to approach it on the same frankly socialistic basis as Deputy Larkin does, very possibly I would find an answer much nearer agreement with him than I am finding now but, in giving the answer I am giving now, I do not want in any way to be construed as, shall I say, a high Tory.  There is an old saying, a Latin tag, <i>In media stat virtus</i>&mdash;in the middle is virtue.  That is the way in life.  If somebody goes far too much to the Left, to bring the whole picture back to the middle you have the complexion of going a little too far Right yourself.  I move to report progress.</P>

    <Title>Private Members' Business. - Valuation Bill, 1953&mdash;Second Stage (Resumed).</Title>
    <P>Question again proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time&rdquo;.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMacCarthy" hpid="Mr. MacCarthy Mr. MacCarthy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacCarthy</NameTxt>
      <P>The Bill was introduced to the House as a measure to produce great and important changes. Not only was it alleged that the measure was good and beneficial in itself but it was also suggested that it had been the basis for urging the Government to make an announcement that they were soon to deal with the valuation question themselves.  So certain was the chief Opposition on that point that they said they had examined the relative dates and could make a case on that point; but very soon, because of the defects of the measure not only in itself and in what it proposed to do but in the way it would interfere with existing legislation in a detrimental way, the sponsors of the Bill were inclined to make apologies for it and to offer to <Col N="1047" /> withdraw it if the Government would take over the problem.  Now this valuation question, owing to certain inequalities and injustices which came to my knowledge as head of the public health administration in one of the cities in this State, has made this a very burning question for me for some years past; and surely it is in the knowledge of most of us that at the annual meeting of the Municipal Authorities Association of Ireland in Arklow a couple of years ago this question was discussed very fully.</P>
      <P>As the members of the House know, when the records of these annual meetings are prepared and published the chief contents are brought to the Minister for Local Government for his information and attention, and that was done in this case.  This problem has been under examination for some time in Government circles, and the public discussion of the matter and the further impetus that was given to it by public representatives here in Dublin brought an announcement from the Government that they had the problem under examination, and that in due course they were providing legislation in a comprehensive way to deal with it, and not in a partial or haphazard fashion.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If there has been any rush in this case, to my mind the defects of the Bill which has been introduced show that there must have been some rush on the part of those who submitted that measure to the House.  It is a very important question for the country, and dealing with it in a partial or haphazard way is not going to solve it. We have people in every walk of life affected by it in my experience such as the humble dweller who, in one case that I will cite, when his son was getting married put an improved window on his dwelling, tidied up and plastered the house to make it a substantial dwelling&mdash;a humble one indeed &mdash;in the suburbs of a southern city that I represent.  The result was that the valuation of that dwelling, even though no extra space had been taken in, the main structure had not been in any way altered except just for an improvement of the outside of the building <Col N="1048" /> by the insertion of a bigger and better window, was increased by approximately 50 per cent To my mind nothing worse could have happened in the old landlord days than a thing like that.  If a reasonable increase, a small increase, had been put on nobody would have cavilled at it, but an increase of practically 50 per cent.!</P>
    <P>Another case I will cite is that of a skilled family of about eight members who had carried on for a number of years the manufacture of iron gates and things of that kind, ornamental iron work of various kinds.  In the expansion of buildings and in the improvement of schools and churches and other things there was an improvement in the business of that firm, and when I called attention to it I was told that that building had last been valued away back in the late 80's or something like that, and that was the only excuse given for it.</P>
    <P>There was another instance where a shopkeeper&mdash;and the Bill now introduced proposes to deal with these problems&mdash;had a shop which was divided downstairs into a number of small rooms or apartments.  In order to give more space to his customers and a better appearance to the shop he removed some of those partitions and put standards instead to support the building, and his valuation went up 100 per cent., although it only meant a few coats of paint on decoration and the removal of some partition walls.</P>
    <P>Now I am making a case not for this Bill but a case for what is to follow, a case for the deficiencies of the Bill and the cases which should be dealt with.  Our rate collectors were castigated here because they reported these matters.  It is in the terms of their appointment that they have to do it under penalty, consequently if they see any improvement of that kind or anything relating in their minds to what should be increased valuation they report it to the local authority. The local authority was mentioned last night, and I want here and now to absolve the local representatives from any responsibility in administering that system.  The public authority in <Col N="1049" /> this case is the city or county manager. And that is not the worst aspect of the case.  The matter is reported to them, an inspection is made of the premises, and the result is that the owners are for some time awaiting the result of that examination.  The first they see of it in most cases, in the county or the city that I represent at any rate, is when the blue books come down to the local authority from the valuation offices, the demand notes are prepared and sent out.  It is then that the owner of the property sees the new bill he has to face.</P>
    <P>He has a certain time to appeal but he has to pay the demand that is made on him there and then, either in two moieties or in one moiety, as the case may be.  He can appeal, but within 21 days or something of that sort; but whatever the end of his appeal may be, there and then he had to pay up to the following March on the new valuation set on his property.  If he succeeds in his appeal he might get relief in the following year.</P>
    <P>The principal result of that kind of system is that they are so disgusted with the whole procedure that they let it go by default.  Very often people go to the courts.  On one occasion I remember that half a page of the <i>Examiner</i> was given over to court actions in connection with the assessment of valuations.  Wherever any kind of considerable relief was given by the court, costs were given against the valuation authorities.  Where the change was small, no costs were given. Why should people be put to all that expense and annoyance just because they improved their property, gave employment and gave better business facilities to the public?  Why should this assessment be made against them in the way it is being done?  That is what I object to.  We actually had to bring a motion to the Cork Corporation asking the manager that, immediately he was notified that there was an increase in valuation, he would notify the affected parties there and then so that they would have an opportunity of appealing before the assessment became effective.  To my mind, it is high time that this whole problem was dealt with.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1050" /> Even though a man goes to the trouble and expense of improving his business premises and making them serviceable, the valuation is on the present day letting value of the property. A man who improves his dwelling-house is doing a public service. The work that he carries out may prevent a charge on the public purse and save a public authority from having to provide a house for him.  By reason of his public service, an imposition is placed upon him and his family who succeed him.</P>
    <P>Take, for instance, the matter of farm buildings and, perhaps, particularly farm buildings in rather remote districts.  Some of the farm buildings are tumble-down buildings that would need to be improved.  If you go in and say to the owner that he will get a grant if he improves them he will reply: &ldquo;I will, but what will my valuation be when the work is carried out?&rdquo;  The whole matter is a vicious circle and needs to be remedied but this Bill does not supply that remedy.</P>
    <P>People may say that the rates will come down if the assessments go up, but the same amount of money is being collected for the public services, regardless of the valuations.  The only effect would be that some system might be devised whereby these public charges would be more equitably distributed amongst the population.  One of my great objections at the present time in this connection is that things are too haphazard.  One house in a particular street is picked out.  You question it, and you find that it was last valued maybe 50, 60 or 70 years ago.  Other houses in the same street are not touched or affected at all.  I think it is iniquitous that that can happen in respect of property where no structural alterations have taken place and where no new buildings have been erected.  It is a brake on progress and initiative and it is a deterrent to the giving of employment.  It has been responsible for the fact that there are derelict eyesores in our towns and cities.  The owners are afraid to touch their property even though these eyesores are a shame and a disgrace to our community.  The imposition will be so <Col N="1051" /> severe that the owners are not prepared to face it.  One of the reasons why we have so many derelict sites and so many eyesores in the way of houses and buildings in our cities and towns is that when a man left a building he would not reconstruct it because of the imposition that would be placed upon him.  He would go into a local authority house, or somewhere else, and leave the building an eyesore.  If the owner took off the roof he would not have to pay any rates on the property.  Such a person should be made remove the erection completely or else put it into serviceable condition and he should not have burdens placed upon him for so doing.</P>
    <P>I have very hard feelings about this whole matter.  I have made representations and I am glad to see that they are having some effect and that the Government are tackling the matter.  However, the measure before the House is simply dealing with the matter in a piecemeal way&mdash;just as is happening now with certain properties. That, in itself, is objectionable. Furthermore, there are some matters in this measure which would make confusion worse confounded.  For that reason, though I feel very keenly on this question, I am sorry that I do not find myself in a position to agree to this measure which is now submitted for our approval.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Davin</NameTxt>
      <P>I listened to every speech made in this very interesting debate.  I want to congratulate the sponsors of this Bill for having, by introducing this Private Members' Bill, drawn public attention, through the speeches that have been made in this debate, to one of the most interesting matters that can be discussed or reviewed in this House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I agree with the principle of the Bill but I am by no means enthusiastic &mdash;in fact, I am very suspicious&mdash;about the manner in which this measure will be administered if it is passed into law in its present form.  I agree with the principle but I am afraid that the principle is intended to apply only in a very limited way.  I do not think that a principle as important as is contained in this Bill should be confined <Col N="1052" /> to any small or reasonably small section of our citizens.</P>
    <P>The traders who will benefit immediately if this measure is passed into law in its present form will be in a much more fortunate position with regard to the payment of rates than any other section of citizens.  The trader or businessman whose premises are revalued and whose rates are increased as a result of improvements carried out is in the happy position that he can pass these increases on to his customers by way of increased charges.  He is an unpaid rate collector, and the trader or businessman who does not make proper provision in the charges he makes to his customers for every commodity he sells over the counter is not a good businessman.  He is in a position to recover every charge&mdash;rates, wages, interest charges and everything else&mdash; and he is a bad businessman if he does not make provision for 10, 20 or 30 per cent. profit, in addition.</P>
    <P>That does not apply to the farmer, the producer or agricultural labourer, and I want the mover of the Bill, or any of his colleagues who have signed it, to make it quite clear whether the principle contained in the Bill can, either in its present form or in any way in which it can be amended, be extended to every other section of citizens.  I am aware and I have to bear in mind&mdash;I have a letter which I received from the Department of Local Government to-day which I could read to confirm what I am saying&mdash;that there is a scheme now about to be sanctioned by the Minister for Local Government&mdash;it will be sanctioned in the next few days&mdash;giving 2,400 tenants of labourers' cottages in County Laois the right to purchase their cottages under the 1936 and 1950 Cottage Purchase Acts.</P>
    <P>I am aware, as every other Deputy representing a rural constituency is aware, that, as soon as the tenants of these cottages acquire that right, one of the first things that will have to be done, particularly in the case of cottages in which there are large families, is the provision of an additional room or two to provide proper accommodation for these large families.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1053" /> That has been done even before now, and, where it has been done in my area, the county council concerned has either charged the tenant a lump sum payment for the additional room built by the local authority or have added a certain amount per week as rent.  I want to be assured by Deputy Sweetman, by Deputy O'Higgins or by somebody giving enthusiastic support to the Bill in its present form, that the tenants of labourers' cottages who build additional rooms or carry out any other necessary improvements will receive the full benefit of the Bill. Otherwise, I do not like the idea of voting in favour of a Bill, the principle of which I agree with, when I feel suspicious that its full benefits can be given only to businessmen and traders, as it appears to me from the contents of the Bill and the speeches made in favour of it.  I shall gladly welcome an assurance in this regard from Deputy Sweetman or Deputy O'Higgins.</P>
    <P>I was rather surprised by the speech delivered by Deputy MacCarthy because he has a long and honourable experience of the work of one of the principal local authorities in the State. It appears to me from the way he delivered himself here that he was not aware or fully satisfied that these increases in valuations and rates, following the carrying out of improvements, are initiated by the local authority.  To show the kind of confusion that exists in other places, I can say that one of the county councils in the counties I have the honour to represent passed a resolution less than a year ago protesting against increases in valuations following the carrying out of improvements to farm and business premises in the county.  With other Deputies for the constituency, I was requested to accompany the chairman, vice-chairman and selected members of the council on a visit to the Commissioner of Valuation.  I told them outside the door that they were in a bit of a jam, that they were coming up there to protest against increases in rates following the carrying out of improvements, without knowing that it was their own local authority and the county manager, in particular, who was mainly responsible.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1054" /> We waited outside the door of the commissioner's office for a considerable time, and the county manager did not turn up.  I suspected he was not going to turn up, and my suspicion was well founded, because he did not do so.  I went into the commissioner's room with the deputation, and I want to pay a tribute to the commissioner and the staff around him for the courtesy and consideration I have always received from him on the limited number of occasions on which I accompanied deputations or made representations in the case of an appeal.  The commissioner, his colleagues and his staff are merely carrying out the law, and they do it very courteously.  If they have to say: &ldquo;No; we cannot do all you are asking,&rdquo; they give a very full and detailed explanation, and any intelligent person can carry that explanation back to the people for whom he speaks.</P>
    <P>I went in there on that occasion and it was only after half an hour or so, when the commissioner came to reply to the deputation, that the representatives of the county council discovered for the first time that they were there under false pretences, and that it was the rate collector, in the first instance and the county manager mainly, who were responsible for the increase in rates as a result of the improvement of premises.  The deputation went home and the next time a discussion took place on the matter, it was not as friendly in all respects as it was on the occasion on which they appointed the deputation to see the commissioner under false pretences.  Is Deputy MacCarthy fully satisfied even now, following the statement of the Minister for Finance, that these applications for increases in valuations, followed by increased rates, are and must be initiated by the servants of the local authority and the county or city manager concerned?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. MacCarthy</NameTxt>
      <P>I stated in the course of what I said how the thing is initiated, but I said that it is in the terms of appointment of the rate collector, and that he is obliged to do it. What I objected to, as I said, was the excessive assessments imposed as a result of these requests.</P>

      <P>My education has been considerably improved on this matter by the debate.  I received some lessons from the Commissioner of Valuation and his staff, and I now accept what Deputy MacCarthy has said.</P>
      <P>I heard a speech delivered by a colleague on my left in which I heard for the first time charges of political prejudice against rate collectors in the carrying out of their statutory duties in this connection.  I am not a member of the local authority, but it was the first time I heard political charges of that type bandied about.  There may be some rate collectors who suffer from loss of memory or bad eyesight and who cannot see every case in which improvements have been carried out, with the result that some fortunate citizens do not come under notice; but I have yet to learn, and I represent my constituency for over 31 years, that any kind of political prejudice under any particular type of Government or any particular political complexion on any county council, has been manifested in matters of this kind.  I am not satisfied that that charge can be substantiated, so far as I am aware, of what is going on in my constituency.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I listened very attentively to the Minister for Finance in the very lengthy speech he delivered on this matter.  There is only one complaint, but it is a serious complaint, I have to make against the Minister.  Are we not entitled to hear something of the type of legislation that will be introduced in the very near future in accordance with the terms of speech made outside this House by the Taoiseach some time ago?  It is no harm to give us the general framework of the proposed measure.  I know it would not be right to ask for the details but there is no harm in asking that there should be some more detailed statement of Government policy in regard to this question than was contained in the general terms of the proposed amending legislation given by the Taoiseach outside this House some time ago.  I have an idea that any and every Act passed by the <Col N="1056" /> British House of Commons which affects this country should be subject to review in this House.  Some of these Acts should have been reviewed and repealed long ago.  Here we have an Act which is 101 years old.  I have not heard anybody protest because Deputy Morrissey and Deputy Sweetman are asking for the revision in a modest form of an Act passed 101 years ago.</P>
    <P>Apart from this Act, are Deputies aware of the fact that there are many old Victorian Acts passed during the period when we had representation in the British House of Commons that have been reviewed so far as they affect Britain but which have not been reviewed or repealed as they should be in this Legislature?  Is that not a disgraceful state of affairs?  I saw a decision given in the courts recently in the form of a reserved judgment. Judgment was reserved because the issues raised were very complicated. That reserved judgment was held up for seven weeks because I suppose the judge&mdash;and I am not criticising the decision of any judge&mdash;knew as the eminent counsel engaged in the case knew, that the particular Act upon which the case was based had been drastically revised in the British House of Commons but that the necessary revision had not been carried out, as it should have been carried out here by amending legislation.  That amending legislation should have been contained in the Harbours Act of 1948.  I am not going to refer further to that judgment but I do press Deputy Sweetman, Deputy Morrissey or Deputy O'Higgins to give us some further assurance that the Bill, to which they are now asking the House to give a Second Reading, will be a measure the benefits of which will not be confined to any small section of our citizens but that the principle of the Bill will be applied to every section in the State.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnCarew" hpid="Mr. Carew Mr. Carew">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Carew</NameTxt>
      <P>As a member of a local authority, I am very glad indeed to have an opportunity of voicing my opinion on this Bill.  I gladly support it and I do so because I feel, from my <Col N="1057" /> experience of public life in the City of Limerick, that grave injustices have been inflicted as a result of the increased valuations placed on many premises.  Having listened last night and again to-night to many of the speeches delivered, I do not think that so much opposition should be levelled against this Bill merely because it came from this side of the House.  I was very glad to hear Deputy MacCarthy who knows the position in Cork, just as I do in Limerick, voice his opinion on it.  Some years ago, not many years ago, I must confess that I was somewhat in the same position as that in which Deputy MacCarthy finds himself in Cork.  I remember when the valuation officers came into my particular street, William Street, in Limerick. Nobody seemed to know who they were or where they came from.  They gave no information of that kind but I will say, in fairness to them, that they were very courteous.  They visited me the same as they visited everybody else. I asked the particular man who called on me what his business was and he told me.  He told me of the hot reception he got in some places and I told him of the hot water into which I got as a result of his visit to some of my neighbours.</P>
      <P>I must say at the outset that I considered the valuation officers who came to Limerick were very fair-minded men.  I also consider that in dealing with any representations we made to their higher officers here in Dublin, they were reasonable, and in no way could it be said that they were vindictive. I felt, to my grief, that they were carrying out their duty, but while you may praise a man for doing his duty, you must remember the hardships that are imposed as a result of an Act which, as has already been stated, is over 100 years old.  I believe that the repeal of that Act is overdue and that this Bill is a step in the right direction.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It may be argued that this Bill affects a section only and that it does not go far enough.  If that be so, it is the duty of the Government in my opinion to bring in a better Bill and, if they do, we shall gladly support it. <Col N="1058" /> I am a member of the Limerick Corporation on which all shades of political opinion are represented, and we are unanimous that, as things stand at present, grave hardships have been imposed on many people as a result of revaluations that have occurred in recent years.  As a member of the Chamber of Commerce in Limerick for a number of years, and also as a member of the Associated Chambers of Commerce, I know that this has been practically one of the leading questions raised at every meeting so that there must be something wrong.  People do not start talking for nothing.  I never saw any division of opinion in the bodies of which I am a member as to the hardships imposed by this Act.  It is true, perhaps, that in many cases an adjustment was needed but, if so, it is evident that this Act, now over 100 years old, was at some time or other administered unfairly&mdash;in other words, that somebody got away with it.  If the Act is wrong, to that extent we have no grievance against the valuation commissioners.</P>
    <P>The point I want to stress here to-night is concerned with the case of every shopkeeper or person engaged in business who, through his industry has accumulated a certain amount of wealth and capital, and is prepared to put that capital into the business.  I feel that that man is entitled to spend his money to the best of his ability and judgment.  There is no doubt that any businessman or any man engaged in industry to-day is pretty well watched by the Revenue Commissioners.</P>
    <P>They are very well able to take care of their own end of things and to take a slice of any profits for which his industry or initiative is responsible.  If the capital which has been left is applied by him to improve his business or an industry in which he is interested I think all credit is due to him.  I say that as an encouragement a remission of two-thirds should be given as in the case of new houses.  Perhaps a two-thirds remission may be considered too generous, but there should be some sliding scale at least.  For that reason <Col N="1059" /> I support this Bill because it is a step in the right direction.</P>
    <P>I am at present chairman of the An Tóstal Committee in Limerick City. We got instructions from the authorities in Dublin to see what we could do to brighten our city and attract tourists and to make our city more attractive even for our own people.  I am proud to be able to say that last year in Limerick we made a very great effort to do that in co-operation with the authorities in Dublin and I can say that the citizens of Limerick did their part.  We are prepared to do that again this year.  Part of our programme is to go around the principal streets getting the people to brighten up their shops and have more illumination; in other words to go to considerable expense.  If by that means we can induce people with capital to put that capital into their business premises and improve them, it is only fair that we should ask through this Bill that some consideration would be given to them.</P>
    <P>If a man spends two or three thousand pounds on a business premises it is unfair that the valuation officers should come along some months afterwards and increase his valuation by 50 per cent. or perhaps 100 per cent.  I think that that man should be held up as an example to others because he has improved his premises. For that reason I think some concession should be given to him.  If a two-thirds remission is not given it should be a remission of some substantial size.</P>
    <P>It was stated by one of the speakers last night that people should not be shouting about increased valuations, that they had their remedy.  We know that there is a remedy, but it is very expensive.  I had to deal with a number of cases of this kind in Limerick, and I found that while the increase in some cases was only a small one, in other cases it was a substantial one.  It was decided to have some test cases of private houses and shops in what we call the leading business street and a secondary street. A comparison was made last night between the number of increased valuations and the small number of <Col N="1060" /> people who appealed against them. The reason for the small number is that all the people did not go into court and pay substantial fees to solicitors, barristers, valuers, etc. Instead of that, test cases were taken. I believe that very few accepted this imposition as being something which they should have placed upon them.</P>
    <P>I know of a case in Limerick where a valuation of £300 on a factory was increased to £800 because substantial additions were made.  The directors decided to get a man who had experience of valuations to go into the matter and, as a result of his examination and the way in which he presented the case to the valuation officers, the valuation was reduced by £100.  Is it not evident that something was wrong there, that somebody had blundered? Is it a case of thinking of a number or having a shot at it or doing what the income-tax people do?  If they have a suspicion that you are not paying what you should in income-tax they will double or treble what they think you are earning and then say to you: &ldquo;Prove to us that you are not earning that amount.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>When such things are happening I think it is about time for the Government to bring in a Bill to rectify matters.  We should not be talking about who brought in this Bill.  Even if they were members of Fine Gael it ought to be to their credit.  If it removes grievances or injustices that exist owing to an Act of Parliament which was inherited by this State I think all sides of the House should be in agreement about it.  If they are not in agreement with the Bill, they should say so.  I am glad that Deputy MacCarthy spoke as he did.  I am sure he spoke as the people of Cork whom he represents wished him to speak, and that is to bring to the notice of the authorities injustices which can be imposed on them.</P>
    <P>Many people will say: &ldquo;It is a nice thing to see that man's premises improved, but after all he has the money and what about it?&rdquo;  I know of business houses in Limerick which eight or ten years ago were doing a very substantial trade, and as a result of improvements the valuations were increased <Col N="1061" /> with the result that the owners are paying very much higher rates, and, unfortunately, our rates in Limerick are on the increase.  Because of the drive made in Limerick to cure the slum problem which existed and the transfer of people to other areas those people lost a lot of their customers although they have to pay high rates, high income-tax and high charges to the E.S.B.  People who started shops in these other areas have now developed substantial businesses.  But as a result of that the valuation officers have not come back and said to these business people: &ldquo;How is business now?&rdquo;  They are not concerned with them.</P>
    <P>As far as I can see in Limerick and from what I am told there is very little use in asking for a reduction in valuation because they will not reduce valuations except in very extreme cases.  They will, however, be only too glad to increase valuations.</P>
    <P>I am very glad, indeed, the point was brought out to-day that the responsibility for these valuations did not rest with the local representatives. I can assure the House that in Limerick City we were blamed for a very considerable time for supporting it on the quiet if you like.  I certainly never supported it.  Neither did any member of the council I represent.  It is the manager, city or county, who is responsible for listing certain properties for revision and that revision has taken place to the disadvantage of many.</P>
    <P>It is mentioned in the Bill that valuations should not be increased unless improvements are carried out.  I think that is only fair.  If a business man, through lack of capital or other circumstances, is unable to carry out improvements to his house to bring it into line with his neighbour's house, I do not think it is fair to go to him and say: &ldquo;Your neighbour's house is valued for so much.  We must come in and give you a dart as well.&rdquo;  Is it fair to go to a man and increase his valuation because his next-door neighbour has put in a new shop front, got the shop revalued and has sublet half the premises in flats thereby deriving a very big income?</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1062" /> It is very hard to get an answer to another matter about which people inquire very often.  One is often asked on what basis valuations are made. You are told one time that it is on the letting value and another time you are told it is on the 1914 value, the 1921 value, or the present-day value.  As far as I can see, there is no fixed basis on which the valuations are made.  I think it is about time that a Bill was brought into this House to clarify the whole matter.  If a man is going to improve his premises by spending £2,000 or £3,000 thereon, he should be told that he will be pounced upon two or three months afterwards and made pay a substantial increase in valuation and, as a result, pay the increased rates.  Let it be understood from the word go that there is an increase, and that the increase will be a percentage increase on a sliding scale.  To my mind, something of that nature would result in a number of people carrying out much needed improvements to their premises.  They would improve the look of their street and give valuable employment.  Any man who is prepared to put money back into his business is to be commended in many ways.</P>
    <P>It is unfair that from time to time many people have been put under a shadow of suspicion because they make protests against the injustices imposed on them.  I feel that every citizen has the right to air a grievance.  It is only proper that we, as public representatives, should air these grievances in the Dáil and let the authorities who are responsible know the position and feelings of the public.</P>
    <P>I listened attentively to the discussion for two hours last night.  Many good points were made on both sides of the House.  I hope this Bill will be accepted.  If the Government reject it, let them give us in its place some better proposition on similar lines.  If they do that, we will gladly join with them in remedying an injustice of long standing.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LaurenceJosephWalsh" hpid="Mr. L.J. Walsh Mr. L.J. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. L.J. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to make a few observations on this question of valuations.  Like most Deputies on both sides of the House, I am not <Col N="1063" /> entirely in agreement with the methods of valuers.  I am not in agreement with this particular measure either.  It is a measure of class legislation as it provides for one section of the community only.</P>
      <P>I was somewhat surprised to hear my friend, Deputy Davin, express doubts as to whether it will apply to labourers' cottages.  The Deputy knows as well as I do from reading the Bill that there is no provision in it for labourers' cottages or even artisans' dwellings in our towns and cities.  They will not be considered under this particular Bill.  I hope that the Government will, before long, introduce a comprehensive measure similar to the one they introduced in 1938 or 1939 and which eventually was dropped.</P>
      <P>No businessman, farmer or any owner of property will contend that property in this State to-day is only of the same valuation as it was in the day of the Griffith valuation.  That does not bear investigation and is not worth discussing.  I have some experience in regard to the question of valuations.  I want to disagree with my friend, the Mayor of Limerick, when he says it is the manager's function.  That is not so.  With the permission of the Chair, I will quote two documents showing the arrangements with regard to increasing valuations.  They are official notices which must appear on the notice-board outside the courthouses and municipal offices throughout the country.  Notice No. 1, Annual revision of rateable valuations: Decision on Appeals, is as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Notice is hereby given that the Commissioner of Valuation has on the 2nd day of February, 1953, transmitted to me a list of his decisions on the appeals to him for the Borough of Drogheda.  The appeals list is open for inspection at my office and the extracts therefrom may be taken during the usual office hours. All notices of appeals to the Circuit Court against the Commissioner's decision should be lodged with me on or before the 23rd February 1953.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>That is due notice and it is followed by another:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1064" />&ldquo;Notice is hereby given:&mdash;</P>
    <P>1.  That the Commissioner of Valuation has, on this date, transmitted to me lists of the several tenements and hereditaments in this Borough with their respective valuations, and has shown in these lists the revision of the valuations which have been made by him during the past year.</P>
    <P>2.  That the said lists will remain open for inspection at my office, and the extracts therefrom may be taken between the hours of 10 a.m. and 4 p.m. for 21 days from the date hereof.</P>
    <P>3.  That any person aggrieved in respect of such valuation may within 28 days from the day hereof by post or otherwise deliver to me a notice in writing duly signed by him, the said person aggrieved, or by his known agent, setting forth the grounds of such grievance.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>In these two official notices the procedure is set out with regard to valuations and there can be no deviation from it.  The person responsible, in the first instance is the rate collector.  He is bound by statute, first of all, to notify the town clerk, and, in the case of a rural community, the secretary to the county council who in turn notifies the Valuation Office.  It, in due course, instructs one of its valuers to call and make an inspection.  I listened this evening to Deputies complain about a valuer arriving in a town and of nobody knowing who he was and with no one to meet him.  Personally, I think that is the proper procedure.</P>
    <P>I myself built some property in the form of new houses.  I knew nothing about the valuer's visit or of his inspection of the property until he delivered his report to the town clerk when, of course, I was fully informed of the amount of the valuations.  I then had an opportunity, if I wished to avail of it, of appealing against his valuation.  I felt, however, that I could not conscientiously object to the value that he had put on the property.  For some reason or other, the yardstick employed for that purpose is that valuations are based on the letting value of the property.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1065" /> I do not think anyone in business, of which I have some knowledge myself, will contend that, if a person improves his property, by additions to it or in some other way, he has not increased the letting value of it. What I find most fault with is the system that you find in operation in towns, such as the one I come from.  I am sure the Mayor of Limerick finds the same thing in his city.  It is this, that you see very substantial premises in which business has been carried on for a long number of years and in which the turnover must run into some thousands of pounds a year, and yet the valuation is about £14 a year.  You get the other side of the picture when you see the valuations on artisans' dwellings.  This is something that Deputy Davin should be interested in.  In our town, we have carried out a number of housing schemes.  Tenants are taken from slum dwellings, on which the valuation was 10/- or 15/-, and transferred to new houses with a valuation of £10.</P>
    <P>I do not know what other public bodies have done in connection with valuations placed on houses provided by them, but we in Drogheda&mdash;the corporation&mdash;on behalf of the tenants, appealed to the courts and got the £10 valuation reduced to £8.  Now, even on an £8 valuation, the tenants of our artisans' dwellings are, in my view making a very substantial contribution to the total over-all rate which at the moment is about 39/3 in the £.  Taking a round figure, it means that, in many cases, an unemployed man is contributing as much as £12 a year to the rates.  I do not know if the representatives of any other town or city have gone to the trouble of investigating minutely the contribution which the tenants of artisans' dwellings are making to the rates.  I think if any of them have done so they will agree with me that, by and large, the tenants of artisans' dwellings and of small dwellings constitute the vast majority of the ratepayers in many of our towns.</P>
    <P>I think that their contributions would represent 75 per cent. of the total rate collected.  That is something <Col N="1066" /> people should ponder on, particularly when they are being asked to vote for a Bill of this kind.  The Bill stinks of class legislation and, as a democrat, I certainly would not support it, not even if it were a Government measure.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnFinan" hpid="Mr. Finan Mr. Finan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Finan</NameTxt>
      <P>I think the best thanks of the House are due to those who introduced this Bill.  I say that, not because of what is in it, but because it gives an opportunity to Deputies to discuss what is a very vexed and serious problem.  The position is bad enough in the country where we find the local rates increasing year after year, with no indication that the position is going to change for the benefit of the ratepayers.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Finan</NameTxt>
      <P>The fact, at any rate, is that the rates are being increased year after year, and that valuations are being increased.  Deputies and the people generally, must admit that the maintenance of our local institutions is becoming a heavy burden on the ratepayers.  I am not suggesting for a moment that the people on this side of the House are the only people who are concerned about that.  I am sure that Deputies on the Government side have also been approached by their constituents about it, not in one county but in every county.  The people are for ever asking when increases in the rates are going to stop.  The Valuation Office disclaims any responsibility in connection with that, and says that, so far as the rates are concerned, it is the business of the local authorities.  That is so, but why are valuations made at all?  Is it not mainly for the purpose of collecting the rates?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In view of the amount of legislation passed through this House recently and the burden which the operation of it is going to throw on the rates, I honestly believe that the ratepayers cannot continue to maintain our local institutions.  I have no hesitation in saying that this situation is, in large measure, due to the policy of successive Governments here.  They, in an <Col N="1067" /> effort to popularise themselves with the people, introduced and passed through this House an amount of legislation, and then put the burden on the local authorities of operating it.  The different Governments that we have had, all did that.</P>
    <P>It is grossly and manifestly unfair that any Government should enact legislation without making the necessary provision for the financing of it from the Central Fund.  I do not think this Bill is going to improve the situation very much as long as the present formula with regard to valuations continues, namely, that the basis of the valuation shall be net letting value. While the formula is there, I do not think that even the valuation commissioners can do very much in the matter.  It was pointed out to me on one occasion when I was a member of a deputation to them, that the valuation commissioners are there to implement the law.  That is the law, that the basis of valuation shall be the net letting value, and until we alter that formula and substitute another&mdash;and I am not going to suggest for a moment that it is easy to substitute another; I recognise that difficulty, too&mdash;we will not improve the situation.  It is inconceivable to me how it ever did form the basis of valuation at all.  I cannot see why, if a private citizen wants to improve his house at his own expense, there is an immediate obligation on the Valuation Office to increase his valuation.  I do not see the justice of it.</P>
    <P>Reference was made as to who was responsible for this.  Everybody knows that in the first instance it is the rate collector and everybody knows, too, that rate collectors are human beings. I do not think it was necessary to suggest a penalty on the rate collector for failing in his duty in this regard, because he knows quite well that the more the valuation increases the more poundage he collects.  There is a good incentive there without any threat whatever.</P>
    <P>I have always held that it is unfair, and indeed it is bad business, to put a valuation on a farmer's out-offices or <Col N="1068" /> buildings, because it seems to me that to do that you might as well put a tax on his plough, on his mowing machine or on his harvester; you might as well put a tax on the ordinary implements of his farm as put a tax on his out-offices.</P>
    <P>I do not think there can be justice done to the farming community on the question of rating until farm buildings are derated, not for a year, two years or even seven years, but entirely. Nobody here will deny that the present system as it operates is a curb on progress in spite of what Deputy Walsh says.  People around the country are quite prepared to improve their homes and their out-houses but they are deterred by the fact that they would be increasing their own liability to the local authority by doing so.  I think it was always held that one of the greatest curses of landlordism in Ireland was that if a farmer improved his holding the landlord's agent immediately came along and increased the rent and rates.  I heard it described in my time as one of the greatest arguments against the landlord system.  How can that system have altered after 30 years of native legislation when, if a farmer, a shopkeeper or a citizen in any other walk of life tries to improve the amenities of his home at his own expense, he leaves himself liable to a higher contribution to the local rates.  It is high time that some Government did deal with this question, and that is why we should be thankful to the member who introduced this Bill.</P>
    <P>Although this measure may have many shortcomings and may have some provisions with which I totally disagree, it does serve the purpose of focusing public attention and the attention of the Government on this very important question to see if something can be done to remedy a situation and a law which are definitely a handicap to progress here.</P>
    <P>The question of valuation of local authority housing schemes was one of the points a deputation of which I was a member raised when we visited the Valuation Office.  In the town of Castlerea the valuation of cottages erected last year or the year before <Col N="1069" /> was £8; at a rate of 35/- in the £ on an ordinary worker's cottage.  Does that seem to Deputy Walsh or to any other Deputy a fair demand on a man whose wages often do not amount to £4 a week?  On reflection, I think that the sensible thing for the Minister to do is to inform the House that he will examine this question thoroughly and bring in a comprehensive covering of the matters about which there is dissatisfaction. It has been suggested this is class legislation.  That is ridiculous. Surely in this country there is no such thing as class.  We are all one class.</P>

      <P>I do not agree with the argument against this Bill put forward by the Minister that it would be unfair to the cottage dweller or the farmer to adopt this measure because a man of a certain class would be improving his position without making any further contribution to the local rates.  Has not the man the other alternative; he need not improve his position, he need not spend any money and he will not make any contribution to the local rates?  I do not think that is a sensible argument from the Minister.  It is entirely optional to the man to improve his holding, but if he does it is he going to be victimised?</P>
      <P>Deputy Cogan must be aware of at least one glaring injustice that occurred in this city, when he and I were members of a ratepayers' association.  A gentleman from Deputy Walsh's constituency complained that premises which he had in Middle Abbey Street and which, before they were improved, had a valuation of £14, were given, after they were improved, a valuation of £300.  In the light of that, and I assume the man was telling the truth&mdash;&mdash;</P>

I hope something will be done to remedy this and to change the outmoded system of local taxation and valuation.  Surely there must be room for alteration in legislation that is 101 years old, especially when it was enacted by an alien government?  Or are we to be happy and contented and say that the British ran this country for 700 years in that way and that we will follow their methods?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Gallagher</NameTxt>
      <P>I must say to Deputy Finan, when he says that there is only one class, what we say in my part of the country: &ldquo;You're a harmless man.&rdquo;  That is the caption they <Col N="1071" /> would give him, as they would not think he was serious in making that statement.</P>
      <P>I agree with Deputy Davin when he refers to the Act of 1852 and says it is completely out of date.  I say that is correct, especially as far as Dublin is concerned.  In 1852 you could go as far as Dolphin's Barn Bridge on the south side and, on looking over the bridge, find cabbage fields there. On the north side you could go as far as Ballybough Bridge and find fine big fields.  You could go as far as Finglas Bridge and there you would find fields again.  Dublin certainly has grown a great deal since 1852, since the times of bows, bonnets and hoops, and it is time that something was done to alter this Act.</P>
      <P>The danger I see about the present Bill, or any Bill is this.  It should be made perfectly clear that if we are to interfere with the present basis of valuation, that is, the annual letting value, we should know clearly what new principle is to be substituted as a new basis.  I think that is the proper approach to it.  I have heard very little here as to what is suggested as a substitute or a new principle. No one spoke about that.  I am not an expert by any means, but I feel that in the case of Dublin you must take into account always the question of increasing or decreasing the value of any property.  If the premises is wholly reconstructed and set up for a different purpose, surely we must take notice of that.  For example, it could happen around Mary Street or Little Denmark Street that a property would be reconstructed which was formerly a tenement.  What is the value of that property to be now?  It is right in the heart of the city and one would have to take notice of such a property reconstructed for a different purpose.  You cannot get away from that problem.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I agree with Deputy Walsh that this Bill or any Bill is this.  It should be and will not do an awful lot for the ordinary ratepayer.  I know it is coming from a constituency where there was a great number of tenement houses and there still are a few and this Bill <Col N="1072" /> mentions them, as it provides for a limitation of increases in the valuation of tenements.  I hope that in the next five years there will be no tenement houses in Dublin.  They were a scourge and the slum landlords were the scourge of the city.  Every effort we can make in the Dublin Corporation we will make, to wipe out the tenement houses.  I for one, with a great knowledge of the city, must say I would be glad to say &ldquo;Amen&rdquo; to the slum landlord.  They are certainly not a credit to the city; where they came from I do not know, but certainly they are a disgrace.  Anything the corporation can do to wipe them out will be done and then I say it will be good riddance.</P>
    <P>What we really need is an equitable distribution of rates.  Take, for example, the area of North Frederick Street, Gardiner's Row and Gardiner's Place, on the way to Croke Park.  At one time there were reasonably big houses there&mdash;fine hotels like Fleming's Hotel and other such places which during the &ldquo;Trouble&rdquo; were well known to many a Deputy who was &ldquo;on the run&rdquo;.  That area is in my constituency now.  The valuation there was very high.  Now Dublin Corporation comes along and takes over some of those houses which went into bad repair.  They have erected corporation flats right opposite the big houses, yet those people are still paying on a high valuation, as much as £52, £62 and £70 per year.  They are certainly feeling the pinch.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ColmGallagher" hpid="Mr. Gallagher Mr. Gallagher">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gallagher</NameTxt>
      <P>It is the worker's money, I agree.  On the other hand, you have other properties such as small shops out in Dolphin's Barn direction where new housing schemes have been built up.  Those shops have certainly increased a great deal in value.  It is tough on the people in my constituency to have to pay the piper still, while the <Col N="1073" /> people on the far side of the city in neighbourhoods which have improved considerably and who are in business premises, benefit a great deal by the new housing schemes, though they still remain at the old valuation.  I do not think that is equitable and it will be a step in the right direction if we can find some arrangement for an equitable distribution of rates, especially in the City of Dublin.</P>
      <P>I feel that any Bill the Government may bring in will help where there is any reconstruction to improve a business in the hands of small business people; but, as was mentioned earlier in the debate, a big shopkeeper or big businessman or big factory can pass on any increase in rates to the consumers. That might not happen in all cases&mdash;sometimes there is a fixed price on the commodity or something of that kind and it may not be possible&mdash;but from what I know of the accountants in Dublin and elsewhere they are a very shrewd lot of men.  They would be able to see that those for whom they work succeed in passing on any increase in rates or valuation to the consumer of the commodity that is manufactured by that concern.  I certainly am satisfied that, on this Bill introduced by the Fine Gael Party, all of us here have been able to give our views and I think they have been put fairly and squarely. I am sure they must agree now that this Bill certainly is for the businessman and not for the ordinary ratepayer.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There should be an equal distribution of rates.  I cannot emphasise that too strongly.  We here in Dublin would like the Government to get down to the job of altering the 1852 Act and they should see to it that there is an equal distribution.  People are suffering heavily because of the burden of rates and that is particularly true of my own constituency.  I would suggest that the Government should try to make a solid effort to clean up the position.  The 1852 Act should be altered to suit our times and that alteration should not be made halfheartedly. Certainly there are many Acts that need alteration but I think the 1852 Valuation Act should get priority.  I would like to see the <Col N="1074" /> Malicious Injuries Code altered, but I would be out of order in dealing with that now.  The 1852 Act is completely out of date as far as Dublin is concerned because Dublin has expanded beyond anything envisaged when that Act was introduced.  There is urgent need in the City of Dublin for an equal distribution of the rates burden.</P>

      <P>&mdash;&mdash;and the honest, straight people on this side of the House.  Apparently Deputy Gallagher and the other Government speakers have not taken the trouble to study this Bill, since from the very outset they have been annoyed because of its introduction here by Fine Gael Deputies Sweetman, Morrissey and O'Higgins.  In the past the Fianna Fáil Party has thrown Valuation Bills into the wastepaper-basket.  They are annoyed now because this proposed legislation will bring about certain long-overdue reforms.  I will quote just one sentence from column 303 of the Official Report, Volume 142, to indicate briefly what the general purpose of the Bill is.  Speaking on the Bill, Deputy O'Higgins said:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;First of all, it proposes that henceforth the valuation of no building, whether it be a dwelling-house, factory, a pigsty or a shop may be increased at the instance of the local authority or anyone else unless improvements or alterations have been carried out to it.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>That should be fairly easy of interpretation by any Deputy who wishes to understand the Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1075" /> Let us go back to the history of this Bill.  On the 8th November, 1952, that is less than 12 months ago, representations were made by a large section of traders to the Government asking for a revision of the valuation system owing to the heavy impost placed upon their businesses under the existing system.  Let me quote the reply to that nation-wide campaign.  On 21st October, 1953, at column 308 of Volume 142 of the Official Report, the text of a letter in relation to these representations is given:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;The Ministers for Finance and Local Government were approached regarding the possibility of introducing legislation to ameliorate the lot of traders whose premises might be revalued to their pecuniary disadvantage because of the food hygiene regulations, and the Commissioner of Valuation was also consulted.  It is regretted, however, that it is not considered feasible to amend the Valuation Acts in one particular respect so as to grant concessions for the cases in question.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>That was the attitude of the Government on 8th November, 1952, in relation to a revision of valuation for business premises.  It became obvious to the Fine Gael Party that a revision of the Valuation Act of 1852 was long overdue and they introduced this Private Members' Bill which is now the subject of debate.  That Bill was printed on 3rd June, 1953, and it was then that the Fianna Fáil Party realised that they had adopted the wrong attitude in relation to this very vexed question.  There was thereupon a change of heart on the part of the Government.  They were forced by public opinion to make that change, even if they will not admit they were not forced by this Bill to alter their attitude towards the effect of the Valuation Act of 1852 in its application at the present time.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Local Government then came forward to forestall the Private Members' Bill introduced last June, and on 7th August he announced that the Government proposed to introduce a Bill providing for some remission <Col N="1076" /> of rates.  Last November the Minister for Finance and himself expressed regret that they were not prepared to give any consideration to a proposition of that kind.  Remember, the Taoiseach also realised the importance of the effect of the 1852 Act upon the community at the present time, and he decided to curry favour with the community, particularly with property owners and tenants of dwelling-houses. He announced that it had been decided in principle that a substantial remission of rates should be granted for a period of years on the valuation of new buildings and on the total increase in valuation as a result of premises having been improved and revalued. There was the Taoiseach rushing in to save the situation and wipe out the embarrassment that had been caused to the Fianna Fáil Party by the introduction of this Private Members' Bill.</P>

      <P>The Minister for Local Government indicated recently, in order to offset the embarrassment caused by this Bill, that it was proposed to give some remission of rates.  Is it proposed to give that remission of rates at the expense of the farmers who pay rates in respect of agricultural land?  We remember that he indicated to county councils a proposal which would mean an increase of rates on farmers' land of something like £350,000 in a full year.  Is he proposing now to give a remission of rates at the expense of owners of agricultural land in respect of the supplementary grants?</P>
      <P>Deputy MacCarthy spoke on this matter.  Every word he said made a good case for this Bill and then he said he would vote against it.  Other Deputies who put forward constructive arguments in relation to valuation made a case for this Bill.  It is regrettable that we have not heard from a responsible member of the Government that the proposals contained in this Bill will be accepted, that they will be prepared to include these proposals in legislation.  They can be assured by the sponsors of this Bill that they will have support for any legislation which will incorporate the proposals contained in this Private Members' Bill.

      <P>We will hear Deputy Davern in a moment.  We would like to know whether he is for or against this Bill.  Is there anything in this Bill that he is prepared to oppose or, if he is prepared to accept the Bill, why does he not whisper in the ears of the Cabinet members a request to accept the Bill or to introduce new legislation which will embody these proposals?</P>

      <P>If the Government consider that they are capable of bringing in modern legislation in relation to this matter they should not delay in doing so.  They are going to get cooperation from this side of the House and in fact they have got a headline so far as certain aspects of this problem are concerned.  Here in this country particularly a revision is necessary, because if we compare the rates being paid in Dublin City here, exceeding 30/- in the £, with 14/- being paid in Belfast, we can see that there is something wrong either with the basis of our valuation here or with the level of the rates paid or the amenities which those rates are expected to finance.  Let us remember that in Northern Ireland there is derating&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="EamonnRooney" hpid="Mr. Rooney Mr. Rooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Rooney</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;but here in Dublin where the rate is 30/- in the £ rates are also payable in respect of agricultural land.  They are not payable in respect of agricultural land in Northern Ireland but still the rates in Belfast <Col N="1080" /> only amount to something like 14/- in the £.  It should be possible to draw a proper comparison in order to see where the defect is here in this country and in our local authorities.  Let us remember that when valuations are being applied at the present time certain standards are considered.  As some Deputy mentioned, the measuring tape is used apart from the other factors which are taken into consideration when a valuation is being applied. Then when that valuation has been applied, if we take, for instance, a private dwelling-house or business premises, one or the other, and we examine the amount of the valuation decided upon and then compare that with a business premises or a private dwelling-house of ten or 20 years ago, built at that time, providing the same accommodation and the same amenities, we see that there is a very big difference in the valuation which applies to those premises although there is only a matter of ten or 20 years in the difference; and so far as private dwelling-houses and business premises are concerned it is probable that the materials at that time were better than the materials used now in the modern dwellings and still higher valuation is applied.  The result is that after the period of remission has expired very high rates will be payable in respect of such premises, compared with similar premises providing similar accommodation.</P>

    <Speaker pid="EamonnRooney" hpid="Mr. Rooney Mr. Rooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Rooney</NameTxt>
      <P>As well as that, at the present time we have a situation where people are afraid to cause alterations to be made in their <Col N="1081" /> premises, or extensions, improvements or renovations, because they realise that if these improvements and alterations are made it is possible that the valuations will be increased and consequently they will be obliged to pay higher rates to the local authority concerned.  That system as it operates is holding back progress as far as the improvement of buildings is concerned and the provision of better amenities in business premises.</P>
      <P>This Bill proposes three reforms in what is set out in the existing Valuation Act of 1852.  It may be argued that many more reforms are necessary, but it is considered on this side of the House that at least these three reforms should be carried out as soon as possible.  If the members of the Government consider that other reforms are necessary it is up to them during this debate to point out these reforms in order that the Government in framing any new legislation which they propose to introduce can have those reforms included.  This debate is affording a very valuable opportunity to the House and to the country which will enable the Deputies to point out the many defects existing at the present time in relation to rateable valuations.  I regret that the Government have been adopting a negative attitude to this matter.  I think the country expects, and certainly the owners of property would expect, a practical approach to this problem instead of destructive criticism, instead of an attitude of trying to belittle the proposals contained in this Bill.  I believe it would be better for the Government to alter the attitude which they have adopted in this matter.  It is only right to expect that we should adopt the same view as Deputy Norton on this Bill, and I am going to quote what he said in relation to this matter.  He said:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;I look upon the Bill simply as a device to get certain things done and to deal with hardships, the relief of which might appeal to members of any and every political Party in the country.  The present law, or if not the law certainly the practice, in respect of valuation of premises, is outmoded.&rdquo;</P>

      <P>Under the food and hygiene regulations many owners of business premises were obliged to carry out certain improvements, and if they did not carry out those improvements and alterations and enlargements they would be liable to be put out of business, so they had a choice of either remaining in business and having those alterations carried out&mdash;&mdash;</P>
