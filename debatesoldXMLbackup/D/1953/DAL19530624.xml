      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Industry and Commerce if he is aware that there is a plentiful supply of biscuits made by the British manufacturers in this country at present, while Irish-made biscuits are rationed out; and, if so, if he will have this matter investigated so as to keep our own factories in full-time employment.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. Lemass)</NameTxt>
      <P>Imports of biscuits, which are subject to customs duty, represent only a very small fraction of total consumption of biscuits.  The volume of such imports in 1952 was substantially less than in 1951 and 1950.</P>
      <P>It is correct that the demand for biscuits appears to have expanded and Irish manufacturers appear to have temporary difficulty in meeting all requirements. I understand however that steps are being taken to increase productive capacity.  So far as I am aware there is, and has been for some time past, full-time working in the firms engaged in this trade.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>Arising out of the reply, is it any wonder that you have the Dublin unemployed marching here on Leinster House when their leader is a biscuit worker who is unemployed since last September?  I have seen these British manufactured biscuits in all the shops and the biscuits made in Dublin are on quota.  I think that should not happen if we are going to protect our industries as we should.</P>

    <P>Debate resumed on amendment No. 24.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RichardJamesMulcahy" hpid="General Mulcahy General Mulcahy">
      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>On Thursday last, I was raising the question with the Minister as to why there was this rather peculiar discrimination against maternity cases.  The bed position disclosed by the answer given to Deputy Norton's question on the 23rd October, as reported in column 224 of the Official Debates, shows that there are eight maternity beds available in the County of Carlow and five available in Longford.  Naturally, then, there is a very good reason why people desire, in maternity cases, to go to a private home.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Under amendment No. 45, where a person desires to go to a nursing home either for ordinary medical treatment or as a maternity case, that person is treated on exactly the same footing with regard to charges&mdash;that is to say, the idea of preference in the pre-treatment that is offered in this Bill to maternity cases is completely withdrawn. As the House will remember, the Bill proposes that when persons of the middle income group go to a local institution to get medical treatment they will be charged 6/- a day. If they go to the local institution as a maternity case, there is no such charge. If a person elects to go to a nursing institution of a private kind, this section proposes to put the maternity and the ordinary medical case on the same footing.  I was asking the Minister on Thursday why the 6/- a day is imposed <Col N="1858" /> as an additional charge on a maternity case, where it goes to a private institution.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>A woman goes to her own private doctor, who says she needs hospital treatment&mdash;not maternity treatment&mdash;say, an operation for appendicitis.  If she is in the middle income group and she agrees and goes into a local authority hospital or is sent by the local authority to a voluntary hospital, the local authority may think that her means warrant them getting a fee of 6/- per day from her towards the cost of the hospitalisation.</P>
      <P>If the same woman, expectant in maternity, goes to her private doctor, and if the doctor says that he thinks it would be better for her to go to hospital because he would not like to undertake her case, then she would get free treatment either in the county hospital or in any other maternity hospital to which she would be sent by the local authority.  In other words, they cannot make a deduction of 6/-a day for her.  But in either case if she chooses her own hospital she will have to suffer this deduction of two guineas a week or 6/- a day.</P>
      <P>I do not think, in the case of a woman who chooses her own hospital, that she is treated any worse in the case of maternity than any other case.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RichardJamesMulcahy" hpid="General Mulcahy General Mulcahy">
      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>The discriminatory preference in respect of maternity treatment is withdrawn?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>The favourable treatment is withdrawn.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichardJamesMulcahy" hpid="General Mulcahy General Mulcahy">
      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>Why should that be so?  If there is an appreciation that maternity treatment requires <Col N="1859" /> special consideration on the financial side, why is it withdrawn?  I think the Minister has not brought out the situation quite clearly.  Take, for instance, the position in Carlow, where there are eight maternity beds.  If a person in the middle income group wants to go into the public ward in Carlow&mdash;into one of those eight beds &mdash;she will get the maternity treatment entirely free.  If the Carlow local authority have an agreement with some hospital in Dublin&mdash;and it is a maternity case&mdash;and if they send the woman there and she is put into the public ward in that hospital, then that woman can get the full treatment free.</P>
      <P>If a patient elects to go to a hospital with which the local authority even has an agreement for general public ward treatment, and if that patient goes into a private or a semiprivate ward in that hospital then she is charged 6/- a day in addition to what the hospital may charge generally. The only thing that she gets is the subvention.  The Minister indicated that the subvention which a local authority pays a voluntary hospital or any other institution is £5 12s. per week but that where a person does not go into the normal public ward of the hospital there is a deduction of 6/- a day&mdash;that is, £2 2s. a week&mdash;and only £3 10s. is paid.  Therefore, if a person who is sent from Carlow to a maternity hospital in Dublin with which the local authority have a contract and if that person goes into the public ward of that hospital then a sum of £5 12s. is paid.  But if that person should go into a private ward then the £5 12s. will be reduced by £2 2s. plus whatever extra is involved.</P>
      <P>If, on the other hand, patients are going for medical treatment then they would be charged the 6/- a day in Carlow.  They would be charged the 6/- a day if they went into the public ward in Dublin but that 6/- a day is taken as a special deduction from the maternity case.  I think the Minister has given us no explanation at all as to why that should be so.</P>

      <P>Perhaps the Minister would clarify this point?  I understood <Col N="1860" /> the Minister to say a moment ago that if the local authority decided that the patient was to go to a maternity home whether in Carlow or elsewhere then the 6/- would come into play.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Morrissey</NameTxt>
      <P>That is what I understood the Minister to say.  I am putting the point to him now because it seemed rather strange to me if the matter were determined by the local authority for the reason, say, that they had not a bed available in their own maternity wing.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Take, again, the case of the lady who goes to her own doctor and the doctor says: &ldquo;I think you should go to hospital.&rdquo; If she says: &ldquo;I will go wherever the local authority wishes to send me,&rdquo; then she has free hospital treatment.  There is a distinction here now between private and public ward.  If may happen that that type of case may be sent by the hospital to a private room because, in their view, the case requires isolation. Therefore, she may get a private room and yet be free&mdash;that is, if they sent her there.  If the patient says: &ldquo;I want to go to a certain hospital and not to any other,&rdquo; then she must suffer the penalty.  This woman has no grievance from the medical point of view.</P>
      <P>I think that everybody will admit that the best possible treatment is given in the maternity ward and that it cannot be beaten.  I admit that a woman may prefer a private room in a private home but she is not going to get any better treatment there.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AnthonyCEsmonde" hpid="Dr. Esmonde Dr. Esmonde">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Esmonde</NameTxt>
      <P>I am afraid I am not very clear on this.  I have read the debate over the week-end.  If a doctor is going to send a patient in the middle income group for ordinary non-maternity treatment, and if he decides he wants to send that patient to a particular hospital, I take it from the Minister's remarks the other day that, in certain instances, even in the case of a person in the middle income group who is being sent to any sort of hospital, even actually to the local hospital, it rests at the discretion of the county manager or the local health <Col N="1861" /> authority as to whether or not that person is to be asked to pay anything. That is what I understood the Minister to say.</P>
      <P>I was under the impression, until we started to debate this particular amendment, that the middle income group were entirely free with regard to medical and institutional expenses for specialist treatment.  Apparently, they are not.  In certain instances they may be charged £2 2s.</P>
      <P>This amendment purports to offer a choice of hospital.  Now, I am dealing not with maternity at all, but with the ordinary specialist treatment. Even if they were free, and it was agreed by the health authority that they were entitled to free treatment, if they go to any other hospital they are not free.  The last day we were debating this here I understood from the Minister that if the patient decides that he or she wants to go to a particular hospital then they are not free. If, however, it is recommended by their doctor that it is desirable that they should have treatment in some particular institution in Dublin, Cork, Limerick or any other place outside the rate-aided hospitals, they would be entitled to Health Act treatment but, at the same time, they lose.  They get only a subvention and they lose £2 2s. a week.</P>
      <P>On reading the debates further, I took it that what was in the Minister's mind was that if they were specifically recommended by the doctor, and it was agreed in the recommendation of the doctor that it was necessary for them to be transferred to a hospital for specialist treatment&mdash;I am still dealing with the middle income group&mdash;they would be entitled to the full amount and not the subvention.  I am not clear about this.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If I, or any other doctor, am attending a patient and I wish to have that patient transferred to a hospital, have I to send the patient into the local county hospital and, if it is a medical case, it to be decided by the physician in that hospital and, if it is a surgical case, it to be decided by the surgeon in that hospital, as to whether or not the patient is to be transferred for treatment?  I am inclined to think <Col N="1862" /> that that is not a satisfactory arrangement.</P>
    <P>Let us look at it this way.  If a doctor is sending a case into a local hospital&mdash;human nature being what it is&mdash;in effect, what he says is: &ldquo;I prefer to have this patient sent further to some other hospital for treatment.&rdquo; It is sort of implied, although it need not be.  But, human nature being what it is, the local surgeon or physician may say that he feels he is not good enough for the treatment and it has to be transferred elsewhere.  That is rather placing both the local practitioner and the resident medical staff of the hospital in an awkward position. I should like to meet it this way if the Minister would agree.  I think the county medical officer of health would be the most suitable person to decide that.  He is not in medical practice and would not be concerned with the actual treatment of the case.  I ask the Minister to consider that.  I am discussing purely specialist treatment in the middle income group.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I must say I feel it hard to answer the question whether the county medical officer of health would be the proper person to advise or not. I am afraid he would not be the best person to give advice in all cases. Secondly, I am afraid a lot of them would say that they could hardly undertake to advise the county manager on this question.  What, in fact, would happen is this: If the Deputy has a patient whom he wants to send for hospital treatment he may perhaps ask: &ldquo;Are you in the middle income group because, if you are, you can get some help?&rdquo;  If the patient says: &ldquo;I am in the middle income group,&rdquo; and the doctor thinks that particular case should be sent to a specialist hospital in Dublin, he will write into the office or, if he likes, he can give the patient a letter and tell her to go in herself. I do not think it will be necessary in all cases that the patient should then go to the county hospital to be examined by the surgeon or the physician. I think things will settle down eventually.  Probably the surgeon or physician would say: &ldquo;There is no doubt about that case; let it go to hospital; I do not want to see the <Col N="1863" /> patient at all&rdquo;; or he may say: &ldquo;I am not sure about that case; I think we should see it.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>There is one thing which I should like the Deputy to realise.  As far as my experience goes in dealing with county hospitals, the only complaint from the administrative point of view that I ever got is that certain medical men were not undertaking enough.  In other words, some of them are too prone to send difficult cases elsewhere. I have never heard a complaint yet that any of them was too daring by taking on too much.  After all, these men have a full-time life job and there is no necessity for them to undertake these cases.  I do not think there is any danger that they will do that.  If there is any doubt and they think it is not a case for them, I think they will be more inclined to send it to another hospital.  I do not think the Deputy need have any fear that they would be inclined to say: &ldquo;I will not send this case to another hospital; I will deal with it myself&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>The Deputy will realise that it would be too much to ask the local authority, acting through the county manager, to accept the recommendation of every doctor in the county.  I think the county manager would want some check.  I think he would have to get some medical opinion from his own staff, whether the surgeon or the physician or the county medical officer of health.  He will have to get some advice I think from some medical authority to verify what the doctors recommend.  As I said the last day, when things settle down and are working smoothly, the county manager may say: &ldquo;You can always take this doctor's word.  I need not bother asking the question; the patient can go straight to Dublin&rdquo;.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Esmonde</NameTxt>
      <P>That is the difficulty I see in these cases.  It would not be right that the local authority should not have some safeguard.  I am not suggesting that the local practitioner should have the right to transfer a patient anywhere he likes without consultation of some sort with the local authority.  What I am fighting for is the principle of the contract that exists between the doctor and the patient with as little State interference as possible.  The only real way to preserve that is to bring in the county medical officer of health.  He is a quasi-State official under the local authority or under the Minister's Department and represents the interests of the State.  You will then preserve the right of the individual to consult a local practitioner and the right of the local practitioner to do the best he can for his patient in consultation with the medical officer of health.  I cannot think of anybody else who would be really fair and who would understand the circumstances.</P>
      <P>I think that the Minister should do it in that way, have a consultation between the county medical officer of health and the local practitioner if the local practitioner wishes to send a patient to some particular hospital. That would meet the case.  Otherwise, the situation will arise where you will have two medical officers, both practising in the same area, and one will more or less have to divulge the fact that he is attending some person in the district, while if the county medical officer of health is brought in, he will be safeguarding the local authority and will have no interest one way or the other.  He is not a practising doctor. In that way you will be preserving the right of the medical practitioner to say where a patient is to go.  That is what I am fighting for-the rights of the doctor.</P>

      <P>I agree that there is quite a lot in what the Deputy says. There may be towns where the county physician is practising in competition with a private practitioner who wants to have a patient sent to a certain hospital.  My difficulty is that I do not know how far we can get the county medical officer of health to cooperate <Col N="1865" /> in this.  The county medical officer of health up to this was in an entirely different service.  He was on the health side, whereas the people in the hospitals were on the home assistance side.  They were two different branches.  They will all be amalgamated when this Bill goes through.  But then it may be difficult to get the county medical officer of health to depart, as it were, from his appointment, from what he has been doing, and undertake duties of this kind.  I think that any local authority or county manager would be inclined to do what the Deputy suggests if they could get the co-operation of the county medical officer of health.  I think it would be better, however, not to be too specific in the legislation as to whom they should consult.  I am quite satisfied that things will work out all right.</P>

      <P>Deputy Esmonde suggested that the medical officer of health would be the appropriate and proper person to recommend.  I disagree entirely with that.  The medical officers of health are dealing with health matters; they cannot be said to be in active medical practice other than health matters&mdash;which is a different thing.  The surgeon or medical officer attached to the county hospital would have far closer contact with medical and surgical cases than the county medical officer of health.  I could see other problems arising as Doctor Esmonde was speaking.  I could see the doctors who want to send all their cases to Dublin or Cork and who want to ignore the local authority institution.  The problems mentioned by the Deputy have already arisen and are in everyday operation.  The Deputy is well aware of that.  There is a trend by some medical officers to ignore the local authority institutions and shift all their cases to the city. You have the problem coming up again that the local authorities would be asked to pay for those patients in many cases.  It is a problem that is there at the moment and has existed for many years.  You have one doctor who wants to ignore the existence of the local institutions and wants to shift everyone to the big centres, or to a particular hospital that he may be interested in himself.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Allen</NameTxt>
      <P>The medical officers at the principal institutions, such as the county hospitals, have determined those matters in all cases and no one else.  They recommend to the county manager or to his office that A or B should be transferred to a particular specialist hospital.  That is what happens and there is no question that <Col N="1867" /> the manager even questions that procedure, or that it even comes to his notice.  In every case where the surgeon or the principal medical officer in the principal institution attached to the local authority are operating they have decided up to this in all cases, and no question of doubt ever arose.  Even when the boards of health were operating you had the same problems and the secretary was given authority to deal with these matters by the board where there was a recommendation from the doctor.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DanielMorrissey" hpid="Mr. Morrissey Mr. Morrissey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Morrissey</NameTxt>
      <P>It was raised by Deputy Dr. Esmonde because, as the section and the amendment stand, there is no mention of the county surgeon, county physician or county medical officer of health.  So far as this Bill is concerned the only authority, and the only person to whom we are giving authority, is the county manager.  That is what we are doing. I am not disputing that what Deputy Allen has said has happened, in other words, that the county surgeon or the county medical officer of health or the county physician have in the past been taken into consultation by the health authority.  But we are not imposing that obligation here.  If we pass this section, Bill or amendment in the form in which it is at the moment, a county manager may&mdash;I do not say that he will, but he may, and we give him the power to do it&mdash;completely ignore any of them.  But may I point this out to Deputy Allen: we are purporting in this amendment to provide something not there at the moment, namely, we <Col N="1868" /> are purporting to give a choice of institution and service and a choice of doctor and hospital?  We are not, in fact, of course, giving a choice of hospital. I think the Minister cannot gainsay this.</P>
      <P>As the amendment is before us at the moment, what it means in effect is a choice of doctor subject to the approval of the county manager, or the county manager in consultation with the county medical officer of health, if he chooses to consult him. There is no question whatever about that.  If a patient elects to choose his own, or her own doctor, and in the opinion of that doctor who probably knows the whole&mdash;if I may say and I think I am using the medical term correctly&mdash;case history of the patient and is therefore in a much better position than any county medical man could be to determine to where or to whom the patient should be sent to get the best possible treatment for his ailments, he cannot do that.  He has to get the authority of the county manager.</P>

      <P>I am one of the many Deputies in this House who are also members of local public health authorities and in my experience I have never known&mdash;and I have experience of five of them in the past &mdash;our managers to take it upon themselves to direct any patient to any institution or to take responsibility for recommending treatment.  In the first instance, a patient goes to the dispensary doctor who examines his case and may possibly direct him to the county medical officer of health.  I have known cases where the county medical officer of health recommended patients to the T.B. home and other cases where he recommended them for surgical treatment.  All of these things <Col N="1869" /> are done by the public health authority and it is the function of the public health authority to formulate policy and it is not the function of the manager.</P>

      <P>The public health authority provides the treatment.  I have known where we have taken accommodation from outside our own health authority and got accommodation from neighbouring health authorities. The manager did not do this on his own initiative.  It was discussed by the public health authority.  They decided to take certain accommodation in neighbouring institutions and then the manager arranged for the transfer of such patients.  My understanding of Deputy Dr. Esmonde's attitude is this: that the county manager is the alpha and omega of all things in relation to public health.  That is not so, and nobody knows it better than a doctor and especially a doctor associated with a public health authority.  I cannot understand the attitude of anybody who says that no one counts in this matter but the county manager.  That is not so.  We, as the public authority elected by the people, have the right to formulate policy and to direct where our services are to be made available.  I must repeat, after an experience of five different county managers, that not in one single case have they directed a patient to any institution.  That is a well-known fact to every Deputy who is a member of a local authority.</P>

    <Speaker pid="AnthonyCEsmonde" hpid="Dr. Esmonde Dr. Esmonde">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Esmonde</NameTxt>
      <P>May I point out that the principle we are fighting for is the right of a doctor to decide where his patients may go for treatment?  We are making no imputation against any county manager in this State.  It is the principle we object to, the principle of the health authority being the final arbiter in deciding where a patient is to be treated.  Deputy Allen <Col N="1870" /> has mentioned the point of view of the local authority.  I think in the few words I said just now, I met the question very fairly.  I agree that as the object of the Bill is to extend medical facilities in this country and to get local authorities to provide for further treatment they have the right to some safeguard.  I think I met that very fairly by suggesting that the medical officer of health, who is more or less an official of such a body, should, in consultation with the local medical practitioner, decide where the patient is to go.</P>
      <P>The medical officer of health may not be in active practice; he may not have been treating cases for a certain number of years but at least he is a fully qualified registered medical practitioner and he would know and understand medical conversation.  He would understand what the local doctor meant when he said the patient should go to such and such a hospital for treatment.  I think the State or the local authority would be safeguarded if the medical officer of health was included in the consultation.</P>
      <P>I cannot for the life of me see how any Deputy can suggest that we are more or less attacking county managers as a body.  We are not.  We are attacking the principle of the thing.  We are defending the right, and it is a sacred right, of a doctor who has a moral contract with a patient, be it a male or a female, to give him or her the best treatment possible and he cannot do that if he is subservient to a State official who is a layman.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As to the question as to whether or not the county manager is the health authority, every Deputy knows that under the existing managerial system the county manager more or less has the final say in local administration. We must accept the fact that if we implement this legislation we are going to hand over the rights that exist at present between a doctor and patient to a lay authority and a State authority.  I said before that we believe in the freedom of the individual so I would ask the Minister to meet us on this point.  If the Minister agrees that the medical officer of <Col N="1871" /> health is to be included in this amendment in consultation with a general practitioner, that does not cover everything we want, but at least it provides a further protection inasmuch as it will permit of the moral contract between the medical practitioner and his patient being upheld and fulfilled.</P>

      <P>Subject to the local authority agreeing that he is either in the lower income group or in the middle income group.  There is no other &ldquo;subject.&rdquo; So far as this amendment is concerned, we are dealing with a choice of hospitals.  A doctor says to a patient: &ldquo;I want to send you to hospital,&rdquo; and the patient says: &ldquo;I should like to choose my own hospital.&rdquo; The doctor then will say: &ldquo;That can be arranged, but you will have to pay a certain amount.&rdquo;  The patient says: &ldquo;All right,&rdquo; and names a hospital.  The doctor then says: &ldquo;Right.  Off you go.&rdquo;  He then notifies the local authority that this patient has chosen his own hospital.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>It is, of course, the medical officer who will do it.  In any case the local authority does not come into the hospital part of it.  They come only into the means part of it.  They will inquire about his means and, of course, if a person or his family is insured, that is decided for them. Again if the person is a farmer under £50 valuation that is also decided, and there is no inquiry necessary.  The only possible case in which there can be an inquiry is the case of a person who is not insured or who is not a person under £50 valuation.  Then the question will arise whether his income is under £600 or not.  It is altogether wrong for Deputy Morrissey to say that he has no choice of hospital.  He <Col N="1872" /> has an absolute choice if he agrees to pay a certain amount, and if he is able to get the hospital to take £3 10s.  That is all he will get towards his hospital expenses.  It is only the other case we are talking about, where the patient says: &ldquo;I cannot afford to pay anything; in any case I do not mind what hospital I am sent to.&rdquo;  Then, of course, if the doctor says: &ldquo;I do mind because I think you should be sent to a Dublin hospital,&rdquo; if where the local authority is going to pay the whole lot, then somebody must decide whether it is an unreasonable request of the doctor or the patient that this patient should go to an outside hospital.</P>
      <P>Just to get the thing clear in the only case that is to be decided by the amendment, as Deputies have pointed out, the practice has been for many years, both since the county managers were introduced and before county managers were introduced under the board of health, where a doctor made a recommendation of that kind whether it was to the secretary of the board of health or to the county manager they got advice from some medical officer who either agreed or disagreed with the recommendation of the family doctor.  I do not think we can change that system.</P>

      <P>The thing has worked so smoothly for all these years that I do not see why you should put in all these restrictions.  Let us take another example.  A county manager is authorised by the local authority to build houses.  Does he build these himself or does he pay an engineer or an architect to carry out that work?  It is ridiculous to talk about sending a patient to hospital on the advice of a county manager.  Of course we know that a man in that position must get advice on the technical aspects of the matter.  There is another amendment to be moved to this Bill later setting up a local advisory committee.  On that local advisory committee there would be four members, two appointed by the doctors and two others can be appointed from outside or any way you <Col N="1873" /> like.  That is the type of case these people will be dealing with.  That is the object of providing that committee in response, first of all, to representations of the Irish Medical Association, and secondly to a representation from some of the religious authorities.  The Irish Medical Association were very keen on that local council where doctors would be represented because so many things might arise that it was considered advisable to have a local advisory council.  Everybody knows that if a county manager was, let us say, so ill-advised as to turn down a recommendation supported by medical advice, that this local advisory council could make a desperate row about it sufficient to keep the county manager from doing anything like that again in future.</P>

      <P>Being a doctor and a Deputy, I will be asked by doctors what the actual position is.  The Minister has said that the county manager will act on the advice of the county surgeon or the county physician, as the case may be.  Suppose I propose to send a patient to a hospital other than the local rate-aided hospital, what is the procedure I adopt?  Do I send that patient to the local hospital from which he will be subsequently transferred or do I send him directly to Dublin and report the condition afterwards?</P>

      <P>I was reluctant to enter into this discussion because the section appeared to me to be pretty simple.  Under the first sub-section, it seems clear to me that, in the first instance, the doctor is treating a patient and decides that hospital treatment is necessary.  The patient elects, unless the doctor advises otherwise, to go to the local institution or an extern institution from a panel of institutions approved of by the Minister.  The only other case is the case of a doctor saying definitely to a patient: &ldquo;I do not think you can get adequate treatment in the local <Col N="1875" /> institution; you ought to go to an extern institution in Dublin or in Cork,&rdquo; where ordinarily better services will be available.  I cannot understand why, therefore, there should be any question of consultation either with the county manager or the county medical officer of health.  It is a matter entirely between the patient and the doctor.  The patient elects to go to the local institution or to an extern institution.  On the other hand, if it is the doctor's advice that he cannot get the required treatment in the local institution, he goes to some extern institution.  I agree, of course, that, by default, in the greater portion of this Bill, the local authority is the county manager.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DanielMorrissey" hpid="Mr. Morrissey Mr. Morrissey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Morrissey</NameTxt>
      <P>Surely Deputy Corish realises that, if he is going to an extern institution in Dublin or Cork, in order to avail of the terms of the contract between the local health authority and the hospital, the patient must go through the local health authority machinery.  Otherwise, any doctor could send any private patient direct to the hospital.  The Minister in his reply tried to establish that the points we were raising were trivial points which amounted to nothing, but he immediately proceeded to show that they were anything but trivial, because apparently, according to himself, the very points that we are making here in relation to the local health authority, that authority in the ultimate being the county manager, were considered so important that very strong representations were made to him not merely by the medical authorities but by the religious authorities.  In response to those representations, he has agreed in a later amendment to set up a local advisory council, half of the members of which will be nominated by the medical authorities.</P>

      <P>Whatever the number, the Minister is doing that in response to recommendations made to him for exactly the same reason as we are advancing here.  Let me say, so that there will not be any misrepresentation, that what we have to keep in <Col N="1876" /> mind here is not what has been done up to now and what may continue to be done.  I am not casting any reflection on any local health authority or county manager, but we cannot divest ourselves of the responsibility that we are legislating for the future.  We do not know whether the system or the custom operated up to the present will continue.  Nobody sitting on these benches can say definitely that there will not or cannot be a change.  It is quite on the cards that you might get amongst county managers, as we have amongst T.D.s some very peculiar fellow who would not be prepared to take advice from anybody.</P>

      <P>I hope that they would not be as peculiar as some members of the House, but generally it is not as easy to get rid of county managers as it is to get rid of T.D.s, although it is being made rather difficult these days.  I am making the point that we are not concerned with the present position or with what the position has been in the past but with the system which may operate in the future.  We have to keep our eye on the legislation passing through here and remember that once it passes out of the Oireachtas its operation, administration and interpretation pass entirely from our hands into outside hands.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McQuillan</NameTxt>
      <P>It is an important aspect that Deputy Morrissey has dealt with that we are not concerned with what has happened in the past, but in order to understand the measure at all we must look at what has happened in the past and go on the experience we have gained.  I have been a member of a local authority for a short period and my experience has been that never did the county manager take it on himself to make decisions with regard to patients or hospitals without the advice of a competent medical authority&mdash; either the county surgeon or county physician.  I should like to know why Deputy Morrissey believes that the position that has obtained in the past is likely to change all of a sudden, within the next six months or two <Col N="1877" /> years.  I want to make it clear that I think this section is an improvement on the present situation.  It is nothing like what I would really like to see but it is an improvement to the extent that in future more people, especially those in the middle income group who up to the present could not take advantage of specialist treatment because they had to pay for it themselves, will be given a chance at least in future of getting this specialist treatment.</P>
      <P>The position that obtained in the past with regard to the lower income group has not been referred to here at all.  As far as that group is concerned, when we talk about a choice of hospital and so on I wonder how many Deputies have criticised the fact that the people in the lower income group who, according to Deputy McGilligan, number practically 1,000,000, have had no choice whatever with regard to either specialist treatment or hospital treatment in the past.  There was no choice whatsoever. I cannot understand what Deputy Dr. Esmonde is talking about when he speaks of a moral bond between the doctor and his patient; that the doctor must in conscience ensure that the patient under his care goes into whatever hospital that doctor thinks is the best for him.  That situation has never existed in the past. The only place that situation existed was where a patient had a big income and had no need whatever to go near any local authority.  In that connection the man in the middle income group, the man who is able to pay portion of his hospital and specialist treatment, can in future take advantage of the assistance that is being made available under this section.  He will be in a position to choose his own hospital and the local authority will pay portion of his costs.  To me the section is quite clear.  It is an advance on previous legislation and it will be a great help to the middle income group.</P>

      <P>I am in the same position as Deputy Mac Fheórais. Possibly the Fine Gael Party sees something in this section that I do not.  It strikes me that the only matter <Col N="1878" /> that the county manager will have to be advised on is the question of means. That having been disposed of, then the choice of hospital or doctor is the responsibility of the patient and his own doctor.  In the past that was not so.  The county manager had to satisfy himself as to whether or not a recommendation of the doctor's would justify him in incurring expense on behalf of the ratepayers in sending a patient to a hospital in Dublin or Cork, or somewhere else, away from the hospital services supplied in the county.  In the past the question of the hospital was primarily the function of the health authority or the county manager, acting on the recommendation of the county surgeon.  Under this section no question of that arises at all.  Is not that actually the case?</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Esmonde</NameTxt>
      <P>I think Deputy McQuillan's point in relation to the lower income group should have a reply.  Deputy McQuillan says that heretofore the lower income group had no choice of specific specialist treatment. That is entirely wrong.  I am not a dispensary doctor myself, but Deputy McQuillan should know as a representative of a local authority that practically every local authority throughout the county has an agreement with certain hospitals in Dublin In the majority of cases they have agreements with three, four or five hospitals&mdash;I am speaking now of the big voluntary hospitals&mdash;to which their patients can be sent.  If a doctor is treating a private patient and that patient is in the lower income group and unable to pay, up to a few years ago it was comparatively simple to get such a patient into a public ward in a Dublin hospital at a maximum of £2 2s.  Let it be said to the credit of the hospitals that in many instances they took patients for nothing.  If a private practitioner could not send a patient for a particular type of treatment, he could have that patient transferred through the local dispensary doctor.  It is quite untrue, therefore, to say that the lower income group <Col N="1879" /> have not available to them the specialist or hospital services that are available to others in the country.</P>

      <P>Local authorities in the majority of cases have an agreement with several Dublin hospitals.  I have confirmed that fact over the last few weeks.  Patients can be sent to any one of these several hospitals.  If that is not a choice of hospital, what is?  In each of those hospitals there is a multiplicity of specialists.  The dispensary doctor can pick any one of these hospitals to send his patient to.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnMcQuillan" hpid="Mr. McQuillan Mr. McQuillan">

Assume I am ill and my doctor tells me I am suffering from a certain disease; I get specific advice from someone else that a certain doctor in a different hospital would be ideal for me.

That is my interpretation of Deputy Dr. Esmonde's argument.  If that is so, what is to prevent a dispensary doctor in County Louth recommending that his patient be sent to a particular specialist in Cork?  As I see it, that is the argument that is being put up.  In my opinion it is an argument merely to waste time rather than an attempt to be constructive.</P>

If the local authority&mdash;I have stated this more than once&mdash;is providing a certain sum for the treatment of that patient, I suggest that the medical officer for health, being a duly qualified medical practitioner, should have the right in consultation with the patient's own doctor to decide where that patient should go.

      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I should have said also that this follows to some extent the present system with regard to insured patients.  In fact, what happens with insured patients is that the doctor sends the patient to hospital very often before he applies at all.  The same will happen here, particularly if the case is in any way urgent.  The point is that permission can be refused by the local authority.  If the patient is sent to a hospital he can get a note for the local authority and that would be all right.</P>

      <P>The Minister's amendment has a very important effect on a part of Section 15 about which we had such considerable discussion. I refer to the £1 clause.  All those people who are above the lower income group and above the special circumstances group referred to in sub-section <Col N="1882" /> (3) who would normally be able to pay, could get full institutional and specialist treatment in the local authority institution at a cost of two guineas a week if they opted to go to an institution other than that to which they are being sent by the local authority and the local authority will pay the normal £5 10s. less the two guineas.</P>
      <P>Under Section 15 a woman availing of the maternity care would receive complete free treatment in the local institution, and if sent by the local authority to any institution outside would receive free treatment too, but there is a proviso.  If a woman availing of the maternity care wishes to go outside the local institution or the facilities normally provided by the local authority outside, and if she wants to go to a doctor other than one of her own choice outside, then the assistance given will be the normal kind of health or surgical assistance and not maternity and the local authority will pay the £3 10s.&mdash;that is, £5 10s. less the two guineas.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister makes provision under Section 15, sub-section (3), in relation to persons outside the groups referred to in Section 14&mdash;that is, the remainder of the community, the people other than those in the lower income group and the middle income group.  The Minister sets out a special scheme which will operate on the payment of £1.  That was later changed to &ldquo;the appropriate amount&rdquo; and is now something which has yet to be specified. He invites women in the higher income group to come into a scheme but the Minister's disclosure on this amendment would seem to indicate that his idea in regard to this particular matter is very fantastic.  We have already referred to the Minister's reply in regard to the accommodation in connection with maternity beds throughout the country.  In Carlow you have eight, in Cavan 15, in Leitrim seven and in Longford five for the normal institutional treatment for maternity cases in regard to persons who are now in the lower income group. What is the idea at all of making provision for the £1 or the &ldquo;appropriate amount&rdquo; group if they are <Col N="1883" /> going to be invited to pay this £1 for the purpose of going to the crowded and ill-equipped local institution so far as bed capacity is concerned?  The Minister tells these that under this amendment, even though they belong to the appropriate fee-paying group, if they go to an outside institution or to a doctor of their own choice they can get no accommodation at all.  That is the only interpretation I can put on the amendment.  I would like to ask the Minister whether my interpretation of the amendment in relation to sub-section (3) of Section 15 is right or not or what would happen persons who were fee-paying persons under sub-section (3) of Section 15 if they elected to go to an institution of their choice outside?</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>It is obvious that, as the section stands, anybody coming under Section 15 will have a choice of hospital and will get the subvention of £3 10s. a week, under certain circumstances. It is true, of course, that, under Section 15, the women in the middle income group get free hospital and specialist services in regard to maternity, but they are not guaranteed that outside maternity.  In fact, we are treating the women in the case of maternity more favourably under Section 15 than people in the same family who suffer from other diseases. To that extent the Deputy has a case, that we should not, therefore, treat them the same.  In other words, that we should treat maternity cases more generously.</P>

    <P>My principal reply to that is we guarantee as far as we can that a woman will get the best possible treatment when she goes to her own doctor and he says that she is a case for specialist treatment.  She will get that treatment in the county hospital or she will be sent to some specialist hospital for better treatment still.  She may even be put into a private room or ward in that hospital because she happens to be a very particular case. All that will be done free if it is on medical grounds and in the best hospitals to be found in the country if necessary.  Of course, if she makes a <Col N="1884" /> decision on social grounds we will say: &ldquo;Well, if you want to make a choice like that you will have to pay a certain amount of the cost.&rdquo;  That is really what we are discussing here.</P>
    <P>The Deputy made a case for those who will contribute.  Perhaps, a case can be made for them but I would like to consider that further.  I do not really know whether you can make a very strong case for those who contribute. After all, if we say to people who contribute: &ldquo;We guarantee as far as the local authorities can do so that you will get the very best possible care. You have a choice of doctor in the first instance and if he recommends special or institutional treatment beyond that you will get it,&rdquo; I think that is promising a great deal even to those who contribute.  I do, however, undertake to re-examine the case of those who are contributing to see if they should not get perhaps even more favourable treatment than the others.</P>

      <P>When the Minister mentions medical treatment, does he mean medical treatment arising specially out of maternity conditions, or does he mean medical conditions that simply are a casual occurrence in maternity cases?</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>No.  The distinction that I meant to make was this.  A person might like to go to a certain hospital because she believed that it gave the best possible treatment&mdash;that would be for medical reasons&mdash;or a person might like to go to a home because it was a good address for the baby to be born&mdash;that is socially.  I made a distinction between medical and social in that sense.  She could have no complaint for medical reasons, because the local authority would say that they were sending the patient to the best institution in the country.  I therefore, hold that the patient will be influenced entirely by social reasons in choosing a private home in this case.</P>

      <P>I must say that I consider that as a rather remarkable suggestion coming from the Minister for Health&mdash;that a person, say, in the upper income group when she looks around to see where she <Col N="1885" /> can be treated for maternity purposes, will think in terms of the society tone of it, rather than the efficiency and standard of treatment.</P>

      <P>It is a rather peculiar outlook on the mentality of our people with regard to maternity and child work.  I do not believe that there is any foundation for it at all. However, I will leave it at that though I disagree entirely with what the Minister has said on that.</P>
      <P>I would like to be clear as to what the Minister's suggestion now is in regard to sub-section (3) of Section 15. In cases where people are invited to become fee-paying contributors to a scheme and are looking for medical, surgical, midwifery, hospital and specialist services without charge under the section, am I to understand that what they are offered is&mdash;if I have not misjudged what the Minister has said&mdash;that if they go to a hospital of their own choice they will be assisted to the extent of £3 10s. a week for two weeks?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichardJamesMulcahy" hpid="General Mulcahy General Mulcahy">
      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>Or such certified period, I take it, as their own doctor considers necessary?  Am I to understand that what they are offered as an alternative is that they will be dealt with in the local institution or, if their cases are exceptional cases requiring specialist treatment, they will be sent to such institutions as the local authority thinks can give the most up-to-date specialist treatment for that particular type of case, and, secondly, that if there is any medical treatment that requires to be dealt with concurrently with the maternity, either leading up to it or following it, they will have the benefit of being brought in under Section 14&mdash;that is to say, they will have a guarantee of the service available under Section 14 because they are covered by the fee?</P>

      <P>The Minister mentioned just now that, if it was thought <Col N="1886" /> by the doctor that it was necessary for the patient to get this maternity treatment in a particular hospital, that would be allowed.  He then went on to refer to social reasons.  I could not follow him on that.  I think that is unlikely to arise.  If it should, who is to be the determining factor, whether a person is going to a home for social reasons or not?  That would seem to me to be an extremely difficult matter to decide.  It would amount to accusing a patient of wanting to go to a particular hospital or institution for social reasons.</P>

      <P>In sub-section (1), page 8, lines 26 and 27, to delete &ldquo;the charges approved of or directed by the Minister&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>I am moving this amendment for the same reasons as we put forward when we moved a similar amendment to a previous section because I believe that the Minister should not have the power to direct or lay down the charges to be made by a health authority for the institutional services which are to be made available.  The section says: &ldquo;The charges approved of or directed by the Minister&rdquo;.  I think that is a matter which should be left entirely to the local authority.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputies will realise, of course, that local authorities, in laying down their charges, will be influenced to some extent, I suppose, by the financial consideration of what treatment in an institution will cost. They may say that there are limits beyond which they cannot go.  The Minister will also have the same consideration in mind because he will have to pay half of whatever the cost in these institutions may be.  I think it is fair, therefore, that the Minister should approve of the charges put up by the local authority as well as from the point of view of getting uniformity. I do not say that we can hope to <Col N="1887" /> get perfect uniformity as between cities and counties, but I think there should not be a big discrepancy as regards the charges between one county and another.  First of all, the Minister, as I say, is paying half the cost and, secondly, it is desirable to get a fair amount of uniformity. Therefore, I think the Minister should have these powers.</P>

Their deletion will not make much difference, but, at least, if that change is made it will leave the initiative to the local authority in fixing the charges.  The Minister will still have power under the section to approve or disapprove.  In doing that, he can have regard to charges made by other local bodies.  I should like to know the significance of the words &ldquo;directed by the Minister&rdquo;.</P>

I do not undertake to bring in an amendment on Report Stage, but I will consider the matter in the meantime in the light of our experience in the past.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>I know.  I am only making the contrast.  Under Section 14 it is the health authority which is given the power to extend the category or the number of people for whom institutional services may be provided. In that instance it is left to the health authority.  Is it necessary to bring in the Minister in respect of charges under this section?  The same matter comes in under sub-section (3) of this. If the health authority is to be the body to determine the group of people to whom certain services under Section 14 are to be made available, why not <Col N="1889" /> leave this?  I would have thought the determining of the group of people should have been more properly left to some central group because the Minister speaks as if an occurrence that ought to be deplored might easily happen under Section 14.  I understood the Minister to make the objection that one local authority might make charges of a certain type and they might be different in a neighbouring area but would there not be the same possibility of differentiation in regard to people who are to be provided with the services under Section 14?  One authority may make the services open very widely to certain people and others may restrict them. In fact, under that section I pointed to that as a flaw in the measure because it would mean the poorer county with low valuation would be more likely to restrict.  That would particularly be the case where the services ought to be more widely available because of the poverty of the neighourhood.  There may be discrimination by different local authorities; one may make it wide and another may make it very narrow. The Minister says the charges might be very low.  It would depend entirely on the type of area and the amount of money to be raised over the rateable valuation.</P>

      <P>&ldquo;Institutional services under sub-section (1) of this section shall be made available without charge for the persons specified in sub-section (2) of Section 13 of this Act and to such other persons specified in sub-section (2) of this section as may be determined by the health authority.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>That is right.  The Deputy will see that (a), (b) and (c) are very well defined and it is only under (d) that there is a discretion.  I do not know if I explained this when the section was under consideration.  It was extremely difficult; there is always the trouble of drawing the line between those who must get a certain benefit and those who will not.  When <Col N="1890" /> it came to £600 and the £50 valuation limits it was pointed out that you might have a certain man fairly well off with, say, £49 valuation; on the other hand you could have a man with a big family not too well off with £51 valuation.  It appeared unfair and the suggestion was made that we might have the higher valuation according to the circumstances of the family.  It was the same with regard to the £600. I thought it was better to keep these limits as simple as possible and to give discretion to the local authority to bring in those that could be considered as hard cases.  That is what is dealt with in sub-section 2 (d).  The man who is over £50 valuation and who has a large family, or the man over £600 who has a large or delicate family and is not too well off could be brought in. These are cases that must be considered locally and there can be no general guide, I am afraid, as to who should be taken in and who should not. It must be left to the discretion of the local authority.</P>
      <P>This, however, is a different matter. This is a question that can be generalised. You are above the middle income group, and they are presumed to be able to pay.  I think it is possible to make fairly general rules with regard to the amount of payment.  I presume the rule to be made will be that the patient will pay the cost of his bed in the hospital and will pay his share of the maintenance and attendance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>It is quite clear that there can be no standard for the whole country laid down&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Except that type of standard.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;except the general type such as that.  May I return to Section 14, sub-section (2) of which specifies people who are to have institutional and specialist services made available to them?  There are three categories of people which are definitely limited.  The (d) category is a bit indefinite.  It applies to:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;Persons not specified in the foregoing paragraphs who, in the opinion of the health authority, would be <Col N="1891" /> unable, without undue hardship, to provide institutional and specialist services for themselves or their dependents.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Therefore, right away the decision is left to the health authority.  They will decide with regard to the persons who will be unable, without undue hardship, to provide those services for themselves.  In relation to that, sub-section (3) says:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Institutional services under sub-section (1) of this section shall be made available without charge for the persons specified in sub-section (2) of Section 13 of this Act and to such other persons specified in sub-section (2) of this section as may be determined by the health authority.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I do not know whether that is mere repetition of what is in (d) or a mere gathering up of what is in (d), or whether that is another right of the health authority to add other people over and above those that a particular health authority may have added under sub-section (d).  Whether it is repetition or not the point I am asking is that it is the health authority which by this sub-section is empowered to make the decision.  Once the health authority is empowered there is the possibility of different treatment under different health authorities.  One health authority may take a liberal view as to the people who will be caused undue hardship; they may take an exact standard while others may take a low standard, say that the people can pay and that they will not extend the list.  There is to be contemplated a possibility of divergence as between different health authorities. I make that point to fortify what Deputy Corish said on this section.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>Amendment No. 46, Section 24.  The Minister took the objection that unless he had power to direct and approve there might be varying charges made to people who are to get the institutional services and who are not entitled under Section 14.  Does it matter whether the <Col N="1892" /> charges would be different or not?  I suggest that rigid uniformity is very bad.  Even on the Minister's general standard&mdash;he said that you will pay more or less the cost of the bed, the cost of the bed meaning the cost of the medical attendance and the cost of maintenance in a bed in a particular hospital.  That will be paid.</P>
      <P>That is going to vary not merely from health authority to health authority but even between institutions where there are more than one inside the health authority.  That is no objection. Why the necessity?  Why not leave this to the health authority?  Why does the Minister require the power to approve and to direct the charges?  I take the approval to mean that in case a health authority puts up certain charges the Minister will approve of these but the direction will mean that where the health authority made certain charges not approved of, the Minister wants power to say: &ldquo;No, not merely will I not approve of the charges proposed but I insist on you charging something else.&rdquo;  I think that is the purpose.</P>
    </Speaker>

      <P>Is not that going to be a fairly sufficient handicap, so to speak, as against them making small charges and, therefore, increasing the State contribution?  That is the way it will work out.  The fact that they have to shoulder the burden as to 50 per cent. ought to make them responsible. They are not going to go mad and give institutional services without very much in the way of charge.  In the end I would say&mdash;I do not think the Minister would agree&mdash;the more that is left to the initiative of the subordinate body and the less that is taken over to the centralised authority the <Col N="1893" /> sooner one is getting to the real teaching on morals in these matters.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I should remind the Deputy that I have in these cases to refer back to Section 14.  In previous legislation, like the infectious diseases regulations, the tendency was to have an appeal to the Minister.  We are dropping this appeal in this Bill. In other words, we are leaving the local authority the sole authority with regard to who they will give treatment to or refuse treatment to.  This is a sort of general thing, however.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>That is a pretty serious matter to leave to the local authority.  I would say much more serious than the charges for people who are not entitled to institutional services.  Surely it is a much more important discretion to give the local authority that they should say: &ldquo;You can get services&rdquo; and &ldquo;You cannot&rdquo; instead of saying to all: &ldquo;You have to pay for your services.  We will charge so much.&rdquo;</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>

I say, yes, we are moving in that direction.  I am not surprised if I am moving in the wrong direction as far as the Deputy is concerned.  However, we are moving in that direction.  The Deputy, having been Minister for Finance for some time, surely understands the mentality, if you like, of saying to a local authority that not only must we approve of their charges, we must also have power to say: &ldquo;You are not charging enough&rdquo; because, if they are not charging enough, the Department of Health has to pay half anyway.</P>

      <P>I assume that in respect of the different classes who are described under Sections 13 and 14, those people will have to declare their means at some particular time of the year so that the medical officers and the medical staff generally <Col N="1897" /> will be able to know at a glance, or say at a day's or a moment's notice, that they belong to such and such a class and that they are entitled to such and such services and that those who belong to the middle income group are entitled to such and such a service. Will there be a general round-up of all those people in the county, or will there be a check by him as to their means?  Will forms be issued or available?  Are those to be filled in or will the information be collected by, say, the home assistance officer or by some officers appointed by the local authority to carry out such an investigation as to means?  What are the actual mechanics of finding out the means and putting the people into the different classes?</P>

      <P>With regard to the lower income group the same definition will be there which has been there for many years back&mdash;a person not able to provide by his own ordinary and lawful means for medical treatment, and so on.  With regard to the middle income group, as I mentioned a few minutes ago, there are two classes there, well defined.  A person insured or any member of his family has only to produce the insurance card if asked to do so; and a farmer of £50 valuation requiring treatment for himself or any member of his family has only to produce his assessment for rates.  You have left then a rather small class, I believe, of those on salaries, whether under £600 or not, and I take it that it will be quite easy to determine in many cases, where you have public servants or allied services like teachers, the Gardaí, and so on, what their means are.  The only difficulty I see about means is in the case of people in business, like small shopkeepers, who may claim that they have less than £600 net per annum from their business.  The county manager, I suppose, if he is acting for the local authority, will probably ask them for a declaration and if he is not satisfied he may ask for some further proof that such a person has under £600.</P>

      <P>What about the person in the first group, in the lower income group?  As it operates at present is it <Col N="1898" /> not worked under a system of giving a red ticket?  My experience of dispensary doctors is this: that unless a doctor is perfectly satisfied that the person is not the type who should get a ticket he accepts their statement of means.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Kyne</NameTxt>
      <P>That is the system.  Will there not now be somebody who will do the allocation or will it be the doctor who will give a white card instead of the warden giving a red ticket?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>As far as this Bill is concerned the same system will continue. The person will go to the warden for his red ticket, but Deputies of course realise that not all people who go to the dispensary have a red ticket.  Many of them have not a ticket at all but the doctor takes them without question though he is entitled to question them.  It was suggested to me and I think to my predecessor, though I am not sure about that, that we should try to substitute the red ticket by something more convenient.  Now there is no use in anybody saying that we want to remove the pauper idea, the idea of looking for a ticket, merely by substituting a card.  My idea was that it would be more convenient to have a card because if a man is in the lower income group and gets this card current for 12 months, let us say, which certifies that he is in the lower income group them he or any member of his family can produce this card at the dispensary or to the doctor during a domiciliary visit or for any other purpose, showing that they are entitled to the benefits for the lower income group and that there is no further necessity to go for a red ticket at the same time.  I want to stress that it was for convenience that it was suggested that this card should be produced, but it was made use of the people to ridicule the whole idea, of saying that we were doing away with the red ticket and substituting a white card and in that way doing away with poverty.  Of course it makes no difference whatever about poverty. If people are in this group we should <Col N="1899" /> make it more convenient for them if we can.  However, these things, if the Bill passes, can be done by regulation.</P>

      <P>What I am trying to say in this.  This white card for convenience is issued at the discretion of the warden or by people acting as wardens.  I have no objection to that.  Instead of going every second week they may get a continuation certificate that they are entitled to medical attention.  What I am afraid of is that if the relieving officer takes on the responsibility he may have a different outlook altogether about the question of medical services. My experience of relieving officers is this, that they have to account to a county manager pretty regularly or to their council and they are inclined to be rather severe on the people.  They are not liberal.  The warden has not responsibility to the county manager at all when a man goes to him and he is inclined to be a more liberal than the relieving officer.  What I want to know is, is the relieving officer the person who will have the duty?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I could not answer that, but I presume it would be.  I think that the county manager would operate that system naturally.  He probably would operate it through the home assistance officer.  We could not immediately say that the red ticket system is withdrawn, because you may be sure that there are many people in the country who would not bother going for the white card and then they would get sick, maybe rather suddenly, and have to do something about it, so we must have the red ticket issued probably for some years.</P>

      <P>I am interested <Col N="1900" /> in Deputy Kyne's point on the definition of what exactly is the public assistance group.  I can sympathise with the Minister.  I have never known what the old definition actually means. I think the defination is: &ldquo;A person who is able to provide for himself by his own efforts or by other lawful means.&rdquo;  I think it might be to their disadvantage if it were more carefully defined or set out exactly what should be done, because I think the relieving officers and the district medical officers have various interpretations of that. My experience is that many district medical officers do not ask for the red ticket at all now.  I think it is a great pity that in this particular part of the Bill the Minister did not try to put what we call the public assistance group to-day and the middle income group into one section of the Bill.</P>

      <P>There are many sections where there are differences in the treatment they will receive. The point that Deputy Kyne was discussing was the way relieving officers would treat cases to decide whether any person was in the public assistance group or was not.  I think that, rather than try to define the public assistance group, he should work for the abolition of whatever differences there are between the public assistance group and the middle income group and try to make them all one throughout the Bill.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think we can appreciate Section 25 without having a look at Section 26, since we are getting well away from the old easy-going method of the red ticket and getting into rather difficult territory for the future.  Section 25 gives the health authority power to require <Col N="1901" /> from a person a declaration.  That declaration is to discover whether a person is or is not entitled to any service provided under this part of the Bill.  They can also ask him to make that declaration in such form as the health authority considers appropriate and the health authority is empowered to take such steps as they think fit to verify the declaration.  All that adds up to considerable power.  Such power might easily be brought under review in the courts in a case where it was sought to surcharge people for giving services to people who were not entitled to them.  If there were any reliance on the old easy-going attitude, the court might say: &ldquo;You started off again in 1953 and the legislative body took care to ensure that the health authority was empowered to get this declaration and could take steps to verify the declaration.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>You go on to Section 26 which I ask to be allowed to look at, at least in this connection.  Section 26 says that if a person is recorded for the purpose of the section by a health authority as entitled on account of specified circumstances to a service provided by the health authority, he is to inform the health authority of any change in the circumstances.  In the next sub-section there is a fine of £20 for which he is made liable if he does not notify the change in circumstances.  Let us apply that to Sections 13 and 14.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Section 13 is the old &ldquo;destitute&rdquo; section&mdash;the health authority is to make available without charge for certain people certain services that they are unable to provide for themselves. Who are the people?  That is defined.  It is the old definition under the Public Assistance Act&mdash;I do not think there is any change&mdash;those who are unable to provide &ldquo;by their own industry or other lawful means the medical, surgical, opthalmic or dental treatment or medicines or medical, surgical or dental appliances necessary for themselves or their dependents&rdquo;.  A person may be in that class but if his circumstances change to the point that he move out of that class and does not notify the health authority, the health authority may come down on him and he may <Col N="1902" /> be fined £20.  There is an amendment to take that out but it is still there.</P>
    <P>Services may also be rendered under Section 14.  The Minister says that some of these groups will more or less define themselves.  There are four categories, the first of which is people insured under the Social Welfare Act. The Minister thinks it easy to find out who they are.  There is also those given under (c)&mdash;adult persons whose yearly means are derived from farming, the rateable valuation of the farm or farms being £50 or less.  In that there is a little bit of choice&mdash; people whose means are &ldquo;in the opinion of the health authority&rdquo; so derived.  May I accept for a moment the Minister's view that that class will define itself pretty easily and there will not be any reason for a declaration? I am not so sure about that. It may be said that a local authority was not efficient or attending to its duties if it did not demand an declaration. There is also the class of people whose income is under £600.  The Minister thinks it is a small group.  It is adult people whose yearly means of are under £600.  This whole matter is defined afterward in sub-section (6)&mdash; that it includes the yearly means of the spouse, where such spouse is resident, and the annual means of any unmarried son or daughter of the person or of the spouse or deceased spouse, where the son or daughter is normally resident with such person.</P>
    <P>The Minister might get some clarification if he asked the Dublin authority regarding their difficulties on the differential rents, which goes down to a means test and to getting information to enable that means test properly to be applied.  It seems to me that there could be considerable difficulty, unless we are going to adopt a very easy-going attitude in regard to the middle income group in defining people under paragraph (b).  Those are the difficulties that are ahead.</P>
    <P>Section 25 is now starting a new system and is no doubt to be taken that it will be represented hereafter that the legislative body was turning back on the old easy-going method of the red ticket and, now that they were <Col N="1903" /> announcing what were to be better benefits, there was going to be better regulation of the class entitled to the particular benefits.  The red light is shown in the next section.  If a person's circumstances change so that he shifts from the destitute group to the middle income group or from the middle income group out of that group, and does not notify the authority, he may be fined.  There is an air of complete illegality about this.  There is definitely a more disciplined system where services are going to be provided, but provided with more rigidity and more regard to the points of entitlement. It is a pity we could not get that matter clarified, as to what the health authority intends to do.  The Minister talks about a declaration. There are two types of declaration. There is that called a statutory declaration, and falsehood in respect of it may get a person hauled before the courts and fined.  I do not know whether a declaration is going to be much good otherwise.  I can see the ordinary declaration where a health authority says it believes, from its view of a man, that the man is inside a particular group and entitled to get certain services.  I believe they are going to demand a statutory declaration.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NoelCBrowne" hpid="Dr. Browne Dr. Browne">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>I naturally, of course, am impressed by the argument put forward by Deputy McGilligan against this proposed system which is implicit in this part of the Bill.  There are two objections which fall to the section, the insistance on the declaration of of means.  Deputy McGilligan has made the case which is universally recognised against the imposition of means tests, particularly in health services.  Inevitably, one must run up against these terribly complex tedious attempts by the draftsman&mdash;with the best intention in the world, I have no doubt&mdash;to cover every contingency and all the contingencies mentioned by Deputy McGilligan.  Even if one did not have other objections to the means test and the attempt to cover all the likely eventualities which must flow from this very complicated legislation <Col N="1904" /> in relation to the means test, one would have to be moved by the appalling prospects which this opens up.  This is an attempt to keep control as to the people who are within particular income groups, the people who have moved out of those groups and the people who move in, to follow the change of their financial circumstances in cities, towns or in the country.  There is no doubt that in order to meet the wishes of the people who are in favour of a means test in relation to health schemes, this tremendously elaborate administrative machine must be engaged in the local authority service.  It is most regrettable that this should have to arise and that it should have to be created.  The ideal would have been to jump all these fences in one and have a scheme in which there was no necessity for a means declaration or means test of any kind.</P>
      <P>If, however, one does accept the necessity for a means test&mdash;and I must confess, of course, that I accept it as a temporary measure in view of the fact that it appears to be the wishes of the majority of the House&mdash;I feel absolutely certain that there will eventually be an extension of the T.B. no means test service, the neo-natal no means test service and the infectious diseases no means test service and the maternity services included in this Bill itself.  I think that is the one bright part of the Bill&mdash;that that principle has been maintained, possibly slightly vitiated but I do not think in effect vitiated.  That principle will be extended over the years and eventually we shall be able to rid ourselves of this rather frightening incubus which must be created in order to help the various local authority officials who must be guided by the very rigid rules created by the Minister under this legislation.  The ideal arrangement would be for us to dispense with the assessment of means and to decide that the health service shall be available to all, either because they need it due to economic circumstances or because they are paying rates or taxation, the need being decided on purely medical considerations.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The main objection to the means <Col N="1905" /> test is not any doctrinaire political objection at all.  As far as I am concerned, it is an objection based on medical grounds that you can have an even type of service with a means test running through it.  I think you can get different levels&mdash;two-tier, three-tier levels&mdash;and I think that the lower income group can come off least well in the contest for the health services. If one does insist on the retention of a means test in our health services, that heritage of years gone by, then I am afraid that all these sections for which you create this very involved and complicated series of regulations are simply consequent on your insistence on the retention of a means test.</P>
    <P>Deputy McGilligan talks about the free-and-easy red ticket days, and so forth.  It is no use telling a relieving officer or a public official that he can use his discretion.  Unfortunately, I do not think the average official feels free to do it.  He must be bound by the letter of the laws we create. Therefore, if we insist on keeping this means test we must impose this very expensive administrative machine on our local authorities.</P>
    <P>From conversations I have had with visitors who, in their own country have valuable no means test health services, I found that one of the main arguments put forward by them for these types of services, particularly in Great Britain, was that the means test was administratively terribly complicated and very expensive to carry out and that, for that reason alone, it was thoroughly undesirable.</P>
    <P>The Minister cannot be accused of having introduced these things particularly willingly.  We know quite well that this legislation is amending the 1947 legislation for which he won the authority of the House for a free no means test scheme and which would be a much bigger bite at the whole cherry which, in reality, would be a free no means test health service.</P>

      <P>The outrage that I find here is that whereas this section plans to deal with the means tests that will define the lower income group, the middle income group and the deserving <Col N="1906" /> cases in between, and the higher income group, we are told in this section that the health authority shall take such steps as they think fit to deal with the matter&mdash;that is, that the machinery and the method of distinguishing between the different groups in the spectrum will be such steps as the local authority think fit.</P>
      <P>Deputy Dr. ffrench-O'Carroll suggested that it is better not to define too clearly how this will be done.  Here is an inquiry section and we find that the approach is: Better not inquire too deeply how this inquiry is going to be carried out.</P>
      <P>Deputy Dr. Browne's appreciation of what will arise here is that very rigid rules must be created by the Minister to deal with the matter.  He implies that the local authority officers who, more and more, have to deal with these matters are getting into the position that they are not able to use their own discretion in connection with this matter.</P>
      <P>The outrage that I find here is that, in a very complicated and very vital work, that is, discriminating between the lower income group, the middle income group and the higher income group, and fairly assessing the rights of every particular person, all we are told is that, in the administration of this matter, the health authority shall take such steps as they think fit.  I think we ought to be told to what extent, if any, the Gardaí will be called upon to carry out inquiries or to take steps in the matter, or any other class of officials, or whether or not new machinery is going to be brought into existence.</P>
      <P>It appears to me that it is an outrage to tell the House that, in a matter like this, the local authority&mdash;in other words, the county manager&mdash;may take such steps as he thinks fit.</P>

      <P>I hope the Minister will not lose sight of one of the observations made by Deputy McGilligan with regard to those people who might, from time to time, drift under the heading of &ldquo;persons insured under the Social Welfare Act, 1952&rdquo; and thus become participants in the middle income group services.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1907" /> Every Deputy in the House knows that we have thousands and thousands of these people who cannot, as sub-section (2) of Section 13 specifies &ldquo;... provide by their own industry or other lawful means the medical, surgical, ophthalmic or dental treatment or medicines, or medical, surgical or dental appliances necessary for themselves or their dependents.&rdquo; I have in mind people who would be unemployed for 11 months of the year and who, say around Christmas, might get relief work under the local authority or get some temporary job around Christmas but would be unemployed for the other 11 months of the year.  What is their position?  What change is there to be if, strictly, they and their families are to be regarded as person insured under the Social Welfare Act, 1952, and, coming under the heading of the middle income group, would thus be deprived of certain services and appliances, particularly dental treatment, to which they would not be entitled under the middle income grouping although they are services which they certainly could not afford themselves?</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I must say that it was not intended at first, whatever way the Deputy might have read it, that everybody in the insured class would be in the middle income group.  Many insured people would be in the lower income group if they &ldquo;are unable to provide by their own industry or other lawful means the medical, surgical ophthalmic or dental treatment, or medicines, or medical, surgical or dental appliances necessary for themselves or their dependents.&rdquo;  There are many people insured who have not a bigger income than, say, £4 a week. I have in mind farm labourers, and so forth, and perhaps other people even lower than that.  Naturally, they would be the lower income group.  I should say that probably half the insured people would be in the lower income group.  An insured person can, however, claim to be in the middle income group.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>This ought to be taken seriously.  A section of this type <Col N="1908" /> is needed of course once there is to be a means test or a number of means tests, and there are quite a number throughout these proposals.  May I take the points made by Deputy Mulcahy first?  This certainly is extremely wide.  There was a point that, apparently, was of some significance to the Minister when discussing amendment No. 46 and certainly the same sort of difficulty arises here.  In discussing amendment No. 46, that is, that the charges were to be approved or directed by the Minister, because the Minister thought it necessary to regularise the charges, to make them more or less uniform or at least to have the power to keep some near approach to uniformity, the Minister apparently regarded it as objectionable that these matters should be left to each separate health authority because you might get a series of charges with very wide divergencies between them.  Similarly here in regard to this rather special matter of finding out a person's means, when there is attached to the means, test a penalty&mdash;because the matter is to become an offence under certain circumstances rendering a person liable on summary conviction to a fine not exceeding £20&mdash;the form of the declaration would surely be a matter in which the Minister should intervene and give us a specimen type of declaration or a ruling generally with regard to the declaration.  That would appear to be the way out of this, that a statutory declaration would be the one which would be imposed on people in the end.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is said that where there has been an insistence on the means test there has been an insistance on objectionable inquiries of this type.  An inquiry is particularly necessary if one has to discriminate between people and if one has to supplement what people are able to provide out of their own resources for these medical services.  But if you cross the borderline you get into rather dangerous territory if you want to do what people should morally be required to do for themselves. An inquiry is necessary but it is wrong to leave it in this vague form: &ldquo;A health authority may require that person to make a declaration in such form as they consider <Col N="1909" /> appropriate.&rdquo;  Deputy Mulcahy pointed out that the matter is still wider when you say: &ldquo;May take such steps as they think fit to verify the declaration.&rdquo; In the end it would work out that there will be a declaration required, and if there are circumstances breeding suspicion a person will be taken to court and the declaration will be produced and some evidence given which will establish <i>prima facie</i> that the person is getting aid to which he is not entitled.</P>
    <P>We are getting into a new system. I do not think it can be denied that it is a new system.  Up to date these services were provided on what is called the red ticket system.  I always understood from my acquaintance with medical practitioners that the administration of public assistance through the red ticket system was carried out in what was described as a very charitable way.  Apparently there is some objection taken to having a service rendered on grounds of charity.  I do not think there is anything wrong with that.  But when you get to another point, when you come to something that people are entitled by legislation to demand as a right, even though the right is limited by certain circumstances, there is no use blinking the fact or trying to pretend that you can render services of this kind on a charitable basis.  You simply cannot. You must have a real inquiry about means.  It may not be developed too rigidly.  It may be that only, so to speak, exceptionally bad cases, really fraudulent cases, will be brought to court.  But there must be some definite discrimination made as between the categories and much more court activity in bringing defaulters and defrauders to book if persons try to get into a class in which they will get freer benefit or better services than they are entitled to.</P>
    <P>I think it is necessary to accept that we should have a means tests in this legislation and, having a means test, we must have some procedure by way of declaration, something that has been described as an inquisitorial procedure. That is a necessary adjunct to the provision of a means test.  I am glad we have a means test.  I think it <Col N="1910" /> is necessary.  I think it divides people into different groups and that we can give the aid required instead of putting every grade on a charitable footing.</P>

      <P>I understood Deputy McGilligan to say that the administration of the red ticket system was done in a charitable way.  I do not agree with that, because the red ticket at present is issued by wardens and, in my experience, a lot of the wardens, particularly in the country, are local shopkeepers, and the position in practice is that if a person wants to obtain a red ticket under the dispensary service very often he has to go into a shop and ask for that red ticket.</P>

      <P>A lot of medical officers never bother about a red ticket.  There are circumstances where a doctor can request a red ticket and, if a person comes without a red ticket, he is within his rights in saying to the patient: &ldquo;You must go back and get a red ticket.&rdquo;  The vast majority of them do not do that.  I should like to come back to the point of the means tests as far as this section is concerned.  I hope the Minister will see that it will be carried out by the relieving officers under more decent conditions and in circumstances where there will be some privacy so that the disclosures made by the applicant will be confidential.  If there is to be a means test, I hope the Minister will do away with the wardens.</P>

      <P>As regards this means test, Deputy Dr. Browne is consistent in maintaining that there should be no means test.  He also stated that there would be an imposition of the means test under this particular section and that in due course there would be built up in every area a considerable amount of administrative expenses.  I agree with that.  I think it is an argument against the whole principle of the sections with which we are dealing from beginning to end.  It also I think brings us back to the point that <Col N="1911" /> the only satisfactory solution in this case is to have contributory insurance. If you have contributory insurance, you do away with all question of means tests.  The argument as to whether you require a means test or do not require one does not arise.  Simply, people who are not able to provide for themselves with the present high standard of living are able to meet the expenses that will come their way when they are unfortunate enough to be in the hands of medical attendants or going to hospital, if they are aided by contributory insurance.  The only means test is as to whether the money is utilised for the purposes of treating them for whatever ailments they may have.</P>

      <P>I am arguing that if you have contributory insurance you will not require a means test.  Deputy Dr. Browne says we should not have a means tests, but the Minister is introducing a means test.  I am maintaining that you will do away with the means tests if you have contributory insurance.  You will not need a means test or a big administrative staff, which is what you are going to have. You can start in a small way with a few officials.  The outcry in this country is in the case of every Department: we have too many officials; we are paying too many taxes; we cannot afford to pay those taxes.  If you are going to have a means test you are going to have more officials, more expenses and the administrative cost is going to be considerable.  Therefore, I think the only reasonable solution is if you abolish this section altogether, have no means test and introduce contributory insurance.  If you do that, you are going to remove expenses and ensure that money taken out of the pockets of the people is used for the purpose for which it was intended and goes into the health services and not into administrative costs.  I asked the Minister the other day what he estimated administrative would cost&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>&ldquo;For the purpose of determining whether a person is or is not entitled to any service provided by them under this part of this Act, a health authority may require that person to make a declaration in such form as they consider appropriate in relation to his means and may take such steps as they think fit to verify the declaration.&rdquo;</P>

We have three sections of the community to deal with.  We have the lower income group in which we are going to have perpetuation of the red ticket to which some Deputies have strong objection.  We are going to have also white cards and if a person has a white card which says he is under continuing treatment, it will obviate the necessity for him to get a red ticket. I think I agree with Deputy Dr. ffrench-O'Carroll that the majority of doctors do not look for red tickets.</P>

      <P>We are on the lower income group.  Now let us take the middle income group.  As the Minister said difficulties will not arise with regard to the farming community because it will be quite easy for the county manager or a health authority&mdash;I assume we are agreed now that the county health authority is the county manager&mdash;to refer to the rate book and he can easily find out what means are there.  But I think in the big centres such as Dublin, Cork and so on, there will be considerable difficulty in ascertaining the means of intending participants in this health scheme, and I would like the Minister to give us some idea of how the county manager, or the <Col N="1914" /> relieving officer or whoever else is there, is going to find out this means. Has he the right to go to the employer and find out what he is paying his employees? Has he the right to insist on getting a declaration on oath as to the means?  I think you will agree with me that the thing is not as simple as it sounds.  There is going to be considerable expense and in the final analysis you are going to have a lot more civil servants under this Health Bill, or under Section 25 alone than you have at present, and a lot more taxes and expenses thrown on the country.</P>

      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>I think we have rather thrown emphasis on the red tickets in the discussion on this section and that is unwise and unnecessary. I think it has tended to obscure the enormity of this section.  Section 13 deals with the lower income group but Section 14 definitely deals with a number of classes that add up to about the middle million of our population. The first million contains the lower income group and the second million contains various classes, and according to this Bill entitles them to certain services, medical and otherwise.  But in order to define what services they are entitled to, they will require to be classified.  The person who is the authority, the sole authority to classify them is the county manager.  We are told here in Section 25 that he shall take such steps as he thinks fit to classify them and classify them in relation to their means.  He can require them to make a declaration in such form as the county manager considers necessary.  If the county manager, having received such a declaration as to their means does not exactly believe that it is a true account, then he can take such steps as he thinks fit to see to what extent the details of that statement are right or wrong.  That is all we have been told about this and I suggest that the talk about red tickets, about wardens, the relieving officer and all that, has nothing to do with providing us with information with regard to the scheme.  Deputy Dr. ffrench-O'Carroll thinks that the relieving officer should have his powers extended to cover the whole spectrum of our population in this matter.</P>

If I did not misunderstand Deputy ffrench-O'Carroll, the suggestion that the Deputy made was that the machinery should be the relieving officers, acting a little more delicately and with a greater sense of privacy than a shopkeeper who might be authorised to give red tickets.  I do not know if the machinery is to be the relieving officer but if it is to be the relieving officer, I think it should be put into the section here.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I want to suggest that the Minister has not given us the slighest information in relation to the section.  There are so many things here that the Minister is required to do and so many regulations that the Minister is asked to make that there is a remarkable shyness departmentally and ministerially about having anything to do with the section.  The lack of information is what I can only describe as a legislative outrage.  Surely the Minister does not think that it is reasonable to give sole power to an official such as the county manager to decide what steps he should take to find out whether the information given about a person's means is right or wrong.  Is the county manager going to have power to refer say to bank managers <Col N="1916" /> in case somebody with an income of £550 may have a thrift account or is he entitled to approach shopkeepers to see to what extent information regarding the debts, which the statement says a family owes, is correct?  Is he entitled to approach the Guards to ascertain what they know of a man's general mode of life or anything like that?  I submit that it is not sufficient to say that the county manager shall take such steps as he thinks fit to do all the things that he may decide are necessary to enable him to come to a decision as to what part of the income spectrum a person belongs.  There is a dividing line as between the first million of the population, the second million and the third million and this section enables a county manager to conduct an inquiry to ascertain to what section an individual may belong.</P>

      <P>The only thing that arises here is the making of an inquiry into the declaration of means.  It must be quite obvious to everybody what the section means.  The county manager will, first of all, ask for the declaration if he thinks it necessary to do so and, secondly, will follow that up by any steps he thinks necessary to verify it. I think Deputies will agree that the investigation that takes place is necessary only in a very small proportion of cases.  There is no doubt about most cases.  This investigation will, therefore, arise only occasionally.  If there is a means test, as some Deputies say and as I have admitted, then you must have power to investigate.  The section enables the county manager to take whatever steps he thinks fit to verify a declaration but it is obvious that under the law he cannot compel a bank manager to give him information.</P>

      <P>It is rather late in the day to have any Deputy in this House on legislation of this type, appealing for privacy, when the whole purpose of the Bill is to stuff into the public ward all the various people who are going to get service under this Bill.  Let the Deputy who is so disturbed about privacy consider this aspect of the matter.  In the public ward of a hospital you are to have the various people who are destitute and who cannot by their own industry or other lawful means provide for their medical services.  In another bed in the same ward you will have a farmer whose valuation is under £50.  In a third bed will be the person whose family resources are not more than £600 a year, and in still another bed a person who is insured under the Social Welfare Act.  All these people are going to know all about the position of their neighbours.  There used to be a cant in this country about 2½d. looking down on 2d.  Now we are going to give these people plenty of opportunity of looking down on one another by placing them in neighbouring beds in the same public ward.  In that situation the Deputy pleads for privacy.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickBrowne" hpid="Mr. Browne Mr. Browne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>When the House adjourned last night, I was speaking on the 1948 Trade Agreement, on the land project and on the system of allocation of bulls to the different county committees.  This matter of the allocation of bulls is a serious matter in my county, where there is a shortage of bulls.  It constitutes a serious drawback for the cattle industry, from the point of view of foundation stock and quality of the breed.  I mentioned last night that, in one electoral division, we had two old premium bulls which we could not replace.  That is a serious situation.  I do not know whether the owners bought a bull on their own or not, but if they did not do so, the position must be very serious.  There is the special term bull system, and both of these men made application for a special term bull, when they could not get the premium bull, and so far as I know they were both refused.  I refer now to the Ballina electoral division.</P>
      <P>In our county, when we set about allocating bulls from the quota available, on the basis of two-fifths dairy and Shorthorn and three-fifths Aberdeen Angus, we divide them up amongst the electoral divisions, and the difficulty in that respect is that one electoral area may want a greater number than another from the point of view of the number of premium bulls which may terminate at a certain time in a certain year.  If these men I speak of bought bulls on their own and paid the full price of a premium bull at the Dublin Show, they would need to be fairly wealthy farmers.  In another electoral division, there was a man who had been a premium holder for years and we could not supply him either, due to this two-fifths and three-fifths regulation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I suggest to the Department that, in relation to the allocation of bulls, the country should be divided into three areas.  An area comprising Mayo, Donegal, Galway, Leitrim, and, possibly, Kerry should not be put in the same category as Meath, Kildare, Westmeath and Longford or the three counties of Cork, Limerick and <Col N="1920" /> Tipperary, which are dairying areas and for which special regulations should be made.  In Longford, Westmeath, Meath and Kildare, the Shorthorn is a suitable type of bull, but in my area the Aberdeen Angus is the only suitable type.  Three-quarters of the county is mountainous and barren and the people of the area would prefer an animal on the lines of the Aberdeen Angus rather than risk the beef Shorthorn, because they could not rear the calves.  They can get on fairly well with the ordinary black small type of cow or the coloured cow, with the Aberdeen Angus, but you will never get them to turn over to the beef Shorthorn or dairy Shorthorn.</P>
    <P>I should like to see a reasonable proportion of the dairy breed of bull in my county; but on the basis of two-fifths and three-fifths, when a quota is allotted, you will get as many Aberdeen Angus as you wish provided you are able to get the required proportion but that proportion is far in excess of what you would wish to get in order to replace premiums.  I feel that a proportion of 70 per cent.  Aberdeen Angus and 30 per cent.  Shorthorn or dairy would go a reasonable distance towards meeting the difficulty in my county.  We would prefer more, but that, in itself, would be a great help. I think the Department are too firm in this matter.  I know that in one area in my county we were only a small percentage short but the Department refused to move an inch.  Even though the percentage was almost available to qualify for an Aberdeen Angus, the Department were not prepared to move even an inch in regard to providing the area with such a bull.</P>
    <P>As to the land project, this is a scheme which gave a huge amount of employment in my county.  We talk here about increased employment on the land and the initiation of that scheme was the beginning of the putting into work on the land of every available man.  The Government ask the farmer to increase tillage and the only way in which we can get that increased tillage is through this land rehabilitation scheme.  It is a scheme which, as I say, put hundreds of people working on the land.  We had this <Col N="1921" /> machinery and these gangs of men working on the land, and we had another section working on local drainage under the Local Authorities (Works) Act.  All these schemes ran hand in hand but the land reclamation scheme can go only 50 per cent. of the way towards complete success, unless the Local Authorities (Works) Act drainage scheme is in operation at the same time.  If a farmer wanted to have two, five or ten acres of waterlogged land reclaimed and made application, he would not be able to get that land reclaimed unless provision cation, he would not be able to get that land reclaimed unless provision had been made to take the water off the land, with the result that his application would be refused.</P>
    <P>In my county to-day there is tillage on land that was waterlogged and that would not feed a snipe five years ago. To-day anyone can see the improvement as a result of reclamation.  That land is a valuable addition to the holding. No county would benefit more from land reclamation than the county I represent, with its big population, low valuations and poor land.  The land project scheme would be a godsend to the people of County Mayo. Farmers with valuations running from £2 to £7 10s. have been tilling the same land for years past.  Land reclamation would add two, three, four or perhaps five acres to their present holdings.</P>
    <P>The drainage carried out under the Local Authorities (Works) Act, run in conjunction with land reclamation was very valuable.  It provided employment for the people in the rural areas.  It provided that employment in close proximity to their own homes.  The money spent was spent on constructive work and expenditure in one year meant that the farmer could reap the benefit of that the next year.  That money showed a return.  The scheme was different in its conception from other public schemes under which the registered unemployed in an area were required to travel long distances to report for work on roads, for instance, or else lose their unemployment assistance. Very often they rose in the dark hours of the early morning, had their breakfasts in the dark and cycled long distances to work; they had no lunch and waited until they cycled home <Col N="1922" /> again in the evening to have dinner and tea combined.  Work under the Local Authorities (Works) Act and the land project was done in close proximity to the homes of these people.  The workers had an excellent return from a purely monetary point of view.  It is a pity those schemes have suffered some interference because they were very successful.</P>
    <P>It is regrettable that the machinery has been disposed of to private contractors. Hitherto if a farmer wanted to do the work himself he could avail of the services of a private contractor. If a farmer did not want to do the work himself he could apply to the Department and the Department would do it for him.  Now the work is entirely in the hands of private contractors. I am wondering if the scheme will continue.  Is there any danger that it may collapse?  About three weeks ago in my own county I heard of a farmer who had made application to have four or five acres of land reclaimed.  He had engaged a private contractor and that contractor was to start work on a certain date. Instructions were given that the work was not to go on, with the result that the work was held up.  Eventually the work did start.  Great numbers of applications for land reclamation work have been sent in from County Mayo. Are private contractors free to tender for this work?  If the owner has to do the work himself I can see this scheme coming to a rapid conclusion in the very near future.  Mention has been made of £30 per acre.  I understand it will cost anything from £20 to £25 to supply clay pipes.  Concrete pipes will cost anything from £15 to £18.  There will not be much of the £30 left by the time the pipes are paid for.  I am afraid the farmers will prefer to go out and work on the roads for the county council at £4 or £5 per week and I believe they would be better off doing that than in reclaiming their own land.  The only satisfactory way in which to do land reclamation is by means of a Government scheme, the Government operating the machinery over large tracts of land.</P>
    <P>In the smaller areas where there is <Col N="1923" /> a small acreage to be done let the private contractor do it.  In the areas where a man can afford to spare a certain proportion of his time during the year let him do it.  Under the old scheme a man had every chance of doing that.  He could spend £12 or he could save it and have the work done. If he were unable to afford the £12 he could pay it by means of an addition to his rent.  The contribution per year was 9/- an acre.  In this way a man added many valuable acres to his holding.  To-day the value of that land is very much greater when you take into consideration the value of land let in conacre, meadow or for grazing.</P>
    <P>I would appeal to the Department to give very serious consideration to the question of the allocation of bulls. I know it will be a problem for the Department in the dairying areas because the dairyman will take the best advantage of his dairying cows.  The dairyman may get from £15 to £20 for a two to four weeks old white head calf and it will be very difficult to get that man to put a dairy bull in with his herd and sell the bull calf or the heifer calf for £6 or £8.</P>
    <P>I was told about a man in Tipperary who sold 15 white headed calves out of his dairy herd and got £19 6s. 8d. each of them or approximately £290 in all.  The calves were two to 12 weeks old.  I know there is a problem there for the Department but it is a problem that has to be solved some day if the dairying industry is to be protected so far as the foundation stock is concerned.  Nevertheless, there should be ways and means of doing it.  Having a method for the whole country will only create an injustice in places such as I have mentioned in my own county.</P>
    <P>Members on the opposite side said last year that during the term of office of the inter-Party Government the Minister for Agriculture went to America.  That was a very profitable visit as it was responsible for bringing trade to this country so far as beef and the dead meat export trade were concerned.  That in itself was one of <Col N="1924" /> the greatest sources of income that was ever provided for the farmers.</P>
    <P>It was of great benefit to farmers living in the country and especially to those farmers who live in areas where you have a big surplus of fat cattle. Every farmer knows that during the months of September, October and November there is a surplus of beef in this country.  You had no place to dispose of that surplus except on the British market but the British people themselves had a surplus of their own at that period.  The result was that these heavy beef cattle were a drug on the market.  It was not easy for the big farmer to dispose of those cattle in September, October or November. They could dispose of store cattle at a good price from April to July.  After that those cattle became fat cattle and were on the farmers' hands.  The dead meat export trade to America was of great advantage to those farmers.</P>
    <P>Were it not for that trade you would not have all those factories springing up to give employment during that period and to buy all the surplus cattle available.  That was of great benefit so far as the winter sale for beef cattle available.  That was of great benefit so far as the winter sale for beef cattle was concerned.  The visit by the Minister for Agriculture to America during the time of the inter-Party Government paid dividends.  It provided a means by which the surplus of cattle at that particular period of the year could be disposed of.</P>
    <P>During this debate we were told about the cattle, poultry and pig population in 1947 and in 1951 and 1952. We were told that the number of cattle increased in 1951 and 1952 and that the number of pigs went up in 1951 and 1952.  The number of cattle cannot be increased in one or two years.  The foundation was laid in 1948 and the increase began to show itself in 1951 and 1952.  It would take two years at least before an increase in the number of poultry would show itself.  Here again the inter-Party Government laid the foundations of a thriving industry. Hatcheries were set up in 1948 and 1949 and this led to a vast increase in the number of poultry.  There was a subsidy for chicks and the Department of Agriculture advised the people in the rural areas to go in for the day-old <Col N="1925" /> chicks and produce more eggs.  I did my part.  I know that the egg is of great benefit to the community.  It is a money builder.  It provides money for the rent and is of particular value to those living in the poorer areas.  The same remarks apply to pigs.  The number of pigs cannot be increased in one year or two years.  It would take a minimum of two years to increase the pig population because you would, first of all, have to make up your mind in regard to the type of breeding sow. In the circumstances, you would not have young bonhams for at least two years.  If the pig population increased in 1951 and 1952 the ground work was done during the time of the inter-Party Government.  No farmer in this country is able to make a living on one class of farming.  He has to have mixed farming to make a success of farming.  By going in for mixed farming the farmer will be able to sell something at the different periods of the year.  I believe that in the dairying areas other methods will have to be adopted having regard to labour and other costs.</P>
    <P>In the dairying counties you have huge quanties of milk going back to the farmers from the creameries.  It is used for the feeding of fowl and pigs. In my area we have small farmers with two and three cows.  Apart from the value of the calves and the high prices prevailing for cattle to-day, the cows they keep are able to provide them with milk for their own use, while the buttermilk and the skim milk is utilised for the rearing of pigs.  In some areas they are able to fatten pigs within from 3½ to 4 months.  They buy young pigs and are able to turn them out within that time, pigs weighing from 16 to 18 stone.  They may pay £8 for a young pig and in a minimum period of four months can put that pig on the market.  It may weigh 16 stone.  They are able to do that, mainly in cases where they have surplus milk which they use with potatoes and maizemeal for the feeding of pigs.</P>
    <P>I realise that, from the point of view of its cost, butter is becoming the problem as far as ordinary consumers in the towns and cities are concerned.  They are finding it difficult to buy creamery butter at its present price.  I am of <Col N="1926" /> opinion that, within two years, there certainly will not be the same sale for creamery butter as there is to-day. The position in many rural areas at present is&mdash;I am speaking now of areas which are outside the dairying counties &mdash;that the people are going back to the old system of churning butter for themselves. These are areas where you have big populations.  People can buy a churn at from £2 10s. to £5.  That is why I say that within two years a great number of people will not be buying any creamery butter.  They will be able to supply their own home butter requirements as they did 15 and 20 years ago, with the added advantage of having the buttermilk for the feeding of fowl and pigs.  I think the people are wise to do that.  I remember that in my county 25 or 30 years ago, the people bought very little creamery butter.  They made the butter at home and, as I say, they are going back to that system again.  That, of course, may not happen in the dairying counties.</P>
    <P>In conclusion I want to say that in my opinion the land project scheme, the drainage scheme and those other schemes which were introduced by the previous Minister strongly influenced the decision arrived at by the people in the recent by-elections in Wicklow and Cork.  In view of that I think the Government would be well advised not to proceed with the sale of the machinery that was purchased for the land project scheme.  I think they should take the advice that was expressed by the people when they cast their votes at these by-elections. I take that advice to mean that the machinery should not be sold.  It should be put back working on the land in the manner that obtained before the change of Government took place.  At that time you had a number of men getting employment on the schemes sponsored by the then Government.  Many men were employed, too, by the private contractors who took work under the scheme.  The position at that time was that small farmers were enabled to take advantage of those schemes.  The sooner the Government comes to a decision in regard to these schemes on the lines <Col N="1927" /> that I have indicated the better it will be for the country and for the people.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DanielDesmond" hpid="Mr. Desmond Mr. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>It must be quite evident from the views expressed by members representing the various Parties that the problem of agriculture is one which calls for the closest co-operation from all of us.  Full regard, of course, must be had to the views expressed by a number of speakers because of their different approach to this problem as it applies in various parts of the country.  The Minister, in the course of his opening statement, made certain comparisons. These comparisons covered not the last two years but went back over a number of years.  I suppose, from motives of political expediency or otherwise, particular attention was drawn to the figures covering, the last two years as against the years 1949 and 1950 under the inter-Party régime.  On paper the figures may favour the present system but I consider that it ill-becomes a Minister and a Government, no matter what Party happens to be in Government, to be just satisfied if they are able to show on paper figures which seem to justify the Party claim that their system of agriculture is the correct one for the country as a whole&mdash;the system which they have put over on the people and which they expect the farming community to operate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are some points in the Minister's statement to which I should like to direct attention.  Deputy Browne mentioned some matters affecting the West in a particular way.  It is vitally important for all of us to realise how the various matters dealt with in the Minister's statement can affect different localities.  While that is so, it is incumbent on us to take the overall picture of the country as a whole rather than of small particular areas.  Dairying was one of the outstanding matters dealt with by the Minister.  Members of various Parties have expressed their views on that. Some Deputies seem to differ in their approach to that very important problem.  I appreciate the fact, of course, that the views of a Deputy <Col N="1928" /> representing the West of Ireland will differ from those of a Deputy speaking for the South, because different problems arise, so far as the dairying industry as a whole is concerned, in the West and in the South.</P>
    <P>On pages 8 and 9 of this statement it seems to me that the Minister has dwelt very much on milk prices and in particular has dealt with creamery butter.  Although the Minister may wish to draw special attention to the fact that in both these instances increases are noticeable, and although that in itself may tend to suit the farming community, when considering the problem of the producer or the farmer, we must also be prepared to consider the overall results of any steps taken.</P>
    <P>The views I hold in this particular instance differ somewhat from those expressed by the Minister because while he dwells on the prices appertaining to milk I consider the kernel of this important situation is not just prices but the quantity of milk put on the market.  When Deputy Dillon was Minister for Agriculture he was abused both in the House and outside it when he suggested certain prices for milk. I understood his view to be that a price should be fixed over a certain period of years.  This day-to-day policy of fixing milk prices irrespective of the quantity of milk produced and put on the market is an unsound one.  Dairying is one of the most important aspects of agriculture and we are facing this problem in a cowardly, half-hearted manner.</P>
    <P>While the Minister may say farmers are not denied the right to keep, if they wish, some of the approved milking breeds which I mentioned last year &mdash;a view which I still hold because of the facts proving the case&mdash;such as the Freisian breed, they are not offered the same facilities or benefits if they use such breeds.  As Deputy Browne mentioned the South of Ireland has been, is and must always be considered as a dairying area.  According to statistics the milk yield in the country is shown clearly to be anything but satisfactory.  Are the farmers in the South to be told that they must follow the policy of the present Government <Col N="1929" /> and past Governments and that they must continue to use breeds which are not giving an adequate output of milk?</P>
    <P>If we give freedom of action to the farmer and encourage him to go in for the Freisian and other breeds that can give 700 or 800 gallons of milk, surely we would be doing better for the farmer and, what is vitally important, for the whole community than we are by throwing a sop of a penny or tuppence a gallon, thus encouraging the farmer in a half-hearted manner while still pursuing the policy of maintaining breeds yielding 300 or 350 gallons. That is the problem which the Department of Agriculture are not facing up to.</P>
    <P>People down the country, year in and year out, blame the Department of Agriculture for the existing state of affairs.  However, I am entitled to assume that the officials of the Department of Agriculture as in other Departments, will be prepared to put into operation the policy of the Minister even though they may hold views which differ from his.  I would not for a moment believe that the officials of the Department would try to force the Minister to adopt their course of action.  Therefore, I blame the Minister who must realise that the policy in operation, not for the last year or two but for very many years back, shows clearly by results that the problem is not a mere prices problem but is one of output of milk.  The sooner we are prepared to give, through the various county committees of agriculture, the same facilities to members of the farming community who are anxious to deal in other breeds such as Freisian, Kerry and other types that are proving themselves valuable in connection with milk supplies, as are given to those dealing in the Shorthorn or other types, the sooner we will be able to make some attempt to solve the milk problem.</P>
    <P>This statement does not offer any encouragement to the people who are very often held at ransom in regard to milk.  These are the people in the cities, in the towns and villages of the country.  In Dublin City and Cork City milk prices are controlled.  They <Col N="1930" /> are controlled at a high price; but even worse than that is the position in villages and towns where there is no control; prices very often are even higher than they are in Dublin City and Cork City.  The blame in this regard must be placed at the doorstep of the Minister for Agriculture, no matter what Government he may belong to as long as he is prepared to pursue the old policy of supply and demand.  Very often the demand being at various times of the year so much greater than the supply, people are forced into paying a high price which the farmers must charge because their production is unfortunately at such a low level.</P>
    <P>Attention is drawn in the notes issued by the Department to exports and export prices.  Reference is made to the export of chocolate crumb and various other milk products, such as condensed milk.  I admit the importance of agricultural exports because we are depending to so large an extent on paying for imports by agricultural exports, but we are inclined to forget all other aspects of this vital problem and to confine ourselves to the question of exports.  We have adopted and seem to be continuing the system in operation in other countries based on the slogan: &ldquo;For export only.&rdquo; There is the extraordinary position that we are importing to this agricultural country a quantity of butter.  I know the Minister may say that the export of chocolate crumb creates employment.  On the other hand the exportation of milk, even in the form of chocolate crumb, can be detrimental to the health of the children of this country if we are not at the same time in a position to supply them with sufficient butter.</P>
    <P>I do not for one moment accept the view expressed by the Minister as to the large amount of butter that is consumed in this country.  It is forgotten that we have a large tourist industry. We know that by various means butter very often crosses an artificial border. We are expected to take it from the statistics that it is not tourists who are consuming butter but that all the butter is used by our own people.  As a Deputy from a rural area I can say <Col N="1931" /> definitely and I challenge contradiction that there are very many working class homes where butter is at a premium at the present time.  At 4/2 a lb. we all know, but apparently at times we are not prepared to admit, that butter cannot be made available in the quantity in which it should be made available for young children in such homes.  We were told by many members of the present Government two years ago that butter had to be imported owing to the mistakes and the faults of the inter-Party Government. The inter-Party Government have been out of office for two years and their so-called sins should be forgiven by now. The Government must be prepared to admit that the continuation of a policy, even this year, of the importation of butter simultaneously with the exportation of milk products, chocolate crumb etc., is not fair to the people of this country.</P>
    <P>I am not prepared to accept the Minister's view that because the manufacture of chocolate crumb creates employment the people should be prepared to use foreign butter or margarine. Our first duty is to retain sufficient butter for the home market.  The Minister or the Parliamentary Secretary may have in mind the cost involved. We can discuss that later on.</P>
    <P>Pages 24 and 25 of the notes contain a summary of the existing services for the artificial insemination of cattle and proposed developments.  The figures quoted reveal a continuation of a policy which is producing undesired results.  I do not wish to go through the whole of it, but I take Mallow, County Cork.  The breeds of bulls kept include: Dairy Shorthorn, Hereford and Friesian.  At Mitchelstown, County Cork, the same breeds are kept.  In many other instances I notice that Friesians are omitted and Dairy Shorthorn and Hereford are included. There is one important station to which I should like to draw attention, Clonakilty, County Cork.  It is in West Cork but on the borders of South Cork.  In that case the breeds of bulls kept are given as: Dairy Shorthorn and Hereford.  Yet it is stated at the bottom of the page:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Clonakilty: To cater for the <Col N="1932" /> Cork milk production district, it is intended that a sub-station to Clonakilty station be provided in the Cork City area.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The Minister admits that in this particular instance it is with a view to catering for the Cork in milk production district.  Why is it&mdash;will the Minister answer me&mdash;that in this particular locality Friesians are again omitted? The problem of milk and butter supplies is one which many people do not wish to face up to.  Will the Minister give us any information regarding the present position in the Cork milk board area and the vitally important question of pasteurisation in that area?  When Deputy Dillon was Minister he did his very utmost to have the problem of pasteurisation of milk supplies in Cork City suburbs brought to a head. Many vested interests fought to the utmost to hold up that scheme.  In reply to a question by Deputy James Hickey and myself very recently the Minister stated that he was awaiting information from the interests concerned in Cork.  Are we going to wait for any information?  Is the Minister going to pursue what his predecessor did to the utmost&mdash;a policy of trying to get the people concerned to realise that pasteurisation in that particular area is going to be a help to the people and the children, and financially can be a help to the producers themselves? We have no information on it, and I should like to know what is the actual position in that particular instance.</P>
    <P>Deputy Dillon mentioned, and therefor I am not going into it in detail except to say that I agree with the point of view he expressed in connection with it, the veterinary services dealing with live-stock diseases.  This problem of farmers losing live stock owing to the prevalence of certain diseases is a serious one in various parts of the country.  Will the Minister see how improvements may be made regarding it, and will he and his Department see if they can speed up the report dealing with diseases, which is an important item and would undoubtedly be a help to the people in the various localities?</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1933" /> Turning then from the question of milk supplies to another one, there is the question of flax which affects people in particular parts of South Cork.  What strikes me very forcibly here is that the Minister states: &ldquo;That indications are that there will be a substantial decrease in acreage this year.&rdquo;  We were very happy and pleased to know of the building and preparations made to put into operation machinery in a factory adjacent to Cork City to deal with this important crop, but unfortunately there are many people in the western part of South Cork constituency at the present time who are severely worried over the fact that there is no indication as to how they stand regarding a fair price for this crop in the future. The fact that the Minister states that there is going to be a substantial decrease in this crop is bound up in the fact that these people are not getting the co-operation or help they deserve.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DanielDesmond" hpid="Mr. Desmond Mr. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>To flax.  A few years ago members came into this House and it was extraordinary to listen to them taking sides and supporting the views of certain associations from the northeast counties when the Minister for Agriculture at that time took a very solid stand and told them, more or less, that they were not going to get away with anything that he considered was not fair to the farming community dealing with flax here.  On many occasions members of the then Opposition during the 1948-1951 period lamented the fact that the Minister for Agriculture at that time was letting down the flax growers.  I think that time has proved that his actions brought the representatives of this Flax Spinners' Association to their senses, and time also proved that through his actions he was undoubtedly giving full co-operation and support to the flax growers.  Now we are at the stage where the reverse is the case and the flax growers are more or less at the mercy of the four winds and are going out of production in this particular crop.  If they are I believe that the fault undoubtedly lies with the Minister for not pursuing to the <Col N="1934" /> full the policy of his predecessor in this instance.</P>
      <P>Many Deputies mentioned, as the Minister himself did, the importance of soil testing, and many members spoke on the land project scheme.  Soil testing undoubtedly is something that the farming community should be made to understand fully as being of vital importance to them as a section of the community.  The sooner they realise the importance of soil testing the better for themselves and ultimately the better for the whole community.  I would like to say that while I fully appreciate the enormous amount of work placed on the shoulders of the officials dealing with soil testing in Johnstown Castle, etc., it would be very pleasant, if it is at all possible, to have the tests gone through more quickly and the results sent out speedily.</P>

      <P>Undoubtedly, it was a worry to them, and they had good reason to worry over it, because while those people did appreciate the importance of this service and had made it quite clear that they were prepared to avail of it, unfortunately the result, which in the final analysis is very vital to everyone concerned, was not coming through.  I should say in all fairness to everyone that if this system can be speeded up it will help not alone the farming community but eventually through the results the whole community.</P>
      <P>In connection with the land scheme, which Deputy Dr. Browne mentioned, there is no need for me to go into it in detail except to say, as I have already stated on other occasions, that I believe it was deplorable for the Minister for Agriculture, I presume with the full co-operation of his colleagues in the Cabinet, to adopt a scheme of selling or preparing to sell the machinery in this scheme.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I know, of course, that members may look at this problem from different angles and they may say that contractors <Col N="1935" /> can do a good job.  I am not going to deny that, but we must be prepared to consider this from all angles.  Will anyone in this House, even the Minister himself, suggest that a contractor getting the machinery to be sold by this Government is going to facilitate the very small landowner who will need a couple of acres done?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>Does not any member of this House know that if a contractor can go into a very large holding he would actually pick and choose? He is bound to take the contracts for the large landowners at the expense of and to the detriment of the small landowner, and it just seems, in my opinion, that in this particular scheme now being offered to the people the man who needs the help of the State, the small farmer, is at the end of the queue, and very often there will be little hope for him of getting on to the bus because the large landowners will be there before him and leave him at the end of the queue.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>Members also mentioned the problem of members of the farming community in connection with their applications for loans from the Agricultural Credit Corporation. Surely there cannot be complaints from various sides of the House without reason, and it cannot be said that where members of all Parties get complaints from all parts of the country they are all telling lies.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I believe there are cases where the applicants are given a severe test and everything is scrutinised.  I agree that it is necessary to have a proper check, but it should not be necessary, as is happening at present in some instances, for a man almost to tell the officials what he had for breakfast and hopes to have for his tea, before they consider his application.  Agriculture must be considered not as a political question but as an economic one, which affects not only the farmers but the entire community.  We must be prepared to say that if it is necessary for farmers, particularly small farmers, to <Col N="1936" /> get loans and if they offer solvent sureties, those loans will be given, that the applicants will not be delayed for a long time and then, as in some instances at present, completely turned down.</P>
    <P>I mentioned at the start the problem of exports and of home prices for butter and other items.  I am in a happy position on this Estimate of not being tied to advocating a policy to suit only the farming interests.  It is because Deputies&mdash;and at times Parties&mdash;are trying to court the votes of this section of the community, that they are not prepared sometimes to say what they think is wrong or what steps should be taken to remedy what is wrong.  If any Deputy is prepared to examine the figures and tot up the totals of the amount of hard cash given by way of grants to the farming community, he will undoubtedly find that it is a very interesting total. While I fully appreciate the necessity to give these grants, I often wonder&mdash; as they have been given for so many years and yet the Minister's statement is so serious on the production aspect &mdash;whether the present grant system is giving us the returns we wish or that the community is entitled to expect. This is a problem which has not been faced for the past few years but which must receive attention.</P>
    <P>Certain sections in this community are getting doles and grants.  It would be well for us all if every person in this small country of ours were able to continue without even a grant or a dole.  While I am fully in favour of giving grants where necessary&mdash;and I believe they are necessary&mdash;I still say that we must be prepared to admit that the policy of giving grants, while in itself it is justifiable and good, is operated by a system which must be wrong somewhere, as otherwise we should be getting better returns in the way of production.  The sooner we are prepared to admit that a new outlook is necessary and that a new system must be put into operation in connection with these grants, the better for us.</P>
    <P>At present, as in all the years back, grants are being given for various buildings and out-offices, piers and <Col N="1937" /> gates.  I agree with this policy, but who is benefiting most by it?  Very often the men who need them most cannot avail of these grants.  The small farmers Deputy Browne was speaking of in the West of Ireland or the small farmers in the SouthWest, because of the size of their holdings, will not have occasion to apply for grants for hay-barns, gates or piers.  In my opinion, it is the large landowner who is getting the highest percentage of any grants available for this purpose.  It may be said that he, through his mixed farming, is giving a good return, but I believe that this system of grants at present is very often detrimental to the man who should get most in grants, that is, the small farmer.</P>
    <P>Coming back to the question of prices, it is extraordinary that for many years past we have been operating a policy of export, export, export. We never seem to take into consideration the position of the man, the woman and the child in our own country who must buy in the home market.  We should be prepared to operate a scheme whereby the producer would get the fair price to which he is entitled.  Members here and in other places may speak against State co-operatives, but if we start by giving a fair price to the producer and if we export at the highest possible price, and where necessary, when we know the home prices in the retail shops are too high, if we are prepared to help the consumer, then we are approaching this problem.  Otherwise, the more we export, the higher automatically will be the home price, whether it is for bacon, eggs, butter or something else.  The more we can send to Britain or elsewhere the more will the supply be curtailed automatically at home and the higher will the prices soar.  Our first obligation is to see that while the producer gets a fair price the consumer is not fleeced, as they often are in connection with some of these commodities.  If the present Government or any other Government were prepared to offer to the farming community not alone a policy but the advice as to the vital importance for their own sake of adopting a system of co-operative selling, there would be <Col N="1938" /> some benefit for the seller of the produce. We cannot continue in Dublin, Cork or elsewhere a policy under which housewives and housekeepers have to stand looking at shop windows, at the plentiful supply of vegetables, butter&mdash; imported or otherwise, it is immaterial &mdash;eggs, and other produce so much needed in their homes.  What we want is that they should be able to go in by the shop door and purchase those commodities.  Our policy of being prepared to sacrifice everything with a view to export is undoubtedly a rash policy and one that is not fair to our own people.</P>
    <P>I turn now to the question of vegetables and fruit.  The Minister dealt with fruit in his statement.  We are all anxious to see Irish fruit sold in the shops and to see increased supplies of vegetables in the shops.  Can the Minister, or Deputies on any side of the House, say why the prices for home-grown fruit are sometimes so exorbitant in some of our shops?  Can Deputies or the Minister, who naturally is responsible, tell us why, even in the past few months, apples, for instance, are so prohibitive in price and so poor in quality?  I am sure the Minister would agree that apples are very good for children.  It seems, also, that for the past few years the importation of apples at this time of the year has been stopped.  I would agree to that decision under certain circumstances but I would not agree to it if its sole purpose is to promote the sale of a product here which, in a large number of shops at this time of the year, is inferior in every respect except, of course, in price, which is always prohibitive.  Undoubtedly, we want to support the growing of home-grown fruit and we want to help the growers of fruit in this country, but the community cannot be fooled all the time.  They are entitled to say that if they must pay high prices for home-grown fruit it should be of good quality and marketed in good condition. I urge the Minister to inquire why supplies of home-grown apples at this time of the year are so often of such inferior quality though of such a high price.</P>
    <P>Through his Department, the Minister should draw attention to the importance <Col N="1939" /> of encouraging the growing of vegetables in this country.  This is a problem which it may be quite easy to solve.  While we can sympathise fully with the housewife who has to pay high prices, very often a small patch of ground is sufficient to enable a family to grow most of their own vegetables.  During the years of the emergency, many people availed of plots for this purpose and it is deplorable that more use is not now made of them for the growing of vegetables.  It is also a weakness in our agricultural policy that those farmers who live near cities and towns do not grow more vegetables.  It may be somewhat difficult but undoubtedly the financial return warrants the outlay involved. It would help us (1) to help the producer and (2) it would help to solve the problem of the price which the consumer has to pay.  The producer will undoubtedly get a fair and reasonable return for his outlay and, in addition, it will help the consumer.</P>
    <P>On page 10 of his statement, the Minister mentioned the oil-dipping of eggs.  We all know that, at certain periods of the year, the supplying of eggs is a problem.  If we could devise a system whereby we could put adequate supplies of eggs on the market throughout the whole year, then undoubtedly we should again be helping the whole community as well as the producer.  The poultry-keeper is faced with the problem of putting eggs on the market at a time when the prices are high, owing to scarcity, and it is obvious that any poultry-keeper who has eggs to offer at such times of scarcity gets a very high price for them because the supply cannot meet the demand.  It would be better for us all if we could devise a system whereby we should have adequate supplies of eggs on the market all the year round at a guaranteed price rather than have fluctuating prices.  I realise, of course, that this is a problem which is not easily solved.  I would not for one moment accuse the Minister in respect of the present position or assert that it is a problem which could easily have been solved.</P>
    <P>I now refer the House to the first appendix of the Minister's statement. <Col N="1940" /> It is very important to draw attention to some of the reports contained therein.  We see reference, under the heading &ldquo;Root and Grain crops&rdquo; to that very important item, potatoes. According to the figures supplied by the Minister, we grew 317,169 acres of potatoes in 1939.  In 1952 the acreage dropped to 310,017.  Some people may say that the difference is not very great but in my opinion the tragedy is that the pendulum is swinging the wrong way.  If we compare the prices of potatoes between the years 1939 and 1952 then all I can say is that the people are being held up to ransom and that we have a policy in operation now which, instead of helping to bring about an increase in the acreage of potatoes, is bringing about a decrease.</P>
    <P>Time and time again, members of the present Government have emphasised the importance of the growing of wheat.  It is true that the difference in the wheat acreage between 1939 and 1952 is relatively small.  It has, indeed, reduced but I admit that the reduction is very small&mdash;a matter, maybe, of 800 or 900 acres.  We must, however, take the overall picture into consideration. What are we paying for the growing of wheat?  When I ask that question I do not mean just the growing and the harvesting of the crop; I mean what do we pay for it by the time it is processed into flour.  What, also, are we paying for the important crop of potatoes?  It may be said that the consumption of bread is heavy in many households.  I do not know very much about cities but I know a lot about rural areas and, at one o'clock every day in the country, the important item on the menu&mdash;if we may term it as such&mdash;is a fine feed of potatoes.  Are we encouraging or, at times, even going as far as to coerce the growing of wheat in areas which may not yield the same good return in the way of wheat that they would yield in respect of the potato crop?  We may be called unpatriotic if we suggest that it might be possible to import some of our wheat requirements.  I move to report progress.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ThomasAnthonyKyne" hpid="Mr. Kyne Mr. Kyne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kyne</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 49:&mdash;</P>
      <P>To delete sub-section (2), lines 12 to 14.</P>
      <P>We hold that the suggestion of a fine of £20 for failure to notify an alteration in circumstances is of great importance.  We feel that it is impossible to think of imposing a penalty of £20 on a person who, owing to an error, may forget to report an alteration of circumstances.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This is not a question of a person attempting to get or getting some benefits wrongly.  It is simply a case of a person not reporting an alteration in circumstances and being liable on conviction to a fine of up to £20. Circumstances could alter without the actual knowledge of the person concerned.  As you are aware, under another section a householder is responsible for the income of an unmarried son residing with him.  The income of that son could change without the knowledge of the person involved and, although he might not be aware of that alteration, he would be liable, on failure to notify that <Col N="1942" /> alteration, to conviction and a fine. We think it is of the utmost importance that this sub-section should be withdrawn.  I should like to hear what the Minister has to say to justify it. I could understand a penalty being imposed for attempting to secure a benefit under certain conditions, for putting the State or the local authority to wrongful expenditure, knowing well that it was wrong, but for mere failure to report a change in circumstances I think it is very wrong to have such a sub-section as this.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DanielMorrissey" hpid="Mr. Morrissey Mr. Morrissey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Morrissey</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to support Deputy Kyne in this amendment very much indeed.  First and foremost, we have to remember the people who may be concerned in this. They may be people living in very remote parts of the country.  Even if they are not living in remote parts, we ought to advert to how simply a change of circumstances can be brought about in the family position or in the family income and how a man, quite innocently, might not advert to the fact that a change had come about. For instance, at the time he made the application for the services a member of the family might be unemployed and, while he was still in receipt of these services, that person might get employment.  That, of course, would make a change in his circumstances so that he would not be entitled to the services given.  I do not want to go into all the things which could happen, but I can conceive quite a number of simple ways in which a person's circumstances could change.</P>
      <P>I suggest that it would not be sufficient answer for the Minister to say that this sub-section fixes a maximum penalty of £20 and that, of course, if a case went to court, the judge or justice would take all the circumstances into consideration and would fix the fine accordingly.  It is not a sub-section aimed at checking deliberate misrepresentation when a person is applying to have certain services made available to him.  It is a question of not reporting some quite simple change in the circumstances that may come about to which the recipient of the services may not advert.  I think the amendment is a reasonable one.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>These sections from 25 to 31 deal, generally speaking, with the case of false information, if you like. I want to explain to Deputies that when we were considering this scheme about people being entitled to hospital services when their means were within a certain limit we had to consider when drafting the Bill whether they would have to go to the local authority and ask: &ldquo;Am I entitled or not?&rdquo;  That would be obviously very bad.  I said that the way to draft the Bill was: let them go into the hospital and get their treatment and let it be decided afterwards whether they were entitled to it or not, because it is more important after all that they should get the treatment.  You must remember that in considering Sections 25 to 31 we have drafted them in that way.  In other words, let them go on with the treatment, let there be no delay as far as the treatment is concerned, let it be assumed that the person who applies for admission is entitled to it; but if he makes any false declaration he must pay for it and pay for it heavily.  That is the idea.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DanielMorrissey" hpid="Mr. Morrissey Mr. Morrissey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Morrissey</NameTxt>
      <P>That is not what we are dealing with at all.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I think Deputies will consider that that is better than having the inquiries carried out beforehand.  I am very much in favour of going on with the treatment and accepting a person's statement for the time being but, if he makes a false statement, we should deal with him severely.  In Section 31 you will notice that for any false declaration the penalty is very severe, a fine not exceeding £50 or imprisonment for any term not exceeding three months, or both fine and imprisonment. It would be possible to say that if a person moved out of the group he was in he might be liable to these penalties, but in this section we are making it a bit easier for such a person, because a person may move out without realising it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think, after all, that if a person moves from one class to another and continues to get treatment and some time afterwards the local authority discovers that in the middle of the treatment this man's income moved up <Col N="1944" />&mdash;I do not think, considering the courts of this country, they are going to be very severe on him.  If it can be shown that a man did that deliberately, and knowing the full circumstances, and went on receiving free treatment&mdash;in that case I think everybody would agree the penalty should be fairly severe.  It is a difficult problem, of course, and I do not know whether Deputies could really suggest that it could be modified in any way.  I would like to cut it out completely but I think Deputies will agree that the courts of this country are not too severe in cases of this kind.  They are very lenient and will not inflict the penalty unless they think a man was deliberately fraudulent.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DanielMorrissey" hpid="Mr. Morrissey Mr. Morrissey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Morrissey</NameTxt>
      <P>That is the point, and if I may say&mdash;if Deputy Kyne will allow me&mdash;there is a very big difference between an act of commission and an act of omission.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DanielMorrissey" hpid="Mr. Morrissey Mr. Morrissey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Morrissey</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister will himself agree that it is a different thing for a man requesting treatment to go in and deliberately give a false picture of his circumstances and a man to go in and give a true picture of his circumstances and in the light of those circumstances he is classified and gets treatment.  Some time subsequent to that a change takes place&mdash;it may be such a change as a member of the family who is unemployed getting a job.  It is quite possible&mdash;and another angle on it&mdash;that a change and a substantial change in his circumstances could take place without the person himself being aware of it or being made aware of it.  I think the Minister will agree that that is possible.  It is not a question of whether the penalty will be £2, or £5, or £20, but if a man is brought in, who is only technically guilty, it is the shame of being brought into court on a charge of having made false representations in order to obtain money or services belonging to the ratepayers to which he was not entitled&mdash;that <Col N="1945" /> is the biggest penalty of all you can inflict.  I do not mind&mdash; and I am sure Deputy Kyne would not object to&mdash;penalties for people who go and deliberately make false declarations or statements for the purpose of getting treatment.  That is quite a different case from the case Deputy Kyne tried to make here.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasAnthonyKyne" hpid="Mr. Kyne Mr. Kyne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kyne</NameTxt>
      <P>As Deputy Morrissey says, we would have no objection if it was a question of fraud to secure benefit, or even attempting to secure benefit by fraud.  But the Minister in starting his reply gave me the impression, whether he intended it or not, that the first thing required was to have got the benefit.  That appeared to me to mean that you would have to have got the benefit before you would be charged, but the section does not say that at all.  It says:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Where a person is recorded for the purposes of this section by a health authority as entitled on account of specified circumstances to a service provided by the health authority under this part of this Act, he shall notify the health authority of any change in those circumstances such as renders him no longer entitled to the service.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>Then, in the following sub-section it says he can, on conviction, be fined up to £20.  I want to say this: that the person who gives all the information as required in the first instance to whoever is appointed to find out his classification, has no knowledge outside his circumstances and wages or income of what position or class he will be allocated to.  If his means bring him almost out of his group any minor alterations of income later may put him out of it.  Therefore, he is afraid that unless he reports every single alteration in his circumstances, he may go out of his group automatically and make himself liable on conviction to a fine.  I think Deputy Morrissey puts it extremely well when he says this would be a crime of omission rather than commission.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I want to stress again the case of a person whose son would get employment and wages, and if the son did not report that employment the father or <Col N="1946" /> mother could be held guilty under the section.  I think that is definitely the case.  Whatever the Minister says&mdash; and we are all in agreement with him in stopping people drawing benefit wrongly&mdash;I do not think the section should be left stand as it is.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMacBride" hpid="Mr. MacBride Mr. MacBride">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacBride</NameTxt>
      <P>I think the Minister might have the section looked at by the Attorney-General and his advisers because it does seem that the section introduces a completely new principle of criminal responsibility.  Hitherto, any criminal conviction must depend on the act of the person who is convicted or charged.  It cannot depend on the act of a third party or, as in this case, on the act of a fourth party, because the section, as framed, makes it an offence for a person who is recorded by a health authority.  If the Minister will bear with me&mdash;it is not the fact that the person has improperly procured a benefit by improperly securing his registration, but the offence occurs, apparently, if somebody in the county council office enters the name of a person in his book as a person who is entitled to treatment.  By that very act&mdash;by an entry made in a book in some county council office&mdash;a person suddenly finds himself guilty of a criminal offence although that person may have done nothing to contribute to it.  I am sure that is not the intention of the Minister.  But if a new offence is being created by statute, I think we should be extremely careful not to introduce some new concept of criminal responsibility, because if one does, then, not only may it lead to an injustice, but it gradually brings the whole criminal law into a certain amount of disrepute.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are quite a number of difficulties in cases such as this because the words &ldquo;family income&rdquo; are introduced and bring a number of different factors into play.  It is not clear from the section whether it is only the head of the family who is liable to punishment, or whether each member of the family who is also recorded would be guilty.  We know a good deal of difficulty has arisen&mdash;I think in Dublin particularly&mdash;in regard to differential rents and the assessment of income for the purpose of payment of differential <Col N="1947" /> rents in this way: the family income is assessed for the purpose of assessing the rent, and in many cases some of the younger members of the family have not fully disclosed to their own parents their full wage.  They may have got a slight increase of 5/- a week, or something like that, and have failed to mention it at home and kept it as additional pocket money.  In a number of cases, where these increases were traced by the corporation, it led to a considerable amount of difficulty. It led to difficulty not only in the family relations when the parents discovered that their eldest daughter or their eldest son was in fact receiving 5/- more in pocket money than they thought, but it created a difficulty for the tenant concerned.  I can visualise other difficulties arising in this case and the Minister would do well to reconsider the section and to ascertain the views of the Attorney-General as to whether it would be advisable to create a new type of offence of this nature which can occur without the person charged having done anything at all to make himself liable to a penalty.</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. A. Byrne Mr. A. Byrne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. A. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think this clause should stand as it is, because it is one that will cause more dissension in families than any other section of the Bill.  We in the corporation have had some experience of matters of this kind where forms were filled in by people who were looking for houses under the differential rents scheme.  It is quite possible that a son or daughter will not tell parents that he or she is getting £7 a week.  He or she may say that the weekly wage is only £6. If you are going to have these inquiries and to institute this detective system, I say that this is the worst form of a means test ever proposed in this House.  It is quite conceivable that a member of a family may fill a form in order to get benefits to which he thinks he is entitled.  In that form he will give the details of the family income.  Some time after the form has been filled, some member of the family, as a result of trade union activities, may get an increase in wages, say of 12/6 per week, <Col N="1948" /> to meet the increased cost of living. Is that to be taken into account as an increase in the means of the family sufficient to deprive them of any benefits under this section?  I should like to inform the Minister that a similar regulation is in operation in Dublin and many other places in connection with the differential rent system and it has led to a good deal of family dissension.  I put it to the Minister that any statement made by the head of a family when filling up these forms which he believes to be generally true should not be used as a basis for preferring a charge against the person who made it on which he is liable to be fined £20.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. L.J. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>Some Deputies have approached the discussion on this amendment as if there were not at present services in operation in which a similar means test, as is envisaged here, applies.  I know that in many services administered at present similar protection is provided for public authorities.  In my opinion, we must have some deterrent in matters of this kind, where the expenditure of public money is in question.  We shall have to provide out of the rates our proportion of the expenditure on these services.</P>
      <P>I know that the method adopted, in my district at all events, in the case of existing services, is that discreet inquiries are made with regard to an applicant's circumstances.  These inquiries are treated confidentially.  I see no reason why the services contemplated in this portion of the Bill cannot be administered in a similar fashion&mdash;in a manner which is very well known to every member of a public authority.  It is an everyday occurrence.  You have it in the case of the old age pensions administration. Only this morning we had to refuse pensions to people who had incomes far in excess of that under which pensions are permitted.  You will have the same difficulties here when it comes to administering these services.  I think that Deputies on the opposite benches are more anxious to run up against difficulties than to try to avoid them.</P>

      <P>If the Deputy intended to refer to it, he certainly did not do so.  He talked about what we are doing already but we are not doing anything already like what is put forward in sub-section (2) of this section. It is not done in relation to old age pensions.  This sub-section and the amendment are directed to what may happen during the time a person is in receipt of treatment.  I do not object at all to what Deputy Walsh has said with regard to persons who are looking for benefit, but what we are dealing with here is a change in the circumstances of a person or of a household during the time that that person or that member of a household is in receipt of treatment.  Do not forget that that change in the family circumsances may take place when he is 50 or 100 miles away in hospital and knows nothing about it.  Although he may not even be told about it, he is still held responsible for it and is brought into court.  If he is brought into court on a charge of obtaining money or services by false pretences, then it does not matter whether he is fined 1/-, £1 or £50.  He does not mind the monetary penalty so much; it is the disgrace of being brought into court and exposed in the local papers that is the real penalty.  There is the danger that a man may be charged with an offence of which he was not alone entirely innocent but of which he was entirely ignorant.</P>

      <P>Surely Deputy Morrissey is aware of cases where people have been prosecuted for claiming old age pensions and where a refund of the money obtained under false pretences had to be made?  Claims have been made, even against the estate of deceased persons who had drawn old age pensions to which they were not entitled, and the heirs to the estate had to refund money, in some cases to my knowledge, a couple of hundred pounds.  There is no use in saying that these regulations do not <Col N="1950" /> refer to old age pensions.  They do and to any other scheme where a person makes a false declaration.</P>

      <P>What I should like to know is whether a decision as to the means will be made in the same way as under the differential rent system. In Cork City, for instance, in dealing with differential rents, it is only the first £2 of a dependent's earnings that is taken into account and there is an allowance of 5/- on the first £2.  There is a sum of 10/- allowed off the main wage earner's earnings, before you start to divide.  Under this test, will the whole of the dependent's income be taken into account or will it be the same as the differential rent system where only the first £2 of the dependent's earnings, after deducting 5/-, is taken into account?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Kyne</NameTxt>
      <P>In reply to Deputy McGrath and Deputy Walsh, who compared this with the old age pension scheme, may I say to Deputy McGrath, who says that a person can suffer a penalty for claiming wrongfully an old age pension, that I never yet heard of a case of a person being punished for claiming?  There is a penalty for drawing an old age pension but a person cannot be punished for claiming, or, if he can, it is never done.  But this does not even say that. It is not necessary to offend against the section by claiming.  It puts on a person the responsibility of reporting alterations in circumstances of which he may have no knowledge, and, if he does not do so, he is liable to a fine on conviction.  Surely no Deputy is going to support that?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMacBride" hpid="Mr. MacBride Mr. MacBride">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacBride</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Kyne has almost understated the position.  It seems to me there are two steps involved in the section.  I am quite certain the Minister must agree with this criticism.  The first step is where a person is recorded by somebody in the local county council office as being entitled to a certain service and that recording may take place without the <Col N="1951" /> intervention of the person involved. It may have happened some years before and the person involved may not even know that he is recorded, that he is on the register in the county council offices.  That is the first step, and it is a step which occurs not necessarily within the knowledge of the person involved.  When that happens an automatic onus falls on that person to report a change of circumstances, but if that person does not know that he is recorded in the county council offices, how can he possibly think there is any duty cast upon him to report the change of circumstances?</P>
      <P>I am quite certain that the Minister will agree to have that section completely re-examined and recast.  It would be creating a completely new concept of criminal responsibility which it would be dangerous to accept because it means that we would go on accepting it in other Bills.  I appeal to him to indicate that he will have the whole matter examined and the section recast.  Everybody in the House will agree that, where somebody obtains money or service by false pretence, the money is recoverable and that possibly some punishment may be inflicted for making false declarations to obtain it; but I want to emphasise this for Deputy Walsh and Deputy McGrath: that is not what is involved in the section.  The criticism being levelled against the section is that it is creating a new type of offence which may occur, not by reason of any act done by the person who will suffer the penalty, but by reason of some act done by some outsider, either in his own family or in the county council office.</P>

That is the experience.  In any case, as I said already, the courts are very lenient in these cases, but I am prepared to meet Deputy Morrissey's point.  He says that we should be more lenient in cases of omission than commission, and I agree.  I am quite willing to put words into the section to provide for the case of a man &ldquo;knowingly&rdquo; wanting to defraud the local authority.  I think that would probably cover all the anxieties I see around me, although I think, personally, it is not necessary, because I am quite sure there is no district justice who would convict a man, unless he felt it was knowingly done.</P>

Let them go into hospital and then claim.  Deputies must keep in mind the fact that what we say is: &ldquo;If you claim you are entitled to treatment, take it, but, if you claim wrongly, you will be severely dealt with&rdquo;.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Morrissey</NameTxt>
      <P>I should not care to follow out and to examine what the Minister has just said and what he said earlier about going into hospital first and claiming after.  I should prefer to know where I stood, if possible, beforehand. It is all very fine to point to what has happened and to argue that all this may be very reasonably done. We have all had the experience, so far, that things, generally speaking, are very reasonably done by local authorities and their officials, but that is not what we are dealing with here. It is our duty, as Deputy Kyne said, to make this piece of legislation or any other legislation&mdash;particularly a piece of legislation dealing with health&mdash;as foolproof as possible.  I want to repeat now because apparently the Minister either did not hear me or does not attach the same importance to it as I do, although he probably knows the country at least <Col N="1954" /> as well as I do, that it is not a question of a district justice being lenient. The real stigma, the real penalty on a man, is being charged in the local district court with fraud and the case being reported in the local paper and read by his neighbours.  That is the point, and not the question of whether a district justice is lenient or not, as the Minister, with his own knowledge of rural Ireland, and every Deputy will agree.</P>
      <P>What I want to stress is that this is not on the same basis as the old age pension.  The old age pensioner is responsible for himself, for his own means and for the extent to which his own means affect his right to receive a pension.</P>
      <P>Remember, here you are making the patient responsible, not merely for his own means but for the means of every member of his family and the amount which every member of his family contributes towards the household.  I submit that is quite a different thing.  If we are dealing with just one person responsible for his own sins, either of commission or omission, who, by some deliberate act of his own, is refraining from or refusing to report this change of circumstances that would be different, but what we are dealing with here, as I have pointed out, is the case in which it is possible a person may offend against this section without knowing that he has so offended.</P>

      <P>I think it would be worse because the person at the time of the change in circumstances could be in hospital and a long way from his own home.  He might not even be informed of the change in circumstances that had taken place.  I think Deputy McGrath will agree there is a difference there.  I am not making the case as to 95 per cent. of what would happen. I am trying to cover the odd 5 per cent. or the 1 per cent., and I do not think anyone here would want any person brought into court and charged with fraud or obtaining under false pretences services or moneys to which he was not entitled.</P>

      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>It is worth while now taking a look at the section before we leave it.  It has to be read in conjunction with Section 25.  Deputy Walsh spoke about the discreet inquiries which are usually made about many matters.  The Minister described Section 25 as a &ldquo;simple section&rdquo;.  I think we will have to call it the simple section.  I do not think there was a quorum here when the matter was discussed and I wonder how many Deputies realised that the county manager will be the person who will take such steps as he thinks fit to decide whether persons come within the lower, middle or higher income groups.  At any rate, that has been decided under Section 25.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Under Section 26, a parent, classed by the county manager, say, as coming within the lower income group, happens to pass into the higher income group by reason of some member of his family getting an increase, and if he has received treatment of a particular kind under the Act subsequent to the increase in the wages of his family and does not report it he may be prosecuted for it.  I wonder whether the <Col N="1957" /> discreet inquiries about which Deputy Walsh spoke will be continuous?</P>
    <P>Will the county manager, in addition to making the necessary inquiries to decide the thing originally, in respect of people receiving benefits under this measure continue the discreet inquiries as to how the person's family income is progressing?  Will complete responsibility be left on the head of the house or on the person who receives particular treatment?  According to Section 14, not only is the head of the house entitled to receive particular treatment but also the members of his family.  Who is responsible for making the declaration in regard to the income? Is it the head of the house?</P>
    <P>If a particular member of a man's family receives treatment under this Act and the income of the family rises on account of an increase in the income of that particular person or some member of the family other than the head of the house, is it the head of the house who will be prosecuted in this matter or is it the person who is receiving institutional treatment?</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Under Section 25 it will be noticed that where a person is entitled to any service the health authority may require that person to make a declaration in such form as is appropriate.  I would imagine that if the person making the declaration is the wife or the son of the head of the house such person would be prosecuted. I think there is a provision further on in the Bill in connection with a person who happens to be in collusion with the head of the family. In that case I presume he also might be prosecuted.  The person who contravenes in regard to the making of the declaration is the first person who would be prosecuted in cases of that kind.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have already stated the position in regard to Section 26.  It is fairly obvious.  It deals with the person who receives treatment which he claimed to be due according to his means, and while in receipt of that treatment his means improved to such an extent that he would be outside the middle income group if reassessed.  If he knows that is the case and does not disclose the <Col N="1958" /> fact to the local authority, then he is guilty of an offence under Section 26. Even though the amendment proposed by Deputy Kyne was rejected by the Dáil, I would still be inclined to amend that section so as to make it clear that a person could not be prosecuted unless he knowingly committed an offence under the section, or words to that effect.</P>

      <P>Section 14, sub-section (2), provides for certain persons who with their dependents are entitled to certain institutional and specialist treatment.  Section 26 says that where a person is recorded for the purposes of this section by a health authority as entitled on account of specified circumstances to a service provided by the health authority under this part of this Act, he shall notify the health authority of any change in those circumstances which renders him no longer entitled to the service.</P>
      <P>Take the case of sub-section (2) of Section 14.  Let us say that a man, his wife and three or four children come in on that section and that one of the children is receiving treatment under the specified circumstances that he is a dependent of a person entitled to the benefits provided under Section 14.  Is it the member of the family who is receiving treatment who is required to notify the health authority of any change in the circumstances? Is it that person who is responsible for saying that his brother has got an increase, and is he the person who will be liable to prosecution and a fine of £20?  What was the original intention in regard to the section as drafted?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Morrissey</NameTxt>
      <P>I think the Minister will agree that Section 25 indicates fairly clearly that the person who must furnish the information is the patient, whether that is the father, mother, son or daughter.  In that case, if there is to be a prosecution, is it to be <Col N="1959" /> against the son or daughter or against the head of the household?</P>
      <P>This service, if put into operation, will be an expensive one.  We must all admit that the county manager will have to keep a very sharp eye on the expenditure.  If not, it might become an immense burden.  Therefore, I presume he will lay down a level of income above which a person will have to contribute whatever sum is determined by the local health authority&mdash;in other words, by the county manager.  Let us assume that he fixes the sum at £6 per week.</P>
      <P>Where the household income exceeds that, then that person will become responsible for a contribution towards the cost of his treatment.  If it is £6, and if the circumstances of that family change by as much as 10/- during the course of the treatment of that person, whether it is the father, mother, son or daughter, then the family automatically goes into a different category, a category that is responsible for a contribution towards the cost of the treatment.  The county manager will then be bound to try and recover that contribution, whatever it is, and he is bound also under this section to prosecute. I think there can be no doubt about that.  Deputies, I am sure, can see where that could lead to.  I take it that the Minister will look into sub-section (2).</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Certain cases may arise from time to time where there may be a dispute between two local authorities as to which local authority is responsible for &ldquo;a particular person or persons of a particular class.&rdquo;  I suppose the only way to deal with that is to have someone who is neutral to make <Col N="1960" /> the determination, and, for convenience, we are putting into the section that the Minister shall decide.  A very simple example would be that of a man coming from, say, the County Kildare to Dublin for the day.  He gets sick in Dublin and is brought to hospital. Afterwards, the Dublin authority gets the bill and they say: &ldquo;Well, properly speaking, Kildare should pay this.&rdquo;  Cases of that kind will arise from time to time.  Therefore, when they do arise it seems better to have someone to decide between them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DanielMorrissey" hpid="Mr. Morrissey Mr. Morrissey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Morrissey</NameTxt>
      <P>I can see the reason for making that provision in respect of a person, but what is the necessity for making it in respect of &ldquo;a particular class&rdquo; of persons.  Perhaps, the Minister would explain the necessity for that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I shall give this as an example of what I have in mind. Again, take the nearest part of the County Kildare to Dublin.  Suppose there is a fair number of children going to school in Dublin from that part of Kildare, and suppose a school medical examination or other treatment arises for that &ldquo;particular class&rdquo; of persons, there is then the question as to who should pay.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I think it is fairly self-explanatory. Where a service is availed of by a person and it is afterwards ascertained that he was not really entitled to it according to his means, then he will be charged.  As I have already explained, the idea that we had in drafting this Bill was: &ldquo;Do not stop a person; let him come along; the fact that he claims the service is, in itself, a declaration that <Col N="1961" /> his means are so and so.&rdquo;  If we find afterwards that he was wrong in that, the local authority will say: &ldquo;Your application in this case is rejected, and, therefore, you must pay.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DanielMorrissey" hpid="Mr. Morrissey Mr. Morrissey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Morrissey</NameTxt>
      <P>But why must the charge that he is to pay be determined by the Minister?  Why must it be sent up to get approval?  Cases of the kind mentioned by the Minister could happen in the early days of the operation of this measure before the people become conversant with its provisions. We find it hard enough to understand it.  It is a very difficult and technical Bill.  There could be hundreds and hundreds of cases of that sort over the whole of the State.  What I am anxious to know is: why the charges in these cases should be fixed or have to be approved by the Minister.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AnthonyCEsmonde" hpid="Dr. Esmonde Dr. Esmonde">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Esmonde</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not quite understand what this section means.  It refers to a person who has availed himself of a service provided under this part of the Act and it is afterwards ascertained that he was not entitled to the service.  It then says that the health authority may charge for the service the charge approved of or directed by the Minister.  I think that is a matter that is already well covered in the Bill.  The Minister has numerous safeguards already for making charges, in practically every section.</P>
      <P>I presume that this relates to finance, and nothing else.  I find it also in Section 26.  Not only is there the right to charge, but, apparently, power is being taken to prosecute as well.  I think that there must be something more behind this section than what the Minister has stated, because otherwise I think we would not have a special section to deal with a thing which seems to me to have been amply covered already in several other sections.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think so.  This is not amply covered elsewhere but there is nothing sinister in the section. It covers the case of a man whose circumstances there is no time to investigate before he goes into hospital. He tells his own doctor that he is entitled to middle income group <Col N="1962" /> treatment.  The doctor accepts that and sends him to hospital.  In the course of the treatment investigations are made and it is discovered that he is not entitled to it; perhaps his valuation is £85 instead of £50.  Therefore, he is told: &ldquo;You must pay&rdquo;.  If you look at Section 24 (1) the idea will be clear.  This person would be a paying patient and this section deals with institutional services for paying patients.  The same words are used towards the end of the sub-section: &ldquo;...they shall charge for any institutional services so made available the charges approved of or directed by the Minister.&rdquo;  I suppose we could have put in there, if you like, the words: &ldquo;In pursuance of Section 24 (1)&rdquo;.  It would be the same thing.  That is precisely the point raised by Deputy Morrissey: Why was that not put in? Regulations might be put in to deal with a case which might arise immediately after the Act is passed and, once regulations are made, they will follow Section 24 (1).</P>

      <P>It is provided here: &ldquo;A health authority... shall charge for any institutional services so made available the charges approved of or directed by the Minister&rdquo;.  That is already laid down in all these amendments and sections.  What we have been discussing here for the last few days is already specifically laid down in this.  Why must we have a sub-section referring it back to the Minister?  I am not suggesting this is a sinister section but we have an inquiring mind and we would like to know.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am in full agreement with the Deputy except for the fact that just after this Act is passed and before regulations actually come in there might be a patient who should have been charged and that may have to be dealt with by a special Order. <Col N="1963" /> However, once the regulations are issued no such Order will be necessary.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RichardJamesMulcahy" hpid="General Mulcahy General Mulcahy">
      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister rather suggests that this is a transitory provision but surely it is in keeping with the generally loose way in which Sections 25 and 26 have been determined. The Minister's suggestion a short time ago that his idea was: treatment first and decide afterwards, whether a person was entitled to treatment or not, without any difficulty about it, is a frank putting into the Bill as a permanent part of the Bill, the Minister's idea that a manager can say: &ldquo;We will treat him and find out afterwards whether he is entitled to it or not&rdquo;.  It is also an absolutely necessary corollary to the weakness and the absurdity of the machinery that is being established in the Bill for deciding whether the person is entitled to treatment or not.  You have a Bill where the county manager is the sole authority for deciding whether a person is entitled to services under this, that, or the other particular class. The inevitable corollary to that weak, absurd and limited machinery is the attitude: &ldquo;For goodness sake send on the patient to receive treatment and we will figure it out afterwards&rdquo;.</P>

      <P>That is not the point.  It is easy to say that.  If he had some idea as to what he was going to be charged, it might help to keep him alive.  The Deputy is right.  I do not suggest that it should be otherwise. All I am saying is that if it is to be determined whether this person is a person who comes within the provisions of Section 14 or not, that that should be determined better locally than it can in the Custom House.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Morrissey</NameTxt>
      <P>It can be determined by the local people who know the circumstances. Why should the charge be a charge to be imposed on him as directed by the Minister?  The Deputy will agree with me&mdash;at least he ought to&mdash;if I were going to hospital tomorrow morning I would feel much happier if I knew the charge which would be imposed on me would be fixed by the officers of the local authority who knew my circumstances rather than by somebody sitting in the Minister's office who had not the foggiest idea of what my circumstances were.  That is the whole point I make. There is no question whatever of depriving the person of treatment until it is determined what he is to pay.  The question is, who is going to determine that?  This could turn on a very fine point&mdash;the Minister will agree with me because we had this out on Section 14&mdash;whether the person coming into this limited class we are now talking about did or did not come within <Col N="1965" /> Section 14.  That can only be determined by the local authority who are more conversant and can make themselves more conversant with the patient's circumstances and his capacity to pay than anybody in the central authority.</P>

If the regulations are not there, then it is to be determined by the central authority, in the absence of regulations and it can only be determined by the central authority, if they are going to advert at all to the circumstances, on a report furnished by the local authority as to the man's circumstances.  I must confess that I can see no good reason for this section unless there is some reason for the section that we have not yet got.  I do not believe there is.</P>

      <P>The section reads:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;... the health authority may charge for the service the charge approved of or directed by the Minister.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am not very good at wording things. <Col N="1968" /> I have not a legal mind, but could it be amended so as to read that the health authority may charge for the service the charge that it is entitled to charge with the approval of the Minster? That would leave the decision to the health authority to fix the charge and, as Deputy Morrissey has so clearly stated here, the health authority is the body that knows what the charge should be, what the circumstances are, and so forth, and the onus is on them then to fix the charge and the Minister may still keep in the background by approving that charge. As the section is worded, the state of affairs would be that it is the Minister who would fix a charge and not the local authority.  As Deputy Morrissey stated, we are not very keen on giving the county managers or the health authority, whoever they are, any more authority than they have already but, in this particular instance, they would be better able to decide than the Custom House or the Minister.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Morrissey</NameTxt>
      <P>May I make this further small point to the Minister? It may be small but I think it is important. The Minister said a moment ago that he did not want to see the fellow getting away with it but under this section it is quite possible for a person innocently to claim that he is entitled to this service.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Morrissey</NameTxt>
      <P>In that case, surely the local authority, with their local knowledge of the person, is in a better position to determine whether he did so deliberately or whether he did it through innocence or lack of knowledge of his real rights under this section.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>The local authority has the option, as the Deputy knows, of making a partial charge if they thought he was not able to pay the full charge of £2 2s. or, if he is able to pay the full charge, then he will come under Section 24 and under the paying patient regulations.</P>

      <P>May I submit to the Minister, with respect, that I do not think he is right there?  In so far as this section is concerned, as I read it, if a person claims a service to which he is not entitled, he claims it either knowing well beforehand that he is not entitled to it and he gets away with it, or he claims in the belief that he is entitled, because some of his neighbours have told him that under the new Health Bill he is entitled to a particular service.  The section is very simple.  I agree with the Minister, it speaks for itself.  It says:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Where</P>
      <P>(a) a person has availed himself of a service provided under this Part of this Act, and</P>
      <P>(b)  it is ascertained that he was not entitled to the service, the health authority may charge for the service the charge approved of or directed by the Minister.&rdquo;</P>

      <P>Deputy McGrath fully appreciates how necessary this section may be in certain circumstances to get a person treated while he is alive and he is rather concerned as to the trouble that may be caused to certain people by the delay in making this section part of the law of the land.  In view of the various types of criticism that we have made against the measure in different <Col N="1970" /> places, about the difficulty of its general administration, I would like to suggest that there is one matter that in the meantime the Deputy might look into&mdash;whether there are not people whose lives are being endangered at the present moment by being refused or delayed proper treatment in suitable institutions by reason of the fact that the local administration insists on their being brought to the local institution first before permission is given to have them brought to the institution that their particular medical officers recommend as being the proper institution for treating them.</P>
    </Speaker>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Esmonde</NameTxt>
      <P>I take it from what the Minister said just now that if a person claims treatment to which he is not entitled, it would be the intention, more or less, under the section, that the Minister would be empowered to deny him any support whatever or any subvention that is due to him, that if a person claims a treatment and it subsequently transpires that he was not entitled to that treatment but he has claimed it inadvertently, that it is the intention to give him the benefit of any subvention that may be due to him?</P>

    <Speaker pid="AnthonyCEsmonde" hpid="Dr. Esmonde Dr. Esmonde">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Esmonde</NameTxt>
      <P>I put it this way. Supposing a person claims or believes that he is entitled to treatment when he belongs, for instance, to the middle income group and subsequently it transpires that he is not in that group but is above it; if he is in the middle income group, as I am supposing for the sake of argument, he would be due the subvention of £3 10s. a week for institutional treatment; but if it transspires that he is not in that particular group would he be in a position to rectify this by paying £1 or £2 as the case may be?  Would that entitle him then to the subvention?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">

    <Speaker pid="AnthonyCEsmonde" hpid="Dr. Esmonde Dr. Esmonde">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Esmonde</NameTxt>
      <P>I am only citing that as an instance.  The case I really want to make is this&mdash;perhaps I have not made myself very clear&mdash;that if a person has treatment and believes himself entitled to that treatment but is not and has inadvertently made that claim, it then seems that under this section the Minister has power to decide what he is going to be charged. Will he then be entitled to claim the subvention or will he be entirely penalised and get nothing whatsoever and be charged the full amount?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Such persons would not be entitled to any subvention, because this is an ordinary surgical or medical case, not a maternity case that we are dealing with.  The subvention in the ordinary medical or surgical case is only payable to people in the lower income or middle income group.  We are dealing here presumably with people above the middle income group. They are not entitled to any help at all.  There are various ways in which a person can be dealt with by the local authority.  Supposing a person goes in, let us say, believing he is entitled to free treatment, and then on investigation it is found that he is not in the middle income group.</P>
      <P>They can deal with that case under 14 (2) (d).  In other words, say there is a case of hardship; they can say: &ldquo;Well, we will give you this treatment and charge you a certain amount.&rdquo; The amount can be anything agreed on in that case.  It may be more or less than two guineas.  Or say this, in a case of hardship this man will not be on a fully paying basis and will fall within the terms of Section 24. Section 24 lays down the circumstances under which paying patients will pay.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DanielMorrissey" hpid="Mr. Morrissey Mr. Morrissey">

    <Speaker pid="DanielMorrissey" hpid="Mr. Morrissey Mr. Morrissey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Morrissey</NameTxt>
      <P>Well, if it goes wider it is even worse.  I was taking it that this section was designed deliberately <Col N="1972" /> to deal with persons coming under clause (d) of Section 2 of Section 14.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DanielMorrissey" hpid="Mr. Morrissey Mr. Morrissey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Morrissey</NameTxt>
      <P>I gather from what the Minister said on the early section referred to, the type of person who did not come in under clause (d) of sub-section (2) of Section 14, that the reason he wanted for having power to approve the charge was that the Minister for Finance wanted to know what he was letting himself in for.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="DanielMorrissey" hpid="Mr. Morrissey Mr. Morrissey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Morrissey</NameTxt>
      <P>And that is one of the reasons why I do not want the charge imposed to be on the direction or the suggestion of the Minister for Finance through the Minister for Health, and through the Minister for Health down to the county manager. If it is to be determined in respect of a citizen of the City of Cork or County Tipperary I want it to be determined by the local officers who know the circumstances.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>What Deputy Morrissey said was an objection to one part of this.  Under a particular part of an earlier section, that is Section 24, it is said that when institutional services are being provided for paying patients the charges may be such as the Minister may approve or direct, and that phrase comes in here.  But does it not go wider than this?  Supposing a person applying under sub-paragraph (a) of 28 is entitled to middle income group treatment, would not the phrase &ldquo;charge for the service&rdquo; include the 6/- a day business?  If that is so I take it that all these sections from 25 down are joined together.  The last phrase may appear, and Deputy Morrissey may be right in that, as being limited to the charge approved of or directed by the Minister.  But there is no doubt about it that under the earlier part of the section a person availing himself <Col N="1973" /> of the services provided under this part of the Act who is not entitled to these services&mdash;I mean a person of the middle income group availing himself of the services only provided for people who are in the destitute class, the old time pauper class&mdash;is that man not caught by this section?  I thought he was.  I was taking the sections from 25 to certainly 28 and 29 as being all bound together.</P>
    </Speaker>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>Certainly later than this, as being all part of a code.  From this time on there are certain services being rendered, not only the old rather easy-going or charitable type of performance under the Public Assistance Acts.  We are now putting in categories and sharply discriminating between those entitled to free service and those entitled to a sort of free service in public wards on payment of the 6/- a day business; and one has then to guard against people being in one class maintaining that they are entitled to service.  Section 25 deals with declaration as to means, Section 26 deals with persons moving from one class to another availing themselves of the services provided to one class, having been in that class and moved from it by a change of circumstances &mdash; he then may be entitled to a subvention and then you determine how the Minister is to decide on certain classes of people to whom certain services may be rendered.</P>
      <P>Is it not right that Sections 25, 26 and 28 are part of the same precautionary measures against people availing themselves of services as being one type of person when, in fact, they belong to another.  If I am wrong in that, of course, the argument falls to the ground.  Deputy Morrissey has just raised this point in my mind that the phrase about the charge being approved of or regulated by the Minister may tie the whole thing to Section 24.  Is that an indication?</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I explained this rather fully before the Deputy came in.  My instructions in drafting this Bill were to make sure that a person who seeks hospital accommodation would get it <Col N="1974" /> and that his means would be investigated afterwards.  Getting from that, under Sections 25 and 26, 28, 29 and 31 we are dealing with the various things that might arise with regard to getting the information necessary regarding the making of charges on patients who have claimed treatment and are not entitled to it.  The next section goes on to say that even if the person has left hospital you can recover the charges.  Then Section 31 winds up with penalties for making false declarations.  They all deal with the same argument&mdash;Sections 25, 26, 29 and 31.</P>

      <P>The purport and the full effect of this section ought to be understood.  The charge that is imposed by a health authority is recoverable.  It is recoverable by a court process, as a simple contract debt in any court of competent jurisdiction, from the person in respect of whom the charge is made or, if that person is dead, it may be followed beyond the grave through his legal personal representative.  This may go further under (b), in that if they be parents and the charge is made in respect of a child it can be taken from them; or if they are dead from their personal representatives.  If there is an illegitimate child, it can be recovered from the mother and if the mother is dead from her personal representatives.  It is very efficient and quite ruthless, but I think you must do that when you get into this region.</P>

      <P>Deputy McGilligan was able to bring out these points because they are legal questions. In my capacity as a member of a local authority or as a member of this House, I have seen examples where such legislation was availed of by a local authority and it was extremely ruthless in practice.  There is no other person who is in a position under law to recover debts to such an extent.  I think I am right in saying that the ordinary person over 20 years of age is responsible for his own commitments and that a relative cannot be held responsible for whatever debts that person does not pay.  Does the Minister think the local authority should have such wide powers?  In the case I speak of, a man died in hospital and the hospital authorities were in a position to &ldquo;corner&rdquo; certain benefits which the man had to his name in national health insurance.  The relatives of the patient were unable to draw the money which stood in that man's name in the national health <Col N="1977" /> insurance, yet the local authority had the right to take that money.</P>
      <P>I see such a section in this Bill and I wonder if it is really correct that we should allow the local authority to follow a man's relatives and family to such an extent for debts which he has not paid off.  These relatives, who are to be asked to pay off these people, will have families of their own to look after and their own expenses to meet. Why should they be held responsible for the debts of another man?  I can understand it in the case of a child or of parents, but I fail to see why the local authority should have power to follow a man's representatives all over the country for payments like this.</P>

      <P>Is not the answer to that, that once you get to the point of giving the benefits on a legal basis, the legal basis being the determination of income, the State, which is paying on that basis, ought to be able to protect itself?  It may be hard to follow people beyond the grave, but I <Col N="1978" /> suppose the situation is that the parents have got some benefit through the child having got benefit to which the child was not entitled, even though the child be an adult&mdash;and similarly in the case of parents.  It may seem harsh, but when we are no longer on the easy-going, charitable disposition of money to a certain class who cannot afford these services and when we are giving the benefits to other people, but limited, as they should be limited&mdash;it is only supplemental aid instead of full aid&mdash;you must give these powers to the State to obtain that recovery where there is fraud.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. ffrench-O'Carroll</NameTxt>
      <P>I submit that the position may be entirely different. A man may be a patient in a local authority hospital and in the middle income group and his earnings may be such that he is asked to pay £2 2s. a week.  When that man dies, his family may be destitute.  Here the local authority comes in and, having made their assessment on the basis of what his income was when he was alive, they have the right to take his assets, before his wife and children.</P>

      <P>Do I take it that if a child dies&mdash;but had reached the legal age and was over 21&mdash;and the parents had no assets whatever, even so the local authority or the Minister has the right to follow the parents for those assets, to pay for the debts that have accrued for the treatment of the deceased child?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think that could be right.  It must be fairly obvious that this can only apply to people above the middle income group, as there will be no debts due for those belonging to the lower income group or the middle income group.  Therefore, they must be in the paying patient class.  That presupposes a certain income or certain means.  Let us say that the father was a wealthy man and that he died.  His income was there but it would be from his estate that the recovery would be from his estate that the recovery would be made&mdash;not from the son of 21, who had nothing.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 50:&mdash;</P>
      <P>In sub-section (1), page 9, line 38, to delete &ldquo;may&rdquo; and substitute &ldquo;shall&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The title of this section would lead one to believe that its main function is the affording of facilities by schools to the health authority for the examination of children.  That is the <Col N="1980" /> case with regard to sub-sections (1), (2), (3), (4) and (5).</P>
    <P>The purpose of the amendment is so to amend sub-section (1) as to make it obligatory on the health authority to give prior notice to a school manager or to the principal of a school that such an examination is to be held.</P>
    <P>I am beginning to believe that I do not know the difference between &ldquo;may&rdquo; and &ldquo;shall&rdquo; when I read these different Acts of Parliament.  I could say that in respect of many of the earlier sections.</P>
    <P>I think the Minister should accept this amendment so as to provide that the health authority will give this notice to a school manager or to the principal of a school&mdash;that there will be no option and that the obligation will be on the health authority to give this prior notice.</P>
    <P>I cannot imagine that a health authority would walk into a school and carry out an examination of the children or that they would even leave it to two or three days' notice.  The notice provided for in this section is, I think, seven days.  I presume that that would be adequate notice to any school.  I presume it would be an adequate period within which to rearrange the school programme and to provide the facilities that would be required by the doctors, nurses and different officials of the health authority who propose to carry out the examination.</P>
    <P>I submit there ought to be an obligation on the health authority to give seven days' notice before carrying out a medical inspection.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>I can see Deputy Corish's point of view and would agree with it with regard to part of this section but I should like to divide the different purposes of the sub-section. As it runs, the sub-section reads at the moment:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;A health authority intending to arrange for a health examination of children at a school, under this Act, may give to the school manager of the school notice in writing of such intention stating the day or days (not being earlier than seven days <Col N="1981" /> after the giving of the notice) on which and the time at which the examination will be held and requiring the school manager to afford all reasonable facilities for the examination.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>If &ldquo;shall&rdquo; is substituted for &ldquo;may&rdquo; then it is made an obligation on the health authority to give notice and to require the school manager to afford facilities.</P>
    <P>I agree with Deputy Corish that if such examination is to be held, notice should be given.  It should be obligatory to give the notice but I do not want to bind the health authority that they shall give the notice and that they shall require the management to arrange the facilities.</P>
    <P>If the health authority decide to have an examination, I agree with Deputy Corish that they should be obliged to give a notice&mdash;not &ldquo;may&rdquo;. As I read &ldquo;may&rdquo;, it would apply to both parts of the sub-section.  It would mean that they might give the notice and might require the school manager to afford the facilities.  I do not think that is intended.</P>
    <P>The Minister may tell me that, according to the parliamentary draftsman, &ldquo;may&rdquo; often means &ldquo;shall&rdquo;. Then you leave it to the courts to decide when it does mean &ldquo;shall&rdquo; and when it is not obligatory but is permissive.  But if he says it means &ldquo;shall&rdquo; then the health authority must give notice and require the school manager to provide the facilities.  I should rather leave it open.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>&ldquo;May&rdquo; means &ldquo;may&rdquo; here.  The position is that in most cases there is no trouble whatever. The school medical inspector, the teacher, the manager, and so on, get on well together.  The medical inspector drops a notice that he will be around on such a day.  Maybe he gives it to the teacher and the teacher gives it to the manager.  However, you may have difficulty in certain cases.  This is to cover a possible difficult case.  If there is a case where there is trouble about a manager <Col N="1982" /> granting a school, then this section would come into operation.  The local authority may avail of this section if they like.  If they do, they serve notice and it amounts to &ldquo;shall&rdquo;.  When it is served, the manager shall provide facilities and, if he does not, there is a penalty.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Esmonde</NameTxt>
      <P>Then you come down to sub-section (4) of this particular section, which reads:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;The school manager of a school to which a notice given under sub-section (1) of this section relates shall cause all reasonable facilities to be given for the holding of a health examination in accordance with the notice and on the day or days and at the time mentioned therein and, if he fails to do so, he shall be guilty of an offence under this section and shall be liable on summary conviction thereof to a fine not exceeding ten pounds.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>I take it from that, that the school manager has to permit the examination.</P>
      <P>Surely if the school manager does not permit an examination he is liable to a fine of £10.  There are to be no half measures with the school manager.  There is no question of &ldquo;may&rdquo; or &ldquo;shall.&rdquo;  He has to do it and, in fairness to him, he is entitled to have it obligatory that he should get seven days' notice.  As I read the section, the school inspector need not give him that notice.  I think it is only fair to the manager that he should get that notice.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I will explain again.  In most cases it is done in a friendly casual way, if you like.  The school examiner drops a note to the manager that he will be round on such a day and he knows there will be no trouble if he makes the examination.  He may, however, come up against a crotchety manager.  In that case the authority may adopt this section but, if they adopt it, then they must give seven days' notice.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">

      <P>First of all, the local authority will provide the facilities and the examiner comes along.

      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>That leads me to the position we were discussing before. The Minister's approach to the matter is that there is not only an obligation on the local authority to provide all the machinery for the examination of school children in national schools and in schools providing elementary education, but that there is a statutory compulsion on them to put the examination into force, subject only to the right of a parent to withdraw his child from examination.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichardJamesMulcahy" hpid="General Mulcahy General Mulcahy">
      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>That leads me to the question we were discussing before. <Col N="1986" /> The Minister did circulate amendments which would bring vocational and secondary schools under this compulsory scheme, but he substituted an amendment which confined it to national schools and schools which provide elementary education.</P>
      <P>When dealing with amendment No. 30 to Section 18, I raised the question as to what is elementary education and how schools can be defined in relation to the amendment put in amendment No. 30.  I drew attention to the fact that under the amendment that was passed already there is brought in under the compulsory effects of the Bill small private schools where eight, ten, 12 or 14 children are getting juvenile education.  I also drew attention to the fact that in some of the large secondary schools they have a junior school, whether it be a part of the institution or a subsidiary to the institution, in which education analogous to the education given in the national school is given.  I raised the question as to whether these schools were to be subject to the compulsion of this Bill.  This section would require the manager of a small private school &mdash; there are a certain number of them throughout the country&mdash;where there are from ten to 20 children receiving the most elementary education, to provide facilities in the school for the examination of the children, except the parents object to it.  I should like to ask the Minister if he has considered that matter since we discussed it before.</P>

      <P>I would like to be clear on this sub-section (1) of Section 30.  It says that the health authorities may arrange for examination, and goes on to say the different ways in which it can convey information to the school manager that an examination is to take place, and the fourth sub-section says the manager shall cause all reasonable facilities to be given.  In the event of a dispute, and it is conceivable that the local authority can claim that they have instructed the school manager, and the <Col N="1987" /> school manager may maintain&mdash;which would possibly be true&mdash;that he had never received any intimation to that effect.  Who is then going to decide the issue?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>The court decides, but in regard to the provision in sub-section (3), I think Deputy Dr. Esmonde is making a point which has occurred in quite a number of circumstances. It occurs in the ordinary law of contract where two people are going to enter into a certain type of relations.</P>
      <P>Indeed, in certain parts of the law of contract, it is laid down that if you put a letter into the post, it is accepted that it was delivered in the ordinary course of post.  That is the case with people making contractual relations, but a man may say: &ldquo;I will not have this contract unless you notify it in a certain way.&rdquo;  The legislative body here is making this arrangement and the Minister would say, possibly, with certain limitations, there must be notice given to a school manager or maybe to the principal teacher before an offence can be committed. Sub-section (1) comes down to sub-section (2), in which the notice is deemed to be given if it is sent by post.  It is taken to mean it has arrived, if it is put into the post-box. It may never get there but it is deemed to be delivered.  If proof can be given to show that the letter was posted it is deemed to have arrived at a certain time although a man may say he never got it, and the court is bound to accept that if it is posted it arrives in a certain limited period of hours after that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I know the difficulties and I know that this phrase is used at many points in regard to ordinary civil law, contracts, torts, and so on.  Here, however, we have a criminal law and we are going to have an offence.  Deputy Corish wants the word &ldquo;may&rdquo; to become &ldquo;shall&rdquo;.  I agree that the word should be &ldquo;shall&rdquo;, but is there any need for this penalising part of Section 4 at all?  I know the Minister's answer will be: &ldquo;If you have not a penalty clause, what is the good of <Col N="1988" /> giving powers?&rdquo;  You must be in a position to punish if they are not carried out, but the Minister himself has said it will be a very odd case indeed in which this will arise and more particularly when all that happens under the section is that facilities must be provided. Nobody need avail of them. All the parents may say: &ldquo;We do not want our children examined.&rdquo;  But you go through the farce of saying to the manager: &ldquo;Make these facilities available.&rdquo; Is it considered necessary to have this penalty clause there?  If the penalty clause goes, the difference between &ldquo;may&rdquo; and &ldquo;shall&rdquo; does not matter much.  It is only because there is a penalty I would insist on saying you must give notice.  I take the Minister as having met that point by saying that if you do not get notice there is no penalty.  But what is the necessity for a penalty?  I wonder is it worth having a penalty?</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>If you have a manager who will put obstructions in the way, and say: &ldquo;No.  I will not allow any examination in my school&rdquo;, I do not know what you are going to do about it.  The penalty may have a good effect.  Anyway, the whole law would be brought into a sort of ridiculous position, if you had not some way of following up serving of notice.  I would be rather surprised if it ever came to that point of the penalty being inflicted, but it must be there.  I think the effect of Deputy Corish's amendment is that the local authority would have to serve notice in every particular case.  Is it not better to carry on in the free and easy way they are going at the moment, if this clause only comes in for the very odd or rare case? However, I would be quite prepared to consider Deputy McGilligan's point in regard to a letter being delivered.</P>

      <P>A similar amendment was considered and rejected by the House earlier but it does occur to me&mdash;and perhaps the Minister could throw some light on it &mdash; that there is a possibility that anybody who makes a false declaration with regard to means, is liable to be prosecuted in accordance with the provisions of Section 26 and also of Section 31 and on top of that is liable to be charged for the services which he might have been given by reason of making that declaration.  As Deputy Kyne said on Section 26, the fine seems to be rather stiff.  He did agree that some fine should be imposed but he thought that a fine of £20 was rather too heavy.  Similarly, in regard to Section 31, a fine not exceeding £50 seems to be pretty heavy and on top of that discretion is given to the court to imprison an offender for a term not exceeding three months.  I would be glad if the Minister could give some information with regard to my submission as to the duplication of the penalty under Section 26 and Section 31.  It seems to me that a person who committed an offence under Section 26 could also be held to have committed an offence under Section 31 and <i>vice versa.</i></P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I imagine that is possible but I could not say definitely.  It <Col N="1991" /> appears to be more a legal question. It is possible that he might be charged under Section 26 or Section 31 but I do not think he would be charged under one and the other.  He could also suffer penalties under Section 28 and 29 at the same time by being compelled to pay what was due to the hospital.  These are the usual penalties for that kind of offence.  Under the Social Welfare Acts, there is the very same penalty of £50 or three months in jail for making a false declaration. That was taken from the Old Age Pensions Act which goes back to 1908. I think the penalties were the same all the time.  As Deputies know they are very seldom inflicted, under the social welfare code.  I suppose they will be very seldom inflicted under the health code either.  I think the penalties are not too heavy.  If we are to provide services of this kind for certain classes of people, I think that anybody who deliberately and knowingly tries to claim a service that is not due to him should be severely dealt with.</P>

      <P>When we come to consider the question of who may make a false declaration, we are driven back again to Section 25 where a health authority may take any such steps as they think fit to verify a declaration made to them.  We had the picture, whether we were justified in drawing it or not, of the county manager ascertaining from, say, a shopkeeper whether a person making the declaration had any substantial debts with him.  We had also the suggestion that the county manager may inquire of employers to ascertain the wages that members of the declarer's family were receiving and it was suggested that inquiries might be made from bank people and so on.  In Section 31 we read again:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;If any person for any purpose connected with this part of the Act ... knowingly makes any false statement <Col N="1992" /> or false representation or knowingly conceals any material facts&rdquo;, etc.</P>
    <P>It is deemed to be a purpose connected with this part of the Act if a shopkeeper gives information as to the debts that a declarer has in his shop? If a shopkeeper in reply to a query from the county manager gives information of that kind that is incorrect, does he render himself liable to be charged under Section 31 and is he liable to the penalties indicated? If a county manager pursuing inquiries and taking such steps as he thinks fit and such as are contemplated under Section 25, makes an inquiry with an employer as to what he is paying certain members of the declarer's family and if that employer gives information that is incorrect does he come within the term, &ldquo;for the purposes of obtaining any service provided under this part of the Act&rdquo;?</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I take it that any person who makes a false declaration or gives false information would be liable to the penalties laid down.  Of course it would be the court who would inflict the penalties and the court will have to be satisfied that these declarations were actually made and were false.  I should like to remind the Deputy, however, as I did before, that the health authority has no power to compel the shopkeeper or the employer to give information.  They can say that they will not give it.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>That gets us back to the case of the bank manager about whom the Minister was talking before the tea adjournment under Section 26.  I was challenged as to whether the bank manager could be forced to give information.  The Minister, I am sure, knows the procedure. The Revenue Commissioners, if they <Col N="1993" /> want to get at a person with regard to income-tax, ask him to produce his bank account.  He says: &ldquo;Not at all.&rdquo; The Revenue Commissioners take that as a sign of weakness and they double his assessment and in the end the man is forced to produce his accounts.  I am afraid I was distracted by something else when the Minister was speaking just now, and I did not fully appreciate what he said.  He stated that they need not give information. I do not know the circumstances, but the fact of concealing a material fact may arise.  It may be that the person to whom the Minister referred is not obliged to give information.  If the person is not obliged to give information, he should not be charged with knowingly concealing any material fact.</P>
      <P>A person can err by positively making statements that are known to be false, or not believed to be true, but he can also commit an offence by concealing a material fact, and quite properly so&mdash;it is the ordinary law &mdash; if these penalties are to be imposed. With regard to the whole code which travels from Section 25 down to and including Section 31, I do not know whether it is necessary to have all these sections.  I do not know whether each is intended to hit at a different possible offender, but they are all here lumped together, and there is no doubt that what Deputy Corish says is true&mdash;they can all light upon the same individual.  A man could be penalised under Section 26 and subjected to a fine of not more than £20; the Minister could also follow him to get the charges under Section 29; and he could be penalised under Section 31 and subjected to a fine not exceeding £50 or a term of imprisonment not exceeding three months, with the usual addition &ldquo;or both such fine and imprisonment.&rdquo;  So far as I read these together, I do not see any point of difference between the possible offenders under them.  All these sections could light on the same individual. That may be necessary&mdash;I do not know whether it is or not&mdash;but it seems to me to be rather overloading the penalty sections.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Again, however, let us at least face the fact that, once we get away from <Col N="1994" /> giving easy charity, in the best sense of the word, to the people deserving of charity and arrive at the stage at which certain people are entitled to certain services if they are in certain classes, without a doubt you must have unfolded all the armoury of the law as against possible defrauders.</P>
    <P>You have to have both the inspection with regard to means under Section 25 &mdash; though it may be worded peculiarly &mdash; and you must have the penalties, or at least some of them, laid down.  It must be accepted, however, that we have been dealing here the whole evening with the means test, with the fact that we move from the giving of service of a particular kind to people who just cannot afford it themselves to the higher stage of giving something, although I think it is not very good, to certain others by way of payments and have to discriminate between people in the lower, middle and higher classes and so must make provision for hitting people who get benefits to which they are not entitled legally&mdash;there is no longer any moral obligation&mdash;by legal means.</P>
    <P>My only difficulty in this regard is whether Section 31 is necessary when there is Section 26 and the power to recover charges.  If I am told that Section 31 is necessary, I ask, in return, if it is necessary, having Section 31, to have Section 26 and the provision with regard to recovery charges as well.  I do not see the necessity for them all.</P>

    <P>In page 10 to delete all words after <Col N="1996" />&ldquo;seaports&rdquo; in line 29 to the end of the section.</P>
    <P>This amendment, if accepted, would mean that the principal Act arrangements with regard to certain rights enshrined in that Act would be reverted to.  As we see it, this section means that the provision for notification to a person of his rights is safeguarded by Section 31 of the principal Act and, under Section 32 of the same Act, he has a right to refuse.  Under this new section, he loses both the right to be notified of his rights as well as his right to refuse.</P>
    <P>I should like the Minister to give us his reasons for this and, in particular, to indicate how he justifies the inclusion of that section as against Section 4 of this Bill, which states that no compulsion will be used on an individual in relation to this Act.  Surely one is a negation of the other.  We put down this amendment for the purpose of opening up discussion and giving the Minister an opportunity of explaining what was not clear to us, at any rate.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy will understand that whatever we may say in Section 4 with regard to examination or treatment where the person himself is concerned, we should give perfect freedom, but we cannot permit any person to be a danger to everybody else.  We have to bring compulsion in in that connection, and, in the case of all infectious diseases, compulsion is used and there is no way out of it. What we are asking for in this section is that men working around an airport will, if necessary, be compulsorily vaccinated. That is what it amounts to, and I think it would be very bad to oppose that in any way, because if a smallpox case was diagnosed as coming in through the airport, there would immediately be a rush to vaccinate everybody concerned, and if there was any such thing as a hold up, because of a person making an appeal that he did not want to be vaccinated, the whole thing would be useless.  I think we will have to have compulsion in cases like that.</P>

One can appreciate that there might be a smallpox epidemic and that such an epidemic might be connected with Dublin Airport.  One can understand that it might be necessary to vaccinate all the airport workers, but would there also be a similar necessity to vaccinate the bus drivers bringing buses to and from Dublin Airport?  As Deputy Kyne explained, in the Act of 1947, there was an obligation on a local authority to notify certain people of their right to opt out of vaccination.  Section 32 gives them that right to opt out.  The Minister here wants to take power unto himself to make regulations with regard to airport and seaport workers. Does he mean that these regulations will be enforced in the event of an emergency, or does it necessarily mean that, in respect of airport and seaport workers, a condition of employment at these places will be vaccination or immunisation against certain forms of diseases?</P>

If one were to support this case, one could appreciate the necessity for applying these regulations to port workers around such places as Cobh, Dún Laoghaire and Rosslare Harbour, but does it necessarily apply to the dock workers in Wexford, Waterford, Wicklow and Arklow?  As Deputy Kyne has said, this amendment is merely for the purpose of getting information.  We would like to know if the Minister intends to apply these regulations to compulsorily vaccinate during the time of emergency or will it be a condition of employment in these areas?</P>

      <P>Deputy Corish, if I may say so, has gone off at a tangent. I understood that the objection of the proposers of this amendment was to the words contained in the paragraphs lettered (a) and (b).  Supposing we stop short at that, the Minister would then be given power by this addition to the 1947 Act to make regulations and these regulations might require <Col N="1998" /> the vaccination against smallpox of people engaged in work at or around seaports or airports.  With that built into the framework of the 1947 Act, I am in entire agreement.  But in the framework of the 1947 Act this is what would happen: If the Minister did make a regulation providing for vaccination against smallpox, such a regulation must contain a provision for the giving of information to such person &mdash; leave out the parent for a moment&mdash;of his right to exemption under Section 32.</P>
      <P>At the outset that appears to be rather terrifying because it seems to me that a person could claim exemption. But the right to exemption is extremely limited under Section 32. The section is too long to read now but, as I understand it, it means that if a person is required under regulations to submit himself to vaccination and if he, within the prescribed period, sends a statement that he objects to such a vaccination, then he gets off the vaccination unless&mdash;and there is an unless&mdash;the Minister, by Order, declares that it is necessary that such person should be vaccinated.  Why should we not keep that on in connection with this?  Suppose someone comes by air or sea with smallpox; the people engaged at the airport or seaport might become carriers or spreaders.  Now some attempt must be made to stop the disease being carried or spread.  Surely Section 32 with its limited exemption is good enough.  I do not know what the special urgency is.  I do not know that there would be any real delay under Section 32.  The Minister can make these Orders in a flash.  If a person does not say he objects, then he is vaccinated.  If he does object, the Minister can overpower him almost immediately with an Order.  Why then does he want to provide that the obligation to comply with a certain provision shall not apply and Section 32 shall not apply as regards vaccination?</P>

      <P>I think the Deputy has read Sections 31 and 32.  The Deputy knows that the regulations provide that the Minister must give notice to the person concerned.  Regulations also <Col N="1999" /> provide that the person may send back an appeal, or whatever you like to call it, notifying the local authority that he wants to appeal against such vaccination. All that takes time.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>That is true, but it all takes time.  Smallpox has become rather prevalent in England.  While there was only sea communication between the two countries, travel was somewhat slower and an outbreak might be discovered perhaps on the way over, or something like that; but now with air travel the position is much more dangerous.  We might get a smallpox case here.  That case might be here for a few hours before it is discovered.  We want to take instant precautions if we discovered such a case.  I think there should be no delay.  We should be in a position to get everybody here at the airport or the seaport, as the case may be, through which this particular case entered the country vaccinated as quickly as possible so that if staff are infected in any way vaccination will largely nullify any bad effects as far as that staff is concerned and as far as their spreading of the disease is concerned.</P>

      <P>First of all, let me answer the point in relation to the notice.  The notice is not taken away. That is a bad point.  You must give notice, but the regulation must prescribe that a person is given information that he is entitled to exemption. Under Section 32 what is the right to exemption?  It is if the person appeals within the prescribed time.  It is the Minister who prescribes the time.  He can say an hour; unless the person inside an hour sends him the notice he will be vaccinated.</P>

      <P>I am rather inclined to agree with these regulations.  I think they are necessary.  The 1947 Act removed compulsory vaccination. Now we have not had a case of smallpox here in the last 50 years.  Smallpox, however is a comparatively common occurrence in different parts of England.  I have myself seen many cases of it there.  I can visualise a situation arising here in which smallpox could become an acute emergency. <Col N="2001" /> Transport facilities have opened up considerably between this country and Britain and it is quite possible that we might get a case of smallpox.  For that reason I think it is necessary that the Minister should have power.  As far as I understand the position, the 1947 Act, the principal Act as it is called, gives a person the right to protest against vaccination.  In other words, it gives him the right to be precluded from being vaccinated.  I think the Minister is right in seeking these powers should an emergency arise, and smallpox is an emergency.  If we were to get a case of smallpox and if the disease were to spread, there is no knowing where it would end.  We might have a very severe epidemic. Where epidemics are fairly common, the disease is nothing like as virulent as it would be in an area where it is practically unknown.</P>
      <P>Smallpox is very prevalent in the north of England, around Nottingham and Derby and for that reason, the actual disease is nothing like as virulent there as it would be here where it is practically unknown.  If we had an epidemic I am sure the disease would be very virulent.  It would spread very rapidly.  There would be a lot of deaths.  Any cases that would occur would be serious cases.  Since we have abolished compulsory vaccination, I think the only thing we can do is to bring in a regulation such as that proposed here to safeguard the populace against the risk of an epidemic of smallpox.  It would be appalling if we had such an epidemic here.</P>

We accept the general principle.  In connection with the health of the public generally the Minister is in duty bound to take whatever emergency measures are necessary.  Could not the Minister do as suggested by Deputy McGilligan?  The Minister has the power to fix the time limit.  We simply wanted to preserve the rights of the people.</P>

      <P>I think the Minister is trying to prevent any infection coming into the country.  Thank God we have not had any for the past 50 years.  Were the Minister to take extraordinary measures here he would only be protecting the individual against one of the most virulent and disfiguring diseases imaginable.  I appreciate that Deputy Kyne's amendment was put down for the purpose of clarifying the position.  I have disagreed with the Minister so much on this measure that it is only right, when I find myself in complete agreement with him now, to say so.</P>

      <P>The original section has been amended.  Apparently the section is an afterthought.  Since 1947 was there any occasion when there was a suspicion of a case of smallpox?  Is this based on any real fear.  Was there any occasion on which we were threatened with smallpox?</P>
      <P>To swing over to another point, when I was much younger than I am now I remember there was a disease that was talked about, bubonic plague. I understand that disease comes from vermin.  It is a thing that certainly arises in the vicinity of ports.  The Minister is taking precautions against smallpox, but is smallpox the only disease that can spread rapidly?  There may be other diseases which must and should be prevented.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>From what I read about it many years ago, bubonic plague is not a thing which spreads rapidly like smallpox.  If contacts are discovered immediately, there is probably not any terrible danger.  There is no vaccination against it.  All you can do to prevent the spread of bubonic plague is to disinfect.  Since 1947 suspicious contacts arrived in this country.  We were indeed, lucky that the suspicious were unfounded.  On a few occasions at least people arrived here who were suspected contacts.  We were informed by <Col N="2003" /> the people from the other side and we kept the cases under supervision.  It turned out that they had not contracted the disease.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>While Section 32 is particularly directed towards vaccination, Section 31 of the principal Act deals with regulations for preventing the spread of infectious disease and speaks of specified treatment which I think is a wider term than that of vaccination.  I read about bubonic plague when I was young, and certainly it was regarded as a terrifying business at the time.  The Minister says there is no vaccination against it. The section deals with specified measures which would include diseases like bubonic plague.</P>

      <P>Deputies will remember that Section 38 of the Health Act, 1947, enabled the medical officer of health to detain a person who was suffering from an infectious disease or who was a probable source of an infectious disease.  The section is a very long one.  Its effect was to enable a person to be detained.  He could appeal to the Minister and have his case heard within 21 days, following examination by an independent medical man.  That is the gist of the section in the 1947 Health Act.  It was put to me that the man could be there for 21 days anyway on the action of a particular doctor who might be wrong in his diagnosis or might even be prejudiced against the person.  It was put to me that it was <Col N="2004" /> hardly fair to have a person detained for 21 days on the action of one man. This section is to ensure that at least two men would be responsible before a man could be detained in that way.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>Without meaning any disrespect to the category of people defined in this as chief medical officers, I thought the Minister wanted to have a chief medical officer and another general practitioner.  The Minister now, more or less, says that he wants two people.  Section 38 deals with the detention and isolation of a person who is a probable source of infection. It says that where a chief medical officer is of opinion, either consequent on his own inspection of a person in the area for which such medical officer acts or consequent upon information furnished to him by a registered medical practitioner who has inspected such person, that such person is a probable source of infection with an infectious disease, the medical officer may order the person to be detained and isolated.  The Minister now wants to make it that two people must sign the order.  Did the Minister want to get away from the chief medical officer as defined in the Act?  A chief medical officer is defined in the Health Act, 1947, as either the medical officer of a county borough or a county.  If the Minister wants to get an independent practitioner with the chief medical officer, he should at least provide for that.  In other words, could two chief medical officers sign the order?  Is that right?</P>

I thought this section was based upon your taking a chief medical officer and providing for an outside practitioner as well.  That is not provided for.  I do not mean any disrespect to the chief <Col N="2005" /> medical officers.  We will get two doctors and that is good enough.  I think it would be better if the Minister stipulated a chief medical officer and another practitioner who is not a chief medical officer.</P>
