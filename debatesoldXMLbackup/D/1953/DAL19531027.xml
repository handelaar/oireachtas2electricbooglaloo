    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Finance if he will state (1)  how many civil servants will be accommodated in Áras Mhic Dhiarmada, (2)  from what buildings they will be transferred, and (3)  whether such transfer will provide alternative accommodation for the uncomfortable civil servants in Dublin Castle; and, if it will, whether the rebuilding of the Castle could not be postponed until sufficient houses for the people at present living in tenements are erected.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrankAiken" hpid="Mr. Aiken Mr. Aiken">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Aiken</NameTxt>
      <P>(1)  Approximately 850 civil servants will be accommodated in Áras Mhic Dhiarmada.  (2)  They have been or will be transferred from the following premises:&mdash;(i)  Part of Ship Street Barracks, Dublin Castle; (ii) 13-14 Earlsfort Terrace; (iii)  Áras Brugha, Upper O'Connell Street; (iv)  73 Merrion Square; (v)  14-16 Lord Edward Street; (vi)  part of the Custom House premises.  (3)  The reply to this part of the question is in the negative. Part of the accommodation which will be available as a result of the occupation of Áras Mhic Dhiarmada by the Department of Social Welfare will be used to house a certain number of the staffs who at present occupy buildings in Dublin Castle which will have to be demolished in connection with the initial stages of the Castle reconstruction scheme.  The remainder is urgently needed to relieve serious congestion which exists in a number of other Departments.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As was indicated in a reply to a previous parliamentary question, none <Col N="574" /> of the buildings in Dublin Castle can really be described as sound; they are unsuitable as permanent premises for Government Departments and maintenance is increasingly wasteful.  Trial excavations have shown that overflows from the old Poddle culvert have undermined the foundations of the existing buildings in the Lower Castle Yard.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Aiken</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose, with the permission of the Ceann Comhairle, to take Questions Nos. 10 to 12 together.</P>
      <P>The available information covering the matters referred to in the questions is as follows:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Of the total issue of £25,000,000 stock of the 4½ per cent.  National Loan, <Col N="576" /> 1973-78, £16,292,260 was subscribed by the public and £5,000,000 by the Irish banks, the balance being taken up as to £255,500 by the sub-underwriters and as to £3,452,240 by the Minister for Finance on behalf of departmental funds.</P>
    <P>Of the public subscriptions, allotments to addresses in Ireland totalled £14,126,540 and allotments to addresses outside Ireland £2,165,720.</P>
    <P>No information is sought as to the purpose of withdrawals of Savings Bank deposits or encashments of Savings Certificates.  In view of this and of the fact that payment for stock of the recent loan need not be completed until 17th December next, no firm estimate can be given of the amount of &ldquo;small savings&rdquo; diverted to the loan.  On a rough estimate the amount of withdrawals and encashments to date for this purpose is of the order of £500,000.</P>

      <P>The board of the <Col N="577" /> Central Bank, in accordance with Section 61 of the Currency Act, 1927, as amended by Section 63 of the Central Bank Act, 1942, carries out a half-yearly valuation of the assets of the Legal Tender Note Fund at values not exceeding the current market prices on the last day of February and the last day of August in every year. Apart from this provision, I have no information as to the price at which the bank's gold holding was valued in the Statement of Accounts at 31st March, 1953.  According to available published information, the total gold holding of the Bank for the Legal Tender Note Fund and the General Fund at that date was 514,000 fine ozs., its sterling value at the current price of $35 per fine oz. being £6.4 million.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>What I am concerned about is the getting of an explanatory memoranda for the information of this House and the public when regulations are made as to what exactly those regulations are intended to do.  If the Minister looks at the regulations he will realise that they are extremely technical and an ordinary commonsense explanation of what they purport to do is necessary to enable a Deputy intelligently to understand the regulations.  I think that situation can be met if the Minister makes a regution and then, in a simple statement accompanying that regulation, explains what it is intended to do.  I am quite certain that not 1 per cent. of the members of this House can understand what the regulations mean at the moment.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think that is meeting the situation fairly.

Examination of these conditions involved, among other things, discussions with the local authority. All of the matters arising out of the proposal have not yet been cleared up, but a letter was issued recently to the county council approving of the proposal generally, subject to consideration of certain details.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Gallagher</NameTxt>
      <P>I was about to conclude when the House adjourned on Friday.  I just had a few points to make regarding the development of the City of Dublin in the interest of the tourist industry.  We in Dublin Corporation have submitted plans with that end in view.  That is the reason why I strongly suggest to the Government that there should be no hold up whatsoever in the question of money for the plans that we submitted.  I have not got the exact figures, but it is well-known that thousands of tourists come here year after year, and I am sure it will be agreed that they do not come alone for the good food they get or to look at Nelson <Col N="598" /> Pillar.  They want something more than that.  Our plans to beautify our parks and do everything possible to clear those derelict sites are very important. In addition to that they give an opportunity for a good deal of employment. We hear from all sides of the House that we should do something to take the men off the streets. As I said on Friday, in recent months Dublin Corporation have taken close on 400 men off the streets of Dublin for these special works, and I think that is what everybody wants, including the Government.  There, again, somebody has to pay for it, and we in Dublin Corporation would like that we should get all the money that is possible.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One of the schemes we have submitted deals with the question of the development of the Bull Island or what is better known as the Blue Lagoon. People may be inclined to laugh at that, but I think it is about time that we went ahead with that work.  No. 1, it will do a good deal to brighten up the city, and that end of the city especially, which is nothing at the moment only slightly better than a slobland.  As well as that, we feel that it will give continuous employment to quite a number of men.  It is proposed in this scheme for the Bull Island that it will give two very fine dual carriage roads.  It will also give two good cycle roads, and if our plans go ahead we will have artificial lakes which, I hope sincerely, will be much better than the monstrosity on O'Connell Bridge.  It is also planned to have swimming pools and possibly a site for attractive amusements of a high standard.  We in the corporation think that is a good plan and should be given serious consideration by the Government.  In the plans we have submitted we estimate that Schedule 3 of these special works will cost £430,000.  Of that £430,000, my figures show that the labour content will be £226,500, and the material and plant £203,500.  Therefore, you will see that the labour content of £226,500 would give a great deal of employment and I think we should proceed on these lines.  I respectfully suggest to the Parliamentary Secretary that if the Dublin Corporation got <Col N="599" /> 80 per cent. of that amount of money we could proceed with the work.  It is a claim that should get serious consideration so as to enable us to get on with the work.</P>
    <P>I have already mentioned derelict sites.  That problem in Dublin City has certainly gone beyond the talking stage.  We should clear those sites and either build houses on them or use them for cycle parks or car parks. Although the survey of the city which is being made by the Dublin Corporation may not yet be fully complete, I have reason to believe that it will be completed very shortly and when it is submitted to the Government I think that the Government should help us out.  There are parts of my constituency such as Denmark St., Grenville Street, Hardwicke Place, Temple Street and so forth, and it is a shame and a disgrace to the city as a whole that nothing is being done about them. With regard to Hardwicke Street and Hardwicke Place, I understand that plans have been drawn up by the city architect and that work will commence in the near future; the sooner the better.  The traders of that district have lost thousands of pounds every year by reason of large families leaving the district.  It means that trade is going from the district. The traders must still pay their rates and taxes.  They cannot say to the Dublin Corporation: &ldquo;I am sorry that I am down £1,000 or £2,000 this year. Let me off.&rdquo;  The corporation will not do that.  When large families in Grenville Street, Hardwicke Street, Temple Street, and so forth, move out to Ballyfermot, Finglas and other areas, money goes with them.  That is a problem for the traders in the area which they have left and it is a problem which we should endeavour to solve.</P>
    <P>I again appeal to the Parliamentary Secretary and to the Government to treat with all convenient speed and consideration the plans of the Dublin Corporation.  We started off by taking close on 400 men off the streets and giving employment to them.  We have started the good work but we cannot continue it without money.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanMacBride" hpid="Mr. MacBride Mr. MacBride">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacBride</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to endorse Deputy Gallagher's appeal to the Parliamentary Secretary in regard to the provision of moneys to enable the Dublin Corporation to carry on with the implementation of the plans which they have made for the relief of unemployment in the city.  I hope that the Parliamentary Secretary will be able to induce the Minister for Finance to give his sanction so that at least 80 per cent. of the estimates prepared for these works will be defrayed by the Government.  I hope that meanwhile the Dublin Corporation will continue to work in the expectation that this money will be made available.</P>
      <P>While in no way wishing to criticise some of the proposals put forward for the relief of unemployment in the city, I should like to urge that, as far as possible, there should be a little more advance planning than there seems to have been in many cases.  I know that the unemployment situation was such that immediate steps had to be taken. Had there been a little more planning, a little more advance thought, it might have been possible to start on work which would be of greater benefit than some of the works which are being undertaken merely in order to provide employment on them.  The digging up of footpaths and the relaying of new footpaths may be very necessary in some cases but one would think that there are more urgent amenities that could be provided if there had been a little more planning. I do not blame the officials concerned because I am aware that they were probably grossly overworked and that they were faced with a sudden emergency in the course of which they had to be in a position to provide some kind of relief work at once.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not know whether the Parliamentary Secretary could advise the Government to allow these funds to be used&mdash;the funds made available by the Government&mdash;to defray the cost&mdash;in part, at least&mdash;of the building of new dispensaries and new schools in Dublin City.  Work of that nature would relieve unemployment and would provide an amenity which is very badly <Col N="601" /> needed at the moment in certain areas of the city.  It has occurred to me that work of that nature might be of greater value than the digging up of footpaths and the relaying of footpaths. There are certain other amenities of a similar nature which are also required in Dublin City&mdash;amenities such as provision of a proper concert hall, swimming pools and so forth.  If money is being made available for the relief of unemployment, it might be possible to plan the work sufficiently far ahead to enable constructive works of that nature to be undertaken, rather than scratch relief works.</P>
    <P>I do not know whether it is relevant to bring this up on this Estimate but I should like to mention that for a great many years past there has been considerable talk about the necessity of providing a new bridge across the Liffey.  There has also been a controversy as to whether a bridge should be erected over the Liffey or a tunnel made under the Liffey.</P>

      <P>I was about to suggest that possibly the Parliamentary Secretary might be in a position to make funds available in the future for the purpose of assisting the Dublin Corporation and the county council to provide a tunnel under the Liffey.  That would have the treble purpose (1)  of providing a considerable amount of work for the relief of unemployment; (2)  of relieving the traffic congestion in the city, and (3)  of providing shelters in the event of a future emergency.</P>

      <P>I bow to the ruling of the Chair.  I was hoping that I might be able to suggest to the Parliamentary Secretary that, as part of the scheme for the relief of unemployment, he might be able to make money available for constructive schemes of a long-term nature rather than what I might term emergency famine relief schemes.  I quite appreciate that these scratch schemes are essential at the moment, when there is an unemployment epidemic of the kind which we have experienced, but if there had been a little more advance planning it might have been possible to have schemes of a more constructive nature undertaken&mdash;schemes that would be of benefit to the city and the country generally.  He might consider a policy of asking local authorities to prepare schemes of that kind as part of the unemployment relief schemes rather than purely scratch relief schemes.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>There has been a good deal of talk in this debate about artificial lakes, playgrounds, beauty spots, fancy kerbs and footpaths and so on.  I think the main item which we, as Deputies, should be impressing as hard as we can on the Parliamentary Secretary and the Government is the seriousness of the unemployment position rather than the provision of artificial lakes.  I doubt if the Parliamentary <Col N="603" /> Secretary or his office has a true and accurate picture of the deplorable unemployment position that exists in the country.  The purpose of emergency employment schemes is the provision of emergency relief for unemployment and is it not true that there is an emergency in every town and village of the country in that regard to-day?  There are people in long queues outside country post offices and Garda barracks registering as unemployed, signing on for work in the various labour exchanges and walking from shop to shop, from business to business and factory to factory seeking work.  Is it not true that quite a number of industrial concerns have had to put notices on their gates saying: &ldquo;No vacancies here&rdquo; in order to save the time of their personnel in regard to interviewing applicants for work?</P>
      <P>Never in the history of this country was there such real hardship and poverty amongst unemployed working-class people.  In various parts of rural Ireland to-day the housewife can provide only one meal a day and I have known cases in which, because of unemployment, children are asked to remain at home from school because there is no breakfast to be provided for them.  Surely cases of this nature constitute an emergency, and I submit that the office of the Parliamentary Secretary is not catering at all for the real emergency which exists.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Davin will agree with me that in parts of our constituency, in Birr, Tullamore, Edenderry, Shinrone, Portarlington, Mountmellick and Rathdowney, there is a great and serious unemployment problem.  Despite the fact that the schemes are there and that the unemployed are there, the schemes are not put into operation. There is no use talking about fancy paths and artificial lakes in these circumstances. The men are not being put to work because the funds are not coming down from the Parliamentary Secretary's office to the local authority to put these schemes into operation. An emergency is something which, in my view, requires to be dealt with without either delay or hesitation. <Col N="604" /> There is an emergency in every town in Ireland to-day.  What assistance is being given by the Emergency Employment Schemes Office?  No help whatever is being given in rural Ireland by that office to-day.  An odd bog road or an odd lane is repaired, a bog drain is made in a particular electoral division, but neither a bog lane nor a bog drain is going to bring an immediate solution of the serious emergency which exists.</P>
    <P>The Office of Public Works has failed completely and utterly to provide even a temporary solution of the serious emergency in rural Ireland to-day, and in view of the magnitude of that emergency it is obvious that we would require four times the amount of money being asked for before that emergency could be tackled properly. It was never as bad and the strain occasioned by this position has fallen so seriously on every St. Vincent de Paul conference that in many cases their funds are completely run out.  At the annual general meeting of one of the oldest charitable societies in Dublin recently it was stated that there was never such a demand on charitable funds as there is at present in the city.  Have we not had this emergency for the past 12 or 18 months and surely such an emergency cannot be allowed to continue for years?  The Office of Public Works is not dealing competently with that deplorable situation.</P>
    <P>Hundreds of the unemployed are leaving the country day after day.  We have 52,000 registered unemployed to-day and there are between 30,000 and 35,000 unemployed who are not registered.  The present position is&mdash; I ask the Parliamentary Secretary to note this for very serious attention&mdash; that unless there is a certain number of registered unemployed in a particular electoral division, no grant will be allocated for that area.  That is wrong. If there are six, seven or eight men in a particular area unemployed, it should be the duty of the Department to provide a scheme, under the heading of emergency employment schemes, to give these men employment.</P>
    <P>It is also wrong that if an electoral area would benefit by a bog drainage <Col N="605" /> scheme, a bog development scheme or a road-making scheme, that electoral area should not qualify for a grant because there are not sufficient registered unemployed there.  Is it not all the same whether a man is unemployed and has his name down or is unemployed without having his name down? This provision with regard to registered unemployed is all not and codology and should be removed completely from the regulations.  If a man is unemployed he is unemployed and that is that.  There is a certain amount of pride in Irish workers and many of them would prefer to die of hunger rather than allow their names to go down on an unemployment record sheet.</P>
    <P>I have known workers who preferred to go to work in English coalmines, in English munition factories and English malthouses rather than permit their names to go down on the list of registered unemployed.  They are too proud to do so and it is a grand thing that we have some of that pride left in this country, but is it not an extraordinary state of affairs that there should be a regulation which debars them from work if they have that little pride?  If they prefer to be regarded as hard, industrious workers who do not want their names on the list no steps will be taken to provide them with work to save them the embarrassment of having to sign such a record in order to get work at home.</P>
    <P>The office of the Parliamentary Secretary has not faced up to the serious responsibility involved in the magnitude of the unemployment position which is not recorded in official figures and the Parliamentary Secretary must have been made aware of this by the volume of correspondence which he has received from various local authorities concerning these relief schemes.  Tullamore Urban Council have time and again made application for grants to the Parliamentary Secretary's Department for a local employment scheme and the council were always told that there were not sufficient registered unemployed in the district electoral division to qualify for a grant.  Yet, let the Parliamentary Secretary go down <Col N="606" /> to Tullamore any night and I will guarantee that he will get from 200 to 300 unemployed men from the town of Tullamore and the surrounding districts who are anxious to work on such schemes.</P>
    <P>I think that this question of finding a solution for the unemployment problem is not alone getting the blind eye but also the deaf ear of the Government and they are certainly not facing up to their responsibilities.  The Emergency Employment Schemes Office is doing very little, if anything, towards finding a solution of this problem.  Is it not a fact that there are quite a number of counties which during the years of the emergency were engaged in the production of turf&mdash;counties such as Laois, Roscommon, Kerry, Mayo and more particularly Offaly and Kildare&mdash;and that during those years the county council staffs were taken away from road maintenance, improvement and drainage schemes which were the responsibility of the local authority and were compelled to direct their attention to turf production during those years?  Then when the emergency passed, no additional moneys were made available for the purpose of giving additional grants to county councils to put their roads back into that state of repair in which the roads of counties, where the staffs were not so diverted, were always maintained.</P>
    <P>Time and again the Office of Public Works and the Emergency Schemes Office have been asked by those counties whose roads were allowed to deteriorate during the emergency, to provide extra grants for the purpose of putting the roads of these counties back into a proper state of repair.  I believe these counties have a special claim on moneys provided for emergency schemes.  Yet when applications at the rate of about six per week are sent in from my constituency for grants under these emergency employment schemes, we get back the reply that these schemes do not qualify for the 100 per cent. grant and that they should come under the rural improvement schemes under which some contribution must be made locally.  I want to say in fairness to the inspectors employed in the Parliamentary <Col N="607" /> Secretary's Department, either in connection with bog drainage work or rural improvement schemes, that they deserve the thanks and appreciation of everybody concerned because they are giving good and valuable service.  Certainly it cannot be said that when an application is sent into the Office of Public Works it is put on the long finger.  I do not know any other section where so much speed and efficiency are shown as in inspecting and reporting to the Employment Schemes Office, but inspecting and reporting do not mean that the job will be done because there are no funds at the office to do the work.</P>
    <P>There is no use in having an efficient inspector carrying out an investigation of a scheme with all possible speed if we find that there are no funds available to carry out the schemes which he recommends.  Despite the fact that 96 out of every 100 schemes put up are recommended by the inspectors, a very small percentage of the schemes can be carried out because the Parliamentary Secretary's office has failed to provide the cash for the carrying out of these schemes.  That is where the neglect lies.  There is little use in saying: &ldquo;We will carry out that scheme this year or next year,&rdquo; if no money is provided for such a scheme.  The Department will have to provide for employment schemes as if they were facing a real emergency and the House should be asked to provide three times the amount of the present Estimate for these works because if the money were available you could in the morning put 25,000 to 30,000 men in employment. While these schemes were in course of completion, we could, as Deputy MacBride suggested, be planning additional schemes to follow them so that we may be in a position to ensure that the serious emergency created by unemployment will be at least in some degree relieved.</P>
    <P>I should like particularly to direct the attention of the Parliamentary Secretary to the necessity of providing extra grants for works in the turf-producing areas.  His own constituency is one of these areas.  I could safely <Col N="608" /> say that such a step would be appreciated by the local authorities concerned and their engineering staffs because we believe that as we were engaged on turf production during the war we are entitled to a better crack of the whip than counties which, because their staffs were not diverted to turn production, were able to keep their roads and drainage schemes in first-class order even during the emergency. I think also that this arrangement of men having to sign for an emergency scheme grant is ridiculous. I think that the Parliamentary Secretary might be able to formulate some new system whereby deserving areas would not be deprived of the benefits of these schemes which, as the Parliamentary Secretary knows, can be very great indeed.</P>
    <P>There is one other matter to which I should like the Parliamentary Secretary to give personal attention.  I do not know how it works&mdash;it did not often work under the inter-Party Government&mdash;but it frequently happens that a local Fianna Fáil T.D. gets information in regard to the operation of a scheme far in advance of any other Deputy.  Surely there must be some looseness in the Parliamentary Secretary's office or the information must come from some other source.</P>

      <P>I intend to vote for the reference back of this Estimate or, if compelled to do so, to vote against the Estimate for one principal reason at any rate, that the Parliamentary Secretary or the Government cannot in existing circumstances in rural Ireland justify the reduction of £100,000 in this Estimate.  I do not know how the Parliamentary Secretary arrived at the round figure of £100,000.  I hope when he is replying that he will give us some more information in justification of this reduction than he gave when introducing the Estimate.</P>
      <P>What will it cost the Government and the taxpayers to give an additional 1 per cent. on the £25,000,000 National Loan over and above what they got National Loans for on many previous occasions?  This cut of £100,000 in the Estimate looks like a sum that would pay 1 per cent. for six months or a year on the new National Loan.  However, if the money is to go to the moneylenders instead of to those looking for work, that is an issue which I would challenge by vote at the end of this discussion.  There is a fundamental difference between the present policy of the Government, as I understand it, and that of some of those who sit on this side of the House.  The Government believe that the first charge on production is whatever is reasonably required by the moneylenders or what the moneylenders may be able to force the Government and the Minister for Finance and his Parliamentary Secretary to give.  We believe that the first charge on production is a livelihood for those who produce and a decent wage and standard of living for the producers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have no hesitation in challenging the Parliamentary Secretary and the Minister to defend this reduction of £100,000.  I want to say&mdash;perhaps I might be able to say it, but I do not pretend to be able to say it, on behalf of my colleagues&mdash;that I share the view of a good many Deputies on this side of the House that the Parliamentary Secretary is a decent, common-sense man, but he has no power or authority to decide policy.  He is in <Col N="612" /> the House to carry out the instructions of the Government and the Minister for Finance without having any say, I presume, as to whether the sum now asked for is sufficient to meet the situation as he knows it and as we all know it in the rural parts of the country.  If the Parliamentary Secretary really knows the position in rural Ireland to-day, how does he come before the House to justify the reduction of £100,000 in this Estimate, knowing perfectly well that there are thousands of schemes in the pigeon-holes of his Department which are absolutely essential and urgently necessary and which cannot be carried out because the Minister for Finance will not give him the money to do so?</P>
    <P>I do not put all the blame on the Parliamentary Secretary, but he will have to bear some of it.  I certainly do not blame any of his officials.  They have to do their duty and to examine every proposal which comes before us under whatever sub-head you may select in this Vote.  They have to put these proposals before their inspectors who have to go into rural Ireland to examine the proposals and to report on them.  If they have only a limited amount of money to carry out certain essential and urgently required works under any sub-head of this Estimate, they have to use their own judgment, if allowed to do so freely, and perhaps select one out of five or six schemes, although they know well that all the schemes are urgently necessary in the areas concerned.  Therefore, I never have blamed the permanent officials of this Department because they have to use their own judgment in selecting one out of so many schemes.</P>
    <P>I support Deputy Flanagan and the county councils of Laois and Offaly in pressing on the attention of the Parliamentary Secretary, the Minister for Finance and the Minister for Local Government the urgent necessity for providing more money under the sub-heads of this Vote or whatever other Vote they like for putting the byroads or county roads in Laois and Offaly in a decent state of repair.  These byroads, as they are called, are in a disgraceful condition since the end of the emergency.  It is now nearly <Col N="613" /> three months since the county council of Laois unanimously passed a resolution requesting the Minister for Local Government and the Parliamentary Secretary to meet a deputation of all sections of that council for the purpose of impressing on them the necessity for providing more money than they have at their disposal now, for putting these dangerous and disgraceful county roads or byroads into decent condition.</P>
    <P>The Parliamentary Secretary knows well, because he represents a neighbouring constituency where they may have the same kind of complaint to make, but not to the same extent, that during the period of the last emergency road workers were taken off their ordinary, normal work in both counties and in some neighbouring counties and put on to turf production work so that turn might be supplied to the citizens of Dublin and other cities and provincial towns.  They were taken away from their normal work and the Road Fund and other grants that would have been normally made available for the carrying out of the usual road construction, reconstruction and maintenance work were apparently set aside for other non-turf-cutting counties. Is it not a fair and reasonable proposition for the county councils of these counties to say, on behalf of the ratepayers, that they should now get some additional grants to put the roads into a passable condition?</P>
    <P>I understand from a colleague of mine that this matter came before a meeting of the Laois County Council yesterday and that no reply of any kind was received from the Minister for Local Government, after repeated applications, for the reception of a deputation during the past two or three months.  I think it is a disgraceful state of affairs that there was no reply to a request to receive a deputation for this very necessary purpose. I know the Parliamentary Secretary is not mainly responsible, but he should impress upon his colleague and friend, the Minister for Local Government, the necessity for granting the reasonable request of the county councils <Col N="614" /> concerned to receive a deputation for the purpose of hearing their case.</P>
    <P>This time three years ago there were 400 more men working for the Laois and Offaly County Councils than are employed by these two county councils to-day.  Why?  Because you had grants made available fairly freely at that particular time for two or three years under the Local Authorities (Works) Act.  Of course, it is well known in the counties concerned and in other counties that the Government are giving that Act a slow death by reducing, if not altogether wiping out, the substantial and generous grants made available from the time it came into operation in 1949 until the end of 1951.  Continuous employment was given to 400 more men by the two county councils of Laois and Offaly and valuable, essential, drainage, road and repair work was done which is not being done to-day.</P>
    <P>There are schemes in the pigeon-holes of the Department of Local Government, according to the latest figure to which I have access, amounting to £42,000 awaiting the allocation of the money that was given in order to enable these works to be commenced and have the available labour locally employed on carrying out these useful schemes.</P>
    <P>I do not know whether the Parliamentary Secretary knows it or not but it is an unfortunate fact that, according to the latest statistical returns regarding emigration, Edenderry and Mountmellick are practically at the head of the list of the towns in provincial Ireland so far as emigration is concerned.  Is it not desirable in areas where you have this huge amount of emigration going on that any schemes of a useful and reproductive nature which are put forward and sanctioned as good, sound, economic schemes should be financed for the purpose of carrying out these jobs?  When it suits the purpose the Taoiseach comes in and says, as he will propose on his own Vote when it is under discussion, there is no question of a shortage of money. Then he will proceed to bore holes through some of the schemes that he has been advised are uneconomic or useless.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="615" /> Somebody handed him the particulars of a scheme when he was speaking on the last occasion.  The scheme was submitted to the Parliamentary Secretary's Department.  It cost the small sum of £70.  He said that was a ridiculous, uneconomic type of scheme.  If the Parliamentary Secretary supplied the Taoiseach with that kind of information, I wonder would he indicate, when replying, whether it was a road improvements scheme, an ordinary relief scheme, a bog drainage scheme, a road repair scheme or what kind of a scheme it was that the Taoiseach referred to on that particular occasion? I personally believe the Taoiseach was misled and that he was probably supplied with information that was not thoroughly reliable.  That is not the way, at any rate, to answer the case for the provision of more money for the purpose of solving the general unemployment problem in the country. Does the Parliamentary Secretary admit or deny&mdash;he is a straightforward man and I am putting him a straightforward question&mdash;that he could make use of more money if more money was made available under the various sub-heads included in the Vote now under discussion?  Does the Parliamentary Secretary think it is right that the Local Authorities (Works) Act should be scrapped?</P>

Is not that so?  If the Parliamentary Secretary was entitled to make reference to sums of money made available under the sub-heads for other Government Departments, surely Deputies who follow him in this discussion are entitled to comment on what he said and ask him for further information in regard to the allocation of these moneys.</P>
      <P>Is it not a fact that some of the schemes submitted by local authorities under the Local Authorities (Works) Act, 1949, and passed by the officials of the Department of Local Government to the officials of the Department over which the Parliamentary Secretary presides, are actually carried out under the Board of Works administration?

      <P>The Parliamentary Secretary will not deny because he can-not&mdash;and he must, therefore, admit&mdash; that at this particular period there is no justification whatsoever for asking the members on any side of this House to agree to a reduction of a round figure of £100,000 in a Vote where money is supposed to be made available for all the useful types of rural improvement schemes that are put forward by local authorities, individuals and organisations.  Is it a fact that you could have carried out schemes covering twice the amount provided for in this Estimate?  If so and if the Taoiseach stated the full facts before the House when speaking about this matter on the last occasion, what is the difficulty about the Parliamentary Secretary getting the money that he knows is required if he accepts the word of the Taoiseach that any money necessary for the carrying <Col N="617" /> out of schemes to relieve unemployment, whether relief schemes or permanent schemes, can be made available? If the Taoiseach is right, what is the justification for the reduction of £100,000 in this particular Estimate at this particular period?</P>
      <P>I do not want to ask the Parliamentary Secretary to shoulder all the blame and responsibility for the reduction of £100,000 because I know that he has been told by his master, the Minister for Finance, who is the master mind of the Government the same as every Minister for Finance is in every Government in every democratic country, that that is all he will get and that he had better do the best he can with it.  I ask him to defend the reduction of £100,000 if he is in a position to do so.  I want the Parliamentary Secretary to tell me the number of schemes sanctioned by his Department and still awaiting an allocation of money, and the total number of schemes sanctioned in his Department that cannot be carried out because money for them has not been made available for them before the end of the present financial year.  I want him to answer those questions in a straightforward way.</P>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. A. Byrne Mr. A. Byrne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. A. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>I attended a finance meeting of the Dublin Corporation yesterday which was called for the special purpose of budgeting for £77,500 for the relief of unemployment. Up to the moment, the corporation has spent £42,000 on emergency relief schemes.  It was stated at yesterday's meeting that no definite financial contribution has yet been received from the Government.  We do not know what grants the Government are going to give, or when.  I disagree entirely with Deputy Gallagher when he says that we are going ahead, and that we should be satisfied with the 70 per cent. contribution for these emergency relief schemes.  We were led to believe by Government spokesmen that we would get an 80 per cent. contribution and that the corporation would guarantee to put up the other 20 per cent.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The point I want to make is that we took the word of the Government <Col N="618" /> spokesman, and the officials of the corporation, in order to ease the unemployment position in the City of Dublin, went ahead as fast as they could in putting men to work, with the approval of the Government, with the money they had in hands for ordinary relief schemes which commence about this time of the year.  The corporation have spent all that money now&mdash;money which they had for ordinary relief schemes.  Every other day promises were made by the Government that to-day or to-morrow we would get the grants.  But on last Friday week we were told that the corporation was coming to the end as regards the money it had to pay wages.  Yesterday, then, in order to overcome these difficulties, and to keep men at work, we were called together to budget for £77,500.  That includes the sum of £42,000 which the corporation has already spent and which will have to be restored to the fund.  The balance is to keep us going until we know what the Government is going to do.</P>
    <P>Will it be believed by any of my colleagues that we have not, up to the moment, got a grant from the Government towards the payment of the wages of the men whom we had to take on and who, very properly, were clamouring for work?  Our officials prepared schemes.  We were hopeful that we would be able to put on another 400 men within the next two months in order to ease the situation for the Government.  We wanted to ease that situation and to ease it for the unemployed themselves.  We had a certain guarantee from the Government that we would get substantial grants but up to the present we have got no grant other than the tail-end of the grant that remained over from the early part of the year&mdash;I think a sum of about £29,000.  The Parliamentary Secretary will remember that, in May of this year, Deputy Tom Byrne, of North-West Dublin, raised the question of the unemployed in the City of Dublin. We pressed that immediate employment should be given to these men. When we said that we could not get money, the Minister at the time said, very properly, that the corporation had £29,000 still unexpended, and that <Col N="619" /> we should spend it.  We went and we spent the money.  It is now all gone.</P>
    <P>Some of my colleagues will remember that at that time one or two members on the Government side of the House made an effort to pour ridicule on myself personally because of my advocacy, as they said then, of the unemployed.  I remember that at the time, in the columns of the <i>Irish Press,</i> I was subjected to ridicule by members on the Government Bench because I was drawing their attention to the then serious problem of the unemployed. That was a month or two before the men themselves took the matter in their own hands and paraded in O'Connell Street.</P>
    <P>The officials of the corporation have prepared what is described as a No. 3 schedule of works.  They have submitted a plan for the expenditure of £430,000.  That is awaiting sanction by the Government, but up to yesterday no sanction was received for a plan which involves an expenditure of £430,000.  We are pressing for an 80 per cent. contribution by the Government. The corporation will put up the balance.</P>
    <P>Deputy Davin has made a reference to the questions of unemployment and emigration.  So far as Dublin is concerned, the two would appear to go hand in hand.  When I was coming into the House to-day I got a letter from a woman, dated the 26th October.  She says:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Dear Mr. Byrne,</P>
    <P>Pardon my writing to you regarding my husband, who is unemployed this past eight or nine months.  I ask you, Mr. Byrne, what is going to be done with regard to the building trade.  There seems to be plenty of work to be done.  When are they going to start?  While the Government and the corporation are talking the people are starving.  Is the Government aware that every day a batch are leaving here for England? Soon there will be very few left to carry on work as the best of our skilled men are going.  Soon the city will be composed of only old men and women.  The flower of the flock <Col N="620" /> are leaving and emigrating.  It makes one wish that we were never born, struggling on from day to day trying to exist.  At the moment my husband has to stand on the line of relief to draw 18/-.  What would that do for anyone, and the rent 14/-? Don't think, Mr. Byrne, that I am looking for help or charity, as is the case in certain other areas.  No, thank God, I am able to carry on, but if it lasts much longer I think we will all be up in the union.  Trusting you will interest yourself in the matter and see that they start work at once.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>That is a type of letter which I am sure every other Deputy has in his bag.  I just give it as a sample of others.  Another woman writes to me and says that her husband and son are unemployed.  The son is unemployed because the wholesale firm in which he worked has closed down.  She refers to the prominent wholesale grocery firm of McMaster Hodgson where her son was employed.  That firm was in business for over 100 years.  It is now closed down and there are 90 men left standing idle to add to the list of the unemployed.</P>
    <P>It would not be right for me to bore the House by reading out a number of these letters.  I know that all Deputies have received letters of the same type. When some of my colleagues come to me and ask me what are we doing in Dublin, I tell them that we have 400 men on special emergency relief works and that we are trying to get ahead with our building schemes.  We have certain building sites marked out and over the next eight or ten years we hope to be able to build 2,000 houses a year.  One of my colleagues in the corporation made reference to the possibilities in Dublin.  I am glad that, from what he said, I had support for views that I have expressed myself, namely, that the clearing of derelict sites would, in my opinion, provide at least one year's work for 100 men.</P>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. A. Byrne Mr. A. Byrne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. A. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>I quite agree but I was rather puzzled when I saw two and a half columns of the Dáil Debates of 22nd October last devoted to Dublin by the present Parliamentary Secretary.  At column 475 he says:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Deputies will appreciate that no extra employment would be provided if the Vote simply financed works which the local authorities themselves would otherwise necessarily have to undertake immediately.  The question of finance is, therefore, by no means the only problem which creates difficulties in respect of these schemes; and, if I take the City of Dublin as an example, it is perhaps because the difficulties there are tending to become more acute.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>My colleagues in the Dublin Corporation who are also members of the House will agree that it is becoming very acute.  He goes on then to say at column 476:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;The Government, accordingly, decided that the programme of employment schemes, which would not ordinarily be due to commence until the winter period, should be put in <Col N="622" /> hands as soon as possible in the county borough areas and the Borough of Dún Laoghaire, and instructions accordingly were issued to the local authorities concerned to submit suitable schemes.  In the result, Dublin Corporation were authorised at the end of July to proceed with schemes costing approximately £60,000 and the other borough counties were also authorised to start a number of works.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I do not wish to contravene the ruling of the Chair but I am merely trying to answer what the Parliamentary Secretary said.  He devoted two and a half columns to Dublin City and I think the Minister for Local Government should have dealt with the matter because we could have questioned certain things that have been done and certain delays and I could have asked why it is that in some section of the Local Government Department schemes involving £430,000 are awaiting sanction. We want extra staff to go out to prepare and survey these schemes.  I still believe there is a hold-up in the Department of Local Government. They have not yet sanctioned the extra staff required for the extra office accommodation, and so on, which will give employment.  We had hoped to employ another 500 men within the next six months and I would ask the Parliamentary Secretary to go into that matter.</P>
    <P>I am sure Deputy Gallagher, Deputy Briscoe, Deputy McCann, Deputy Breathnach, the Lord Mayor, Deputy Doyle and my other colleagues in the corporation will accept my word that we are most anxious to assist the Government in any effort they make to solve the unemployment problem in the City of Dublin.  The difficulties which unemployment is bringing to many families are deplorable.  I do not know exactly how many decrees for rent arrears are being granted in the courts at the present time but I know they are considerable; thank goodness the cases are usually settled in a friendly way by considerate officials.  I believe there have been at least 100 decrees a week for rent arrears granted in the City of Dublin within the last <Col N="623" /> 12 months due to unemployment.  The unfortunate thing is that when the rent arrears mount up the young men and perhaps the fathers of families who get nervous take the boat across to England so that they can work in Coventry, Manchester and elsewhere. The whole family happiness is destroyed when the father or perhaps one or two sons and a daughter emigrate to work in another country.</P>
    <P>All the Dublin Deputies know I am not exaggerating when I say that at the moment you will find hundreds of fine young men going along to the North Wall, to building schemes and other places, seeking employment. Every Dublin Deputy has received letters asking for employment similar to those I have had.  The corporation is most anxious to help the Government but, as I said, we are waiting for more men.  We can give good value for the money expended.  Work needs to be done on the clearance of derelict sites, knocking down all the old tenement houses, improving the position so far as playgrounds are concerned, playing fields and swimming pools.  There is good reproductive work to be done. My difficulty in regard to all this matter is that I have too many notes to which I could refer on this special subject.</P>

      <P>I am sure he will say something, because I know he is as much interested in Dublin City and Dublin County as the rest of us are. He will not be any less responsible than we are for putting pressure on the Government to give us more money. A member of the Finance Committee of Dublin Corporation stated yesterday:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;The Minister has not yet informed the corporation officially as to how the cost of special works relief would be defrayed.  No indication has been given by the Government as to what grants are to come.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have 380 men out working for the past nine weeks; we have spent over £40,000, and more money requires to <Col N="624" /> be made available at once.  We have promises and I believe those promises will be fulfilled.  I told my colleagues not to be alarmed about grants not being in their hands at the moment. We had the Taoiseach's guarantee in regard to this work and we know that his guarantee is as good and solid as if we had a cheque in our hands. That was my personal view, but what we want to know is will the Government give us an order and say: &ldquo;We will give you 80 per cent. for the works you have in hands and we will sanction that £430,000 under Schedule 3 which was not yet sanctioned.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The Blue Lagoon is a very live matter at the moment.  The improvement of the whole Clontarf area is being undertaken.  So far as this money has been spent good value has been given.  Our head engineer in charge of the relief schemes and emergency works said publicly yesterday at our finance committee meeting that they were getting good value from the workers, which shows there was a genuine desire on the part of the men to get work.</P>
    <P>I would like finally to press the point that has been made by other members that the Government should foster a little more co-operation between the heads of the Department of Local Government and the Dublin Corporation.  We had reason to complain here a couple of weeks ago, and I hope the little differences of opinion have been settled.  We need a few extra technical men to get ready that £500,000 relief scheme.  As one of my colleagues put it to-day, we have plenty of work to do in Dublin if we had the money, but the Government must give us a fair share.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnFlynn" hpid="Mr. J. Flynn Mr. J. Flynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>I have just a few queries to put.  Mention was made about the employment of men in areas where it is difficult to obtain the required number according to the schedule.  It was suggested they might be brought from outside or that the clause should be amended and a lesser number taken as the standard figure.  We have had cases down in South Kerry where very necessary works were required and simply because there were not sufficient U.A. <Col N="625" /> men in the district the work had to be cancelled.  If the employment office would agree to bring men from outside it would be a very costly affair and it would not work either.  I think the only way out is to amend the number required under the regulations, which at present provide that if that number is not in the electoral district the work cannot go on.</P>
      <P>In regard to rural improvement schemes, on behalf of the people I represent I appreciate the Parliamentary Secretary's decision to increase the grant.  I would ask that the people whose schemes have been held up, and who have paid their contribution for the carrying through of those schemes, should be enabled to put the work in hands as early as possible.  I am aware of a good few cases where the money was paid over some months ago and the people have received a note back from the Employment Schemes Office that until money was available the schemes could not be undertaken. That may go on until January or February of next year.  I am glad to know that the Parliamentary Secretary is increasing the amount so that these schemes can be attended to.  I hope they will be attended to right away, as they are very urgent and the people have requested us to have the money sanctioned as early as possible.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In Book No. 4 of last week's Dáil Debates on this Vote, I saw that Deputy Palmer referred to the employment of gangers and said they should be drawn in from outside.  It was through his action in South Kerry that that had to be done.  Immediately this Government took over the affairs of this country, Deputy Palmer's supporters down there organised against the employment of what they called Fianna Fáil gangers.  They went as far as to object to any of these gangers who they claimed were Fianna Fáil supporters.  It went to the extent that in the Sneem district, Deputy Palmer's own parish, these men caused a strike and an inspector of the employment works in Kerry had to bring a man named Moriarity all the way from Ballinskelligs. Deputy Palmer asked Moriarity to meet him in his own <Col N="626" /> house, but Moriarity refused.  I want that to go on record.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>I would not raise it but Deputy Palmer raised it last week about the employment of these gangers.  The Board of Works officials in Kerry stood up to them and I will give them full credit for doing so.  The man in charge in Kerry is second to none, Mr. Kenny.  I do not like to mention names but he and the men associated with him have done good work in South Kerry though they were up against it on this occasion.  I appreciate that every effort was made by these people to employ the best men. They did employ them.  We said nothing about it.  I remember myself when the inter-Party Government was in power there was none of this work carried on; every man was regarded as being capable and trustworthy.  I think that the employment of these gangers is an important factor and where the official has been doing the work over a period of years that experience should be appreciated.</P>
      <P>Perhaps the Parliamentary Secretary could recast this whole scheme in regard to drainage and bog development. I am speaking outside this sub-head now, I know.  Our idea down there is that some of these works are commenced too late in the season, even the road works.  These rural improvement schemes have been held up for the past three or four months and almost into the winter.  I hope that in future, long before the winter period arrives, the small farmers concerned will be informed in time and obtain sanction in time so that the work will have reached an advanced stage while the good weather is available.  That is particularly important to us down in South Kerry, where it is difficult to get the proper conditions.  When the Parliamentary Secretary is replying I would like him to indicate an improvement in regard to schemes of works in certain areas in South Kerry.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I had a parliamentary question down <Col N="627" /> some time ago about Valentia Island and I made a case that I had received a number of letters from people in regard to accommodation roads which were damaged during the recent floods.  I believe that, even though it might not be on the regular schedule, if the matter is specially investigated by the Parliamentary Secretary's Department and we can show that these roads are practically impassable, an additional or supplementary allowance might be made available for these flooded roads.  That is a point I would like to make because it was sudden damage, if you like.  It is a thing that could be justified at all times.  The point I am making is that even if the Parliamentary Secretary had a schedule made out, say, for the past month or perhaps longer, that the case of sudden damage, even though it did not arise until after the scheme was made out, should still be considered because the occurrence was unexpected and it would be serious for the people concerned during the winter months. Even if there was only a supplementary grant given to enable them to repair the roads temporarily until some later date when the job could be completed it would be of great value.</P>
    <P>That is all I have to say in regard to this Vote.  Again I would like to mention how much I appreciate what has been done but, like many other Deputies, I believe that in order to cope with the whole problem, a greater sum should be made available to meet all the demands.  Nevertheless, I appreciate that it is a great advance in so far as rural improvement schemes are concerned that the Parliamentary Secretary has seen his way to increase them.</P>

      <P>Listening to the debate, not only this year but in previous years, in regard to this particular Vote, I have been struck by the variety of work that comes under the control of the Parliamentary Secretary. I find on examining this whole matter of employment&mdash;which is of vital importance&mdash;that there is to some extent a considerable overlapping of functions of the Parliamentary <Col N="628" /> Secretary and other Departments, particularly that of Local Government.  I think that we have now reached a stage when there should be a complete reorganisation of the administrative machinery that deals with this question of employment.  To some extent, a number of these relief schemes and rural improvement schemes and schemes of that kind have been developed as temporary measures for a particular purpose.  I feel that we have now reached the stage when we must consider that there will have to be Government machinery to deal with the problem of unemployment and with schemes of productive work on a longterm basis.  Some of the temporary schemes or relief schemes, as they have been called&mdash;perhaps improperly called&mdash;will have to be merged into the bigger machinery that I visualise.  I think the work carried out by the Parliamentary Secretary is so important that instead of being controlled by a Parliamentary Secretary it should be done by another Minister.  It should, in my view, be absolutely under the control of a special Minister whose functions would be entirely the provision of employment and the carrying out of schemes of work that will benefit the country as a whole.</P>
      <P>There is one thing which I think is very important.  Other countries&mdash;and particularly France&mdash;provide a certain proportion of the Budget every year for public works, and public works are the means by which employment is provided for the French people.  Public works are considered so important there that no political Party or politician would make the suggestion that there should be one halfpenny reduction in the provision for public works in the annual Budget.  We too will have to get into the frame of mind here that public works are absolutely essential if decent employment is to be provided for the people.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Viewing the matter in that light I regret very much the tendency that is creeping into this debate&mdash;and it has crept into the political field in recent months&mdash;towards the condemnation of certain schemes of public works that are vitally necessary.  I refer particularly to schemes that have been mentioned <Col N="629" /> in conjunction with the provision of employment for skilled workers in the City of Dublin.  I think it is a national disservice to condemn those public works.  I think every Deputy in this House should study the necessity for such public works if there is to be continuity of decent employment. I was particularly pleased when I heard that in Dublin City steps were to be taken to knock down and rebuild portion of Dublin Castle.  Undoubtedly that will cost a considerable sum of money but it will give very valuable employment for a long time.  We have other huge schemes that need to be carried out.  We have a scheme of municipal offices that are necessary, and have been necessary for a long time.  Those of us who are in Leinster House will know the inconveniences of Leinster House&mdash;the fact that there is no room where you can bring in a visitor to talk to him; no room in which you can discuss a pressing problem with a con-stituent&mdash;and we must realise that something must be done to build a new Dáil, in which there will be adequate and ample facilities for the transaction of public business.</P>

      <NameTxt>Captain Cowan</NameTxt>
      <P>Perhaps they would, but I was just trying to make my contribution in connection with all aspects of the matter and I am only going to touch on them very briefly.  Unfortunately, many public works are necessary not only in the urban areas but throughout the country.  We should combine here to ensure that these essential public works will be carried out under conditions that will provide a decent standard of living for the workers engaged in them.  We should be unanimous on that.  None of us should endeavour to obtain some narrow-minded political support by pushing this matter of town against country or country against town at a time when we should all be doing our utmost in the interests of the country as a whole.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Some waste occurs because of overlapping as between the Parliamentary Secretary's Office and the Department <Col N="630" /> of Local Government.  The Department of Local Government has enough to do in dealing with administration without entering into the question of relief schemes, employment schemes or matters of that kind.  I would like to see all these things under the sole control of the Parliamentary Secretary and he should be the head of a special Department with ministerial responsibility for the purpose of dealing with these matters.</P>
    <P>We have been faced in the corporation with the problem of providing employment for a large number of workers.  We have set up a special works committee, having on it members of the council, the city manager, the deputy city engineer, and the clerk to the council.  We have received every encouragement on that committee from the Government and from the Department of Local Government but, unfortunately, the machinery we want to establish in relation to these schemes does not apparently commend itself to the Department of Local Government.  That is a pity because the members of that special committee are vitally concerned with schemes for the improvement of their own particular areas and they are perhaps more competent to decide the right thing to do and the right way to do it than are officials who have not had the benefit of the wider experience that elected representatives have.</P>
    <P>I would like to see established by every local authority a works committee of the kind that has been established in Dublin for the purpose of carrying out a survey of local requirements, local amenities that should be provided and local works that should be implemented.  These committees should have the assistance of competent staffs and they should work directly under the control of the Office of Public Works.</P>
    <P>Many years of work lie ahead but that work will have to be carried out in a somewhat different manner from that in which it has been carried out hitherto.  Relief schemes were originally introduced as a palliative to surmount some particular unemployment difficulties.  We have had the <Col N="631" /> spectacle and the experience of tired local officials, engineers and others, rushing around trying to provide an employment scheme for a certain number of people at a certain period of the year.  That is not satisfactory. The best work is never done in that way to justify the money expended. The best employment conditions are not provided on such schemes.</P>
    <P>I press very strongly for a wider approach to this problem because I am satisfied that for many years to come there will be no improvement in the standard of employment or the actual employment content except through the medium of the measures I have advocated.  I have given considerable attention to this matter.  I am convinced that it is only in the way I suggest we will improve our present level of employment, provide better conditions for our workers and, in the long run, benefit and enrich the country as a whole.</P>
    <P>The Parliamentary Secretary is certainly doing an excellent job.  I am anxious that his responsibility should be increased in relation to this matter of employment of a permanent nature. All that should be under his control. In Dublin councillors and members of all Parties are anxious to co-operate in having valuable constructive works carried out.  The citizens of Dublin appreciate the work that is being done by the special committee to which I have referred.  I will support any steps taken to enlarge the scope of the Parliamentary Secretary's responsibility in order to put all these essential works on a sounder basis than that on which they have been operated for a number of years past.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with what Deputy Cowan has said in relation to the administration of the Office of Public Works by the Parliamentary Secretary.  He has carried out his functions in a very fair and impartial manner.  I would like to see the Parliamentary Secretary having more money at his disposal and more power to deal with these very vital problems. The Government is endeavouring to meet the present unemployment position <Col N="632" /> by the introduction of more public works.  The Government has given the maximum protection to agriculture and industry but, despite that, neither agriculture nor industry has proved capable of assimilating all the labour available.  It is regrettable that, in relation to certain public schemes, the Opposition should sing one tune down the country and another when they come to Dublin on the theme of unemployment.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>It is very regrettable that that attitude should be adopted. We all realise the importance of providing work for the unemployed. Dublin Corporation, Dublin County Council and the various county councils are doing their best to continue housing schemes and other projects. The E.S.B. are engaged on rural electrification.  Bord na Móna are carrying out turf projects.  Nevertheless, all these schemes are not employing all the available labour.  The Government realise the importance of providing employment and are doing their best to create it.</P>
      <P>I hear mutterings from my old friend of other days, Deputy Davin.  I would remind him that during the inter-Party Government's term of office he did not mind what that Government did.  They imported materials and commodities that could be at least manufactured here. Instead of contributing to the creation of employment, the inter-Party Government destroyed a number of very enterprising schemes that were well advanced by the previous Government, Fianna Fáil.</P>

I would like the Parliamentary Secretary to <Col N="633" /> have more money and more power so that I could approach him to have this work carried out.  Deputies from the City of Dublin have referred to the provision of parks and swimming pools.  I represent part of the city, Finglas and Ballyfermot.  I have approached members of the corporation, the city manager and the Minister for Local Government with a view to having essential work carried out in these areas.  The Dublin Corporation have done a reasonably good job in providing houses, but these areas suffer from a lack of social amenities.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>Out of Votes provided for the Parliamentary Secretary's office.  I understand that some schemes have been submitted.  I am sorry that there is no member of Dublin Corporation in the House.  There is one scheme in which I was very interested for Ballyfermot.  The Minister for Local Government was also very anxious that the scheme should be carried out but I understand that he has not got the co-operation that he would expect to get from the corporation; they are rather slow.  I do not know whether that is the position or not but I believe it is.  I seriously urge the provision of money for this purpose.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In Swords and Balbriggan it would be very desirable that schemes should be carried out in wintertime when there is not much work available on the land or in building.  At that period there is usually a very large number of people unemployed.  The rules governing grants should be more flexible.  At present there is a lot of red tape and the grant is made on the basis of the number of unemployed the previous year.  The Parliamentary Secretary should have more power and more money at his disposal so that he could say that, on the advice of the commissioners, a problem in a particular <Col N="634" /> area would be relieved by A, B or C method.  Unemployment is a national problem.  Everything possible should be done to relieve it.</P>
    <P>There is a number of works which it is essential to carry out but which cannot be carried out in a piecemeal fashion.  Relief works in certain areas have been well carried out.  In other areas they have been very poor.  There should be constructive planning.  More constructive work should be done through relief grants.  Sometimes these grants are used for work on roads, for instance, that could be carried out in the normal way.  Relief grants should be employed for more essential work, such as the removal of dangerous corners.</P>
    <P>I take this opportunity of publicly thanking the Parliamentary Secretary for the intelligent and conscientious way in which he has conducted his office since his appointment.  I appreciate that he is aware of the needs of the nation as a whole and is anxious to do all the things that we ask him to do.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesHickey" hpid="Mr. Hickey Mr. Hickey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hickey</NameTxt>
      <P>There is a good deal of unreality about all that has been said for the past hour or so about the question of unemployment and employment schemes.  We all know that the Parliamentary Secretary would do what any of us are anxious to do, that is, to give all the employment that it is possible to give.  Deputies have said that they would like to see him getting more money and more power. Deputy Cowan wants local committees set up and more staff engaged.  I am satisfied that there is sufficient staff in the various Departments of State and in local government offices.  The only handicap is the lack of money to <Col N="635" /> carry out the schemes.  There is no good in trying to shirk any issue no matter how long we will be here.  It is a tragic thing to see thousands of young men and girls demanding work and anxious for work while food and clothing, furniture and all the things needed in life are there to be produced, and what is keeping us from producing them?  Is it not because we are devoid of the necessary powers to put men to work?  There is one thing we want to realise in this House, and I am not speaking in any Party fashion now, and it is this, that the only thing that gives value to money is when human labour is applied to material.  Deputies Cowan, Burke and myself could go down to-morrow morning and give a hatful of gold to the people on the plains of Kildare, but until you come to employ labour that gold will have no value.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We are listening here to talk about schemes that need to be done in this country.  Housing needs to be done and we want ships.  We badly want ships, and why are we not in a position to build the ships?  I have heard from time to time that for every man employed in shipbuilding we would employ ten other men on different activities, and why are we tied up there, then?  I could see myself in the labour exchanges in my own area when I go down there&mdash;and it is a tragic thing to see&mdash;able-bodied men willing to work.  I have seen those unemployed men cycling out eight and ten miles from the city on borrowed bicycles looking for work on the new scheme.  I say we should cut out all this cant and humbug about the question.  We want something to be done.  What is wanted to be done is that we want a Government in power and elected by the people to be in a position to see that money and credit are available for the work that is there and to produce the things that are demanded to be done.  I have listened to accusations here&mdash;not accusations but comments&mdash;from the Parliamentary Secretary that he is tied up by the Minister for Finance. Why, again, is the Minister for Finance tied up?  Is it not because we <Col N="636" /> are not in power?  Let us not be trying to deceive ourselves.  The reason is that we are not in power, and I think it is very appropriate that we should mention here what the Minister for Finance said on the 28th September, 1931, when he was then in opposition, I take it, and he was dealing with the bank rate and the banking system.</P>
    <Speaker pid="CormacBreslin" hpid="An Leas-Cheann Comhairle Cormac Breslin">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesHickey" hpid="Mr. Hickey Mr. Hickey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hickey</NameTxt>
      <P>I suggest that it is in order because we are dealing with the unemployed, employment schemes and the reason why we cannot get more money.  We are only giving here £658,000 under the Estimate of the Parliamentary Secretary for employment schemes.  That works out at about £26,000 per county in the relief of the unemployed and to do the things which Deputy Burke is anxious to see done and which I am anxious to see done.  Something has to be done which will help people who are without food, people who are without clothing or without houses.</P>
      <P>I read a statement in the paper the week before last, in the <i>Irish Times,</i> reporting a meeting at which the Lord Mayor of Dublin was present and Deputy Gallagher, who spoke here this evening and was talking about building all the fancy things.  I would prefer Deputy Gallagher to be more practical and to come down to the things that Deputy Burke has in mind. At that meeting it was stated by a responsible person, having got it from the medical officer of health, that there were 400 families in Dublin with six persons per family living in one room; and another gentleman said that there was never so much poverty in Dublin as at the present time.  Then we talk around in circles here, we pay tribute to the Parliamentary Secretary, as if the Parliamentary Secretary was responsible for not having more money. After all, the Parliamentary Secretary is just as keen as I am about having the power that is necessary to do the things that we want done.  When are we going to take it?  Here is what the present Minister for Finance said in 1931:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="637" />&ldquo;The first thing that strikes me is that the Oireachtas should be convened immediately and asked to pass an Act setting up a credit tribunal composed of representatives of employers and employees in the agricultural and manufacturing industries and requiring representatives of the Standing Committee of the Irish banks to attend before it and prove, before the present increase in the bank rate becomes effective, that it is inevitable and in the general economic interests of the country.  It would be a rather ironical thing if the bankers who have placed the whole savings of the community in jeopardy by their policy of the last few years were to claim that they were seeking to induce the people to entrust them again with their savings.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I seriously suggest now to the Minister for Finance and to every member of the Government and this House that the time is very appropriate now that we should have such a conference where we will have the Ministers of this country and of this House and give to the Government who are elected by the people the right to put our unemployed people to work.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Everett</NameTxt>
      <P>I have nothing to say against the Department of Works.  I appeal to them in connection with the improvement of harbours.  I know that speeches were made by the Minister that there was no money available.  I <Col N="639" /> am well aware that in connection with the Wicklow Harbour the Department engineers put up schemes to the Department of Industry and Commerce. The No. 2 scheme was unanimously approved by the harbour board, representative of all Parties. One of the schemes submitted for sanction by the Minister for Industry and Commerce was, in the opinion of the harbour board, not suitable for Wicklow.  They have appealed for the last three or four months to accept scheme No. 2 that was submitted by the Department of Works and their engineers.  If that scheme is approved, we believe it will be an improvement to the docks as the harbour is developing, big factories are there and a number of boats come in, often at the one time.  We have submitted the evidence to Industry and Commerce that it is necessary to have a scheme. The scheme submitted by the Department of Industry and Commerce for the approval of the harbour board would leave us in a worse position than we are at present, where there is only one berth, and if another boat comes in she has to remain outside while the first is being discharged. Over three months we have sent up a recommendation to the Department of Industry and Commerce, and up to the present, other than asking for further particulars, we have not had any definite reply.  I believe that if sanction were given to that scheme it would prove a very good thing, because it would improve and develop the harbour and it would provide more work for dockers.  It would encourage other people also to make greater use of the harbour, because it would be possible to obtain a quick discharge there.</P>
      <P>I appeal to the Parliamentary Secretary to use his influence on behalf of the Wicklow Harbour Board so that the scheme in question will be sanctioned and undertaken without delay. It is a scheme which is long overdue and, at the same time, it will provide much-needed employment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJKeyes" hpid="Mr. Keyes Mr. Keyes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keyes</NameTxt>
      <P>I must say that I was intrigued by the statements of Deputy Burke and I hope that I shall keep <Col N="640" /> strictly to procedure in referring to some of the points he made.</P>
      <P>I endorse his statement about more power for the Parliamentary Secretary. The Parliamentary Secretary really represents the Minister.  It is his policy that the Parliamentary Secretary has to operate and that is what either restricts or enables him to carry out the work.  I think that, in recent years, the tendency of the Board of Works has been somewhat to divest themselves of authority.  Minor employment schemes have practically disappeared and these have been replaced mainly, if at all, by rural improvement schemes.  It has been made more and more difficult for a local authority to get works done under minor employment schemes.  The system is that they are related to the unemployment content in the area in question, as disclosed by the labour exchange.  There must be a certain percentage of unemployed in the area which is covered by the employment exchange.  Sometimes it may be difficult to find a sufficient number of unemployed in a specific area, covered by an employment exchange, to work on a boreen or a byroad while, in an area immediately adjoining it, you would find a sufficiency of unemployed to come and do that work.  That is why it is usual for the Parliamentary Secretary who is responsible to say: &ldquo;You have not got a sufficient unemployment content in the area covered by the employment exchange and hence you cannot have a minor employment scheme, but it may be possible to have a rural improvement scheme.&rdquo;  Under a rural improvement scheme for, say, the improvement of a byroad, the procedure is that the people living along the byroad subscribe a certain percentage of the total cost&mdash;I think 25 per cent.&mdash; and then the work will be carried out.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Even if a rural improvement scheme is sanctioned, what is the position? We have a scheme for a place where the volume of unemployment has been shown to be not sufficient to justify a minor relief scheme and, hence, the people who contribute towards that scheme will have the first call on the road.  The point is that, in an adjoining area&mdash;which may be only a very short distance away but which is not <Col N="641" /> covered by the same employment exchange&mdash;there are sure to be unemployed people who would be glad of any work they could get.  I suggest, therefore, the restoration of minor employment schemes which will be carried out free, as they used to be, by grants, to help to relieve those men in rural areas who are unemployed and who are anxious to obtain employment. Rural improvement schemes are not a proper substitute for minor employment schemes.</P>
    <P>With the reduction of the work under the Local Authorities (Works) Act to a fifth of what it was, and with the wiping out of minor employment schemes, grave hardship is felt by certain sections of our people.  As I have said, rural improvement schemes are not an adequate substitute and the position is most unsatisfactory, because the unfortunate workers have no jobs. The trouble is that, all the time, there is plenty of work crying out to be done &mdash;work on boreens, on roads and work on roads into estates.  The Board of Works say that work on estates is a matter for the Land Commission and the Land Commission say that they will do it if the land is vested, but, between Herod and Pilate, the work still remains to be done and the people continue to be unemployed.</P>
    <P>Like Deputy Burke, I suggest that the powers available to the Parliamentary Secretary ought to be exploited. The Minister for Finance is responsible for the dictation of policy and, undoubtedly, works cannot be carried out without money being available. I believe that, with a loosening by the Minister for Finance of the purse strings and with a loosening of the tightening-up in the regulations which was made recently, a great deal of work could be accomplished.  I know that that is something which would give pleasure and satisfaction to the Parliamentary Secretary himself, as well as to the rest of us, and certainly it would greatly reduce the unemployment content in the rural areas.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickBeegan" hpid="Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Finance (Mr. Beegan) Patrick Beegan">
      <NameTxt>Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Finance (Mr. Beegan)</NameTxt>
      <P>A great deal has been mentioned about <Col N="642" /> the scarcity of money and the reduction in this Vote by £100,000.  I think that I explained at the outset why this reduction was made, and the sub-heads to which it applied.  These sub-heads are not administered, if you like, by my office or by the Special Employments Schemes Office; they are administered by other Departments, particularly by the Department of Local Government, and by local authorities.</P>
      <P>Everybody has called for more money, for further schemes, and so on. They say that they want much greater amenities and that the work is most desirable.  I agree that the work is very desirable, but unfortunately the question of payment comes into it.  It is grand to have amenities, facilities and comforts, but it is far grander to get the other fellow to pay for them.</P>
      <P>With regard to the £100,000 for urban employment schemes and rural employment schemes, a good deal of money has been made available by other Departments to carry out the schemes that, ordinarily, would be carried out in this way.</P>
      <P>A considerable amount of money has been made available from the Road Fund for the improvement of our roads and no mention has been made of that fact during this debate.  We have not heard about all the money that has been made available to the various county councils: they are handed over the whole Road Fund now.  Furthermore, the Road Fund has been increased as a result of the increase in motor taxation.  The people who were criticising the Government this evening &mdash; people such as Deputy Oliver Flanagan and other Deputies&mdash; were the very people who came into this House and objected to and voted against any increase in motor taxation.  If all the roads in Offaly, Laoighis, Westmeath, Galway and everywhere else are to be brought up to the standard of trunk roads&mdash; such as was implied in the speeches which have been made&mdash;then, undoubtedly, the money must come from somewhere.  We cannot have it both ways.  We have to agree to the increase in taxation for that purpose or else we cannot have the work done.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="643" /> Unemployment in Dublin was one of the matters which was mentioned most by Dublin Deputies, among other Deputies, in their speeches.  In fact, in some cases the position was somewhat misrepresented.  Deputy A. Byrne stated that no grant has yet been paid to the Dublin Corporation. That is true but, on the other hand, the corporation have been notified of the schemes which they were prepared to go on with and for which money would be made available.  In the latter part of his speech Deputy A. Byrne said that he knew that the Taoiseach's word was his bond and that the money would be made available.</P>
    <P>Deputy Gallagher and other Deputies mentioned schemes submitted to the Department of Local Government and amounting to £430,000.  Before anything can be done, and before the Special Employment Schemes Office knows where it is, the schemes must be vetted and approved by the Department of Local Government.  If they are approved I expect that, on the ratio mentioned, the Government will do their best to meet them, but it must be understood that the schemes must be approved.</P>
    <P>In my opinion, a number of the schemes that have been mentioned are not schemes to be undertaken by the Special Employment Schemes Office but are, rather, schemes which come within the province of the Corporation of Dublin.  I have in mind the clearing of derelict sites, the Blue Lagoon and so on.  I think that there is legislation which enables the Dublin Corporation &mdash;if they provide the money&mdash;to carry on with the work of the provision of cycle parks, car parks and so forth. That is not, nor should it be, a responsibility of the Special Employment Schemes Office.</P>
    <P>A good deal has been mentioned about the increase in unemployment, but, as Deputies know, this Employment and Emergency Schemes Office was set up for the purpose of dealing with people who were unemployed and in receipt of unemployment assistance, in the main.  It was set up to help them in a critical period of the year <Col N="644" /> and also, as I mentioned in my opening statement, to rehabilitate any of those who had had a long period of unemployment and to test their willingness to work.  The system has not been changed and consequently we have to deal with the situation in relation to the number on the unemployment assistance register in January of each year when the census is taken. This year, though it may be a surprise to many people, the unemployment assistance figures are not nearly as great as in previous years, and it was on that basis that the estimate for Dublin City and other urban centres was prepared.  Since then, a certain situation arose in the city and, as I explained in my opening statement, the Government gave authority to bring forward relief schemes which ordinarily would be carried out from mid-November to 1st March or mid-March, and also gave the corporation to understand that a sum that would bring it up to the normal expenditure in that period would be provided at a later stage.  We have not got the approved list of schemes and consequently I cannot say what that sum may be.</P>
    <P>To go back to the beginning of the Vote, Deputy Blowick and a number of other Deputies spoke on it and talked of this big reduction made in it by Fianna Fáil this year.  They mentioned the figure of some years ago, but altogether left out of consideration the fact that large sums of money which were provided in this Vote in other years had been transferred to other appropriate Departments.  If we take the money provided on the various schemes for the years from 1948 onwards, it will be found that the amount of money being provided this year will compare very favourably with the amount expended during the years 1948 to 1951.</P>

      <P>I am talking about the expenditure, which counts a good deal more than the provision made during the year.  If the Deputy had been nearly as emphatic in his protests against reduction of expenditure when the previous Government was in office, it is possible that a good deal more would have been done as regards bog development schemes, rural improvement schemes and minor employment schemes all over the country when there was definitely a cutting down on these bog development schemes.  The Estimate prepared by the Fianna Fáil Government in 1947 for 1948-49, so far as bog development schemes are concerned, was £90,000.  That was almost expended that year, but in the next year the provision made was reduced to £60,000 and it was again £60,000 in 1950-51.  Only when a fuel crisis threatened in respect of 1951-52 was it brought back to the figure of £90,000. I wish to inform the Deputy that the expenditure actually incurred on urban employment schemes, rural employment schemes, minor employment schemes, bog development schemes and miscellaneous schemes in 1948-49 was £611,700, and I might mention that in that year the Estimates were prepared by the Fianna Fáil Administration and operated by the inter-Party Government.  For the year 1949-50, the expenditure on all the schemes I have mentioned was £484,800 and for the year 1950-51, £486,200.  In the first year of the Fianna Fáil Administration in 1951-52, the expenditure was increased to £634,500 and in 1952-53 the expenditure was £724,600.</P>

      <P>Deputy Davin, Deputy Flanagan and various other Deputies are very interested in bog development schemes and they talked a great deal about the way in which the counties which produced turf during the emergency were treated.  They suggested that they were badly treated, but they were not badly treated by the Special Employment Schemes Office under the Fianna Fáil Administration, because the 1948-49 amount&mdash;an expenditure on a Fianna Fáil Estimate of £90,000&mdash;was not expended.  If anybody goes back to the Volume of Estimates, he will find that the figure was £90,000 of which £61,000 was expended.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In 1949-50, £66,100 was expended on bog development schemes and, in 1950-51, £56,400&mdash;a total of £183,500 in three years, or an average of £61,167 per year.  In 1951-52, the first year after Fianna Fáil took over, the year in which a Supplementary Estimate was brought in for bog development schemes, a sum of £135,000 was expended, £45,000 more than was in the Estimate prepared and submitted by the Coalition Government.  In 1952-53, the expenditure was £144,000, making a total of £279,000, or an average of £139,500 per year, which was more than twice as much as was spent on bog development schemes by the inter-Party Government in any of the years they were in office.  In 1948-49, the expenditure on minor employment schemes was £97,850; in 1949-50, £103,200, and in 1951, £91,700&mdash;a total of £292,750 or an average expenditure of £97,583.  In 1951-52, when Fianna Fáil took office&mdash;we were <Col N="647" /> operating on an Estimate made by the previous Government&mdash;the expenditure was £99,650.  In 1952-53, a sum of £123,000 was expended, giving a total of £222,650 or an average of £111,325 as compared with an average of £97,583 for the years that the Coalition Government which Deputy Davin supported was in office.</P>

      <P>In 1951-52, a sum of £150,700 was expended on rural improvement schemes, and in 1952-53, a sum of £191,000, giving a total of £341,700 or an average of £170,000 per year as compared with the average of £90,717 in the previous years.  Then we are told of the big reduction in expenditure on all the very important schemes on which money could be so usefully expended.  This year, so far as rural improvement schemes are concerned, we have made provision for an expenditure of £175,500, and we are proposing to introduce a Supplementary Estimate of £50,000.  I think that is very satisfactory.  I do not know if all that money will be expended, but I believe the greater part of it will, because the rural improvements scheme is a very popular scheme.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It was suggested by Deputy Blowick that there should be a further cutting down as regards local contributions. He said that even the 5 per cent. in many instances was a heavy burden to expect beneficiaries to pay.  I do not agree at all with Deputy Blowick that it is very nearly as well to give the full cost as to give £95 for £5.  If there is a townland or a village where the <Col N="648" /> people are not willing to pay £5 for £95, even though they are under the £6 valuation limit, I think they want jam on both sides.  To be quite honest, I do not believe that people in any part of the country are reduced to such a state of penury or poverty that they would not be able to contribute at least £5 for every £95 they get from the State for carrying out a very useful scheme.</P>
    <P>He suggested also, and it has been mentioned by several other speakers, that we should &ldquo;soften off&rdquo; with minor employment schemes.  In other words, he mentioned that under the present regulations there must be a certain number in each gang, and he and other Deputies suggested that we should regulate the matter in such a way that we would take in men from other electoral divisions or else go ahead with a small gang.  Of course, a small gang would mean the same amount of supervision as a fairly large sized gang, and consequently a larger portion of the expenditure would go into the pockets of the gangers and engineers and would not reach the people for whom it was intended.  If we took it on the basis of taking people from adjoining electoral divisions in order to form a gang, adjoining electoral divisions could be north, south, east or west of that in which the work was being carried out.  From which of them would we take these men?  That is the difficulty.</P>
    <P>Deputy O. Flanagan and a number of other Deputies suggested that there should be no such thing as an unemployment register at all.  Deputy Flanagan said that there are many of our people who are too proud, because of their traditions, to go to a labour exchange to register.  I do not believe that at all.  I do not believe that there is 1 per cent. or even ½ per cent. of the unemployed people of this country who keep away from an employment exchange for that or any other reason. If there were no registration, I wonder what Deputy Flanagan's criticisms in this House would be like?  He would tell you that people were being selected for work from the Fianna Fáil clubs.  He would say that people were being selected on a political basis and <Col N="649" /> because of their political affiliations. There would be no criterion at all in existence, if people were not obliged to register as genuine unemployed. Everyone who pleased could come forward for work and then where would we find money to provide for all of this?  It would be a very difficult thing to do and furthermore it would not be at all a fair system.  I think the introduction of this system of registration for employment on public works schemes of all kinds, marked a great step forward, because it removed the administration of these schemes from the atmosphere which had existed hitherto&mdash;an atmosphere of political suspicion and doubt that those who were getting employment, whether they deserved it or not, were getting it because of the influence they could exercise with a Deputy, a county councillor or somebody else who was a member of the Party responsible for the Government at the time.</P>
    <P>I would like to be as sympathetic as possible with the ideas expressed by Deputy Blowick, but some of them were indeed very far-fetched.  He talked about roads into bogs and said that even if the bogs were cut away in a few years' time nevertheless the money should be expended as it would be very useful for the Forestry Department to have good roads there when they would take over these cutaway bogs for reafforestation.  I wonder if, when he was responsible for the Land Commission and the Forestry Department, he insisted that in the areas which were in their hands they should spend large sums of money in developing bogs which are not even yet vested in the tenants?  He had to take the same thing into consideration just as well as I have in regard to all these matters.</P>
    <P>Deputy Browne suggested that county councils should be permitted to pay local contributions towards the cost of rural improvement schemes. The county councils have, under recent legislation, adequate powers where they consider a road to be of sufficient public utility to take it over, repair it and maintain it.  Rural improvement schemes are confined to roads which serve two or more people and which <Col N="650" /> perhaps would not be taken over by a local authority at any time.  Therefore, in my opinion, it is better that they should be restricted to roads to which rural improvement schemes were intended to apply rather than to have a contribution from county councils.  I do not believe there is a county council which would be so generous in regard to that.  There would be a lot of selection and examination if a county council were to go into the matter. The county council, of course, would want to have the roads brought up to county council standards.  They might want to have a 25-feet carriage-way. If we were to have anything like that introduced it would delay many of the very worth-while schemes that could be proceeded with if that kind of thing were not introduced.  In my opinion, it cannot be introduced because it will only hold up the work.</P>
    <P>The Deputy also mentioned cases where persons living along roads have to contribute towards the cost although other people have to travel on these roads to get to their turbary plots.  In all cases of that kind the Special Employment Schemes Office take into consideration the number of other people who use a road that leads to a bog and they scale down the contribution very considerably for the people who are directly concerned.  I think that everybody has experience of that, particularly in the counties where rural improvement schemes are being carried out to any great extent.</P>
    <P>Deputy Palmer spoke about a continuation of uncompleted works.  It has been the general practice in making allocations to take cognisance of uncompleted works, based, of course, on the report of the local inspector.  If he reports that a work has been uncompleted and that it is necessary to get a further grant for the carrying out of that work, I would say that in nearly 99 cases out of a 100 his recommendation is accepted in the office.</P>
    <P>The Deputy also referred to the efficiency of workmen employed on minor employment schemes.  In fact, he stated that some of them were very inefficient.  I do not know what he had in mind when he made that statement, <Col N="651" /> but I do know that the Special Employment Schemes Office have no evidence to suggest that the standard or output of the men employed on minor employment schemes in Kerry is below that which would be required on other work of a similar type.  It is the aim of the officials in charge of these schemes that the standard of efficiency should not be less than on other work of the same kind.  If the Deputy is aware of specific instances in which the output of workmen appears to have been insufficient, the office would be glad to be furnished with the particulars and I guarantee that they will be examined and investigated.</P>
    <P>Mention was also made of hardship due to the exclusion of works such as bridges that serve one family.  Rural improvement schemes are intended for two or more families and not for one family, and I think there is ample provision made by another Department for carrying out work where only one family is concerned as far as the erection of a bridge or the making or repairing of a road or avenue is concerned. Certainly it does not appear to me that there should be any change made whereby the Special Employment Schemes Office could carry out rural improvement schemes where only one person is concerned.</P>
    <P>Deputy Palmer on the one side and Deputy Flynn on the other side, speaking for the County Kerry, referred to the appointment of gangers. I am not going to be embroiled in any local Party politics in County Kerry.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickBeegan" hpid="Mr. Beegan Mr. Beegan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Beegan</NameTxt>
      <P>But for the benefit of Deputies I should like to mention that in a number of counties the Special Employment Schemes Office took over in recent years the administration of rural improvement schemes, minor employment schemes and bog development schemes.  As is well known to Deputies, these schemes were administered previously by the various county councils and their staffs.  When they were being taken over&mdash;my own county <Col N="652" /> was one of the first&mdash;the director of the Special Employment Schemes Office notified his staff that they were to get in touch with the county engineer and find out if he could recommend a number of gangers who had experience of that particular type of work.  That was done in County Galway and also in County Kerry, County Clare, County Roscommon, County Mayo and, I think, the North Riding of Tipperary.  On the recommendation, in the main, of the county engineers or their assistants who had experience of supervising the work the gangers were recruited.  I do not think there has been any change since then or that there have been any dismissals except in cases of glaring inefficiency, and I think they are very few and far between.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Palmer also suggested that the beneficiaries should be allowed to appoint the gangers on rural improvement schemes.  The office has never accepted that the beneficiaries should be allowed to have anything to do with the appointment of gangers or have the appointment of their own gangers and I hold with the view of the office in regard to that.  I believe it is better, if it is possible to find an experienced man, to bring in a man from a distance rather than to have any of the beneficiaries given the supervision of a rural improvement scheme.  In fact, I am always in favour, if it is possible&mdash; in some cases it is not&mdash;of bringing a man from a distance of five miles, because I have long experience of gangs of men and of work being carried out by the Congested Districts Board, the Estates Commissioners, the Land Commission and other Departments. It is a case of familiarity breeding contempt in many instances. The local man might be the very best man for the job and carry it out with great skill, but, at the same time, very often there is a certain amount of resentment and, perhaps, a good deal of abuse if he asserts his authority to see there is discipline and that the work is being carried out properly. For that reason, I am all in favour of bringing the ganger over a certain distance.  I do not believe in having a ganger <Col N="653" /> employed within one, two or three miles of where he resides.  It is a good rule, where it can be applied, to bring them from outside the five mile limit, the limit prescribed so far as it is possible to be observed by the Special Employment Schemes Office.</P>
    <P>I explained how the gangers were recruited in the first instance.  I have stated that in my opinion 99 per cent. of them have given satisfactory service and, perhaps, even a higher percentage than that.  Any other gangers that are required are being recruited. The instructions to the local inspectors in all cases are that preference should be given to persons who have previously been employed on similar schemes and who have given proof of their competence and trustworthiness. Where a suitable ganger with previous experience is not available, preference is given to any suitable person submitted by the employment exchange, and if no suitable person is available from that source, the inspector is free to appoint the most suitable and competent person available from any other source provided that (1)  if there are two or more equally competent and suitable persons, preference will be given to the person who appears to be in the most necessitous circumstances; (2)  other things being equal, Irish-speaking gangers are given preference, particularly in the Gaeltacht; and (3)  favourable consideration is given to demobilised members of the Defence Forces.</P>
    <P>That is the system by which the gangers are recruited, and I think it is a very fair system with which nobody can find fault.  If any cases are brought to my notice of a ganger showing favour or trying to show favour or discriminating as between one person and another, I can tell you that I will have that investigated by the director and his staff.  It will get a very thorough investigation, too.</P>
    <P>Deputy Murphy of West Cork said that we were sending out notices more frequently now than in the past informing people that the work applied for was not suitable and did not justify an expenditure of public funds.  We are not doing any such thing.  There is no truth in the suggestion. <Col N="654" /> It is an exaggeration.  The office judge a scheme on its own merits and, where a letter is issued, it may be taken that the office consider the scheme to be uneconomic in itself and that they would not be prepared to carry it out in any circumstances.</P>
    <P>In regard to the rural improvement schemes, it was mentioned, I think, by Deputy Murphy, that contributions in kind should be accepted.  He suggested materials and free labour.  That would be impracticable because you could not compel beneficiaries to provide free labour.  If eight people turned up one morning for that particular day's work it might happen that there would be only five of them the next morning. You could have no proper system of carrying on the work if you were to have it on that basis.</P>
    <P>So far as materials are concerned, it has often been suggested to me in my own constituency that there was suitable material quite close to a particular road and that it was waste of money to transport material over a long distance.  The inspector takes all that into consideration.  In the first instance, he takes into consideration the type of material he requires for the particular road.  He wants to have a particular kind of gravel for that road which is not, perhaps, the type of gravel that is convenient.  In the second place, he often finds it is much more economic to get contractors to bring that gravel over a distance and dump it on the road than employ the men who would ordinarily be on the job working under a ganger, to employ them in a pit even if it was only 300 yards away from where the scheme was located because, when material is brought by a contractor, he has to supply his own men and lorry. He brings the material and dumps it on the road.  In that instance, the ganger has constant supervision over all his gang on the road, while, if he had them in two different places, he could not supervise them all at the one time.  There would be divided supervision in that case.  That is another reason why sometimes, even although it would not be free and even were it free, it would be cheaper in the long run to bring the gravel from a <Col N="655" /> distance and get a contractor to take it there by lorry.</P>
    <P>Deputy Murphy also mentioned that it would be most desirable, where minor relief schemes are carried out, to have it on a rotational basis.  The rotational basis was in operation here for a number of years and there were very strong criticisms of that scheme. It was altered and I think that the alteration has proved much more satisfactory than the rotational system.  The giving of three days to one set of men and knocking them off and then giving three days to another is, in my opinion, not satisfactory.  It is better, anyhow, to give them one week.</P>
    <P>That was the viewpoint of my predecessors when they changed it and I do not propose to go back to the rotational system.  I should like Deputy Murphy to bear in mind that if a scheme is likely to continue for a relatively long period it is provided that the gangs should be changed at the end of each period of six weeks.  That is about the best we can do.  I think that would be more satisfactory than having the old system that was so much criticised in this House.</P>
    <P>It was mentioned in many instances useful schemes had been held up because of the fact that you meet an individual who is not willing to sign the consent form.  It has been suggested that compulsory powers should be taken in that case.  We find so many areas where there are no difficulties of that kind whatsoever and no objection that it is much better to go on with the limited amount of money we have at our disposal and carry out the schemes for which we can get the consent voluntarily and without objection than to recommend to the Government &mdash;I doubt if this or any other Government would do it&mdash;to have compulsory powers brought into existence in order to compel people to surrender what to them, perhaps, may appear a right.</P>
    <P>In connection with works of this kind, you may find that a landholder, whose land has to be encroached on for the widening of a road or something of that kind, will object, and, perhaps, would have a right to do so. <Col N="656" /> We find that, in nearly all these cases, if some of the local people interested approach the person who is objecting&mdash;his objection may be due to some petty local jealousy&mdash;and talk to him in a reasonable way very often he will prove amenable and will agree to sign the consent form.  But, whether the consent form is signed or not, if the widening of a road means that an objector's land has not to be encroached upon, that does not mean that the work is held up.  Our people go on with the work whether the person signs the consent form or not.</P>
    <P>Deputy Flynn of Kerry wants me to proceed with the rural improvement schemes.  We are proceeding with them as rapidly as we can all over the country.  We have a huge number of applications.  In some instances the local contribution has been forwarded. At any rate, when we get the amount of money provided for in the Estimate to cover these and other approved schemes, even those for which the local contribution has not yet come to hand, there will be no delay whatever in proceeding with them.  I may say that there has not been any delay.</P>
    <P>There were a great number of matters mentioned by other Deputies. Many of them were not relevant to this Vote but were concerned with other Departments.  Deputy O. Flanagan, as usual, painted a very doleful picture of the country, particularly of his own constituency and of the country in general.  He talked about the amount of poverty that existed and said that nothing was being done.  He also talked about the huge amount of unemployment in Laois-Offaly.  I can hardly understand how there can be unemployment there.  There may be some unemployment in the towns.  In Offaly, there are not very big towns, except Tullamore.  It is a fairly large sized town, but I should point out that a big number of works are being carried out in that area.  I do not think that the Brosna drainage scheme has been fully completed.  I also know that Bord na Móna are carrying out some very big schemes there.  I cannot understand, therefore, how, in these circumstances, local people can be unemployed in view of the fact that <Col N="657" /> people are coming up from other counties to Offaly, Laois and Kildare to work with Bord na Móna.  It may be that you have a type of people there for whom employment cannot be found under the Special Employment Schemes Office.  I am referring to craftsmen and people of that kind who, as a result of the machine age, are now unable to procure suitable employment. I do not know of any other type of men, willing to work, who would not be able to find employment with Bord na Móna.  I am almost certain that Bord na Móna would be inclined to give preference to local people rather than to outsiders from Galway, Mayo, Clare and elsewhere who are going up there.  I have already dealt with the question the Deputy raised about the condition of the roads in the turfproducing counties.  I think that a good deal has been done about that.</P>
    <P>Deputy Davin said that I could not justify the reduction of £100,000 in the Estimate.  I think I indicated in my opening statement the reasons for the reduction, and pointed out that there was really no reduction in expenditure nor is there likely to be.  Deputy Cowan spoke about a considerable amount of overlapping by Departments in the carrying out of schemes.  Perhaps that is so, but it is something that I have no control over.  I am responsible only for the work done by the Special Employment Schemes Office.  Deputy Hickey spoke about more money being required and said it was the financial system that was responsible for the present position. Well, I am not competent to go into that question.  I am not a financial expert or wizard.</P>

      <P>I cannot understand Deputy Keyes making the statement that the minor employment schemes <Col N="658" /> have almost disappeared.  I do not think they have, and the figures which I gave to the House show that we spent as much money on them last year as in any previous year.  There has been no cutting down in the provision for minor employment schemes this year.  The figure is the same in this year's Estimate as it was in last year's, namely £120,000.  The Deputy also mentioned something about old cranks not agreeing to make a contribution to rural improvement schemes. I know you will find such people, but I do not think there are very many of them.  The fact, at any rate, is that we have enough schemes to absorb all the money that we have and even more money than we are getting, schemes in respect of which there is no objection by anybody.  In fact, the people are only too delighted to help.  As an instance of how anxious people are to help, I know of cases of this kind occurring.  You have perhaps three, four or five individuals in poor areas living a big distance in from a road to be improved willing to make a contribution, while the people living nearer to the road were reluctant to do so.  I have known individuals, not well off by any means and living a greater distance in from the road, putting up as much as £43 and £45, while the others, nearer to the road, just put up £15 or £20 between them. You have that spirit as well as the old crank spirit.  It is an indication of what people are prepared to do in connection with these schemes.</P>
      <P>I think that, as far as this Vote is concerned, the Special Employment Schemes Office was well worthy of the compliments that were paid to it by many of the Deputies who spoke in this debate.  I have explained the position as best I could.  I explained it fully and did not conceal anything, and I ask the House to give me this Vote.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>That a sum not exceeding <Col N="659" /> £2,478,510 be granted to complete the sum necessary to defray the Charge which will come in the course of payment during the year ending on the 31st day of March, 1954, for the Salaries and Expenses of the Office of the Minister for Industry and Commerce, including certain Services administered by that Office, and for payment of certain Subsides and sundry Grants-in-Aid.</P>
    <P>The Estimate for the Department of Industry and Commerce this year, amounting to £7,416,510, shows a decrease of £2,286,670 as compared with the Estimate for last year.  The majority of the sub-heads show a decrease but the principal decrease is, of course, that in respect of food subsidies which is down by £2,149,000. There are substantial increases necessary in respect of two items: one, the payment to the Central Fund of advances made for rural electrification, and the other, in respect of fuel subsidies.</P>
    <P>I will deal more fully with the position of our fuel stocks later and indicate my attitude with regard to them.  The repayment of advances to the Central Fund in respect of rural electrification is likely to increase further in subsequent years because of the anticipated speeding up in the rural electrification programme.</P>
    <P>There are two new sub-heads in the Estimate, first, sub-head V, which provides for the expenses of the Fair Trade Commission.  The Restrictive Trade Practices Act was passed in the present year and the Fair Trade Commission was established and began its functioning subsequent to the preparation of the Book of Estimates.  However, provision was made when preparing the Estimate for the Department, for the expenses of the commission. The other sub-head is sub-head W, which provides grants towards the cost of technical assistance projects.  Technical assistance projects were financed from a separate Vote last year but this year the amount provided for technical assistance projects is set out under sub-head W.</P>
    <P>These technical assistance projects <Col N="660" /> are intended to provide for the employment of competent technical experts in particular industries and the money requested in the sub-head is required to enable the Government to make a contribution towards the cost of the employment of these experts.  There were various technical assistance schemes of that kind financed in the past under the E.C.A. scheme but now that that scheme has wound up, if the projects are to be continued&mdash;and our experience of their operation would justify the decision to continue them at least to some extent&mdash;the money must be found from our own resources or at least from the resources of the particular industries concerned, supplemented, where necessary, by State subventions.</P>
    <P>The custom is, on the occasion of the introduction of the annual Estimate, for the Department to give a general review of the state of trade and of the outcome of various measures in operation to stimulate industrial development and other desirable changes.  The fact that the Estimate is being introduced so late in the present year rather requires some departure from that practice because a review of the state of trade in the previous financial year would be rather inappropriate now. But in a general way I propose to indicate how things developed during that year and what changes have taken place in the meantime.</P>
    <P>The trade recession which we discussed here with so much concern last year passed during the course of the year.  The industries which were most directly affected, the textile industries and the leather and footwear industries, were back into full production before the year ended; in fact the change in conditions affecting these trades came so suddenly that the industries were frequently unable to meet the orders which they were receiving in any reasonable time and some special import facilities had to be allowed as a temporary measure to avoid difficulties in unemployment in industries using their products.  The inability of textile firms to deliver promptly all the cloth required by clothing manufacturers might have caused difficulty for the clothing trade <Col N="661" /> if these special facilities had not been allowed.  Somewhat similar conditions arose, although less acutely, in the leather trade.  That was due to the fact that many firms, being uncertain about the trend of prices, had allowed their stocks to run down to the point that when the revival in consumer demand took place they were unable to expand their output accordingly.</P>
    <P>The improvement in the balance of trade position which was also noticeable last year was to some extent attributable to the same circumstances as had produced that recession in our textile and leather trades, the desire of manufacturers and traders to keep their stocks at a minimum. With the revival in business which has brought these new orders to the textile and other firms concerned, so also some expansion of imports of similar goods was recorded.</P>

      <P>Before Section 4, but in Part I, to insert a new section as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>From and after the passing of this Act:&mdash;</P>
      <P>(a)  The Supreme Court shall be styled and known as &ldquo;An Chúirt Uachtarach&rdquo;;</P>
      <P>(b)  The High Court shall be styled and known as &ldquo;An Ard-Chúirt&rdquo;;</P>

      <P>(f)  The President of the High Court shall be styled and known as &ldquo;Uachtarán na hArd-Chúirte&rdquo; and shall be addressed as &ldquo;A Bhreithimh&rdquo;;</P>
      <P>(g)  Every judge of the Supreme Court, of the High Court and of the Circuit Court shall be styled and known as &ldquo;Breitheamh&rdquo; and shall be addressed as &ldquo;A Bhreithimh&rdquo;;</P>
      <P>(h)  Every justice of the District Court shall be styled and known as &ldquo;Breitheamh&rdquo; and shall be addressed as &ldquo;A Bhreithimh&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This is a comprehensive amendment, but it is a simple one.  Its purpose is to bring the courts into line with the general national tendency towards the use of the Irish language where practicable <Col N="663" /> and possible.  In our State institutions generally there has been a development over the past 30 years whereby the holders of important offices would be known by the Irish title and would be addressed in the Irish form.</P>
    <P>Since the establishment of the State, even in this House the office of Chairman of the Dáil has been styled Ceann Comhairle, and has been known and accepted as such over the years. Similarly, the Vice-Chairman is known as Leas-Cheann Comhairle.  Those two titles have become so popular that no one would think of addressing the occupants of those offices by any other than their official Irish style and title. The President of the State is known as An tUachtarán; he is referred to as such in official correspondence, and he is properly so addressed.  The head of the Government or Prime Minister is known as the Taoiseach.  Everybody refers to him as the Taoiseach, and there is no difficulty whatsoever in regard to the pronunciation or the meaning of the term.  Similarly, the second principal Minister in the Government is known as the Tánaiste.</P>
    <P>Many other terms have been popularised over the years.  Our road transport service is known as Córas Iompair Eireann and no one finds any difficulty either in regard to pronunciation or the meaning of the term.  Similarly, our airlines are known as Aer Lingus. We have very many boards established in the State which are known generally by the Irish titles.</P>
    <P>The proposition in this amendment is that this national development should be continued and brought into our courts of justice, that our different courts should be known by the Irish form.  It is quite a simple form and there is no difficulty whatsoever as to the meaning or the pronunciation.  It would require only a short period to familiarise the Press, the public and litigants generally with the Irish style and title.</P>
    <P>The second part of the amendment relates to the form of address by which judges would be addressed in court. That has been a slight problem for quite a long time.  It is proposed in <Col N="664" /> the amendment to address the judges in court as &ldquo;A Bhreithimh&rdquo;, the Irish title of judge.  It is proposed for simplification that that term should be used for judges of the Supreme Court, the High Court and the Circuit Court, and for justices of the District Court. I think a uniform style of address would be welcomed by everybody.  The House will agree that it would be preferable to address a judge in that way in the Irish form than to follow the system which has been brought in and developed from a foreign system.</P>
    <P>When the first Courts of Justice Act was passed in 1924, the problem was before the Dáil.  There were two sections which dealt specifically with it&mdash; Sections 10 and 18&mdash;which gave to the rule-making authorities for the High Court and the Circuit Court power to determine the title by which judges would be addressed in court.  Under the rules they made for the High Court, a judge would be addressed, according to the phrase they adopted in the rules, &ldquo;in the form hitherto adopted&rdquo;.  In other words, even the rule-making authority at the time was a bit dubious about putting into the rules, which would come before the Dáil, the expressions &ldquo;My Lord&rdquo; and &ldquo;Your Lordship&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>They got over it simply by saying that judges would be addressed &ldquo;in the form that was hitherto in use, or in the Irish form, &lsquo;A Thiarna Bhreithimh&rsquo;&rdquo;.  Now, if one examines that term, &ldquo;A Thiarna Bhreithimh&rdquo;&mdash;Lord Judge&mdash;it is not a term that one would consider appropriate.  I do not think anyone would consider that the dignity of the Bench would be in any way lowered if that particular form of words was not used.  Similarly in regard to the Circuit Court.  Recent rules of court provided that a judge could be addressed as &ldquo;My Lord&rdquo;, &ldquo;Your Lordship&rdquo;, or in the Irish form, &ldquo;A Thiarna Bhreithimh&rdquo;.  Certainly this Parliament in 1924 would not have passed that form of address as what I might term the Republican outlook and feeling and the Republican conception of forms of address could not possibly justify that archaic system of address which on its face is absolutely nonsensical.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="665" /> It is proposed in this amendment to bring the Courts of Justice in line with other State institutions by the encouragement of the use of Irish terms so far as they can be encouraged, and the use as forms of address of a simple Irish term which, as far as I can gather from my reading, was the form by which the old Irish Brehon judges were addressed.  I think every member of this House would be anxious that the respectful form of address which was used in old Ireland to our judges should be the respectful form of address that would be used now by our counsel and advocates generally and by the public generally to our judges.  I think that the term which I advocate in this particular amendment is more dignified and more proper than that in use, and I recommend the amendment on those grounds to the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMcQuillan" hpid="Mr. McQuillan Mr. McQuillan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McQuillan</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to say that this is something that quite a number of Deputies have shown interest in from time to time, and I would like to congratulate Captain Cowan on going to the trouble of preparing such an amendment as this.  I would simply like to say I am in complete agreement with him that it was a wrong thing to have the titles used in our courts taken over as they were from an alien Government.  The least we might have done in this House was to ensure that a clean sweep would be made on the titles in our law courts. I have on numerous occasions expressed dissatisfaction at the titles used in the various courts, District Court, Circuit Court and High Court, and perhaps I would go further than Deputy Cowan in connection with this amendment.</P>
      <P>He is anxious, and rightly so, that our courts be brought into line with other State bodies where Irish titles are now in use, and nobody for a moment would dream of addressing the Ceann Comhairle, for instance, as &ldquo;Chairman&rdquo;.  We all prefer the title of Ceann Comhairle, and I see no reason in the world why Irish titles could not be used in our courts.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Perhaps there are individuals who say that the choice or the liberty <Col N="666" /> should be left to the individual to say either &ldquo;A Bhreithimh&rdquo; or in plain language &ldquo;Sir&rdquo; or &ldquo;Judge&rdquo;.  I believe that as far as judges and justices are concerned what everybody must show is respect.  It is for the office that the individual holds that we have respect, and I have always been taught that &ldquo;Sir&rdquo; is a form in an address of respect.  The highest officer in the Army, whether Chief of Staff or ordinary second lieutenant, is addressed as &ldquo;Sir&rdquo;, and there is no grading up along the line.  Even if he is wearing a line of stars he is not given any other title when addressed by a junior officer or soldier other than &ldquo;Sir&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>As far as the amendment is concerned I think Deputy Cowan is on the right lines.  There might be a lot of difficulty if we had to introduce the use of &ldquo;Sir&rdquo; in courts, and it is a nicer thing to utilise the Irish expression if everybody would use it.</P>
    <P>On this question of titles of respect in courts we could learn something from other countries and from their outlook on the matter.  The only country where there is real pomp and ceremony in connection with the law courts is our next-door neighbour and if we go back on history we will see that they had very good reasons to have these forms and titles and also to have the impressive peacock dress so that the unfortunate aborigines and the so-alleged uncultured savage people would have respect for their lords and masters.  That is really very briefly how all the trappings arose in the British system and how the address that is used in our courts to-day came into operation in the beginning.  I think it would be no harm to get rid of some of the trappings here and in view of the fact that Deputy Cowan has taken this line I think he should and will get the support of the House in pressing on the Minister at this stage to accept this amendment which is well overdue.</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>My attitude to the amendment is that I have a great deal of sympathy with it.  Naturally I would like the Irish terms to be used in the courts and the judges to be addressed by their Irish titles and the courts to <Col N="667" /> be called by their Irish names.  The way I feel about it is that this particular Bill was brought in for two purposes, to increase the salaries of the judges thereby compensating for the reduced purchasing power of money and restoring the status quo so far as jurisdiction is concerned.  I think an amendment of this kind would be more appropriate on another Bill, which will be introduced shortly, to formally establish our courts under the Constitution. A Bill of that nature is due in a couple of months and I think it would be better if Deputy Cowan would withdraw this amendment and put it down again when that Bill is being considered by the House.  The Bill is almost ready.</P>
      <P>There are certain amendments tabled here which would so widen the scope of this measure as to completely change its character.  If we open the door even a little we shall have to open it altogether.  I shall do my best to get the House to agree not to widen the scope of this Bill more than is absolutely necessary because I think it should be confined to the two principles underlying it.  The other questions can be considered at some other time.  This particular amendment of Deputy Cowan's can be dealt with at a later stage.</P>
      <P>It is the Government's intention to set up a committee or a commission to consider the whole question of the courts.  I am not asking Deputy Cowan to wait until the report of that body is available.  I am merely asking him to wait until the Bill dealing with the formal establishment of our courts under the Constitution is introduced here.  I do not want to be taken for one moment as opposing this amendment, because I am altogether in favour of having Irish terms used in our courts but, as I say, I do not think that can be done under this Bill.</P>

      <NameTxt>Captain Cowan</NameTxt>
      <P>I would have liked to have had some more views from the House in regard to this matter.  I appreciate what the Minister has said. He has stated that he is in sympathy with the idea of the extension of Irish terms and Irish forms of address to <Col N="668" /> our courts.  I am glad to know that when the proposed measure comes before the House that matter will be dealt with; it certainly would have been much better if we did not have to do it by legislation at all.  It would be better if the people concerned, who have the power under the rules which they are empowered by statute to make, would advance with the times. In the course of my professional business I have to go into court day after day and address a judge, for whom I and my colleagues have the greatest respect, as &ldquo;My Lord&rdquo;.  I have never considered that an appropriate form of address.  I think it is ridiculous.  I cannot for the life of me understand why judges in 1953 would wish to be addressed in such a nonsensical and archaic fashion.  They, however, have decided that they must be so addressed under the powers given them by statute.  I had one experience where, inadvertently, I addressed a judge as &ldquo;Sir&rdquo; and I was taken to task for doing so.  I do not think it adds to the dignity of our courts that we should have these archaic forms of address.  I know that the public would welcome the elimination of what is a ridiculous form of snobbery.  I am so anxious to get this eliminated on the first opportunity I put down this amendment and I am, in fact, somewhat disappointed that we cannot have a decision of the House on it now, but I am prepared to accept the Minister's statement that he will bring in this Bill in the very near future.</P>

In those circumstances, I am prepared to withdraw the amendment on the specific undertaking from the Minister that a Bill will be introduced in the near future in relation to which this matter can be dealt with more appropriately than on the present measure.  Meanwhile, I hope that what has been said here will have the effect of awakening the rule-making authorities to the fact that this form of address is neither welcomed nor approved by the general public, by <Col N="669" /> legal practitioners or by Parliament. They should themselves take early steps to eliminate it.  I am anxious that this Bill should become law as quickly as possible and, on the Minister's undertaking to the House, I am prepared to withdraw the amendment.</P>

      <NameTxt>Captain Cowan</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 3:&mdash;</P>
      <P>Before Section 4, but in Part I, to insert a new section as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>All courts shall normally sit at 10 a.m. and shall, where the business so warrants, continue until 5 p.m. with a break for refreshment from 1 p.m. to 2 p.m., but by agreement of the parties and, in the case of a criminal proceeding, with the consent of the accused, the court may sit after 5 p.m.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This covers somewhat more difficult ground.  The purpose of the amendment is to provide that the courts will sit for longer hours and, therefore, so more work.  Everyone knows that our High Court is at present cluttered up with work.  Jury cases are in a scandalous state of arrear.  Plaintiffs and litigants have been deprived of rights because their cases are not disposed of within a reasonable period.  Possibly the present practice has carried over from feudal times.  I did not have time to study far back enough to discover the beginning of all this, but the practice certainly goes back a long way to the days when judges sat at 11 o'clock in the morning, had a break of three-quarters of an hour or an hour for lunch and rose at 4 o'clock.  Judges agreed to work four and a quarter or four hours a day for five days in the week.  In modern times it is impossible for the business of the court to be <Col N="670" /> expeditiously dealt with when our courts sit for so few hours in the year.</P>
    <P>The courts sit for only a few hours on four or five days a week and there are very long vacations.  For two solid months, August and September, the courts are almost entirely closed down. There are other periods of vacation. That practice arose in times when the position of the judge was, to some extent, incidental.  It was a break in the pleasures of the year, a break with hunting, fishing and shooting.  These games, amusements and sports could not be interfered with too much and the sittings of the court were arranged accordingly.</P>
    <P>Every practitioner knows that the business of the courts cannot be dealt with expeditiously while so few hours are worked by the judges.  It would be interesting for the House to have figures from the Minister as to the annual number of hours our principal judges sit.  It would come as a shock and a revelation to the general public.</P>
    <P>I see no reason why our courts cannot start at 10 a.m.  In that I am supported by many practitioners who function in the courts.  There should be no reason why District Courts, in Dublin and the other cities and towns, should not start work at 10 a.m. and, with a reasonable break for lunch, continue until 5 p.m.  Anyone who has any experience as a practitioner or as a yaryman in the High Court will find that a court scheduled to start at 11 a.m., will barely get down to business much before 12 o'clock.  The court rises at 1 o'clock, having heard the opening addresses of counsel, and resumes at 2 or 2.15 p.m.; a few witnesses are examined and crossexamined and the court adjourns at 4 p.m.</P>
    <P>If law was paid for by the State and practitioners were paid for by the State, perhaps it would not matter, but most of the litigation has to be paid for by the citizens.  Under this system a case which might reasonably be expected to conclude in a day continues for a second day, doubling the costs on the unfortunate litigant who happens to be a party to the action</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="671" /> On that statement of the case every person, certainly every Deputy, would be expected to support longer hours for the courts but there are objections raised.  It is significant, not only in regard to this particular measure or this particular reform that is advocated, but in regard to any reform wherever it may be that, once a reform is suggested, an amazing number of objections can be invented, objections that were not thought of when the original idea was adopted.  In the old days there was a difficulty about getting to courts.  Transport was slow. One had to depend on the old horse and car.  In those days it was not unreasonable that the courts would sit at 11 a.m.  Now we have the most rapid forms of transport.  Motor cars can bring witnesses and other parties from many parts of the country in a very short time.  Yet the idea is still advocated that some person who has to cycle ten miles to a district court could not reasonably be expected to be there before 11 a.m.  He can be reasonably expected to be at his work, which involves cycling the same distance, at 8 a.m.  I want to demolish in advance a few of the objections that will be raised to this reform.  That is the first objection, which is a ridiculous objection, an invented objection.</P>
    <P>The next objection is that, in regard to the High Court, solicitors would have tremendous difficulty in getting their witnesses to Dublin before 11 a.m. Everybody knows that the good solicitor and the bad solicitor has his witnesses in Dublin the night before the hearing of the action and that they are enjoying themselves in a hotel or some other place, as they are entitled to do, on the expenses that will be provided for them for attending court.</P>
    <P>There is no question, except in the most unusual circumstances, of a witness having to travel to the High Court from the country on the morning of the trial.  Generally speaking, as a matter of practice, there is a consultation the night before either in the consultation rooms at the court or at the senior counsel's residence, at which senior and junior counsel and solicitor and all the witnesses are present.  The whole case is gone through perhaps <Col N="672" /> until after midnight.  They are all ready to start out on the case in the morning.  If it is a State case, the consultation is in the State Solicitor's Office on the afternoon before the trial. There is no question, therefore, of witnesses travelling from the country to the court on the morning of the hearing. It may happen in an exceptional case but not very often.  That is the second objection disposed of.</P>
    <P>The third objection is that solicitors would object to it because they have not the post opened and studied at 10 o'clock in the morning.  Perhaps that applies to some solicitors, but the busy solicitor, the active solicitor, has his post read and his letters dictated by a quarter past nine in the morning and is ready to be in court at 10 o'clock if he wants to be in court at 10 o'clock. The amazing thing is that the objection to starting at 10 o'clock does not come from solicitors who function in the court but come from solicitors who, perhaps, never put their foot inside the court door but operate entirely by counsel and send down one of their clerks to attend the counsel when the case comes off.  The general objection comes, as I say, from solicitors who do not practise themselves physically in the court, so that there is not very much in that objection.  Certainly, any solicitor who practises in the Dublin Courts would have no objection to starting at 10 o'clock in the morning. In fact, he wants a start to be made at 10 o'clock, particularly in the District Courts, because it gives him an opportunity of getting to all the different courts he has to get to in the day.</P>
    <P>Another objection is that from 10 a.m. to 5 p.m., with an hour's break, would be six hours, and that six hours would be too long for a judge to stand the heavy strain of the court.  Most people have to work longer than six hours in the day.  The strain on some industrial workers who have to work much longer than six hours is, undoubtedly, a heavy strain.  I have yet to learn that the strain of listening to a case is such a strain as will tire a judge in more than five and a half hours, so that that objection of the strain on the judge, particularly on a <Col N="673" /> judge who gets over two months' holiday in the summer, and extensive periods of holidays during the rest of the year, cannot be sustained.  I often wonder what our judges would do if they were surgeons, in which case they would have a very heavy strain, or if they were Ministers, or if they occupied many other of the positions in our Civil Service or business or professional life.  I do not think that a judge is any less seasoned timber than the occupants of other professional or business appointments, and I cannot see why he is not able to last a longer day than four and a half hours.</P>
    <P>They will say that the strain of going beyond four and a half hours may result in injustice&mdash;injustice to the party or some of the parties before the judge.  Injustice could hardly arise in that event, and anyway the lawyers or counsel or solicitors or advocates who are looking after the accused person in the case of a criminal trial are well able to look after that particular aspect for the accused person; so that there is nothing very much in that argument unless we are to take the line that our judges are to be specially pampered.  I can see no reason for it.</P>
    <P>Another argument advanced against it is that the judges, when the day's work is over, have got to consult authorities; they may have to go to libraries; they may have to look up their notes.  We all have to do that. After a much longer day we have to consult authorities, we have to read cases, we have to search for the cases we want; whereas a judge has them all marked down for him by one side or the other, authorities are given, the books are available for him if he wants to read them.  I see nothing wrong. Every person who does his work well in any sphere of life has got to burn the midnight oil, and if a judge has to burn the midnight oil now and again I do not think he can complain very much about it.  This State will provide in abundance the midnight oil for him.</P>
    <P>There may be other objections to the course advocated by the amendment. I will be glad to hear them, and I will be glad to make my comments <Col N="674" /> upon them, but I think that we ought to agree that in the interests of the people the court day should be somewhat longer than it is.  I am not tied entirely to the hours I have in this amendment.  I am not unreasonable, and I do not want to be unreasonable in regard to it, but I do think that it is most important that our courts should sit to the minute of the time they are expected to sit.</P>
    <P>I think that there is tremendous inconvenience to practitioners and to litigants to find a court starting at 11 o'clock which should start at half past ten, to see a court start at half past 11 that should start at 11, and particularly here in the City of Dublin where practitioners have to do cases in a number of courts, all cases fixed for the same time.  It is impossible to arrange one's work when you go into court and do not know in the name of God when the justice is going to come out.  They are all due at, say, half past ten.  They may come out at half past ten or they may not.  One may arrange his business on the basis that a particular justice is punctual and will be out at half past ten, and that another may not be out until 11 o'clock, and find, having taken that chance, that the man who does not come out generally until 11 o'clock will be out at half past ten and that the man who generally comes out at half past ten is out only at 11 o'clock.  It is absolutely unreasonable that we should have that state of affairs.  There is no reason why the courts should not sit at the hour they are expected to sit; and in that respect I want to say from my experience that I find no grounds for objection to the High Court, the Supreme Court or the Circuit Court in regard to punctuality in sitting.</P>
    <P>I think I have said enough to make a reasonable case for this particular amendment.  If, by any chance, on any day a judge were to feel a particular strain because of a very technical case or something else before him, nobody would object if the case were adjourned sooner than the usual time. There would never be any trouble whatsoever in regard to it.  Even if an advocate became ill or unfit to carry <Col N="675" /> on with the strain of a particular court, it is quite possible that, on application, an adjournment to suit his convenience and to suit his health would be arranged.</P>
    <P>We have advanced a good distance beyond the long hours of some of our famous criminal cases in Green Street. I am moving this amendment on principle. I shall be quite satisfied if the Minister says that he will have this particular amendment examined before the Report Stage and will bring in an amendment to which the House will agree.</P>
    <P>The general public are anxious that our courts should do more work and, in the interest of the general public, I have brought forward this amendment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. O'Higgins Mr. O'Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>This amendment certainly does refer to a problem of some importance, perhaps unlike the earlier amendment which the Deputy moved. The question of the hours during which courts should sit is of public importance.  It is correct to say that people have been inclined to attribute arrears of legal business to the shortness of court sittings.  Whether or not that reasoning is sound is, I think, difficult to be certain about.  At any rate, I agree that there is some matter to be inquired into and that the amendment seeks to deal with a problem that does exist.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is a pity that Deputy Cowan should have availed of this House and of this amendment to raise this particular problem because I think that the matter of court sittings is primarily one for the courts and that, in the first instance, the hours of sittings must be ordered by the courts.  I retain sufficient respect for our judicial system and for our legal practitioners in both branches of the profession to believe that it is not a difficult matter to order court sittings for as long as people require them to sit.  One of the judges in the High Court&mdash;in fact, the President of the High Court&mdash;has, for the past three years, been endeavouring to get litigants and solicitors to commence their cases well before 11 a.m.  He has had lists informing <Col N="676" /> litigants and solicitors that cases would be taken at 10 a.m.; 10.15 a.m., and 10.30 a.m.&mdash;and time after time no one turned up.  I do not think it is quite fair to suggest&mdash;as I think is inherent in Deputy Cowan's remarks&mdash;that all this must be laid on the shoulders of our judges.  I do not believe that that is so.  I think that every judge&mdash;each judge of the Circuit Court, the High Court, and the Supreme Court&mdash;within his physical abilities, will be only too anxious to sit for as long as he possibly can.</P>
    <P>I feel that the suggestion of longer court sittings should come in an organised way from the professions engaged in the courts and should be discussed in an orderly and proper manner before the rule-making authority for each court.  I feel that it should not be for a Deputy of this House, in his privileged position in this House, to move an amendment of this nature, with the innuendoes behind the speech which he made when moving the amendment.  It is quite wrong and it is unfortunate that it was done.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>As I was saying, in my opinion, this matter could have been better dealt with outside this House.  However, it has been raised here.  While agreeing that there is some foundation for advocating longer court sittings, I cannot agree with some of the reasons offered by Deputy Cowan.  The assimilating and sifting of evidence&mdash;whether Deputy Cowan agrees with me or not&mdash;is a highly technical matter.  Listening to evidence, and acting in accordance with an oath to do justice to all, is a matter of considerable anxiety, I believe, <Col N="678" /> to all our judges.  It is very easy for a Deputy to say that an industrial worker works eight hours a day and to ask why a judge cannot work more than four hours a day.  Most judges can and I believe do work considerably longer than four hours a day. How many Deputies sit in this House for longer than an hour at a time?  I should like an honest answer to that question.  For how long at a time can they sit here and listen to speeches&mdash; even sensible speeches&mdash;without ducking out to the back to have a smoke? We all know that that happens.  One of the most difficult things to do is to sit consistently and patiently and to follow anxiously and carefully&mdash;as a judge is bound under rule to follow&mdash; every syllable, every inflection of a voice, every flicker on a witness's face, to make quite sure that he is doing justice. I do not think it is wrong to expect our judges, for however short they may sit each day, for as long as they do justice, to be tired and anxious men when eventually the court rises.  I know that that, in fact, is so.  It may be that it is possible to prolong the sittings in some way, but that is a matter for the judges.  It is not a matter for a Deputy in this House.</P>

      <P>I am making my speech; I did not interrupt the Deputy.  If we want proper justice administered here, we will leave the settlement of these matters to our judges and to our professions.  There is nothing more harmful than the meddler and there are many things that are better left alone.  I believe this is one of them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Deputy advanced a variety of other reasons why it would be more convenient to have our courts and judges sitting longer.  He mentioned the District Courts.  I do not believe that anywhere in this country would you find a District Court still in <Col N="679" /> session after two o'clock in the day. Their business is finished at that hour and in fact such is the situation that in this very Bill the Minister is seeking powers drastically to reduce the number of justices, and still it is suggested that in the case of district justices, whose business ordinarily finishes within an hour or one and a half hours, it is a matter of prime national importance that they must get up an hour earlier and sit at 10 o'clock.  I cannot see the sense behind that.  It is suggested that in the High Court&mdash;the Deputy particularly mentioned High Court juries&mdash;longer hours are necessary.  I am not a judge, and possibly will never be one, but what about juries?  Are 12 decent citizens who serve as jurors every day in the High Court to be forced to sit for two hours longer each day?  Are their feelings not to be considered?  Again I suggest that this is a matter to be left completely to the judges and to the rule-making authority which represents both solicitors and Bar to decide. We would be very wrong to interfere.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DeclanCostello" hpid="Mr. D. Costello Mr. D. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to say that I am against this amendment also.  I am not against the idea which inspired it.  I think we are all anxious that our courts should be as efficient as possible and I presume that the Deputy in putting down this amendment thought that, by getting this passed into legislation, our courts would be more efficient.  I do not think that the delay in our courts is primarily due to the shortness of the hours which the courts work.  I think the delay in our courts&mdash;certainly in the High Court&mdash;has in the past been due to the shortage of High Court judges.  Our remedy in the desire we all have that litigation should be speeded up should be to endeavour to have an adequate number of judges, particularly in the High Court, so that the work will be got through with greater speed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not know of any country in the world whose judges are asked to sit from 10 a.m. to 5 p.m. and I think the reason for that, as Deputy O'Higgins pointed out, is a very good one indeed &mdash;that judges' work is in many ways <Col N="680" /> more difficult and more demanding, when done conscientiously, than even a surgeon's work, and I think the very system of the courts, which requires consultations before and after cases and constant discussion with witnesses and with counsel and solicitors on the other side, necessitates a greater margin at the beginning and end of the case than the ordinary day's work which the ordinary person does.</P>
    <P>I am in agreement with the idea that our courts should work longer.  I think the courts, all courts, could sit at 10.30 in the morning without putting any undue strain on judges or on the system of hearing cases.  I do not think the way to bring about that state of affairs is, as Deputy Cowan suggests, putting down an amendment to a Bill which, I presume, he wishes would become the law of the land.  One of the main objections to this amendment is its futility.  We pass an amendment requiring judges to sit between 10 a.m. and 5 p.m. and one of the first principles of law is sanction.  Where is the sanction if the judges do not sit?  Do we fine them £10 for not being in time? I think that such an amendment is in its nature a futile one.</P>
    <P>We have to appreciate and realise fully what this country, by adopting its Constitution, has done.  It has deliberately put our judicial system into a privileged position and I for one regard it as one of the fundamental safeguards of the freedoms we all recognise here as being desirable to be maintained that that privileged position should remain.  I know that privilege of one sort or another is a matter which it is the task of the Parliament of a country to examine, to see if the body of persons or individuals in the privileged position are using their position in the interests of the country as a whole.  That is a right which this Parliament should exercise, no matter what the walk of life in which the individuals exercise the privilege, except in regard to our judicial system. It is of vital importance that this country under its Constitution recognised the principle of the division of powers and set up a separate independent judiciary and for that reason, when dealing with such matters of <Col N="681" /> detail as the sittings of the courts, we should be very careful that we here in the Oireachtas do not encroach upon the privilege of the judiciary which this country, in its wisdom, has adopted as a principle of its Constitution.</P>
    <P>I agree with Deputy O'Higgins that these are matters which are best left to the rule-making body of the profession and to the judiciary themselves. I do not think this House should interfere in the manner proposed in this amendment.  I think we are exceeding our functions as one of the branches set up under our Constitution, if we do so.  I certainly do not think that the hours proposed in this amendment would be suitable or would, indeed, help to bring about the efficient legal machinery which we all desire.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>I must say that I have slightly different views from those expressed by my colleagues on this matter.  I think we all know that there are entirely separate problems involved for the High Court, the Circuit Court and the District Court.  One of my objections to this amendment is that it tries to meet all three courts on the same basis.  I, of course, regard the Supreme Court as one with the High Court.  The delay that exists at present in the High Court in obtaining a decision in a trial by jury, and indeed in obtaining a decision in a case where there is no jury, is of undoubted hardship to litigants.  I think every member of the House, no matter whether he be legal, lay or even a Minister, will agree that the delay causes great hardship to litigants.  But when it comes to ascertaining the cause of that delay, that is where many of us would part company.  I do not think that, primarily, the hours of sitting are the cause of that delay.  Without being personal or without taking individual cases, we all know that one person will dispose of a great deal more in an hour than another will dispose of in two hours.  After all it is a question of approach.  Some of us in this House will say in five minutes what others will take 55 minutes to say.  It is, perhaps, a problem of human nature if you like but I do not think the question of whether one sits at ten or <Col N="682" /> later is at the base of the trouble at all.  There is another cause, in my belief, for the delay in the High Court at the present time but I think that is a cause which is not a suitable one for discussion here.</P>
      <P>I disagree entirely with Deputy Cowan when he says, as I understood him to say, that this is going to make legal action cheaper for litigants.  I think, by and large, it is going to make it dearer.  I agree, of course, that where witnesses have to come up from, say, Mayo&mdash;I am dealing at the moment with the High Court&mdash;they come the night before, but in the vast majority of cases in Leinster, the litigants and the witnesses come up on the morning of the trial.  If they have to arrive before 10 a.m. it is going to mean that more of them will have to stay over-night, and that, obviously, will increase the cost.  We all agree that the cost of litigation should be decreased and not increased.</P>
      <P>What about jurymen?  It is sometimes impossible to assess the damage that a person engaged in business might suffer by not being able to attend for a short period at his business premises in the morning, when he is called to serve on a jury on a particular day. Under the present system a juryman has some chance, at least, before he attends court of going to his business premises and of giving perhaps what I might call some directions as to what might transpire while he is away.  He will have further opportunity of dealing with the matter again when he comes off jury work in the evening.  I think that the jury system is one that we must retain.  I equally think that we must try to make it as reasonable for people who serve on juries as we can.</P>
      <P>So far as convenience of the legal fraternity, be they judges, barristers or solicitors, is concerned, I do not think that really enters into it.  It is the convenience of litigants, witnesses and jurymen that should be considered and, so far as the legal fraternity is concerned, into whichever of the three branches they fall, their convenience should be considered only in so far as it is necessary to assist them to carry out their respective functions properly. So much for the High Court.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="683" /> When it comes to the Circuit Court, however, other considerations arise. Mayo has been mentioned, and in Mayo people from Achill have to travel to Ballina to the Circuit Court.  A 10 o'clock sitting would mean that they would have to come the night before, because what invariably happens in the country&mdash;and I think Deputy Cowan will agree&mdash;is that the consultation is held at 10 o'clock before the Circuit Court sits.  There is never a consultation the night before, and putting back the hours of sitting for the Circuit Court in the country would merely mean that litigants and witnesses would inevitably have to travel the night before and that would very substantially indeed increase the cost.</P>
    <P>So far as the District Court is concerned, the position at the moment in Dublin is that the District Court starts at 10.30.  I do not think it is worth arguing about starting the courts half an hour earlier in Dublin. The Minister has included a provision in the Bill by which he hopes to have fewer district justices in country districts. It seems to me to be difficult to argue that you should say, on the one hand, that there is so little work for justices in the country that you are going to cut down the number, while on the other hand you propose to increase the hours of sitting.  Either of these statements is true; you cannot have both.</P>
    <P>In regard to the question as to whether this is a proper matter for the House to discuss, I have very strong views.  I consider it is entirely a proper matter for the House but an unwise matter for the House to discuss until the House has got the point of view of those who are dealing with the problem every day.  I think the decision would be a proper matter for the House but that it would be unwise for the House to come to a decision until it had got, presumably through the Minister, the viewpoint of those who are immediately concerned&mdash;the judges in the various courts and district justices, the Bar through the Bar Council, presumably, and the solicitors either through the Law Society or the local Bar associations who deal with <Col N="684" /> these matters down the country.  They seem to me to be the bodies to whose views on this matter the House should give grave consideration.</P>
    <P>I think that until we have these before us we should not take a decision.  I think that is what Deputy O'Higgins meant to say, though, perhaps, if I may say so without offence to him, he did not quite express it: that it would be very wrong to come to a decision without having these views before us.  I do not think, however, that anybody would suggest that the question of legislation is not one with which we in the House must ultimately deal.  But we should be reasonable men and take all proper steps to get opinions from the skilled men before coming to a decision.</P>

      <P>I believe that all the Deputies who have spoken on this are legal men.  I have, however, gone out of my way to try to find out what the opinions of the Incorporated Law Society and the Bar Council are on this matter.  While we had our committee dealing with judicial salaries there was a question raised as to the hours of sitting of the courts and I took advantage of that to draw the attention of the Chief Justice and the President of the High Court to the opinion of the committee, which, of course, made no recommendations. They thought, however, that the courts ought to sit longer.  I mentioned that to the Chief Justice and the President of the High Court.  They were pressing, of course, for an additional High Court Judge and we are making provision for that, but they said they would do what they could.  The arguments that have been put up by Deputies were precisely the arguments they put up.  I wish Deputy O'Higgins had not dealt with Deputy Cowan's speech in the personal way in which he did.</P>

      <P>Deputy Cowan expressed the hope, when dealing with the last amendment, that as a result of what was said here the rule-making committee might change their attitude and make a move in the matter of how the judges in the different courts ought to be addressed.  I think it would be wrong to take it out of the hands of the rule-making committee.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with the substance of what Deputy O'Higgins and Deputy Sweetman said.  My attitude, as I said in the beginning, is that we ought to try to keep this Bill confined to the main purpose for which it was brought in, the question of salaries and the raising of the jurisdiction to what it was intended to be before money lost its value.  Then this question was raised in the House, that there ought to be a change of hours.  If that is felt generally by the House, I think the proper way of settling that is by some commission or committee who could go into the whole question.  That committee could decide whether the hours should be fixed by law or by the rule-making <Col N="686" /> committee.  I think Deputy Costello was not right in suggesting, as I understood him, that this was not a matter for the House.  It definitely is. We are entitled to discuss these matters and decide them.  But I think this matter, like some other matters raised in amendments, would be more properly dealt with by a committee which would go into the whole question of our courts.  I intend to ask the Government to set up such a committee to make recommendations, and for that reason I think we ought not to take a decision in this matter until that committee reports.</P>
      <P>When this Bill passes, the solicitors' profession can be represented by two solicitors.  At present you have one <i>ex officio</i> member, who is President of the Incorporated Law Society.  I understand that this rule-making committee generally meets on Friday, and that it is not always easy for the solicitors' member to attend.  If there are two members permanently on it for a term, they would be able to put the point of view of the solicitors' profession.</P>
      <P>I am definitely of opinion that the hour of ten o'clock would not suit witnesses. What Deputy Sweetman has said is what I was told by the representatives of the Bar Council and the Incorporated Law Society, that witnesses who came by car from a distance were generally interviewed in the morning; that the majority of them generally have these conferences in the morning and that it would mean great hardship and more expense if they were brought up the night before and had to be kept in a hotel.  That is what they tell me.</P>
    </Speaker>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>The Incorporated Law Society also said that they would find it very awkward if they had to be in court at ten o'clock, as they would not have an opportunity of dealing with their post.  Deputy Cowan said they can, but they tell me they cannot.  I do not know who is right.  Maybe Deputy Cowan is a quicker worker or gets up earlier.  Some of them say they get their post about a quarter <Col N="687" /> past nine, and that they could not very well deal with it before ten o'clock.</P>
      <P>Then there is the question of the jury.  There is no doubt that it would be difficult to expect a jury who have to sit for long hours to attend at that hour.  I agree that any judge who would be required to sit for more than three or four hours listening to a case, and to come to a decision, would find it difficult to do it with such long hours. I could not do it anyhow.  Even a Minister, when engaged in this House, can go out for ten or 15 minutes, and he requires a break.  I am only giving a personal opinion, but I think it would not be right for a judge to be asked to give a decision after a very gruelling day.</P>
      <P>That whole question would be settled better by a committee which would inquire into the whole question of the operation of the courts.  My suggestion is that the Deputy should not press this now that it has been ventilated. The same thing applies with regard to extending the scope of the Bill.  I do not think the Deputy ought to go further with it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Captain Cowan</NameTxt>
      <P>If I still belonged to my original profession of a soldier, I suppose no one could object to my raising this matter.  But, being a Deputy who is interested in matters pertaining to the public and having heard a number of complaints about short hours in the courts, I felt that it was my duty to raise this matter.  I think I am entitled to put down an amendment and this House would be perfectly entitled to pass the amendment if it so wished.  I want to make that perfectly clear.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am intrigued by one fact.  I <Col N="688" /> mentioned in advance the number of objections there was to the extension of the court hours and I knocked all those down one by one.  The judges never said that the hours would be too long.  They were interested in the strain that would be put on the jurymen. The Incorporated Law Society and the Bar Council were not interested in themselves, but in the enormous expense that would be imposed on litigants if they had to bring the witnesses up.</P>
    <P>I would much prefer if the judges said: &ldquo;Well, it would not be possible for us to deal with these cases if we had to work an hour later, or if we had to work a five hour day instead of a four hour day&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;That it would be too severe a strain&rdquo;&mdash;I could understand that.  Let the litigants and jurymen speak for themselves through the only people who can speak for them&mdash; their own representatives in this House.  There is no representative of the witnesses on the rule-making authority.  There is no representative of litigants on the rule-making authority.  There is no representative of our county councils or local authorities or even of this Dáil on the rule-making authority.  The rule-making authority should have the views of the witnesses, the litigants and the jurymen.</P>
    <P>I have had cases where jurymen objected in court when the judge said he was adjourning the case until morning. They were country jurymen&mdash; farmers.  It was a good harvest time and there was good weather and they wanted to do the work.  They asked why should they have to come back the following morning for an hour when they could do the business that evening.  The judge told them they had got to go home and come back the following morning.  Nobody gave two hoots about their convenience, about their farms or anything else about them.</P>
    <P>I have no objection to the judges making the case that the strain would be too long but do not let them make the case that it would be too severe on the jurymen and do not let the Incorporated Law Society or the Bar Council make the case for the witnesses. <Col N="689" /> Let them make it for themselves. In that way, I think we could all understand one another much better.</P>
    <P>It is a strange thing that Deputies O'Higgins and Sweetman agree that there is some problem but they do not agree that my amendment is the right way to meet it.  I do not suggest it is. I did say, when introducing it, that I was putting it forward so that the matter might be considered by the Minister and something introduced on Report Stage that would meet the general view.  It is a significant fact that the rule-making authority has been in existence for the last 29 years and have not dealt with the matter and would not deal with it for the next 29 years were it not raised by some Deputy in this House.</P>
    <P>Let anybody say what he may but the fact that the courts do not sit longer imposes heavier financial burdens on the people of the country. If a case can be concluded in one day there are fees for one day only&mdash;not refresher fees or fees for two days. I would make a little bet with anyone that the refresher fee in a day would be much more than the cost of bringing a few witnesses up and putting them in a hotel in Ballina or elsewhere.  If we are going to talk about expense, let us talk about expense and let us see how it works.</P>
    <P>This nonsense that it would be more expensive to have the courts working longer days should not be accepted by any intelligent person.  There is no foundation for it and it is only what I term an invented objection.  The rule-making authority is an authority set up by statute.  As this Oireachtas set up that rule-making authority, it can prescribe its powers and we can ourselves make rules in relation to the hours at which the court sits.</P>
    <P>I think Deputy Costello was trying to be humorous when he asked where were the sanctions for a judge if he did not sit at ten o'clock.  There is a very good sanction&mdash;£2,000 odd or £3,000 a year if he does not carry out his duties and that can be dealt with by the Oireachtas.  That is the sanction that can be imposed.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="690" /> Under the Rules of Court which are statutory rules made under the authority of legislation, judges are required to do this, that and the other thing.  There is no question of imposing sanctions on them or imposing a penalty of £10 for not doing this or that.  It certainly would be a poor day if we had to impose penalties on our judges.  However, I think that was a humorous intervention and was not intended to be serious.</P>
    <P>Under the Constitution of this country&mdash;and I have always supported it&mdash;the judges are independent.  I have always supported that.  I believe they should be independent and should not be subject to the Executive in matters particularly within their own domain, as to how to deal with cases.  As to the hours at which a court opens and as to when it should close, those are peculiarly matters for statute and, in fact, are controlled and governed by statute at the moment.  The Minister said that he proposed to introduce a Bill which will deal with a number of matters in the near future.</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>

      <P>I do not want to be unreasonable in regard to this. We have had 29 years of it and the work of the High Court has fallen into shocking arrears notwithstanding the very excellent efforts of the President to try to make the day a little longer by bringing the jurymen in earlier.  The court is in a scandalous state of arrears.  The only remedy they suggest for it is one additional judge.  If they do not wipe out the arrears they will come to the Minister and ask for another judge. Are they going to ask for a third judge?</P>

      <P>Deputy Sweetman and Deputy O'Higgins may agree that the shortening of the long vacation is something that is desirable.  I agree with them and I am sorry that they did not put down an amendment to that effect.  I did consider that this question of a longer working day for the judges was important.  I think it is particularly important in the District Courts where I have seen little cases that might be dealt with in a quarter of an hour left over.  The court rose at 4 o'clock to the second with the result that 15 or 20 litigants, with their witnesses, all of them concerned with informal matters that could be disposed of in a quarter of an hour, were told to come back on <Col N="692" /> that day fortnight.  That is wrong, I do not care who says to the contrary. It is scandalously wrong and is happening very frequently.</P>
      <P>I remember going down to the country one time to do a case.  I travelled a long way from Dublin. When I arrived in the court I had to wait until some cases that were at hearing were disposed of.  Suddenly, the court adjourned at an hour that I have never seen courts adjourn at. There was an absence of the justice for a couple of hours.  I was anxious to get my case finished and get back to Dublin.  When I made inquiries, I was told that the justice was out disposing of his cattle.  That may be perfectly all right, but I do not think the general public would think it is right during a day on which the court is sitting.  I do not think it should be done.  However, that is a long time ago, and I am probably the only person alive who was there on the day in question, so that the court cannot be identified.</P>
      <P>However, I have raised this matter because I think it is important.  I do not think it is the sort of matter that should be dealt with by a hasty amendment of the law.  I have put down this amendment for the purpose of having it discussed.  Frankly, I am disappointed that Deputies who are interested in the general public, and have no connection with the law, did not give us their views on this matter. If they had done so, it might be helpful to the Minister and to the rule-making authority, and certainly might have been in the public interest, because, after all, the courts are more concerned with the general public than with the legal fraternity.</P>

      <P>On the section, this is the section which provides for an increase in pay of judges of the Supreme Court and the High Court, for judges of the Circuit Court and for district justices.  The section was discussed on the Second Reading of the Bill here.  This has been a unanimous recommendation by the committee that considered the matter.  Under the Constitution, as has been mentioned, judges are independent in the exercise of their functions.  Unfortunately, since this matter was under discussion by the committee, certain things have occurred in regard to district justices which might have altered my views if they had occurred prior to that.</P>
      <P>I want to speak within the limitations that will be imposed on me by this House in regard to the exercise of their functions by the judiciary.  In the exercise of their functions, the judiciary are absolutely independent.

In recent months and weeks there has been a spate of contradictory declarations by district justices in regard to the hours of dancing.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="697" /> Before Section 13, in page 6, to insert the following new section:&mdash;</P>
    <P>(1)  Notwithstanding anything contained in Section 34 of the Act of 1936, if, at any time before a judge begins to travel a High Court Circuit for the purpose of holding therein any half-yearly sittings of the High Court on Circuit, the Chief Justice and the President of the High Court ascertain that there is no business to be transacted at such sittings in any particular appeal town for a county or county borough in that High Court Circuit, the Chief Justice and the President of the High Court may direct in writing that it shall not be obligatory to hold such sittings in that appeal town.</P>
    <P>(2) (a) Where&mdash;</P>
    <P>(i)  two or more judges are travelling a High Court Circuit for the purpose of holding therein any half-yearly sittings of the High Court on Circuit, and</P>
    <P>(ii)  the senior of the judges ascertains that there is no business to be transacted at such sittings in any particular appeal town for a county or county borough in that High Court Circuit,</P>
    <P>the senior of the judges may direct in writing that it shall not be obligatory to hold such sittings in that appeal town.</P>
    <P>(3) (a) Where&mdash;</P>
    <P>(i)  one judge only is travelling a High Court Circuit for the purpose of holding therein any half-yearly sittings of the High Court on Circuit, and</P>
    <P>(ii)  the judge ascertains that there is no business to be transacted at such sittings in any particular appeal town for a county or county borough in that High Court Circuit,</P>

    <P>(4)  A direction under this section may be filed in the Circuit Court <Col N="698" /> Office serving the appeal town to which the direction relates.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 6:&mdash;</P>
      <P>Before Section 13, in page 6, to insert the following new section:&mdash;</P>
      <P>The power to remit or transfer an action conferred by Section 25 of the Act of 1924 may, with the consent of the parties to the action, be exercised by the Master of the High Court, and any action remitted or transferred by him shall be regarded as having been remitted or transferred under that section by the High Court.</P>
      <P>This amendment proposes to give statutory authority to a practice which was being followed up to a few years ago and under which the Master of the High Court, with the consent of the parties, transferred to the Circuit Court or the District Court any High Court actions which might have been commenced in the lower courts.  In fact the power of remitting or transferring such High Court actions, with or without the consent of both parties, is reserved to the court itself under the provisions of Section 25 of the 1924 Act.  Where the parties to the action consent to the transfer of the action to a lower court, the exercise of the power of transfer becomes a more formality and it will be a saving of time both for the High Court and the parties themselves to have the transfer orders made in such cases by the Master.</P>

      <P>On amendment No. 6, would the Minister say if there are any other like functions that the Master could undertake and if certain jurisdiction could be given to him?  In several matters which I will not go into now his jurisdiction is still rather vague.  There are many purely technical matters which are transferred automatically, even when they are subject to the consent of both parties, from the Master of the High Court.  I think power should be given to the Master to deal with these matters.  As I say, I cannot go into them now in detail but I would suggest that the Minister should get in touch with the rule-making body and find out from them what power they suggest should be given to the Master in many of these small matters of detail which, in practice, could be dealt with by him but which he has no jurisdiction to deal with and which are helping to clutter up the courts.</P>

      <P>Is that to get you over certain difficulties?  I do not want to start a discussion but there are a number of functions exercised by the Master at the moment in a court, as it were, that in my view could be readily dealt with in the office.  However, I do not want to start an argument on that.  Perhaps Deputy Costello has something there in suggesting that certain powers should be given to the Master.  We will run into a difficulty in the fact that the Master is not a judge and cannot exercise judicial functions.  However, I suppose the committee will be the place to deal with this.  Some of the things the Master does could very well be done <Col N="700" /> by him in the office without having counsel, solicitors or anybody else appearing before him in the court.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 7:&mdash;</P>
      <P>Before Section 13 to insert a new section as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>(1) Every appeal from a judgement of the Circuit Court in an action tried by judge and jury shall be made by way of a motion before a judge of the High Court for a new trial and the allegations on which such motion may be grounded shall include the allegation that the verdict of the jury was against the weight of the evidence or was otherwise perverse.  In any such appeal the judge of the High Court before whom the same is prosecuted may, in lieu of an order for a new trial, set aside the verdict findings and judgement appealed against and enter such judgment as the court thinks proper.</P>
      <P>(2)  The provisions in the Act of 1936 relating to appeals from the Circuit Court shall be modified in relation to appeals from judgments in actions tried by a judge and jury in accordance with this section.</P>
      <P>This again is an amendment which I think is a simple one.  It was intended to be considered with amendment No. 22 and arises out of the increased jurisdiction proposed to be given to the Circuit Court.  In effect it is to provide that a civil jury's decision in the Circuit Court on a question of fact should be final, and that an appeal should lie only from a jury's decision in the same way as it now lies from a High Court jury to the Supreme Court.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This particular provision is sound common sense, where the jurisdiction of the Circuit Court is proposed to be doubled.  I had hoped that it might be discussed with the later amendment No. 22, as I think that&mdash;whatever may be said about the High Court&mdash;in the Circuit Court and in rural areas where a litigant exercises his right to bring jurors in to hear his case he <Col N="701" /> should be bound to provide some expenses for the jury; and he would get as a corollary to that an assurance that the decision of the jury could not be upset by one judge coming along later on, on appeal.  That is unfortunately the position at the moment&mdash; the jury that hears a case in the Circuit Court is wasting its time, the whole thing is unreal because after they come to their judgment on the facts they hear, an appeal is brought and is heard by a judge of the High Court, on a rehearing completely without a jury, and he may come to quite a different view.  The purpose of this is to ensure that where a civil jury is heard, their decision on fact will be final.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DeclanCostello" hpid="Mr. D. Costello Mr. D. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy O'Higgins's amendment is an attempt to deal with what will develop into a very real problem very shortly after this Bill comes into operation.  By raising the jurisdiction to £600, we are automatically going to bring into practice a rule of court which has been availed of very little up to the present time, namely, the right of a plaintiff in an action tort to have a jury.  At the present time, it is vary rarely that you have a jury empanelled in an action where the claim is for £300.  Now the claim may be up to £600 and there will be many such claims heard in the Circuit Court. That practice is going to creep in, in all the circuits, including Dublin, and we will have juries being empanelled, if some provision such as in Deputy O'Higgins's suggestion is not made.  We will have the paradoxical and wrong situation that the right of everybody to have a substantial case tried by a judge and jury will be whittled down, by reason of the appeal which, for example, a defendant would have against a decision by a jury, and that appeal coming on before a judge without a jury.  You will have a ridiculous situation where facts are threshed out in the Circuit Court before a judge and jury and the same facts are again threshed out in the Hight Court before a judge alone.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On the Second Reading of this Bill, I suggested that there should be an appeal direct from the Circuit Court <Col N="702" /> to the Supreme Court on the judge's notes, on the motion for a new trial, in the same way as there is an appeal from the High Court to the Supreme Court.  If that is not acceptable to the Minister, I suggest the form proposed by Deputy O'Higgins, in order to get over the very cumbersome and ridiculous system that will develop in appeals from the Circuit Court to the High Court as the Bill now stands.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PeadarCowan" hpid="Captain Cowan Captain Cowan">
      <NameTxt>Captain Cowan</NameTxt>
      <P>I have been thinking over this problem of cases of tort, actions for damages, tried before a circuit judge and jury.  Undoubtedly every sensible plaintiff in one particular type of action will endeavour to have a jury in the Circuit Court and it is certainly wrong that there should be, from the verdict of 12 men who have seen the witnesses, observed their demeanour and have been able to make up their minds on the facts in front of them, an appeal to a single judge.  I think there is a certain amount of merit in Deputy O'Higgins's amendment, but personally I prefer the appeal direct from the Circuit Court to the Supreme Court.</P>

      <P>If you are going to have appeals to the High Court, you may help to clutter up the High Court more than it is.  For that reason, I would strongly urge that the appeals should be direct to the Supreme Court.  I would ask the Minister not to say he will leave it to the new Bill.

    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="705" /> This, I suppose, cuts across the policy of the Bill because it is designed to prevent the proposed reduction in the Circuit Courts.  I know that I will have Deputy Cowan's full support for this because it certainly seems strange to me that we should substantially increase the jurisdiction of the Circuit Court and at the same time reduce the number of judges.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PeadarCowan" hpid="Captain Cowan Captain Cowan">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. O'Higgins Mr. O'Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>That is just the point. If, in fact, there are too many Circuit Court judges at the moment, it does not matter about the hours because there are too many of them sitting and they will sit too many hours.  For that reason, I am quite certain Deputy Cowan will support the amendment.  I do not know whether it is a matter of firm and definite policy with the Minister to reduce the number of Circuit Court judges.  I always think it is far better from the courts' point of view to have redundant judges.  I think the important thing is not the saving of the £2,000 or £3,000 a year that might be saved by pruning down the number of judges to the bare minimum needed to have the work done.</P>
      <P>That does not count compared with the great public convenience and general satisfaction that will be given by having as many judges as are reasonably necessary to do the work. I think the proposed reduction in Circuit Court judges&mdash;while a case might legitimately be made for it&mdash;is unwise with the increase in jurisdiction which we will give to the Circuit Courts now. I do believe that very, very quickly we will have some Minister coming back to the House proposing to increase the number of Circuit Court judges once again.  I think it would be far wiser to leave them as they are to see how the increased jurisdiction works out. It is my opinion that you require all the Circuit Court judges you have and more.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>I just wish to urge the Minister to accept this amendment. I think it is just possible that a case might be made at the present time that <Col N="706" /> some of the country circuits need to be rationalised, and it is just possible that it could be fairly argued that there should be a reduction in Circuit Courts at the present moment.  I do not think there is any substance in that argument when we are, under this Bill, deliberately going to give the Circuit Courts extra work, and I am convinced a good amount of extra work, in the future.  We have got to regard ourselves as trying to legislate for an effective judicial system and an efficient system, and I do not see efficiency or effectiveness arising from a new judicial Circuit Court system by which we give them, admittedly, a large amount of extra work and reduce the number of circuit judges at the same time.</P>
      <P>I said on the Second Reading&mdash;and I believe it is true&mdash;that this is a compromise between the Department of Justice and the Department of Finance, and I think in order to give the judges the extra salary which it was admitted was necessary, the Department of Finance wanted its pound of flesh and decided to cut down on the number of Circuit Court judges.  I think it is wrong.  As Deputy O'Higgins said, it is better to have too many Circuit Court judges than too few, and that is exactly what I think is going to happen if this amendment is not accepted.</P>

      <P>I do not agree with the particular amendment moved by Deputy O'Higgins, because the section says that the Government will divide the State into eight convenient groups. I agree we should have eight convenient groups as circuits but I think we should have nine judges.</P>

      <P>Yes, an additional judge.  I think that the President of the Circuit Court should be a person who would be available to go here, there and elsewhere where there is a lot of work to be done.  As it is, he is one of the judges in the Dublin circuit, and under the Act as it will be when passed, there will definitely be a reduction of one judge.  I think that the Minister could consider that&mdash;whether we could still retain the same number of judges, leaving the President to <Col N="707" /> help out, whether in Dublin or elsewhere. In that way we will get into the machinery of the new system.  We will get it operating efficiently and easily, and if and when it is found in operation to be a success, the Minister can easily come to the House on the occurrence of a particular Circuit Court vacancy and ask the House to agree to reduce the number of Circuit Court judges by one.  I think, however, in the process of change-over, no harm would be done and a great lot of good might be done if the number of judges that are in the Circuit Court was retained.</P>

      <P>If the Minister is giving attention to that, I suggest that some care should be taken in the drafting of Section 15, &ldquo;as soon as conveniently may be after the passing of this Act...&rdquo;  That may be permissive, but sometimes&mdash;perhaps Deputy Costello could help here&mdash;I have an idea there has been some difficulty in construing such a thing and that there is a possibility that somebody could move to compel the Minister in that matter if it is in this form.

      <NameTxt>Major de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>I accept your ruling.  On the amendment, I can speak now from a completely detached point of view and with a certain amount of knowledge.  I know that up to two years ago the situation in the Eastern circuit and in the Dublin circuit was such as to demand even more judicial attention to work than was actually possible under the system.  I presume the situation is more or less the same to-day.  One judge is appointed for the counties, Louth, Meath, Wicklow, Wexford and Kildare.  Whatever may be said for Deputy Cowan's argument in relation to High Court sittings, one must remember the amount of time involved in travelling on circuit and the physical fatigue occasioned by that travel to both judge and practitioner. I have no hesitation in saying, after a number of years' experience of that circuit, that it is too much for one judge.  I merely want to stress that point relative to the proposal to reduce the number of Circuit Court judges.  Possibly the Minister may find his solution by a rearrangement of circuits.  Any such rearrangement must be one that will compensate in cases of the kind I have mentioned.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="709" /> The Dublin Circuit Court is also notorious.  Very often a judge has to be brought in from some other circuit to help clear up arrears of work.  Bearing all that in mind I do not think the amendment should be accepted in its present form.  It might be desirable to frame this Bill in such a way as to make it permissive. It is not permissive at the moment and anybody who says it is is not accurate.</P>

      <P>I agree with the Minister's intention, and I support him in it in so far as he suggests that a redrafting of the wording of that section on the Report Stage will more clearly achieve what he has in mind. Certainly it does not appear to be in the section as it stands at present.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 13:&mdash;</P>
      <P>In sub-section (4), line 33, to delete &ldquo;nine&rdquo; and substitute &ldquo;ten&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>We have really been discussing amendment No. 13 on amendment No. 12 to some extent, and I think it is amendment No. 13 which would appeal more to the members of this House.  I think it is vitally essential that there should not be a reduction in the number of Circuit Court judges.  If I may put it this way, there should be a &ldquo;fluid&rdquo; judge who could be sent around as a sort of shock troop to clear up wherever there is an accumulation of work.  I think it is utterly illogical for the Minister to propose an extension of jurisdiction in Section 18 and at the same time a reduction in the number of Circuit Court judges.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not want to say anything now that might be directed towards any particular individual, but there are some judges who get through their work with great celerity.  There are some who get through by sitting <Col N="710" /> longer hours on certain days.  I am afraid that the rule of the Civil Service is being made to apply and that the Minister's own Department, or the Department of Finance, is rather inclined to view this matter on a rule of thumb basis.  Now one cannot measure this particular type of work on that basis.  A judge may have one case in his list that proves extremely difficult and that may deserve an entire day.  On the other hand, there may be a case that will only take ten minutes but is allowed to take three hours. Another judge may get through three or four quite difficult cases in an afternoon. A colleague may take the whole day.  Some are more prolix than others, just as some are more prolix in this House than others.</P>
    <P>I suppose that is human nature, but one cannot measure the work done in the courts by a rule of thumb method. Perhaps it is the way of the Civil Service to take a rule of thumb basis how many cases are disposed of; how many days do judges sit&mdash;without considering whether the cases were contested bitterly or uncontested and without considering how many hardfought cases were dealt with by particular judges on a particular day.</P>
    <P>I have in mind one judge.  I have never appeared before him professionally. The nearest I have come to having any dealings with him is in the realm of sport because he occasionally indulges in the same kind of sport as I do.  He is well known for the fact that he disposes of his work with tremendous celerity and gives satisfaction to litigants.  He sits longer hours on a particular day, if that is necessary, in order to clear up the work.  Yet, I understand that the Department of Justice, or the Department of Finance operating through the Department of Justice, merely calculates on a day-to-day basis.  That particular judge, as I have said, sits longer hours on one day and keeps his work up to date.</P>
    <P>In mentioning that I want to make it quite clear that this is work which cannot be measured on a rule of thumb basis.  I think it would be better for the Minister to retain the existing number of judges and the President of the Circuit Court, through the medium <Col N="711" /> of a flexible power, should have authority to move judges around to clear up arrears wherever there may be an accumulation of business or pressure of work.</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>I will look into that matter.  I am advised that this is permissive but I shall certainly have it examined again.  The method adopted is not altogether a rule of thumb. The committee considered this matter and went into all these aspects.  There are at least four Circuit Court judges who have sat less than 100 days on an average over a five-year period, and one of them very much less than 100 days.  On the other hand, we have the case mentioned by Deputy de Valera of one circuit being much bigger than the others.  All that will be taken into consideration.  The proper step to take is to remove some of the counties from that circuit and put them into some other circuit.  We will not operate this until we see how the committee report on the matter.</P>

      <NameTxt>Captain Cowan</NameTxt>
      <P>If I may say so, I agree that the circuits should be rearranged and the word &ldquo;shall&rdquo; should be left in the Bill and in the Act.  The committee that would be set up would be a committee to advise how best to rearrange, but this House having decided, on Second Reading, that there should be a rearrangement, they would have no power to advise against it. Their function in being set up is to advise the Government and the Minister how best to rearrange but they could not, and it would not be one of their functions, advise the Minister that he should not alter the circuits, this House, on Second Reading, having decided definitely that there must be a rearrangement for the reasons the Minister gave.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think that is at all arguable.  This House gave this Bill a Second Reading.  The whole point of a Committee Stage is to enable the House to discuss it section by section, and on the discussion of this section there is a viewpoint to be put that it is not desirable to rearrange at all.  Whether that viewpoint is right or not, does not matter. That is obviously a Committee decision and not a Second Reading decision.  It is ridiculous to say that you will tell the committee: &ldquo;Advise how to rearrange, but one of the things that you cannot advise is that there is to be no rearrangement.&rdquo;  If you are going to ask the committee to decide how best to rearrange, the logical thing to put to the committee is to advise whether, and if so, how, there was to be rearrangement.  Clearly that is a committee point.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Major de Valera Major de Valera">
      <NameTxt>Major de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>It seems to me that the basis of this section is simply that there is a case for rearranging the circuits.  I think the Minister has expressed one side of that case with relation to circuits where, apparently, there was not enough work to keep them going in the past.  I have mentioned a case of a circuit that was overloaded and the Minister mentioned <Col N="713" /> it subsequently.  Clearly, there is a case for reconsidering this circuit arrangement.  On that we are all agreed.</P>
      <P>There are two points that arise, one of them explicitly in the section but the Chair may pardon me if I mention the other one.  One is, what is the correct number of circuits to have; what is the best organisation you can have for the circuits?  As Deputy O'Higgins has pointed out, the increase in jurisdiction will give the Circuit Court a further reach than it has at the moment.  For instance, certain negligence cases that were automatically going to the High Court because they were over £300 will go back to the Circuit Court now. That is one factor to be taken into account.  There are very few of us who can really have examined the thing very thoroughly and all I can say to the Minister is that, with his advisers, it is a question for him to try to get the best solution and to find out what is the optimum number of circuits to have and what is their distribution.</P>
      <P>There is another point that I would like to mention in connection with that, if I will be pardoned for doing so, as, strictly speaking, it is not on this section.  In doing that one has to take into consideration the physical amount of work that judges and practitioners can do having regard to the fact that they must travel.  That is a point that should be taken into consideration in rearranging the circuits. The second one is a question for the legal practitioners and the Bar on circuit, that you will have a very awkward problem where solicitors and barristers are established on a certain pattern at the moment.  There is a point there to be watched in rearranging the circuit, to try to see that as little upset as possible is caused.  In the interest of the community some upset may be necessary but after the community has been properly safeguarded the profession should get some attention.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The first question then that arises on this section is, is eight adequate?  The <Col N="714" /> Minister is the only person who can really answer that on the basis of the advice that he is given but this much is clear&mdash;that is why I interjected a few minutes ago&mdash;the section is certainly mandatory.  Supposing the words &ldquo;as conveniently&rdquo; were left out, the section would be practically directly mandatory.  The words &ldquo;as conveniently&rdquo; do bring in a certain elasticity from the point of time but it does not get away from the fact that we are here legislating that the Government shall within a reasonable time&mdash;that is more or less the effect of it&mdash;by Order give effect to the provisions of this section.  Personally, I do not like the idea that we should frame legislation in that particular form, declaring an intention to do a thing as soon as conveniently may be and at the same time have the intention of putting it off indefinitely.  That is a very dangerous precedent to introduce into this House.  That is why I would ask the Minister to reconsider the wording there, if that is his intention because it is quite a novel approach to legislate on the face for something to be done and at the same time to hold it in abeyance.  If we are passing contingent legislation or legislation to be held in abeyance, we should express it to be so.</P>
    <P>Apart from that point I think the Minister is perfectly right to reconsider the adjustments of the circuits.  There is room for adjustment and, with the advice that he has he will probably be able to get one which will be a real improvement both from the point of view of the Bench and from the point of view of the citizen.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>There is one point that I omitted to raise a minute ago, a point that does not affect my side of the legal profession.  There is a system by which barristers allocate themselves to circuits.  There is a situation in which a barrister may have built up a business in, say, two adjoining counties which are at present in the same circuit. The Minister, by rearrangement of the groups, will perhaps cut away overnight half that man's business.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>I will keep an eye on that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Col N="715" />
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>It is rather difficult to see how the Minister will keep an eye on it.  It is one of the things that should be considered because, if there is to be a rearrangement in that way that can affect substantially and seriously a person's livelihood, it certainly should not be done, so to speak, overnight.  There should be considerable notice of it so that the person concerned may try to adjust himself accordingly and so arrange his business for the future that it will not cause him hardship.  I can see cases quite obviously happening in a rearrangement where places that are in the same circuit now will be in different circuits thereafter.  That is of the essence of what Deputy de Valera has said and if you are going to say that one circuit is overloaded and another is underloaded, I hope that some effort will be made to ensure that the hardship that will arise therefrom will be minimised.  One of the ways to minimise it is to give longer notice than conveniently may be to the people concerned.  If they got considerable notice of what was likely to happen it would ease the problem for them and enable them to make new arrangements.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Major de Valera Major de Valera">
      <NameTxt>Major de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>On the point raised by Deputy Sweetman I think that for the practitioner something more than notice should be given.  I am thinking again of the Bar.  This problem can arise, that a man is at the present moment practising in, say, certain towns on a particular circuit, and that he is practising in those towns in succession.  If you partition that circuit he will find himself in two circuits.  It may not be altogether feasible or convenient for the profession to readjust themselves completely. In other words many barristers may find themselves compelled to practise in two circuits at the one time.  That brings me to the point which I can mention now and which I think is an important point, that in rearranging the circuits and the times for sittings some regard should be had to that fact and an effort be made to arrange that where a circuit is partitioned say, two important towns that once were consecutive remain <Col N="716" /> consecutive and do not have simultaneous sittings.  I could go into it in more detail.</P>
      <P>I think the Minister will grasp what I mean if I take the instance of the eastern circuit.  At present you have the circuit going right around and sitting, say, in Wicklow Town in one fort-night and Wexford the next.  Barristers who go to both of these towns, and solicitors&mdash;remember there are solicitors involved&mdash;the people on the borderline, have the convenience that the court hearing is consecutive, and they can attend to their business in both. Now if, for instance, Wexford were to be put in another circuit&mdash;I am merely taking that arbitrarily; I do not know if it is the intention or not&mdash;then care should be taken that Wicklow sessions and Wexford sessions would not be simultaneous, but that they should be consecutive, so that such practitioners as attend those circuit towns at the present moment could continue to do so. Furthermore, I think that although Deputy Sweetman said that his profession was not interested particularly this is a plain case where his profession might be more interested in so far as a particular solicitor had to attend both towns.</P>

      <P>I think that I can get around it this way then.  I would not be happy with Section 15 being sent to a committee unless I felt that the committee was going to be this type of committee; if the Minister is suggesting that he is going to leave the wording of Section 15 more or less as it is, after dealing with the &ldquo;mandatory&rdquo; and the &ldquo;convenient&rdquo; side of it, and is going to send it to a committee I am quite happy with that, provided that the committee is of a particular sort, and I think that as long as he made that proviso I would be in order in discussing the type of committee I would be satisfied with.</P>

      <P>I am only going to make a few passing remarks.  I hope that the committee, when it is set up, will be a committee, that contains no member of either House of the Oireachtas.  I think the committee will probably, if not certainly, have to make certain suggestions in its report which will mean legislation, and it would be entirely desirable that when that legislation does come before the Oireachtas no member of the House would have already preconceived views on it; or perhaps he might have preconceived views, as most of us have views on this, but that we would not be bound already by being parties to a report.  I would advocate that very strongly indeed.  I would also urge the Minister very strongly that the committee would contain representatives of the people who would have to work out recommendations of the committee, and representatives of people who would be affected.  It is desirable that it should contain representatives of the judges, of the Bar and the solicitors, and in so far as one can pick them&mdash;and it is a little bit difficult to see how they are going to be picked&mdash;representatives of litigants. I do not suggest that the Minister would go down to the Four Courts and get certain gentlemen who are always there as litigants.  There is one who comes to my mind straightway.  But the Minister should get representatives of the non-legal people who would be affected in the ordinary way.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="719" /> I think, without making any personal suggestion, that about a month ago a judge retired from the Supreme Court who had an alarming experience. A judge outside the system now might be very suitable for consideration as a person who had that type of experience.</P>
    <P>I think that the committee should go further than having referred to it the actual matters that have been mentioned so far during this discussion here to-night.  I think the committee should be asked to advise as to what other reforms it can suggest in the legal system.  There are reforms in the legal system which were referred to by way of a side wind to-night in regard to things that are dealt with in the Master's Court&mdash; things which, perhaps, it may not be possible to do constitutionally.  That is a matter for consideration.  I hope the committee will be given reasonably wide terms of reference to consider what legal reforms it can put forward.  I hope that it will be a committee (1)  that will be representative of those people who will have to work it and (2)  that it will also be representative of those people who have to be the sufferers&mdash;using that word to cover the general public.</P>
    <P>I think that the Chair has allowed me to drag in my very tenuous reference.  Having done so, Sir, with the help of your blind eye, I think I had better not extend that reference too far.</P>

      <P>The question of the jurisdiction of the Circuit Court in civil cases is of vital consequence.  I always felt, in regard to that jurisdiction, that the jurisdiction of £1,000 for probate of administration was a low jurisdiction by reference to the £300 for contract in tort.  For that reason, I would not in any way quarrel with the increase in the jurisdiction from £1,000 to £2,000.  Candidly, I have not enough experience to be able to offer any comment on State proceedings. I am going to deal, therefore, only with the contract in tort jurisdiction. Deputy Moran had the idea that it was desirable to extend it still further.  I think it has been extended a little bit far.  I do not agree with the point of view that it should not be extended at all.  There is a sort of a dividing line and £500 is considered, so to speak, a round figure with which juries deal and that when you go over that round figure you are going into the realm of more important cases.</P>

      <P>If one adopted the some rule of thumb method for the Circuit Court jurisdiction as is adopted in Section 18&mdash;if, for example, the same rule of thumb were adopted in Section 4&mdash;I think the Minister and the Minister for Finance would explode. If, however, you adopt it as a rule of thumb method in one case, it is clearly logical to adopt it as a rule of thumb method in another.  I do not propose to discuss it as a rule of thumb method.  This has just been taken as a rule of thumb doubling.  I think that a £500 jurisdiction would be a far more satisfactory figure.  Candidly, if we had got to the stage at an earlier date of agreeing between ourselves about the committee or commission, or whatever it will be called, I think that, at that stage, the Minister would have been happy to get advice from the commission on this matter.  You cannot possibly increase the jurisdiction to-day, get a report from the commission to-morrow to decrease it and then go back again.  Therefore, it seems to me that this is one of the clear instances in which the advice of the committee would be desirable.  They might disagree violently with my view.  However, when you are going to have them deal with it, I think it would be desirable to get their point of view.  If you are going to get their point of view, you must get it before you enact a change which might mean any possibility of a decrease.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have heard some people suggest that there was no case for any increase; I would not agree with that at all.  I think that undoubtedly there is a case for an increase, but I think that this goes a shade too far.  Even the figure of £500 would be a better figure. Alternatively, I should be quite happy to leave it to the committee which the Minister will set up to give a recommendation, all in all, for all three. They might come to the conclusion that all three require to be dealt with at different figures.  You cannot possibly change the figure to-day and then have a commission which may report to the contrary to-morrow.  That would give <Col N="722" /> rise to an entirely unsatisfactory position. One of the things you must get is some certainty and something definite about the matter.  The Minister has agreed to his committee.</P>
    <P>I urge on him that when he has agreed to the committee&mdash;when he has agreed that it is a desirable method of dealing with the matter&mdash;he should postpone the decision on this question of jurisdiction until the committee have reported.  Suppose, for example, the committee reported in favour of Deputy Moran's amendments.</P>

      <P>It would be highly unsatisfactory to change thus far to-day and so far to-morrow.  That would not make for certainty.</P>
      <P>As regards the extent of the change there should be, we discussed that to some extent on one of the earlier sections which is to be considered between now and the Report Stage, but one of the most vital objections to any increase in Circuit Court jurisdiction is the position in which you could have the verdict of a jury completely overridden. Those people who are not acquainted with legal procedure and who are anxious to increase the Circuit Court jurisdiction completely overlook the fact that, unless at the same time you change the system, you are going to have a position in which a person may bring an action in the Circuit Court arising, say, out of a motor accident.  The jury may find in his favour and award him £599.  The defendant or his insurance company may then appeal and that appeal will be heard by a High Court judge alone &mdash;there will be no jury.  One man is going to have the function, as it is at present, of completely overruling the verdict of the 12 good men and true. I do not think Deputy Hickey would be made very happy by that situation.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>The Bill, as such, does not provide for it and that is one of the reasons why some people opposed very strongly the extension of the Circuit Court jurisdiction.  They wanted to retain unfettered the right of a man to get a verdict from the jury which, except when it was against the weight of evidence or had been misdirected, could not be upset.  I know that certain people have entirely misconstrued&mdash;I am not certain that they have not deliberately misconstrued&mdash; the view that these people were putting forward, saying that they were putting it forward for selfish purposes. The real difficulty is the difficulty of the jury and unless that position is to be covered, it will be extremely difficult.</P>
      <P>I do not know whether I will get into trouble now for what I am about to say, but, when the Circuit Courts were set up originally, I think it was hoped that solicitors themselves would plead in these courts and that counsel would not come into the cases.  It did not work out that way.  The bringing up of the county court jurisdiction to the £300 of the Circuit Court meant, in fact, that solicitors did not feel capable of dealing with cases so important. I wonder if increasing the jurisdiction of the Circuit Court from £300 to £600 is not going to have the effect that, not merely will there be a junior counsel brought into the case but a senior counsel, because it will be of such importance.  It may very easily be that, by extending the upward limit more than is desirable, you may make it more expensive for the middle limit.</P>
      <P>I take the view that some extension of the contract and tort jurisdiction is desirable, but I think the Minister has gone a little too far.  I do not know whether he has any statistics&mdash;we all know that it is possible to prove anything with statistics&mdash;as to how many running-down cases in the year exceed £500 in the damages given.  I should say that they would be a very small percentage and I think the Minister is in danger, by extending the jurisdiction too much, of making the system not cheaper but perhaps more expensive for litigants.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 21:&mdash;</P>
      <P>Before Section 19 to insert a new section as follows:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Where by reason of the non-appearance of the plaintiff in an <Col N="725" /> action in the Circuit Court the said action is dismissed without a hearing an appeal shall nevertheless lie to the High Court under the provisions of the Act of 1936.</P>
    <P>This is intended to cure a difficulty which has arisen in practice in recent years.  From time to time, it may happen that an action comes for trial in the Circuit Court, and, through some default or other, the plaintiff does not turn up.  The action is, in effect, dismissed for the non-appearance of the plaintiff.  These things can happen through a variety of circumstances, and have happened.  When such a fatality does overtake a litigant in these circumstances, he has no right of appeal at the moment.  He cannot put it right, because, under the Courts of Justice Act, 1936, the only appeal is by way of rehearing, and the courts have decided that, since there was no hearing in the Circuit Court, there cannot be a rehearing.  The purpose of the amendment is to provide that, in these circumstances, the plaintiff or person involved shall have a right of appeal, just as if a hearing had taken place. Whatever may be said about the manner in which the amendment is drafted&mdash;it was done rather hurriedly &mdash;I do not think the principle can be objected to.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PeadarCowan" hpid="Captain Cowan Captain Cowan">
      <NameTxt>Captain Cowan</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to support this amendment.  I remember a case I was remotely connected with in which the plaintiff had a case in the Circuit Court, and, for some reason or other, was unable to be present when the case was heard.  An appeal was lodged on behalf of that person to the High Court and the High Court ruled that it had no jurisdiction to hear any evidence at all.  Undoubtedly, a very serious loss resulted for that particular plaintiff.  If there is an appeal from the District Court to the Circuit Court the appeal is by way of a completely new hearing and the same thing should apply to any appeal from the Circuit Court in the type of case mentioned here to the High Court.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think Deputy O'Higgins has done good work in bringing this amendment before the Dáil and that the Minister could accept it without any great difficulty. <Col N="726" /> He certainly could have it examined between now and the Report Stage.  I am sure the principle of it will be accepted and perhaps a more precise wording could be adopted. Everyone believed prior to the particular case I mentioned, which arose some years ago, that the law was that you had a right of appeal and to have the case fully heard in the High Court.  It came as a shock when a High Court judge decided that there was no right to produce evidence before him that was not before the Circuit Court. What Deputy O'Higgins is trying to remedy here is not statute law; he is trying to cure in the interest of the public a judge's decision.  I certainly support the amendment.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>You can leave all these things to the court.  In fact, if a plaintiff through some fault of his own is not there, and appeals, he will do so on a penalty as to costs.  That is a matter that will follow automatically if left to the good sense of the court. I think it would be unwise to attempt to provide that he should give reasons or anything like that.  It was intended by the Courts of Justice Act of 1936 that every person whose action was dismissed in the Circuit Court should have the right of appeal by way of rehearing.  The word &ldquo;rehearing&rdquo; was used.  Where his action was dismissed because he was not present, there is no hearing and it was on that particular point that it was held that he was not entitled to appeal.  I think that whatever provision is put in the Bill should merely say that where a person's case is dismissed because of some fatality of that kind, even though no hearing has taken place, he shall be entitled to appeal.  The rest will follow as a matter of course.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 22:&mdash;</P>
      <P>Before Section 19 to insert a new section as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>(1)  The right of any party to an action in the Circuit Court to have questions of fact determined by a jury shall not be exercisable unless the party so requiring a jury shall first deposit with the county registrar for the county in which such action is to be tried the sum of £12.</P>
      <P>(2)  In the event of the said right being so exercised and the said questions being submitted to a jury each person serving on such jury shall on being discharged from such service be paid the sum of £1 out of the sum so deposited.</P>
      <P>(3)  After such a deposit has been made if it is found unnecessary to empanel a jury the said sum so deposited shall be paid to the person who deposited the same.</P>
      <P>(4)  The said deposit shall at the discretion of the Circuit Court judge be recoverable with any costs awarded to the person so requiring a jury.</P>
      <P>This is part of what I consider should be a necessary new provision in the Circuit Court with regard to jury trials.  We are giving the Circuit Court increased jurisdiction.  I agree completely with the amount to be given and with the manner in which it is proposed to be given.  It seems to follow, as suggested in an earlier amendment, that we must provide for finality in jury trials.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With regard to trial by jury, there have been time and again, in this House and elsewhere, legitimate complaints made by jurors who have had to travel long distances to serve on juries, even at considerable loss to themselves.  That complaint is particularly true in wide-flung country areas where jurors have often at busy times on the land to travel distances of 30 or 40 miles to serve on a civil jury.  I <Col N="728" /> think in those circumstances it is only fair and proper that any litigant who seeks to avail of his right to get a jury of his countrymen to come in from the fields to listen to his case should deposit with the court officials concerned some reasonable sum to provide for the expenses of those who have to listen to that case.  I have suggested in the amendment that the right to call for a jury cannot be exercised unless there is a deposit of a sum of £12 and that, when the right is exercised, out of the money so deposited, each member of the jury empanelled to hear the case will be paid £1, instead of the nominal sum of 5/- which, I think, they are paid now.  It would follow that the person who made the deposit, if he won his case, would be entitled to recover the deposit as part of his costs.</P>
    <P>I know it may be suggested that this is in some way undemocratic and that it is perhaps imposing a penalty on a person who has not £12 to deposit. These types of objections are there and I can see the weight that might be urged in support of them, but if we are to maintain the jury system, I feel that the time has come when litigants must realise they have got themselves to bear some portion of the expenses of the people who have to undergo jury service.  Naturally, a plaintiff or a defendant seeking a civil jury in the Circuit Court if this amendment were accepted, would not lightly do so.  In a case that could well be tried by a judge, he would not for no reason at all ask to have a panel called into the Circuit Court and 12 men selected to deal with his case.  It would not be lightly done, because even though £12 may not be a very considerable sum, it is certainly a sum that will make those inclined to exercise this right more careful in pursuing the right if the amendment is accepted.</P>
    <P>Secondly, if a person does decide to have a civil jury and to pay the deposit involved, I think that in practice he will have a very good case and that, in point of fact, in all probability he will not be at the loss of the deposit involved.  As Deputy Cowan said earlier with regard to another amendment, I put down this amendment to <Col N="729" /> enable this matter to be discussed because I feel that some such reform is necessary in our whole system of jury trials.  It is not so bad in relation to the High Court in Dublin, because the distances are not so great, and for the lucky men who are not empanelled on a particular jury there is also the chance that a twopenny bus ride will bring them back to their place of business. But it is a very serious imposition in the countryside.</P>
    <P>I have myself from time to time gone to country circuit towns in the middle of the busiest agricultural work of the year to find that some litigant, for some reason of his own, was not satisfied with the decision likely to be given by a judge and had asked to have a panel brought in to hear his case.  There would be 40 or 50 farmers in the town who had to come a great distance at considerable expense, waste an entire day and be a considerable sum out of pocket.  It is to ensure that this right will not be lightly exercised and at the same time provide in some way for the expenses of the jury that I suggest this amendment.</P>
    <P>When I was drafting it, I was wondering whether there was any way in which the entire panel could be compensated.  I do not think there is unless the State intervened, and that is a matter of policy we cannot be concerned with in this Bill.  We can at least ensure, however, that the 12 jurors who are actually empanelled to try a case will get payment more in accord with the actual loss the service is to them.  For that reason I move the amendment.</P>

      <P>I think this is more a matter for a Jury Bill.  The question of paying jurors is under consideration. I have answered a parliamentary question about that and eventually we will have to have a Bill. I do not think it would be proper to deal with the matter in this Bill.  It goes with that other amendment which we are going to consider on the Report Stage&mdash;amendment No. 7. I do not think an amendment of this kind, providing for paying jurymen and for a deposit, should be dealt with in this Bill.  I would not be inclined <Col N="730" /> to accept that in a Bill of this kind.</P>

      <P>I would be strongly opposed to this.  I think everybody who would consider the matter from a fundamental point of view would object to it because, after all, it is an interference with the right of a citizen to have a matter in which he is interested heard and determined by the courts.  If a deposit were required to be put down, it might mean that many citizens would be deprived of their just rights.</P>

      <P>It does.  There are too many serious objections to it.  I can see the force of the arguments that Deputy O'Higgins advanced, but I think that on reconsideration Deputy O'Higgins would agree that there are too many dangers inherent in a proposal of this kind, and that anything that would affect or interfere with the right of a citizen to have his case heard or determined by the courts, whether he is a person of substance or no substance, would be detrimental and dangerous.</P>
      <P>I do not think that the House in any circumstances should agree to the principle of the amendment.  I think that it is one that should be rejected by the House and that there should be no question of the House even giving an indication that it had the least bit of merit.  I hope Deputy O'Higgins will appreciate that I am putting that point of view because I can visualise the very serious dangers that are inherent in his proposal, and I think that he realises some of the difficulties in his proposal himself.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. O'Higgins Mr. O'Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>I rather anticipated that the point of view expressed by Deputy Cowan would be expressed, but I think that from time to time, when we are talking about trial by jury, we are too prone to assume that a litigant has a right to have his case tried by jury.  In fact, no such right is known in our Constitution, in our laws, or in our manner of approach. There is a right, so far as we talk about rights, for any man charged with a crime to have the question of his <Col N="731" /> guilt or innocence decided by a jury of his fellows.  But with regard to the settlement of disputes between one man and another, when did the belief grow up that it is the right of any litigant to drag into the court to listen to his dispute 12 decent citizens?  I do not believe that any such right ever did exist.  It is certainly not known to the law.  Under the law as it stands at the moment, if I allege that the Minister or a Deputy or any other person broke a contract with me, I cannot get a jury to decide the facts at issue and to pronounce and give judgment on them.  The right does not exist.</P>
      <P>Why should we think, merely because it is a common practice in negligence actions in the High Court to have the issues tried by a jury, that that indicates that it is some inalienable right of a litigant?  In fact, it is not.  Trial by jury in civil matters as a practice ceased to exist in the Circuit Court by reason of the provisions of the Courts of Justice Act of 1936.  I can see it arising again now, and I think it is legitimate to say that anyone who wants to have his case tried by a jury should be a person who is prepared to foot some of the bill himself.  I cannot see that the fact that a sum of money&mdash;I suggest £12&mdash;should be deposited will be in any way harmful to a litigant.</P>
      <P>At the moment, an Irish citizen who lives in the County Fermanagh and who brings an action in our courts, as he is entitled to do under our Constitution, no matter how good his case may be, is not entitled to proceed unless he makes a deposit in the High Court of security for costs, if it is a High Court action, and the amount he might have to deposit could be £500 or £600.  That is a precaution taken&mdash; it has been there for a long time&mdash;to ensure that a person outside the exercisable jurisdiction of our courts will not bring an action here, lose it and skip.  I merely mention that as an example that the idea of depositing a sum of money in court, the right to pursue an action being dependent on the deposit, is nothing new.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think it was Deputy Cowan who <Col N="732" /> earlier in this debate chided lawyers with being conservative.  I think that Deputy Cowan is being ultra-conservative in this matter.  It is time for a change now, and I think that that change should be made, particularly where we will possibly be resurrecting a dormant jury system in the Circuit Court.</P>
    <P>Accordingly, if we are to make a change it is better to do it now so that those who exercise the right of the civil jury in the Circuit Court in future will know they can do so on terms. I am afraid I cannot see that there is anything very harmful to litigants in what I propose.  If they do not want to deposit their money, they can do what they have been doing for many years, have their case tried by a judge. The right to have their disputes settled in any event by the court is in no way impaired.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesHickey" hpid="Mr. Hickey Mr. Hickey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hickey</NameTxt>
      <P>I find it hard to agree. I have in mind a man who had a very good case to go to the High Court and the only way he could do so was by putting down a deposit.  The man was unable to do it.  I have two cases in mind.  In one case a deposit of £120 had to be put down and in the other something under £100.  I think that principle is bad.  It means that a citizen has no right to avail of the courts of justice unless he is able to put down a deposit.  I do not like the idea of asking a litigant to put down a deposit of £12 if he wants his case tried by a jury.  I am not afraid of change.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. O'Higgins Mr. O'Higgins">

      <P>You are another conservative.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesHickey" hpid="Mr. Hickey Mr. Hickey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hickey</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not.  I have in mind the difficulty experienced by a person without any means who is handicapped to that extent.  I have a very sad recollection of the two cases I mention.  The strange thing about it is that the two cases were won.  I know of another instance where the man lost his case through the usual technical points by the legal gentlemen on both sides.  He also had to pay a very big deposit.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I cannot bring myself to agree that the litigant who wants to get a jury <Col N="733" /> must first put down £12.  I think the principle is wrong.  I am open to conviction. I do not agree with it.  I feel that every citizen should have the right to avail of the courts of law and get justice in this country.  Two of the three cases I have mentioned were successfully contested but the third one was lost.  If the litigants had not someone to advance the money in order to bring the cases to the High Court, they would have been left in the lurch so far as justice is concerned.</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Major de Valera Major de Valera">
      <NameTxt>Major de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>I must say that the idea of having a deposit for a jury in the form in which it is stated here does not appeal to me on the grounds put forward by Deputy Hickey.  Is not the point here really to provide payment for the jury from a litigant?  Is not that what it is in effect?  We all know, of course, what is involved in the jury system at the present moment.  It is very true that it involves considerable hardship, particularly in the country. In the case of Dublin High Court juries it is not quite so bad both from the nature of the jurymen concerned and the short distance they have to travel. But let us take one extreme example, the case of Wicklow town.  There, jurymen are brought from the far side of the Wicklow mountains and it would seem to be a very hard thing on them to have them brought in that way.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This particular proposal does not help where criminal juries are concerned either.  It merely deals with the question of a civil case.  You would still have the problem of the criminal juries.  After all, the present right of jury in civil actions has remained more or less unaltered for a number of years.  Is not that so?  It is practically the same as it was in 1936.  Jury actions were very common in the Circuit Court and, I might say, very popular.  Jury actions declined in number and I recollect very few civil jury actions in the Circuit Courts since the war.  I think that the primary cause of that was the fact that appeal lay to a judge without a jury.  What effectively diminished and almost killed the civil jury in the Circuit Court was the fact that the appeal lay to a judge without a jury, and unless things have <Col N="734" /> changed very much in the past two years, I imagine that civil jury actions are now not very common in the Circuit Court.  Deputy O'Higgins can correct me if I am wrong.</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. O'Higgins Mr. O'Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>That is quite true.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Major de Valera Major de Valera">
      <NameTxt>Major de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>On that premises, we have two distinct things to consider one of which is the question of juries generally.  In fact, in the Circuit Court a big burden of the jury duty now exists in regard to criminal cases not covered by this amendment at all.  That is a separate problem outside the scope of this section and I should be out of order were I to digress.  Many of us have felt there is a problem.  I will leave it at that. Trial by jury has some very useful features and I, for one, would hesitate to abolish it.  On the other hand, it imposes a very heavy burden on certain members only of the community.</P>
      <P>In regard to civil actions, do you need, first of all, juries in civil actions on a question of fact?  I have given the present trend.  Will a judge by himself be enough?  Heretofore it has been found reasonably satisfactory. The next point is whether there is more sense in providing elaborately for jury action in the Circuit Court if ultimately the matter will be decided by a judge in the High Court if one of the parties care to appeal?  Let us be realistic about that.  Might it not be the more reasonable approach to this matter to simply abolish jury actions in the Circuit Court in civil cases?  I am not so sure that that might not be the more economic and direct approach to the whole matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When all is said and done, I have never served on a jury, being one of the privileged immune.  As a member of a profession, I have never served on a jury but I have often wondered how facts are decided by a jury. Where the issue is a simple one of guilty or not guilty it is all right but in regard to all the complicated things that can arise in civil actions, I wonder would it not be better to leave it to the judge?  He will not be perfect, infallible or even impeccable but he will do the best that human nature can do.  In the way we pick <Col N="735" /> our judges, we can rely upon them to do that.  After that, there is an appeal.</P>
    <P>I am not quite sure whether Deputy O'Higgins's suggestion is the wisest one.  I see his point and were it not for the particular objection that Deputy Hickey raises, I would be inclined to say that, in all the circumstances, if somebody wants the luxury of a jury in the Circuit Court, he ought to pay a secure deposit for it. The only reason that I do not agree is precisely the reason advanced by Deputy Hickey.  I think that justice should be equally within the immediate reach of every citizen, whether he be a beggar man or a rich man.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesHickey" hpid="Mr. Hickey Mr. Hickey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hickey</NameTxt>
      <P>That is right.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Major de Valera Major de Valera">
      <NameTxt>Major de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>And to put a deposit of that nature in question does raise that.  Deputy O'Higgins will realise that there are very many cases taken in the court at the present moment by solicitors on behalf of their clients where the solicitor is not at all certain of any remuneration for the work he has done.  The barrister whom he briefs is in the same position unless the litigant is successful, be he defendant or plaintiff.  Many solicitors in all our country towns undertake work in proper cases of that nature. They are very much in the same position, when they do that, as a doctor who treats a patient free.  Frankly, I should not like to deprive the poor man of the service he is getting from solicitors at the moment in that regard.  The solicitor has a certain outlay.  Difficult cases such as cases under the Workmen's Compensation Act are very commonly undertaken by solicitors without there being any funds to back the case in the initial stages.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The outlay is a serious matter for him, and if you impose further substantial outlay it will mean, in effect, that the solicitor will he unable to take that case.  It will mean also that, not only will there be the difficulty of finding a deposit, but that, in fact, in the poor man's case there will be no jury. Frankly, I think that if there is to be compensation for jurymen generally, then that is another problem.  I think <Col N="736" /> that, in the interests of justice, it is properly a matter for the State.  If there is any question of payment deriving from profit sources to juries, then I can see great danger in that.  If we could work out an arrangement of making some provision for juries, then I think it should be done generally, but the particular form which Deputy O'Higgins suggests in this amendment is not, I think, the best.  I do not think we should adopt it, mainly on the grounds which Deputy Hickey has advanced.</P>

    <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That Section 24 stand part of the Bill.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Major de Valera Major de Valera">
      <NameTxt>Major de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>On this section perhaps it would be well if we could have a clarification of the words &ldquo;ten years' standing&rdquo;.  I remember that, at the end of the war, there was a question about certain ex-Army personnel as to their eligibility for certain appointments arising out of the phrase in use at that time.  This might be a suitable occasion on which to define what exactly is meant by the phrase &ldquo;ten years' standing&rdquo;.  Sub-section (1)  of this section says:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Section 69 of the Act of 1924 (which provides for a six years' standing as a barrister or solicitor as a qualification for appointment as justice), is hereby amended by the substitution of &lsquo;ten years&rsquo; standing' for &lsquo;six years&rsquo; standing'.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Very often, in similar clauses of that nature, you also have the words &ldquo;practising barrister&rdquo; or &ldquo;practising solicitor&rdquo;.  What exactly is meant by practising barrister of six years' standing?  Does it mean a barrister who has been six years called to the Bar but practises, say, for only one year?  Does it mean a barrister who has been at the Bar practising for <Col N="737" /> more than six years and at the moment is not practising?  I remember that the question arose on this in connection with Army personnel.  There the question was of barristers who had been more than six years called but who had had an interrupted break in their practice.</P>
    <P>Barristers and solicitors served in the Defence Forces during the whole period of the war, and hence their professional careers, as practising barristers or solicitors were interrupted for a varying period in each case, with a maximum of six and a half years.  A number of these found themselves in the category of barristers or solicitors who had been more than six years a member of the profession but who had not been in continuous practice for six years.  I remember that raised a certain amount of difficulty at the time, and I suggest to the Minister that this would be the time to have the matter clarified.  It is rather important in view of the fact that an amendment is being made to this section, and that the period is to be ten years now instead of six years. I should like to know what is the interpretation that is being put on it at the present time.</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>That a person has been practising for six years since he was called.  That is the way it has always been interpreted.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. O'Higgins Mr. O'Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Higgins</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Major de Valera Major de Valera">
      <NameTxt>Major de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>There is a question of clarification involved and I think that the thing should be clarified.  Let us take an extreme case.  We all know that there are very many people who get called to the Bar.  They do the Bar course and get called.  They may be doctors, members of the State services and members of companies who do the Bar course by way of educational qualification.  Now an extreme <Col N="738" /> interpretation of the word &ldquo;standing&rdquo;, if you had only that word, would be that, after the lapse of a certain number of years, all those people who had become barristers in that way would be eligible for appointment.  That is qualified by the word &ldquo;practising&rdquo; but that brings up the question as to the meaning of this word.  You can take again the extreme case.  Take somebody who perhaps was head of a State department and who was a barrister for the requisite number of years; he would only have to relinquish that, go to the courts and practise for a month and he would be eligible for appointment to anything, so to speak.  I know that is an extreme case and I am not for a moment suggesting that it would arise but the possibility of it arising suggests that some definition is required in order to clarify the position.</P>
      <P>I realise the objection the Minister has and I think he should be cautious. I would not ask him to rush into it now.  This phrase arises over a number of enactments but specific limits in regard to one might raise doubts in regard to another.  There is perhaps some danger in regard to interpretation and I think it would be well to clarify it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The period of ten years' standing raises the standard in the District Court.  Personally I feel it is desirable that only experienced professional men should be appointed to these posts under our present system.  I qualify that because I do not want myself to go on record as being completely committed to the thesis that only lawyers make judges, but under our present system it is desirable that only experienced people in the legal profession should be appointed to the Bench and ten years does not seem to be an abnormal qualification.  It is a desirable amendment but I would like to see that it was ten years' genuine practice.  There is the possibility&mdash;and perhaps there is a much greater danger of that possibility becoming an actuality in the case of the lower appointments like those of the District Court than in the case of the higher judge appointments&mdash;that a person who was professionally qualified did not practise continuously or <Col N="739" /> did not practise for some time and in fact did not have the experience that ten years seem to connote.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PeadarCowan" hpid="Captain Cowan Captain Cowan">
      <NameTxt>Captain Cowan</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to make a few observations on the section.  It is not my experience that the most experienced lawyers are the best judges and it is a very strange fact that some of the best judges and justices we had in this State were men who were appointed in the early days after the establishment of the State with very little experience or practice. It may sound a kind of heresy to say that but so far as the District Court is concerned I feel that a very serious mistake is being made and has been made for some years in the appointment of district justices.</P>
      <P>Deputy Major Vivion de Valera has just said there should be 10 years' general practice.  I agree with that but what is genuine practice as it refers to the District Court?  In my view it should be genuine practice in or about the District Court and if you are going to have a lawyer very actively engaged, say, in matters of title or in High Court practice, he has no conception of the work that is done in the District Court and his 10 years' experience is more a hindrance than a help.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. O'Higgins Mr. O'Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Higgins</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PeadarCowan" hpid="Captain Cowan Captain Cowan">
      <NameTxt>Captain Cowan</NameTxt>
      <P>It might be better from the point of view of justice if we appointed judges in the District Court if we are appointing them from the barrister rank with no experience at all, because in that way they would give considerable study to the business of being efficient justices and in the long run I think they would <Col N="740" /> operate very successfully.  The more practice in the court a practitioner gets the more he is inclined to get into a particular groove or rut and it is pretty difficult for experienced practitioners, particularly in the District Court, to have from time to time those persons sent as justices who know nothing whatsoever about the machinery or the practice in the courts.  It takes them a long time to find their way around and particularly to find their way out of the habits they have learned practising on the barrister side of the court in the Circuit or the High Court.  I do not suppose these views will be accepted as a guide to what will be put into operation but they are my views.  I know the Minister in increasing the period to ten years is endeavouring to get more experienced and more balanced persons as justices in the District Court.  I think there ought to be appointed to the District Court persons who have practice and experience in the District Court, who understand the litigants in the District Court and understand the summary jurisdiction of that court, because the District Court, while being a court of justice, is meant to get its work done in a speedy way. Nobody wants our district justices to deal with every matter that comes before them in the way a Supreme Court judge would deal with them.  Justice in the District Court is summary justice.  It is meant to be the poor man's court.  It should be administered with reasonable speed and justices should be in a position to give a proper decision after hearing the evidence.</P>
      <P>I certainly agree we want experienced people in the courts but I think the experienced practitioners of the District Court should be the persons who would be considered in the first instance for appointments.  In the solicitors' side of the profession there is some objection to the preponderance, as they put it, of appointments of barristers as district justices.</P>

      <NameTxt>Captain Cowan</NameTxt>
      <P>Perhaps that is considered a preponderance.  The <Col N="741" /> solicitors do feel that as practitioners in the Circuit Court and as persons who undergo courses of study somewhat higher than those of their colleagues in the barristers' profession, they, too, should be considered for appointment to the Circuit Bench. However, that does not arise on this particular section but it is a point of view that is held by many members of the Incorporated Law Society and of the solicitors' profession, and I just mention it on this section.</P>

      <P>I am unfortunately not briefed on the point I want to make here but I have a recollection of once coming across the Dublin Police Act outside the Dublin district and finding that it was possible successfully to make a case for the delivery of the goods back to the person charged with unlawful possession notwithstanding a conviction.  I do not know whether the Minister is aware of that particular case.  It occurred at Dundalk some years ago and there was a considerable legal argument on it.  In the application of the Dublin Police Act outside the district of Dublin there was the possibility of some flaw and in fact the whole situation in regard to the provisions of that Act as it stands leaves room for improvement.  That is my recollection.  Unfortunately I have not got the title now of the case of which I am thinking but briefly the situation which resulted was that a person was convicted of unlawful possession but at the end of the legal argument he walked out of court with the goods and a good title thereto.  There is therefore, I think some cause for investigating the present law in regard to this generally and I am wondering if the Minister can tell us what the effect is.  Unfortunately as I say I have not the papers now and cannot point out exactly what the position is.</P>
      <P>I wonder if the deletion of the words &ldquo;within the limit of the police district&rdquo; will be sufficient.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This section carries a number of amendments.  It is in rather an unusual form, as it runs straight on. <Col N="744" /> It refers to Section 68 of the Dublin Police Act and declares it to be amended by the substitution of &ldquo;justices of the District Court&rdquo; for &ldquo;any of the said divisional justices&rdquo;. That is merely an adjustment in nomenclature.  It is an adjustment to fit our present District Court structure as against the structure at the time the Act was passed.  Then there is provision to delete &ldquo;within the Limits of the Police District&rdquo;, which is a separate amendment.  I would like to know the reason for that, from the point of view of covering the case I have more or less indicated.  Thirdly, there is the substitution of &ldquo;twenty-five pounds&rdquo; for &ldquo;fifteen pounds&rdquo;, and the section as so amended shall have effect throughout the State.  If the Minister could give us his reasons for the draft in this particular form in regard to the latter two amendments, he would be helping us considerably.</P>

      <P>I think it is generally a good idea that an appeal <Col N="745" /> should lie from any order of an inferior court.  I do not know if other practitioners would agree, but from such experience as I have had in court I have come to the conclusion that wherever there is a court of inferior jurisdiction it is desirable to have a right of appeal.  We have all had the experience of a certain difference in approach in courts to matters where an appeal lay and to matters which were final and conclusive in that particular court.  Therefore, I think it is highly desirable in principle that you should have a section in which an appeal should lie to the Circuit Court.  I would go even further.  In general terms, although the Constitution says an appeal lies to the Supreme Court, the mechanics get so complicated that it is not really practical.  In the case of practically every order that is made by an inferior court, there should be a right of appeal to the next higher court. That would bring in a uniformity that is much to be desired especially in regard to the lower courts.</P>

      <P>I agree with what Deputy de Valera says.  There was one stage in the development of our courts of justice when there were certain matters on which there could not be an appeal from the District Court and it is within the recollection of practitioners that biassed and malicious district justices deliberately imposed the penalty or made the order that could not be appealed against.  We have been trying time after time to remove from the judges the power of doing anything like that. It was a reprehensible thing for them to do but they did it.  I doubt very much if any of them can do it now. Every order in the District Court or Circuit Court should be capable of being appealed if a person wants to appeal against it.</P>
